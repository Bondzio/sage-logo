<p>The Student Affiliates of Seventeen (SAS) serves as the representative body for the Division 17 (Society of Counseling Psychology) student affiliates. Our central aims are to ensure that students are informed of current events and to facilitate access to opportunities within the Society of Counseling Psychology (SCP) and the American Psychological Association (APA). In so doing, we strive to provide tomorrow’s professionals with the tools needed to accomplish their academic and career goals.</p>
<p>The University at Albany SAS Executive Board has officially completed two thirds of our term. We have developed several important initiatives and are delighted to report on the progress we have made toward these goals. As the host institution, we strongly believe that it is our duty and privilege to connect students with SCP, to help identify leadership opportunities, and to match students with these opportunities. Anecdotally, however, we realized that we were not reaching our students effectively. The problem seemed to be one of establishing a sense of community; as an organization, we concluded that we were disconnected from our membership and needed to find ways to effectively bridge this gap.</p>
<p>As such, one of our main priorities this year has been fostering a sense of community among SAS members. To this end, we have expanded our network to include more student representatives, increased our social networking presence, continued to connect students with opportunities at the division level, invited students to serve on our SAS executive board committees, and created an awards committee to provide travel, research, and first-time convention attendee awards as well as program and regional representative of the year awards. The response from student members has been outstanding. To recognize the importance of our members’ contributions and to provide them with opportunities to connect with SCP leaders, we hosted our first SAS Networking and Awards Social at the APA convention. This event was a resounding success, and we hope to provide a repeat performance at future APA conventions!</p>
<p>We are also excited to announce the 21st Annual Diversity Conference, hosted by SAS and the students of the Division of Counseling Psychology at UAlbany. The goal of the Diversity Conference is to increase awareness about central issues concerning the needs of diverse populations and communities. This year, our theme is “Building Bridges, Removing Barriers: Expanding Our Roles,” and we are delighted that Dr. Isaac Prilleltensky will be joining us as our keynote speaker. The conference will be held at the University at Albany in November 2012, and we hope to see many SCP and SAS members there!</p>
<p>As we begin our final year as host institution, we look forward to developing new and innovative ways to increase engagement in the SAS community. For example, beyond continuing to provide networking opportunities to SAS members at APA conventions, we hope to promote continuity between conventions by exploring options for mentoring throughout the year. Overall, we are committed to maintaining and building upon our progress through collaborative efforts with our student membership. Although passing the baton to the next institution is bittersweet for us, our experiences and interactions with SAS students serve as confirmation that the organization will continue to be in good hands. We hope to announce the new host institution soon!</p>
<p>Thank you to our student members, contributors, and the Society of Counseling Psychology, from the entire SAS Executive Board at the University at Albany.</p>
