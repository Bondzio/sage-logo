<p>Islamic finance industry is growing very fast and well-recognized having huge potential to grow. Over the past two decades, Islamic finance has received significant global exposure. Its scope is no more limited to Islamic countries but now part and parcel of financial markets and banking industries across world. The industry assets have at present grown to around one trillion US$. The shaky nature of conventional financial markets and the frequent occurrence of global financial crises have further reinforced the escalating growth of this industry. The mushrooming growth of the industry has increased the appetite for students, researchers, common investors, bankers, financial institutions and policy-makers to understand more of this emerging market. In this backdrop, the book under review is a timely intervention and should be useful for the beginners as well as practitioners and policy-makers in the field of Islamic finance.</p>
<p>This book is a compilation of Dr Sundararajan’s selected papers on Islamic finance, and is systematically organized in three parts. The introductory part is written precisely in one chapter, highlighting the current developments and key issues in Islamic finance. Part II covers in four chapters the aspects of monetary operation, debt, liquidity and risk management under Islamic principles and discusses related policy issues, methodological procedures and measurement techniques. The last part involves three chapters technically handling profit and risk management in Islamic banks, assessment of Islamic financial services industry, and discusses supervisory, regulatory and capital adequacy implications of profit sharing under shari’ah (Islamic) rules and principles.</p>
<p>The Islamic finance industry has grown to develop financial instruments, common standards, practices, and has drawn the attention of the international community but the very basic concepts, operational and methodological issues are not well understood. Moreover, the issues relating to its economic and financial implications are being debated and discussed. In this context, the book has rightly started with the foundation of Islamic finance and historical background of the Islamic Financial Services Industry (IFSI) and its development. Chapter 1 describes the structure size and further scope of the Islamic financial services industry (IFSI) under different categories such as Islamic banking, capital markets, insurance, non-bank financial institutions and money markets, and recognizes close coordination among them. The chapter very carefully defines different terminologies and types of financial instruments before stating the challenges in the development and supervision of IFSI, and highlighting the further scope of research in the field.</p>
<p>After setting the basics and agenda right in the first part, the book proceeds to explain and analyze scientifically the different financial instruments and issues around these in Part II. As the size and importance of Islamic finance grew, from the creation of the basic instruments and institutions to the more complex issues such as monetary operation, risk and liquidity management, and compatibility with the mainstream global financial system cropped up. The recent developments in monetary instruments and issuance of government securities under Islamic banking principles are profoundly discussed (Chapter 2). The institutional arrangements for monetary operations need to be supported by efficient payment and settlement systems and an appropriate design of central bank credit facilities. The paper warns about the weakness of the central bank monetary operation and recognizes the importance of the development of strong financial markets.</p>
<p>The Islamic banking poses special risks and these can be addressed through appropriate regulatory framework and adequate institutional development. Apart from technical issues, there are certain methodological and legal issues for effective risk management and poses key challenges ahead for the growth of Islamic banking (Chapter 3). The various aspects of financial soundness may be carefully analyzed in the standard CAMELS framework. The chapter identifies that Islamic finance based on profit-and-loss sharing (PLS) principle is very complex and requires different risk management framework as against conventional system. The synoptic analysis of PLS and non-PLS modes in Annexure I of the chapter may provide some insights to this. The authority like Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) has to play a proactive role in providing appropriate regulatory framework.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 again revisits the risk management issue but in a different way. The study finds from the literature survey that Base II may provide the scope for the proper recognition of risks in Islamic banking products. The chapter provides different methodologies to measure different types of risks and suggests value-at-risk (VAR) principle for overall risks of an Islamic bank. The measurement of profits and risk sharing between investment account holders (IAHs) and bank owners are based on VAR methodology. The study lays down plausible approaches to risk mitigation and also suggests a possible disclosure regime for Islamic banks. However, the determination and management of profit sharing among shareholders and risk mitigation still remain very critical. Finally, the paper makes policy recommendations for overall risk management.</p>
<p>The last chapter of this part provides a note on a very specific issue of liquidity management and calls for widening and deepening of the money market. At the same time, the chapter discusses the factors affecting the money markets emphasizing on legal and Shari’ah issues. The availability of Shari’ah compliant money market instruments is very limited and varied in nature across countries. This poses difficulty for the integration of different financial markets. The structure and instruments of money market are discussed and role of central bank is duly recognized. There is a need for the parallel development of foreign exchange market and bond markets to supplement the money market. The proper coordination of monetary and fiscal policy is required for the development of money and government securities markets. Finally, the chapter outlines the broad policy issues and strategies for Islamic money market development.</p>
<p>There has been an effort to bring the Islamic finance in the forefront and integrate it with the conventional financial system. The weaknesses and limitations of the Islamic banking and finance have been identified and attempts have been made to address these issues in a scientific way. In this spirit, the last part attempts to address technical issues of managing profit equalization and investment risk reserves (Chapter 6), whereas Chapter 7 deals in specific the World Bank–IMF Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP) to assess the functioning and performance of the IFSI. The last chapter primarily constitutes the implications of profit-sharing investment accounts (PSIAs) in Islamic finance.</p>
<p>Based on theoretical analysis on determining the risk characteristics, the sharing of risks and returns are calculated with appropriate adjustment made to the volatility in asset returns for the shareholders and the IAHs (Chapter 6). Investment risk reserves (IRR) is used as a key instrument to smoothen out the returns in the face of uncertainty arising out of volatility in asset returns. The international organizations like IMF and World Bank are carefully observing the functioning of the Islamic banking industry particularly after the occurrence of East Asian currency crisis. The primary objective of the FSAP is to promote economic growth with financial stability by promoting financial system soundness with broadening and widening Islamic financial sector (Chapter 7). Different stability and development modules are developed for countries having small and large share of IFSIs. The Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) is set up to develop standards and guidelines for the prudential supervision of the IFSIs.</p>
<p>In the last chapter, the implications of PSIAs specifically to supervisory, regulatory and capital adequacy aspects are discussed; calculation of capital adequacy ratio is illustrated and a detailed methodology is provided for measuring risks in IAHs. By the varying nature of risks of IAHs and the banks, the judiciary issues crop up. The sharing of profits/loss between the concerned parties is suggested on the basis of technical analysis. The issue of risk and/or profit sharing in Islamic finance is no doubt a very complex one but if resolved satisfactorily, it can help in promoting a global Islamic financial system.</p>
<p>Though the potential for the growth of Islamic finance is well recognized, there are many challenges like uniformity of financial instruments, management of risk, financial stability among others before the policy authorities to strengthen Islamic financial system. The book offers insights to these issues and attempts to provide pragmatic solutions in this direction. The book also provides analytical foundation and solutions to the practical problems relating to management, policy and institutional issues confronting the regulation and supervision of the Islamic banking industry. Islamic financial system and its structure are comprehensively discussed. The issues of risk management, profit sharing, financial stability, regulation and supervision the Islamic banking industry is facing today are thoroughly addressed.</p>
<p>Given the complexity of the Islamic finance, the book is certainly useful at least to understand the concept of Islamic finance and key issues around it. The practitioners and policy-makers in the field of Islamic finance may also find this book handy and may learn the experiences and practices of Islamic banking in different countries. The Islamic finance should not be understood as an alternative or competitive to the conventional financial system rather it may be seen as complementary to it. This book intends inculcating the spirit of collaboration and cooperation between these two financial systems to ensure the growth of the industry and global financial stability.</p>
<p>The editors deserve compliments for making contribution to the literature on Islamic finance and banking by bringing out this book. They have made commendable effort to compile the writings of Dr Sundararajan and present it in a single piece of work. We understand that it is difficult to avoid repetition and maintain lucidity in an edited book. Undoubtedly, the substantial expertize and efforts of the editors are being reflected in this publication. The book has limited its focus on main issues of risk sharing, regulations and challenges facing Islamic finance. The discussion of Islamic finance is largely limited to the banking sector. There is a casual discussion on Islamic insurance and bond markets. Finally, Islamic finance needs a critical approach and pragmatic analysis to gain strength to stand high in the current global financial system. The book offers some original thinking and food of thoughts on Islamic financial system, and throws different issues and challenges for us to ponder over in the recent time.</p>
