<title>Background:</title>
<p>Internationally, it is well established that the behaviour, performance, and achievement of schoolchildren is directly linked to the nutritional status of overall diet – including the contents of their school lunch-boxes. In a previous survey study by the lead authors, primary school children’s food consumption behaviour was investigated. Results indicated that most children’s lunch-boxes contained an over-representation of ‘undesirable’ food groups and an under-representation of fruit and vegetables. This follow-up study examined children’s awareness of healthy food choices and investigated what food groups children would choose if given free choice when constructing a lunch-box.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0017896911422964">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The data was obtained by surveying 1,184 primary school children from eight different urban primary schools in the Manawatu Region of New Zealand. Food items included in this survey represented the 40 most common foods from the previous study. A series of accompanying food charts were used in combination with the checklists. From these lists the children were asked to construct a hypothetical ideal ‘dream’ lunch-box and a ‘healthy’ lunch-box.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0017896911422964">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Results indicated a significant difference between the fruit and vegetable content between lunch-boxes, demonstrating that children understood fruit and vegetables are healthy – but that they did not necessarily translate this knowledge into action.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0017896911422964">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The influences on children’s choices in fruit and vegetables are as complex as the barriers to them eating. This study offers unique insight into the knowledge and behaviours of schoolchildren when selecting and consuming fruit and vegetables – especially given a degree of autonomy and choice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Those people who are classified as medically obese have increased considerably over recent decades and are now a serious worldwide problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911422964">1</xref></sup> New Zealand, in 2003, had an obesity rate of 21% and this is predicted to further rise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896911422964">2</xref></sup> It is estimated that over half the adult population in New Zealand is overweight and it is expected that, by the year 2012, the number of obese adults could rise to 30%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896911422964">3</xref></sup> More worrying still is the fact that there are unprecedented numbers of children now featured in these statistics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911422964">4</xref></sup> One study in New Zealand found that 9.8% of children between 5 and 14 years were obese and a further 21.3% were overweight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896911422964">5</xref></sup> Such statistics are not unique to New Zealand and, instead, reflect international trends – especially in Westernized nations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911422964">6</xref></sup> Compounding and unique to the New Zealand obesity issue, Turnball and colleagues identified that, over the last 11 years or so, higher percentages of Maori and Pacific Island-origin children, in comparison to children of European descent, have a significantly raised Body Mass Index (BMI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911422964">7</xref></sup> It is also known that New Zealand children are subjected to significantly higher proportions of food advertisements on the main terrestrial television channels, classified high in fat and sugar compared to ‘improved nutrition’, when compared to neighbouring countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911422964">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Internationally, it is also well established that the behaviour, performance, achievement, and obesity-levels of schoolchildren are directly linked to the nutritional status of overall diet – including the contents of their school lunch-boxes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911422964">9</xref></sup> In New Zealand, there is no state-funded school lunch programme so a large proportion of schoolchildren are reliant on packed lunch-boxes to serve their nutritional requirements for the longest part of their working school day. Where children in New Zealand do not have packed lunch-boxes, their nutritional needs are served either by convenience stores known to cluster in the immediate vicinity of schools (dairies, garages etc.)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911422964">10</xref></sup> or, less commonly, school-based tuck-shops.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911422964">11</xref></sup> The fact remains, however, that these inlets/outlets are far more likely to serve as ‘additional’ nutritional adjuncts compared to the far more popular and common lunch-box provision – rather than as a replacement. In July 2004, the New Zealand Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health and Sport and Recreation New Zealand (SPARC), signed a ‘tripartite memorandum of understanding’ towards improving the health and wellbeing of schoolchildren in New Zealand, with a particular emphasis on nutrition. In 2008, all state-funded schools were required to promote healthy nutrition to all schoolchildren and, where food was sold on school premises, that only healthy options were available. However, with a change of government in 2009 this requirement was removed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911422964">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Compounding the situation already stated, and known to be a contributory factor, a number of international studies have indicated that there is an overall decline in fruit and vegetable consumption among school-aged children – particularly during the school-time period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896911422964">13</xref></sup> Given that approximately one-third of the total nutritional intake of schoolchildren between the ages of 5 and 15 years old is consumed while they are at school,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911422964">14</xref></sup> it is important to target, measure and evaluate this issue. One study identified that 10% of school-aged girls and 19% of boys had not eaten any vegetables in the week prior to their survey – and that over 50% of each group had not consumed a ‘whole’ fruit daily.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911422964">15</xref></sup> Sanigorski and colleagues highlight a worrying trend away from fruit as a natural product towards fruit substitutes as a snack in lunch-boxes; that is, nutritionally-dense fruit bars with added sugars.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911422964">16</xref></sup> This reflects the fact that it is known that most children view eating as a way to satisfy hunger rather than as a means to maximize health when at school.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896911422964">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>In line with the national and international situation, New Zealand health policy, particularly at the governmental level, has sought to identify strategies to overcome the common dilemma of reduced fruit and vegetable consumption in children’s overall diet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896911422964">18</xref></sup> However, several years forward and more recent childhood nutrition studies are finding that policy directives do not appear to be impacting as envisaged.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911422964">19</xref></sup> For instance, despite increased awareness of ‘5+-a-day’ and increased levels of fresh fruit and vegetables from Ministry of Health campaigns in New Zealand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896911422964">20</xref></sup> the recommended servings of fruit and vegetables are currently present in only a third of the lunch-boxes consumed daily by children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911422964">19</xref></sup> Tobias and colleagues have identified that, even with modest increases in the consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables for New Zealanders, associated poor nutrition mortality rates would significantly decrease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896911422964">21</xref></sup> Adding to this debate, a recent New Zealand year-long study of Wellington-based supermarkets concluded that eating fresh and healthy option food is only marginally more expensive than unhealthy processed options.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0017896911422964">22</xref></sup> These types of results overall indicate that there is a need for raising awareness of the importance of fruit and vegetables in the diet of schoolchildren – particularly within packed lunch-boxes where this is the most common form of schools-based nutrition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896911422964">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this paper was to determine the proportion of fruit and vegetables that were voluntarily selected, given a hypothetical choice, in children’s ‘dream’ versus ‘healthy’ lunch-boxes. The collected data represented phase two of a larger project that explores food choices in the packed lunch-boxes of primary school children in New Zealand. Phase one surveyed the nutritional components of the contents of packed school lunch-boxes and observed the nature of ‘consumed versus unconsumed’ lunch-box items. This part of the study is published elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911422964">19</xref></sup> The inter-related phase three explores the perception of ‘risks’ in fruit and vegetables consumption where data collection remains ongoing. Overall, the phase of this article’s study uniquely intended to measure and evaluate children’s food knowledge, choices and consumption behaviour (particularly in relation to fruit and vegetables) while at school and outside the school environment.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>The data were obtained by surveying 1,184 primary school children. The survey was conducted in eight different urban primary schools (age ranges from 5–11 years), in the Manawatu Region of New Zealand. The schools were randomly selected from a Ministry of Education decile-rating (socio-economic status) list to represent a broad socio-economic spectrum. In the first instance the School Principals were telephoned to obtain consent. There were 337 children from the lower deciles (deciles 1, 2 and 3), 284 children from the medium deciles schools (deciles 4, 5 and 6) and 563 children from the high-decile schools (deciles 9 and 10) who participated in a school wide survey. The amount of checklists obtained from each school varied according to the size of each school and the correspondent size of classes. At least one class from each year (years 1–6) was taken from each school. The number of children in each class ranged between 4 and 27.</p>

<sec id="section12-0017896911422964">
<title>Development of checklists</title>
<p>The checklists contained instructions, 40 food icons and two blank spaces. Items were arranged on the checklist in alphabetical order. Each food icon included a square coloured background, a generic white silhouette of the food item and a text label. Icons were designed using photographic reference and with emphasis put into ensuring key characteristics were included, such as the white pulpy centre and pips of a kiwifruit. Icons were used to ensure reading barriers were not a factor, text labels were used as reinforcement. Food items were grouped and each of the eight groups was represented by a different colour (fruit – dark green; vegetables – light green; savoury main – orange; dairy – aqua blue; baked goods – red; savoury snacks – dark purple; sweet snacks – pink; and junk foods – purple). Colours were selected primarily to be bright and appealing to the children, but also to be representative of the food type. Colour was used to enhance the usability of the food charts and checklists. Colour was used to assist the children in identifying food groups and in cross-referencing between the food chart and the checklist. Colour also made the analysis phase quicker and more accurate. Two spaces were left free on the checklists for the children to insert any food items not represented by the icons. It was explained to the children that, even if their favourite brand of food item was not pictured, they should pick the icon that was closest; for example, if they liked a particular flavour of crisps and this was not pictured. If none of the icons represented the food item they were encouraged to write this into the blank spaces.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0017896911422964">
<title>Development of food charts</title>
<p>A series of food charts were used in combination with the checklists. The food charts were large-size posters that included photographic images of food examples accompanied by the corresponding food icon found on the checklist. Food charts were colour coded as aforementioned. Individual food charts contained a range of images as appropriate for each of the 40 food items; for example, the apple chart pictured a range of different coloured apples. Images were obtained from free image libraries on the internet, supermarket brochures, and personal photography.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section14-0017896911422964">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Each child was provided with a checklist and then led through the food charts which had been laid out on desks in a classroom. Children were first asked to tick up to six items representing their ‘dream’ lunchbox and tick these with the provided red pen. ‘Dream’ was described to the children as perfect or ideal; that is, a lunch-box that they would create if all food types were available to them. Children were encouraged to choose items they would be happy eating regularly and were asked to include the items they most liked. Once the ‘dream’ lunchbox task was complete children were then asked to select up to six items representing a ‘healthy’ lunchbox using the provided blue pens. The concept of healthy was discussed with the children first and healthy was defined as being good for you; that is, good for your body, good for strength and growth, nutritious. Children were specifically instructed to only select healthy food items that they would eat and not throw away in the waste bins.</p>
<p>Parents were provided with information via two routes. First, it was posted in the school newsletter and, second, each child was provided with an information sheet to take home explaining the nature and intent of the study. Parents were offered the opportunity to contact the school administrator if they did not wish to participate. Only two parents declined. Part of the information stated that the research was not intended to scrutinize individual children or the individual schools, but as broad anonymous food-based data. Demographic data was also not sought, such as child’s gender and ethnicity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0017896911422964" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The study with the checklist aimed to explore children’s willingness to eat fruit and vegetables if they could exercise free choice as in the situation of their ‘dream’ lunch-boxes. The results showed that 57.7% of the children would voluntarily eat one fruit or vegetable and 29.5% would eat two fruits or vegetables for lunch. Furthermore, the children understood the importance of having fruit and vegetables in their healthy lunch-box: 95.4% of children selected fruit and vegetables in their healthy lunch-box compared to only 57.7% selecting fruit and vegetables in their ‘dream’ lunch-box. There was a significant difference in the amount of fruit and vegetable selected for the healthy lunch-box (<italic>M</italic> = 3.69) as compared to ‘dream’ (<italic>M</italic> = 1.04), <italic>t</italic>(1184) = 43.62, <italic>p</italic> = .000. The differences in individual fruit and vegetable are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0017896911422964">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>With a careful examination of the food items, strawberries and apples were the only two fruit or vegetable food items to appear in the top 15 choices for the ‘dream’ lunch-box. In contrast, all fruit and vegetable food were selected in the top 15 in the healthy lunch-box, with the exception of raisins that appeared 26th on the list (the selected food items are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0017896911422964">Table 1</xref> with individual fruit and vegetables shaded). Furthermore, the top four items chosen in the ‘dream’ lunch-box were in the bottom five items of the healthy lunch-box; that is, chocolate, chippies (crisps), donuts and lollies (sweets). The results showed that children have good knowledge that fruit and vegetables are healthy, but that fruit and vegetables may not be their preferred lunch-box items.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Eating patterns among school-aged children have continuously received attention from education and public health institutions. Despite increased awareness of ‘5+-a-day’, fruit and vegetables intakes are consistently reported as being low.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896911422964">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0017896911422964">25</xref></sup> The results of this study are consistent with the existing literature reporting positive effects of general nutrition education programmes in schools and that children have a good understanding of the educational messages delivered about the importance of fruit and vegetables in their diet.</p>
<p>There is a reasonably wide and eclectic body of information that targets issues related to food knowledge, choices and consumption behaviour of schoolchildren while at school and outside the school environment – but only a small proportion investigates lunch-boxes in this context. A few previous studies have investigated the nutritional status of lunch-boxes in children but all differ from the scope and outcomes of this study. Barton’s study aimed to see to what extent a teaching session on healthy nutrition, to a group of 10–11-year olds, would change the contents of their lunch-boxes pre-intervention and post-intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0017896911422964">26</xref></sup> MiRan and colleagues, in their Korean study, compared the lunch-box calorie-ratio content of middle-school girls in rural and urban areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0017896911422964">27</xref></sup> Findings showed that calorific values were less in rural children compared to their urban counterparts. Warren and colleagues wanted to observe the ‘food recall’ of 5–7-year-old schoolchildren between those that ate packed lunch-boxes compared to those that ate provided school lunches two hours after consumption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0017896911422964">28</xref></sup> The findings noted that accurate recall was significantly higher in the packed lunch group than the comparator. The most likely explanation for this was increased familiarity with their own property and its contents. Phase 1 of the overall project presented in this article observed directly the nutritional composition of children’s lunch-boxes and observed the levels of ‘consumed versus non-consumed’ items.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911422964">19</xref></sup> The most closely related study to the phase 1 stage of this project appears to be those of Sanigorski and colleagues who did observe the nutritional contents of lunch-boxes in Australian schools, in comparison with those that ate provided school lunches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911422964">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The positive effects of general nutrition education programmes in schools are well documented in relation to food knowledge, choices and consumption behaviour of schoolchildren while at school and outside the school environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0017896911422964">29</xref></sup> Interventions to improve good nutritional habits in children are known to be more effective at school ages when their food habits and preferences are still forming.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0017896911422964">30</xref></sup> For instance, specific curriculum introduced sessions on fostering healthy eating are known to significantly improve the frequency of fruit and vegetable intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0017896911422964">31</xref></sup> In one randomized trial, a direct education nutrition intervention by teachers showed significant uptake of fruit (47% increase) and vegetable (58% increase) consumption and a large decrease in sugar and fat-laden snack foods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0017896911422964">32</xref></sup> Reassuring in one way, a study found that following educational interventions, 68% of children had fruit in their lunchboxes – but this was countered by the fact that over 90% also had energy-dense, micronutrient-poor snacks as the main constituent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911422964">16</xref></sup> Further educational consideration is to provide unique and creative opportunities to help children learn about fruit and vegetables and to extend children’s enjoyment of fruit and vegetables – such as blind tastings of different fruits and vegetables as a class experiment – and then get children to describe their experiences (good and bad) as class stories or poems. Establishing a class or school fruit and vegetable garden may be another creative possibility.</p>
<p>There are studies, however, that highlight the flaws and frailty of curricular education-based interventions alone. Thus other studies identify broader recommendations. The Council of Europe, in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) and through the Health-Promoting Schools Network, advises that schools actively revise their nutrition policies to investigate existing food services or implement new ones above and beyond just curricular-driven activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0017896911422964">33</xref></sup> Therefore, interventions within and outside the immediate school vicinity might include targeting shops in the vicinity of schools, lunch-boxes, vending machines, cash cafeterias and canteens, ‘tuck shops’ and other kiosk-type outlets. Other schools-based interventions could include innovations such as food clubs, fruit-only ‘tuck shops’, after-schools projects and competitions based on nutrition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911422964">11</xref></sup> In our previous phase 1 study, one of the surveyed schools enforced a ‘fruit/vegetable-only’ policy for the morning break period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911422964">19</xref></sup> It is proposed here that another worthwhile intervention to compliment and enforce similar local policies would be to try and encourage parents to substitute one of their snacks for a piece of fruit or vegetable – while still being able to offer some snack-related provision as well. This seems even more appropriate, in light of that fact that Wagner and colleagues have stated that nutritious school lunches do not necessarily cost more and nutritional quality appears unrelated to student demand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0017896911422964">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>It has been reported that school-based strategies alone may have little impact on the overall consumption of fruit and vegetables of schoolchildren without the adoption of wider initiatives that target community-wide interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911422964">15</xref></sup> This seems even more pressing when considering the findings of Kubik and colleagues who have identified that school students do not compensate for less healthy foods consumed at school by choosing more healthy options when they are outside the school setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0017896911422964">35</xref></sup> Despite the paucity of evaluated interventions that adopt a community-wide strategy, more recent studies are beginning to make headway in this area. For instance, two similar but separate studies report their evaluation of multi-strategy, multi-setting <italic>Eat Well Be Active</italic> and <italic>Be Active Eat Well</italic> programmes in Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0017896911422964">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0017896911422964">37</xref></sup> Such interventions are in line with the wider remit and intention of the WHO-endorsed Health-Promoting Schools movement and those who advocate its cause.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0017896911422964">38</xref></sup> Such interventions are more likely to demonstrate success when it comes to measuring and evaluating food knowledge, choices and consumption behaviour of schoolchildren while at school and outside the school environment – especially in relation to existing fruit and vegetable health policy.</p>

<title>Implications for school health</title>
<p>Despite increased international awareness of ‘5+-a-day’ fruit and vegetables consumption in children, intakes are consistently reported as being low The results of this study are consistent with the existing literature reporting positive effects of general nutrition education programmes in schools. What this study adds for school health practitioners is that children, as potentially healthy consumers, have a good understanding of the educational messages delivered about the importance of fruit and vegetables in their diet – but that this does not necessarily translate into direct action. This is an important consideration when implementing and evaluating schools-based nutrition programmes.</p>
