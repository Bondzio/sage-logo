<p>Healthcare costs are of concern in every part of the world. Rehabilitation is at particular risk for several reasons: it may not be considered a legitimate part of healthcare; it may be given a lower priority; and outcomes are less dramatic and more long-term than in some other areas of practice, especially surgery. Under these circumstances the three linked articles from Professor Lynne Turner-Stokes and her colleagues should be of interest to everyone as they explore ways of costing and paying for rehabilitation services. The first of these articles explores <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra1-0269215512437996" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511417468">casemix and costing models</related-article>, the second looks at <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra2-0269215512437996" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511417469">cost analysis</related-article> of specialist inpatient neurorehabilitation services and the final one investigates <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra3-0269215512437996" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511417467">healthcare tariffs</related-article> for specialist inpatient neurorehabilitation services. Although the data relate to UK practice, the methods and results should apply anywhere similar. And, at the same time it must be emphasised that the evidence in favour of rehabilitation is getting stronger each year. We know that the process works, and slowly more details are being discovered about what specific interventions help. In this issue a <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra4-0269215512437996" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511420306">systematic review</related-article> of constraint-induced movement therapy for impaired arm function after stroke suggests some real advantages. Of course, only a small proportion of stroke patients can benefit from this and about half will be left with non-functional arms with flexor spasticity, contractures and discomfort. A <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra5-0269215512437996" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511421355">pilot study</related-article> now suggests that early use of botulinum toxin may be quite effective at reducing long-term spasticity. A trial including 50 patients should answer the question, and the small size of the required study suggests quite a powerful effect of the intervention long after the effects of the toxin have worn off. Poor mobility is also a common problem after stroke and a common treatment of this is treadmill training. <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra6-0269215512437996" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511419383">A study</related-article> now suggests that adding a visual stimulus can increase the effectiveness of the training. This requires confirmation, but the effect appeared to be detected in a small sample which suggests quite a powerful result. Another positive study suggests that adding <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra7-0269215512437996" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511419382">electromyographic feedback</related-article> to exercise after partial knee menisectomy may speed up recovery. Finally the range of rehabilitation studies being undertaken in the UK can be seen in the <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra8-0269215512437996" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511425764">abstracts of the Society for Research in Rehabilitation</related-article> – which includes RCTs.</p>
