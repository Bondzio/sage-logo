<abstract>
<p>In this article, we report findings from a qualitative study that explored how the relatives of intensive care unit patients experienced the nurses’ role and relationship with them in the end-of-life decision-making processes. In all, 27 relatives of 21 deceased patients were interviewed about their experiences in this challenging ethical issue. The findings reveal that despite bedside experiences of care, compassion and comfort, the nurses were perceived as vague and evasive in their communication, and the relatives missed a long-term perspective in the dialogue. Few experienced that nurses participated in meetings with doctors and relatives. The ethical consequences imply increased loneliness and uncertainty, and the experience that the relatives themselves have the responsibility of obtaining information and understanding their role in the decision-making process. The relatives therefore felt that the nurses could have been more involved in the process.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The closest relatives of critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients find themselves in a very difficult and uncertain situation. The patient’s condition is often unstable and can oscillate between relatively good periods and ever-increasing deterioration. Norwegian ICUs have virtually unlimited visiting hours; the family will often be present most of the day. Patient–nurse ratio is 1:1; there is always a nurse responsible for the patient who is also continuously involved with the family. The relatives often experience waves of hope connected to improvement, but simultaneously there is a constant threat of deterioration and possible loss. For some patients, this may gradually emerge into a phase where treatment termination becomes a reality.</p>
<p>In this article, we study how the families experienced the nurses’ role in the end-of-life decision-making processes. How did they experience the relationship and communication with the nurses, and how did this meet their expectations and needs in this ethically challenging process? The families’ situation in the end-of-life discussion is a prominent theme in global ICU nursing research. Our results shed light on some unrealised goals in the practice in this area in Norwegian ICUs, and we will suggest improvements to ICU nurses’ work with relatives in end-of-life situations.</p>

<title>Previous research</title>
<p>End-of-life decision making is the process that healthcare providers, patients and families go through when various treatments for a life-threatening illness are being considered.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011433925">1</xref>
</sup> Such decisions should be based on the patient’s wishes. However, ICU patients generally have impaired cognition and can thus seldom decide for themselves.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733011433925">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733011433925">3</xref>
</sup> A shared decision-making model is recommended where clinicians include relatives in the process.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011433925">4</xref>
</sup> Traditionally, and due to legislation, families in European countries have been less involved in end-of-life decisions than in the United States<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733011433925">5</xref>

</sup> In Norway, legislation gives clinicians the final decision-making authority,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733011433925">8</xref>
</sup> and many Scandinavian physicians consider themselves to be the principal end-of-life decision makers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011433925">9</xref>
</sup> However, according to the Patients’ Rights Act, when a patient is assumed incompetent to consent to treatment, the relatives should be included in the decision-making processes to provide information on the patient’s presumed preferences.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733011433925">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Decision-making for ICU patients is viewed by family members as a complex process<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011433925">10</xref>
</sup> where quality, frequency and availability of communication are considered important factors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011433925">11</xref>
</sup> Due to the often inherently uncertain nature of the patient’s situation, discussing prognostic information with patients or relatives can be challenging.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733011433925">12</xref>
</sup> Families are often asked to ‘wait and see’,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011433925">13</xref>
</sup> while physicians strive to achieve certainty in prognostication. However, it is known that family members can tolerate discussions about an uncertain prognosis and that such discussions are also essential to allow them to prepare emotionally for the possibility of a patient’s death.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733011433925">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011433925">15</xref>
</sup> A previous article from our study reveals that families want a more active role in order to communicate the patient’s preferences. However, many considered their role unclear, and few participants experienced, in fact, being a part of the decision-making process.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011433925">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>There is a growing amount of research describing the role of nurses in end-of-life decision making and how they strive to facilitate the families in the process.<sup>

</sup> A recent review found that key nursing roles are information broker, supporter and advocate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733011433925">19</xref>
</sup> Despite the fact that nurses and physicians often consider the nurses as actively involved with physicians in end-of-life decision making.<sup>

</sup> and agreement that nurses should participate actively,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011433925">4</xref>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>This is a qualitative study based on interviews with 27 family members of 21 former ICU patients who died after a decision to withhold or withdraw ICU treatment. The study design was based on narrative methods where ‘the purpose is to see how respondents in interviews impose order on the flow of experience to make sense of events and actions in their lives’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733011433925">27</xref>
</sup> The interviews allowed for extensive accounts of a distinctive and strongly emotional time in the lives of the participants. The stories often gave an elaborate insight into both the sequence of events and the participants’ interpretations and experiences of these events.</p>
<sec id="section4-0969733011433925">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Four university hospitals participated in the study. Hospitals were selected based on their ICU size (&gt; 8 beds) and type of unit (general ICU). Local research coordinators selected relatives from their ICU patient database, based on the inclusion criteria that both the deceased patient and relatives were above 18 years of age and that the relative had visited the patient regularly. The decision to withdraw treatment should be documented in the patient record. Relatives who had been asked to consent to organ donation were excluded. Detailed information on the study and an invitation to participate were sent from the research coordinators to selected family members within the first year of their loss of a close relative. Those who agreed to participate returned the written consent in a prepaid envelope addressed to one of the researchers (RL) who also was the only interviewer. The family member who received the invitation could decide to invite other relatives to participate with them in the interview. Therefore, in three interviews, two family members participated, and in one interview, four participated.</p>
<p>The relationship of participants to the deceased family member varied: 11 were spouses, 2 were sons, 8 were daughters, 2 were mothers, 2 were brothers and 2 were sisters. In all, 20 of the participants were women, and 7 were men. The ages ranged from 20 to 80 years, with an average age of 49.7 years. Length of care in the ICU until time of death varied from less than 4 days (5 patients) to 1–4 weeks (14 patients) to more than a month (2 patients). The average patient age was 61 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0969733011433925">
<title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p>The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics, the Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD) and subsequently, by the participating ICUs. The approval authorised contacting potential participants 3–12 months after the loss of a close relative. The average time between death and interview was 9 months. The researchers carefully considered that it might be potentially offensive and intrusive during the grief period to make contact soon after the loss.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0969733011433925">
<title>Procedure/interviews</title>
<p>Interviews were conducted during autumn of 2008 and 2009. The 1–1.5 h long interviews were recorded digitally and transcribed partly by the researcher (RL) and partly by a professional typist. Most interviews took place in the participant’s home. Due to long distances, there were two telephone interviews. The interview started with a short introductory dialogue to clarify the written material received by the participant. This was followed by a single narrative-inducing question where the participant was asked to relate what had happened. From this open question an extensive narrative about the patient’s illness and the relative’s own experiences was elicited. This uninterrupted account varied from 10 to 25 min. Next, using a semi-structured interview guide, the interviewer followed up the topics from the participant’s narrative. Examples of questions asked were as follows: Could you please tell about your experiences from the decision-making process and how you found the nurses’ role in this process? What did the conversations with the nurses mean to you? Could you please describe situations where you did cooperate and communicate with nurses, and if possible, also focus on the content of the conversation? However, the sequence of topics did not strictly follow the guide. Some questions further down on the list were answered through follow-up questions to elicit more details on a particular topic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0969733011433925">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The interview texts were analysed in several steps using narrative analysis, which recognises that people make sense of their experiences and communicate them in various ways through stories explaining what these experiences mean to them.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733011433925">27</xref>
</sup> Interpretations were made in light of the themes developed by the investigators, with the concrete purpose of gaining an understanding of how the informants experienced the nurses’ role directed to them in the end-of-life decision-making processes. A combination of thematic and structural analysis was conducted based on narrative methods.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733011433925">27</xref>
</sup> The thematic analysis identified topics within the stories and gave an overall picture of the nurses’ participation. Positive experiences were in the forefront. An example of this was the initial emphasis most participants placed on the nurses’ kindness and caring attitude towards both the patient and themselves. By re-entering the narratives and sorting data with a structural approach with particular emphasis on complicating actions and evaluation, a more nuanced picture with critical comments and crucial events was revealed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733011433925">27</xref>
</sup> Comparisons were made externally with other research as well as between the various narratives in order to establish alternative interpretations for the data and to determine how well the themes matched information from other participants. In line with the phenomenological tradition, we focused on trying to find how the participants interpreted their experiences of relationships and interactions between themselves and the nurses, and the significance of these for the participants, before we as researchers constructed our own interpretation.<sup>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In this interview study, relatives of deceased ICU patients narrated and reflected on their communication and relational experiences with ICU nurses during the end-of-life decision-making process. Their views varied greatly, and they encountered different nurses with diverse communication skills and abilities to support their needs. Our analysis of the narratives reveals three main themes across a wide range of experiences: compassionate caring, vagueness in communication and loneliness in stressful surroundings. Fundamental and highly valued is the nurses’ caring attitude. This theme has already been well described in other research, so we shall let it form the background and starting point for our presentation and discussion of the other two themes.</p>
<p>Although most participants experienced the bedside compassion and care, a typical experience was an overarching vagueness in communication with nurses. This involved experiences of how topics for discussion were too limited, how information was selective to spare them and how they felt alone in stressful surroundings.</p>
<sec id="section9-0969733011433925">
<title>Vagueness in communication</title>
<p>The participants in this study experienced compassionate caring from the nurses. The nurses were involved with the patient and gave the family attention and often practical help such as food or a place to rest. Many relatives found this unexpected in the general busy atmosphere in the ward. They clearly understood that the patient was the nurses’ prime concern, and they had not expected anything for themselves. However, it really meant something that the nurses found a way of working where the relatives were welcome to visit the patient as much as possible without feeling that they were getting in the nurses’ way.</p>
<p>The participants related that being by the bedside, able to see and touch the patient, helped them to come to terms with the situation. They observed the nurses’ work with the patient and over time noticed changes in the patient’s appearance, skin colour, temperature, swellings, movements, sleep or wakefulness. Some nurses communicated with them about changes, for example, that the blood pressure had gone down, or that they had increased the medication. Fragments of information gradually formed a larger picture, which then shaped their perception of what might happen next. All the sense impressions were subsequently judged to be important in preparing to cope with the patient’s worsening condition. One wife reflects on what happened the day before her husband died:<disp-quote>
<p>They disconnected the dialysis and then I realised, but they didn’t say anything. But then I realised it. But they told me the next day. They said: There’s no turning back. Now we must … just stop treatment!</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Although this participant obviously was not brought into the decision-making process, she later reflected that she had somehow been included by being prepared for the treatment termination.</p>
<p>Those accompanied by other relatives exchanged their impressions, but several said that they rarely discussed with the nurses. If they did ask the nurses, they usually received a complete answer, except regarding prognosis and risk.</p>
<p>Beside casual conversations, the bedside talk with the nurses about the patient’s condition was often limited to results of measurements on the instruments connected to the patient, as this daughter relates,<disp-quote>
<p>They were very interested in the oxygen measurement … the saturation … all the time. I felt they were hung up on that screen. And then it was kind of like that was what they answered about when I asked how he was, either when I was there or on the phone in the evening.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The uncertainty in the patient’s situation was thus undercommunicated and limited to objective results of measurements. Several informants describe a form of socialisation that occurred, where they learned which measurable parameters the nurses emphasised, and later they themselves became interested in these. For some, this information helped to increase their understanding of the patient’s condition, as this daughter says,<disp-quote>
<p>For me it was really good to be there because then I saw him, I could see myself what it said on the screens, you see. After a while you got to know what Noradrenaline was, … I’m not a nurse … But I got very worried about how high the oxygen saturation was, because it should really be over 90. But his was only 87–88 at his best. I just couldn’t stop thinking about this.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Although some participants adapted the instrumental focus from the nurses’ agenda, they wondered about the nurses’ limited topics of communication and the absence of more direct communication and clarification of the uncertainty of the situation.</p>
<p>Several relatives felt that the nurses expressed themselves in a selective and vague manner and kept information from them. They thought that the doctors probably forbade the nurses to disclose full information. However, most families accepted the different roles of the nurses and physicians. Although they recognised that the nurses may have tried to spare them, giving them hope and comfort by ‘not telling’, this is nevertheless also criticised as a lack of openness and honesty in communication. One spouse pointed out how illogical the nurses’ answers were.<disp-quote>
<p>They were always doing tests. But the nurses just answered that they didn’t know, that they hadn’t heard anything. But we knew they’d heard something. When they took tests, they got results! I felt that they didn’t want to say anything, and that things were going downhill really fast.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Because the doctors were so busy and the nurses so vague in communicating, many relatives, like this wife, felt a huge responsibility to acquire the necessary information themselves:<disp-quote>
<p>I got information. But the doctors were terribly busy, and there wasn’t much chance to ask. Sometimes I had to be the one to ask for information. I realised there was something, but didn’t quite know what. I wanted to find out how worried they were and so on.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Although several mentioned the dynamics of interaction with nurses and doctors, where they took an active part, it was a big effort having to search for information. Some, therefore, sought the advice of family friends who were health professionals, and the youngest participants also searched for information about risks on the Internet.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0969733011433925">
<title>Loneliness in stressful surroundings</title>
<p>The conclusion of several participants is that their situation as ICU families was a lonely experience. They longed for proper conversations. This longing we interpret as directed both towards a recognition as an active participant and the opening of a dialogue about the patient’s situation. This also implied help in clarifying the family’s role as a surrogate and a participant in the decision about terminating treatment. Such conversations, however, require attention and awareness that many suggest may be difficult in a busy ICU context. Many had trouble in taking the initiative themselves, as this wife put it:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s such a stressed-out environment, busy and I at least then, …. would be careful about […] I didn’t want to disturb them and get attention. […] I think in fact I kept myself in check so I wouldn’t show my worry and desperation … I really pulled myself together, … sitting there … I used up a lot of energy doing that. […] And there is a bit of support and a bit of …Well, what should I say really? But they (the nurses) are absolute strangers, they don’t get close.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The ICU environment limits closeness, but where nurses participated in family–physician meetings, some participants met nurses who worked well to reduce the environmental stress. Referring to the conversations and follow-up after meetings with doctors and nurses, an elderly husband assessed the nurses’ ability to reach him as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>The personal thing, in all the pressure you get. It’s almost inconceivable that anyone else can understand it. Especially Mary, the nurse we saw the most, was just absolutely fantastic.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The doctor and nurse worked with him and his family as a well-prepared team and often provided the information they needed but had not yet formulated as questions. They also saw that they were prepared for possible bad results before the patient was sent for X-ray and that afterwards a meeting was arranged often set up in advance.</p>
<p>Most study participants, however, found that nurses did not attend family–physician meetings. Some, like this son, presumed it was because the nurses were busy or had other duties scheduled:<disp-quote>
<p>The nurses didn’t take part in our meetings with the doctors. I suppose they had their shifts which made it impossible. No, it probably wasn’t possible.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A spouse described it as coming to a completely different world when she came back to the bedside after getting information from the doctor. There was a gap and she just had to presume that the nurse also knew what she had now learnt; it was quite impossible to raise the subject, to start a conversation about it.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0969733011433925">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It is already known that families of ICU patients want more information and inclusion in the end-of-life discussion and process<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969733011433925">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733011433925">30</xref>
</sup> We interpret the criticisms mentioned regarding nurses’ vagueness, absence and evasiveness as a reflection of the relatives’ desire for more active participation by the nurses with whom they already had good contact in the bedside care. It is therefore necessary to consider how nurses can be involved with the family more constructively.</p>
<sec id="section12-0969733011433925">
<title>Bedside communication and ethical concerns</title>
<p>We have studied with interest the participants’ description of how the topic of conversation with the nurses is directed towards everyday matters and measurements, coupled with a lack of dialogue about ethical matters and essential clinical decisions. It is also interesting that the families interpret the vagueness as an expression of an intention to provide comfort and a shield, while they consider their need for information and participation to be more important. This gives reason to ask whether the family’s ethical concerns should also be emphasised as part of the traditional ideal of nursing care.</p>
<p>Comfort in the family nursing context appears in this study as a practical form of care for the family, mostly in the bedside situation. It embraces both healing and protecting. Bach et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733011433925">17</xref>
</sup> similarly found that one of the key roles nurses play is being present at the bedside, providing comfort, a caring touch and a listening ear. In contrast to the unconditional positive quality of comfort, many of our participants felt that what they missed most in the relationship with nurses, that is, openness and dialogue, was answered with evasiveness and vagueness. The nurses talk about casual topics and measurable physiological parameters, while values, as an extension of the issue of prognosis, are marginalised.</p>
<p>The families experience a clear distinction between what doctors and nurses can communicate to them, primarily related to the doctor’s professional responsibility, medical insight and decision-making capacity. But the distinction can be unnecessarily exacerbated by the traditional doctor–nurse roles and learned hierarchical patterns,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733011433925">31</xref>
</sup> where nurses see their share of the communication with relatives as delegated and subordinate to the doctor. If the doctor views providing information to families as his duty alone, he can plan and carry out information meetings without nurses and without regarding this as poor cooperation. When nurses are absent from the family meeting and the end-of-life decision-making process, the holistic, ethical caring perspective of nursing is missing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733011433925">32</xref>
</sup> We notice that a professional group such as ICU nurses, having great responsibility for continuous care for patient and family, is not sufficiently involved in important processes<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733011433925">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733011433925">25</xref>
</sup> and has not been allowed to realise its full responsibility to provide information and to help the families in ethical considerations. This is an ethical problem since the lack of transparency is in conflict with legislation, which provides for information to the patient’s relatives.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733011433925">8</xref>
</sup> Our results indicate that the ICUs experienced by our participants have not established adequate systems and routines for team collaboration around family care with regard to shared decision making.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0969733011433925">
<title>Ethical consequences</title>
<p>Ethical consequences of deficient team collaboration and divergence in topics of communication are an exacerbation of the loneliness, anxiety and uncertainty in such an existentially difficult situation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733011433925">33</xref>
</sup> Our results show that the families often had feelings about developments in the patient’s condition, which they were unable to discuss, and they were also uncertain about their role as a possible surrogate in decision-making issues. In order to interpret their impressions, they were working on their own with coming to terms with the situation. Our findings are supported by Ågård and Harder<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733011433925">34</xref>
</sup> who described families’ work with understanding as forming personal cues. In concordance with other research,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969733011433925">35</xref>
</sup> our study reveals that the inadequate communication led some participants to feel great responsibility to find the information still lacking after they had come to terms with the reality of the situation. This is ethically questionable and indicates that present practice focuses too little on communicating with families on their own terms but rather perpetuates procedures that may be mostly based on the traditional role perceptions of the physician and nurse,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733011433925">31</xref>
</sup> but which do not benefit the family. This contrasts with other findings, which point out that nurses consider it their duty to be the advocate for the family,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733011433925">19</xref>
</sup> to collect all information from various doctors, tests and examinations and then help the family by providing end-of-life communication, which calls their attention to the ‘big picture’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011433925">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0969733011433925">36</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>There are several consequences for the nurses of the sharp boundaries in communication. From a relational ethics perspective, the lack of transparency threatens to break down trust. However, our normal intercourse with one another is based on an expectation of openness and truth.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969733011433925">37</xref>
</sup> The families in our study experienced that the nurses also suffer from the lack of complete openness and honesty. Several participants interpreted, sometimes apologetically, the vagueness as part of a difficult balancing act for nurses; they are torn between loyalty to internal information procedures and the desire to offer the family truth, hope or protection. Limiting bedside talk to casual conversations and measurable details is also a way to avoid the danger of having to communicate risky and value-laden topics. The nurses’ reservation may indicate an attempt to avoid sensitive topics and thus an involvement with the relatives’ concerns and feelings.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0969733011433925">38</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The absence of the nurse from family–physician meetings deprives her of closeness to what happens at these meetings. She lacks a contextual understanding of exactly what was said and how the relatives reacted emotionally. She, therefore, lacks a professional perception of the relatives’ situation and how best she can help them. Our results show that relatives found it difficult to reveal words and feelings from the meetings with doctors.</p>
<p>Similar to our findings, Nelms and Eggenberger<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969733011433925">35</xref>
</sup> described the relatives as wanting the nurses to take the initiative and reach out to them. They want nurses to be responsible for moving the dialogue from casual conversation and a focus on measurable details to deeper, more purposeful and meaningful interaction through discussing value-laden topics. This partly involves the relatives clarifying their thoughts and their preliminary understanding of the patient’s condition and also realising the implications of their own role in the decision-making process.</p>

<title>Clinical implementation of effective ethical work processes – nurses’ responsibility</title>
<p>We propose that nurses must recognise the ethically important end-of-life communication with families as a nursing topic and improve their practice in this field. Several experts agree that patients’ families benefit from a collaborative approach to end-of-life issues.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969733011433925">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969733011433925">40</xref>
</sup> Although such collaboration is important, some investigators<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969733011433925">39</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969733011433925"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969733011433925">41</xref>
</sup> have suggested that the close relationship between nurses and patients’ families in these settings make the nurse the right person from the clinical team to encourage open dialogue with the families. On the same basis, a recent article from the improving palliative care (IPAL)-ICU project<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0969733011433925">42</xref>
</sup> goes even further, proposing a leading role for nurses in design and application of work processes that facilitate systematic integration of palliative care. The authors point out that ICU nurses bear significant responsibility for implementation of the patient care plan and they, therefore, suggest that nurses should be full partners in developing more effective systems and routines for palliative care and in communication that determines the care they will need to provide (p.91). The implementation of ICU protocols or standardised procedures such as checklists or reminders can be effective in improving practice regarding family meetings.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0969733011433925">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0969733011433925">44</xref>
</sup> However, communication must be adapted to the individual family,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0969733011433925">44</xref>
</sup> with ethical sensitivity and sound judgement as to what is at stake for the relatives in the situation and also in the important time after family meetings. It is also suggested that nurses need more education in end-of-life topics and more training in communicating with dying patients and their families.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0969733011433925">45</xref>
</sup> We believe that our findings support this and propose that more attention is paid to this important aspect in both Norwegian and international ICU nursing.</p>
<p>Qualitative research has limitations due to the small sample used.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733011433925">27</xref>
</sup> Although the results from this study demonstrate overarching themes across the various ICU settings of these participants, it is important to stress that the results cannot be generalised but still have general relevance and apply to practice outside the four hospitals studied. Less than 50% of the invitations resulted in interviews. One important reason is no doubt the difficulty inherent in sharing strongly emotional and sensitive narratives with strangers. The results may also have been affected by a predominance of relatives with offended feelings or other negative experiences among those who agreed to be interviewed. However, we do not know the experiences of those who decided not to participate. Our study did not examine clinicians’ practice, but the families’ narratives reflect patterns of practice in Norwegian ICUs where cooperation between the professional groups is deficient with ethical consequences for vulnerable families. Fresh research should address this topic more directly.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study shows that the ethical consequence of nurses’ vague communication with the ICU patients’ family is that many relatives miss a long-term perspective in the dialogue. Values, patients’ preferences and the families’ role in decision making seem to be marginalised. Most importantly, nurses should not be limited to roles of caring and comforting families in very vulnerable and traumatic situations. This study shows that nurses should be real communicators, expected to both have and reveal vital clinical information. Given the nurses’ relationships with these families, being able to reveal such information in close collaboration with the doctors is a crucial element of comprehensive care for ICU families. But it is also to be expected that involving nurses in more substantial collaboration will not only improve information processes and care for relatives. It will also enable nurses to make a more substantial contribution to the clinical decision-making process, involving the vital informational cues they may have regarding the patient’s clinical situation. In this way, care for the patient and care for the family will go hand in hand and this is what shared decision-making processes are all about.</p>
