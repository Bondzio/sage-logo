<p><italic>Debating Restorative Justice</italic> is the first volume in a new series entitled ‘Debating Law’, compiled by Hart Publishing. Inspired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811415349">J.J.C. Smart and Bernard Williams’ (1973)</xref> book, <italic>Utilitarianism: For and Against</italic>, the format of the series is that two authors offer different perspectives on a contemporary topic in a single volume. In this book Chris Cunneen and Carolyn Hoyle, both well known contributors to debates within restorative justice, take contrasting standpoints in order to ‘stimulate, challenge and inform by bringing contrasting perspectives together in one volume’ (Preface).</p>
<p>Broadly stated, Hoyle outlines the case for restorative justice, whereas Cunneen’s more guarded argument focuses on drawing attention to its limitations. While the authors do not respond directly to each other’s views, they are often in agreement on some of the key issues but for different reasons. Consequently, many similar arguments are rehearsed but from different sides of the debate, which in itself is a refreshing and often rewarding approach. Both authors argue that restorative justice has the potential to challenge the established practices of punishment and criminalisation, but has yet to do so in most areas of practice within the criminal justice process. For Hoyle, this is partly because research findings drawn from studies of restorative justice are too often compared to those of retributivist justice. This results in building the research-base on a false premise, and is essentially comparing ‘the proverbial apples with oranges’ (p. 5). As such, her line of reasoning is based on theoretical and philosophical arguments, suggesting that these perspectives are more adequate for establishing a normative position. Cunneen also argues that the comparison between retributivist and restorative justice is unhelpful, but for him the central issue is more that those who oppose current formations of restorative justice tend to be seen as ‘apologist[s] for retributivist or punitive approaches to criminal justice’ (p. 104).</p>
<p>A key tenet of Hoyle’s argument is her suggestion that the dichotomy between restorative justice and criminal justice is an unhelpful one, instead arguing that they are complementary rather than contradictory. She illustrates her point by suggesting justice should be seen on a continuum, where in some circumstances a restorative conference is the most appropriate response; in other cases restorative justice should be seen as ‘an important but subordinate adjunct to the “normal” criminal process’ (p. 94). Following on from this observation, she advocates that restorative justice is all too often kept for ‘shallow end’ (minor) offences while it is ‘deeper end’ (more serious) offences which, causing the greater harm to victims and the wider community, require more restoration. She articulates a framework for how this can be achieved for offences widely seen as inappropriate for restorative forms of intervention, giving examples of domestic violence and crimes against humanity. Helpfully, Cunneen also uses the example of domestic violence and the allied issue of transitional justice to evidence the problems of structural inequalities which, in his view, result in some harms being unsuitable for restorative justice. This synchronization of examples is particularly useful for students seeking to understand many of the debates around restorative justice and its applicability to all harms and offence types.</p>
<p>Hoyle’s recognition that restorative justice has become ‘a victim of some of its own advocates’ rhetoric, a casualty of the over-inflated claims and expectations they raised’ (p. 94) is, in my view, especially helpful. It acknowledges that restorative justice proponents could paint a more balanced picture of both the strengths and weaknesses of the approach, promoting a more accurate understanding of restorative justice practice. This is reflected in Cunneen’s conclusion that restorative justice simulates ‘something which never really existed – a kind of hyper-reality of the justice system which is fair and equitable and offering redemption for all’ (p. 187).</p>
<p>Overall, <italic>Debating Restorative Justice</italic> provides a clear and accessible introduction to the key debates within restorative justice. The presentation of both authors’ arguments in sequence is a major strength of the book. Both authors offer convincing arguments from their individual stances, which in combination makes for an interesting contribution to wider policy and practice debates. This is particularly in regard to the appropriateness of using restorative justice approaches to resolve conflict within more serious offences. Its publication is especially pertinent not only as the Ministry of Justice appears to be keen on making restorative justice a fundamental aspect of the sentencing process, but police are increasingly claiming to apply its principles when dealing with low level crime and disorder by pursuing ‘Community Resolution Disposals’. Consequently practitioners also would do well to read this book, using the debates rehearsed as a way of reflecting upon their own practice and ways of ‘doing’ restorative justice.</p>
