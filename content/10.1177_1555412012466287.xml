This article considers some of the reasons for this reticence, offering close readings of a number of games in which sex’s absence seems especially significant. Attending to these absences can, I argue, throw light on some prevalent misconceptions regarding the nature of video games and the appeal of play. Debates concerning games and sex reveal that commentators, critics, and game developers alike are, by and large, still too ready to judge games using standards developed in relation to other media forms. In doing so they tend both to ignore games’ unique characteristics and to misrepresent their potential as vehicles for creative expression—a potential suggested by the ways in which the medium has already begun to explore how technology is altering our understanding of sex.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>video games</kwd><kwd>censorship</kwd><kwd>sexuality</kwd><kwd>cinema</kwd><kwd>technology</kwd><kwd>posthumanism</kwd><kwd>new media</kwd><kwd>media hysteria</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Video games are growing up. Their complexity and visual sophistication continues to increase, as does the average age of players, most of whom are now in their 20s or 30s. So why, by and large, are games still so coy about sex? Of course, not all games avoid the subject; as Brathwaite’s <italic>Sex in Video Games</italic> (2007) demonstrates, video game sex assumes many forms and serves many purposes, from the tastefully discrete procreation process in <italic>Zoo Tycoon 2 </italic>(Blue Fang Games, 2004) to the bawdier content of Brathwaite’s own <italic>Playboy: The Mansion </italic>(Cyberlore Studios, 2005) and the forms of cybersex practiced in online virtual worlds such as <italic>Second Life</italic> (Linden Research Inc., 2003). Nevertheless, this article argues that sex continues to exert a powerful influence on video games as an absence or limit. Looking at various games that in some way <italic>avoid</italic> sex, it asks not only why sex so often goes missing but what its omission might be understood to mean in different contexts. This turns out to be a question with far-reaching implications; debates over gaming and sex are also debates over this new media form’s place in the cultural landscape, its relative “maturity” and its potentially harmful effects, and by treating sex’s absence from games as <italic>significant</italic>, this article seeks to illuminate not only these issues but also contemporary conceptions of technology and sexuality.</p><sec id="section1-1555412012466287"><title>Antiheroes and Arrested Development</title><p>I want to begin by discussing Grasshopper Manufacture’s third-person action game<italic> No More Heroes</italic> (Grasshopper Manufacture, 2007), which offers both a useful summary of and a tongue-in-cheek commentary upon the received wisdom regarding video games and sex. The game’s plot is deliberately perfunctory: players are cast as the lonely young <italic>anime </italic>obsessive Travis Touchdown, who has won a <italic>Star Wars</italic>-style “beam katana” in an online auction and decided to become an assassin. Travis must work his way up the United Assassins Association leaderboard by winning duels with those ranked above him. Originally released on the Nintendo Wii (though Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 ports were to follow), the game’s extravagant violence and inveterate smuttiness set it apart from the sort of family-friendly fare in which the Wii usually deals. Travis’ answerphone is perpetually clogged with messages from the local video shop, reminding him that <italic>How to Please a Woman in Bed 101</italic> or <italic>French Maid Cafe: Spilled Coffee</italic> is overdue, while his beam katana must be recharged by frenzied, pseudo-masturbatory pumping of the Wii’s motion controller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1555412012466287">Figure 1</xref>). Sex seems to matter more than life itself to Travis, whose only motivation for risking his neck is that the beautiful United Assassins Agency operative who scouted him promises to sleep with him if he can reach the top of the leaderboard. But while he is perpetually teased, provoked, and lead on, Travis invariably ends up disappointed.</p><fig id="fig1-1555412012466287" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>An example of <italic>No More Heroes</italic>’ gleefully immature attitude to sex: players must pump the controller suggestively to recharge Travis’ sword (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1555412012466287">Cybermario, 2011</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1555412012466287-fig1.tif"/></fig><p>Travis, then, embodies certain stereotypes about gaming, masculinity, and sex, evoking an immature, furtive, frustrated, and comically grotesque form of male sexuality. Other characters disparagingly call him an “otaku,” a Japanese slang term for someone with an obsessive, antisocial investment in <italic>manga</italic>, <italic>anime</italic>, or video games. Refunctioned, to some extent, as a badge of honor by American fans of Japanese pop culture, in Japan the term continues to connote seclusion, sexual dysfunction, and the potential for psychopathic violence. The game’s none-too-subtle framing of Travis’ sword (and, by extension, the player’s controller) as a phallic substitute invites us to read its gleefully over-the-top, unabashedly repetitious sword fights as a means of sublimating or relieving pent-up sexual urges. Sex-obsessed but celibate, Travis stands not merely for the stereotypical gamer but also for video games themselves, insofar as they are frequently understood as a quasi-onanistic means of displacing sexual energies, which are channeled into bouts of compensatory, repetitious, and futile activity. Littered with references to gaming history (from the classic consoles that Travis owns to a “dream sequence,” which takes the form of a primitive top-down shooting game), the game flaunts its awareness of what games have learned to do well—things like movement, combat, spectacle, and kinesthetic engagement. However, it also seems agonizingly aware that the medium has, by and large, failed to mature to the point of successfully incorporating sex. The female characters’ outfits may be skimpy, the game’s humor profane, but sex remains teasingly, embarrassingly out of <italic>No More Heroes</italic>’ reach.</p><p>If, like most console games developed for international release, <italic>No More Heroes</italic> goes no further in its treatment of sex than a smattering of titillation and innuendo, this is perhaps understandable, given the outbreaks of media hysteria that gamic portrayals of sex have been known to cause. One of the more prominent recent controversies concerned the Xbox 360 space opera <italic>Mass Effect</italic> (Bioware, 2007), which included a brief, non-explicit, noninteractive sex scene. The American media seized on the game after Republican blogger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555412012466287">McCullough (2008)</xref> penned an erroneous but impressively lurid description of how <italic>Mass Effect </italic>placed “virtual orgasmic rape” at 15-year-olds’ fingertips, inspiring Fox News to run a segment in which anchorwoman Martha MacCallum introduced <italic>Mass Effect</italic> as</p><disp-quote><p>A new role-playing video game that is leaving NOTHING to the imagination. . . in some parts of this, you’ll see full digital nudity. Imagine! And the ability for the players to engage in graphic sex and the person who’s playing the game gets to decide exactly what’s going to happen between the two people, if you know what I mean. . . Basically, Pandora’s box is open. I mean, kids have access to these things… (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1555412012466287">Game Politics, 2008</xref>)</p></disp-quote><p>While their application is particularly heavy-handed, MacCallum and McCullough both employ concepts and rhetorical strategies found in many other, more even-handed accounts of digital technologies—not least in that vague ideas of “the virtual” license them to envisage the worst rather than adhering to the facts. Entreated to “imagine” a representation that “leav[es] NOTHNG to the imagination,” solicited by an elliptical and allusive style that eschews indiscrete specifics because it can presume its addressee <italic>already to know</italic> (if you know what I mean), MacCallum’s statement produces its audience as tactful, (carnally) knowledgeable adults while, by way of the same strategies, invoking a child whose innocence would be threatened even by a <italic>description</italic> of the game’s content.</p><p>As Floyd argues, the fact that, despite demographic proof to the contrary, “a large segment of the population still perceives games as toys for children” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1555412012466287">2008</xref>) has played a significant role in discouraging game designers from exploring sexual subject matter. The appeal to the sanctity of childhood is, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1555412012466287">Edelman (2004</xref>) has forcefully argued, a favorite rhetorical move of social conservatives; the “kids” evoked by MacCallum are fellows of “the Child” Edelman discusses—“the Child who might witness lewd or inappropriately intimate behaviour; the Child who might find information about dangerous “lifestyles” on the Internet; the Child who might choose a provocative book from the shelves of the public library. . . ” (pp. 20–21). As Edelman notes, real citizens’ freedoms, including freedom of expression, are increasingly being curtailed in order to protect this fantasmic Child’s “freedom to develop undisturbed by encounters, or even by the threat of potential encounters, with an “otherness” of which its parents, its church, or the state do not approve” (p. 21).  Digital technology, with its capacity to reorder space–time—and thus to bring the alien and the adult into the Edenic space of the family home—is framed as prejudicial to this process of “develop[ing] undisturbed” by advocates of video game censorship.</p><p>Of course, earlier entertainment technologies, too, were considered capable of disrupting or accelerating what would otherwise be a proper, “natural” process of gestation or initiation: as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555412012466287">Barker (1984</xref>) notes of the idea of childhood invoked by the video nasties’ Thatcherite opponents, “childhood means not knowing things too early. . . to gain direct, unmediated knowledge of things before one’s time is to be damaged” (p. 31). But in the case of video games, the extra control afforded the viewer is thought to increase the potential for corruption or harm.  <italic>No More Heroes</italic> parodies such notions via a noninteractive scene in which an assassin named Jeane informs Travis that she cannot tell him her story as “it alone would jack up the age rating of this game even further.” Ostensibly a throwaway quip, it actually gestures at another important factor in games’ reticence regarding sex: the refusal of certain American retailers to stock games rated “Adults Only” (AO) by the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB). While there are other avenues for the sale of “adult games” (notably online distribution), this policy essentially operates as a form of de facto censorship; as ESRB president Patricia Vance notes publishers will usually make whatever concessions are necessary to secure games an “M” rather than an AO rating (and thus a spot on the shelves of such big-box stores; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1555412012466287">Brathwaite, 2007</xref>, pp. 155–156). In <italic>No More Heroes</italic>, Travis proposes an ingenious way around this impasse: Jeane will relate her story, but Travis will “fast forward” her narration, rendering her speech unintelligible to the player. The game effectively censors itself, as Travis—who is normally at the player’s command—takes control, speeding up the action to prevent players from “growing up too fast.”</p><p>Jeane’s story (a slowed, comprehensible version of which is available on Youtube) turns out to be a lurid tale of intergenerational incest: revealing that she is Travis’ half-sister, she goes on to describe her childhood experience of abuse at the hands of their father. Problematically, in the search for a revelation that would if not legitimize then at least seem adequate to the violence that its players have witnessed (and perpetrated), <italic>No More Heroes</italic> has recourse to the image of the violable child initiated prematurely into the realm of sexuality—the same image levied by the censors the game affects to scorn. Equally tellingly, the game’s designers opt not so much to defuse this image as to cancel it outright by way of a drolly reflexive gesture. Unable to represent “serious” sex, let alone tackle the even more serious subject of sexual abuse, the game nevertheless seems compelled to witness that inability in a fashion that both calls on players’ acquaintance with postmodern distanciation techniques and sneers at the idea of games’ being capable of corrupting their players. In other words—and again, much like the conservative critics it ostensibly ranks itself against—<italic>No More Heroes</italic> is content to capitalize on sexual knowledge it presumes its audience already to possess rather than risk addressing or representing sex directly.</p><p>MacCallum’s scaremongering and <italic>No More Heroes</italic>’ meta-humor, then, both participate in the economy of sexual “knowingness” that Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick has so ably dissected. As Sedgwick writes,</p><disp-quote><p>Our culture as a whole might be said to vibrate to a tense cord of “knowingness.”  Its epistemological economy depends, not on a reserve force of labour, but on a reserve force of information always maintained in readiness to be presumed upon—through jokey allusion, through the semiotic paraphernalia of “sophistication”—and yet poised in equal readiness to be disappeared at any moment, leaving a suppositionally virginal surface, unsullied by any admitted knowledge, whose purity may be understood to be violated and violated and violated yet again each time anew, by always the same information in fact possessed and exploited from the start. (Sedgwick &amp; Moon, 1984, p. 222)</p></disp-quote><p>Sedgwick’s concern is with how this mechanism facilitates homophobia, permitting us to take a “knowing” pleasure in camp performance without requiring us to acknowledge the rights—or even the existence—of homosexuals. Her argument is however equally suggestive of the way in which banning video games from dealing with sex “for the sake of the children” forces them to fall back on allusion, paraphrase, and innuendo, techniques better suited to the restatement of reductive, clichéd, and simplistic attitudes than the nuanced treatment of complex issues.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1555412012466287"><title>Perversity in Play</title><p>While <italic>No More Heroes</italic> might be forgiven—and even applauded—for deriding the alarmist accounts of gaming and sex that appear in the mainstream media, we should not be too dismissive of such accounts. For they exemplify another common and important misconception regarding video games, one that has to be discussed in order to arrive at an understanding of another reason why games struggle with sex. The implication in reports like McCullough’s and MacCallum’s is that games are too accommodating of the user’s desires, permitting or even encouraging the indulgence of “perverse” whims—sadism, voyeurism, objectification, and so on. This vision is, in fact, not so far from the ideal of some makers and advocates of erotic games; Brad Abram, the president of Xstream3D Multimedia Inc., developers of the “sex simulation game” <italic>Virtually Jenna</italic> (2007), has stated that his goal is “to develop a simulation system where our customer’s needs are fulfilled 100%. Any sexual wish should come true” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1555412012466287">Brathwaite, 2007</xref>, pp. 297, 298). Here, as is so often the case, the “sensationalist rhetoric” used by would-be censors finds a parallel in the hyperbolic marketing pitches of video game developers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21a-1555412012466287">Krzywinska, 2012</xref>, p. 144). Ironically however, both miss something fundamental about video games.  For what is lost in this vision of games pandering to their users’ whims, fantasies, and fetishes is precisely the <italic>perversity</italic> that renders games pleasurable in the first place. Video games are unique in the field of consumer software in that they intentionally <italic>resist</italic> their users, establishing barriers between the operator and their goal. Games deal in delayed gratification: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1555412012466287">Dovey and Kennedy (2006</xref>) observe that, at least “in the initial stages of gameplay,” it is often as if hardware and software exert “a malign force in direct antagonistic conflict with your own pleasure” (p. 110). By contrast, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1555412012466287">Brathwaite (2007</xref>) notes, “often a hard-core [sex] “game” is only a game in the most basic sense of the word” (p. 7), so concerned are such games with fulfilling the user’s desires.</p><p>“Games” based around the realization of sexual fantasies, then, face the problem that the player cannot arrange everything according to their wishes without compromising the element of challenge and removing any incentive to improve—the very factors that render a game a game. Indeed, in his meditation on the perversity or “paradoxicality” of games (which, while concerned with nondigital games, is highly relevant to computer games) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1555412012466287">Suits (1978</xref>) compares games to sex on the basis that both play and sex may be understood as activities in which “trying and achieving may be sought as ends in themselves” (p. 80). In each case, taking the scenic route—or obeying “the principle of prolongation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1555412012466287">Suits, 1978</xref>, p. 131)—tends to be more pleasurable than using the most efficient means of attaining one’s ends.  As Suits observes, a literal perversity (in the sense of misdirection or turning away from) is built into many games: the knight in a chess game <italic>cannot</italic> take a diagonal route, no matter how much more efficient it may be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1555412012466287">Suits, 1978</xref>, p. 54). If there is, as such, a quantum of erotic excitement to be had from playing video games, it is less a consequence of what they permit us to do than of their attempts to baulk, baffle, or obstruct us.</p><p>Suits’ meditations on the perversity of games can help us to gain critical purchase on Konami’s <italic>Metal Gear Solid</italic> series, and specifically on the fact that these games elicit a quasi-erotic pleasure from their players even though sex is, again, naggingly absent from their diegesis. Sex’s omission is especially glaring, given the exhaustive catalogue of <italic>a</italic>sexual forms of reproduction that the series’ military sci-fi plots represent: cloning, nanotechnology, prosthetics, cybernetics, and Virtual Reality are, at various points in the <italic>Metal Gear</italic> timeline, explored as possible means of producing a “super soldier” who would both hark back to a glorious past and herald a glorious future. In each title, players are positioned as attempting to usurp or emulate an illustrious forebear, whether brother, clone, predecessor, or hierarchical superior. This structure is often reflexively foregrounded, most notably in <italic>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</italic> (Kojima Productions, 2001). The sequel to a multimillion-selling PlayStation title, the game was hyped prior to its release as a “killer app” for the recently released PlayStation 2. Fans were outraged however when it transpired that after a prologue starring Snake, the much-loved hero of the first <italic>Metal Gear Solid </italic>(Kojima Productions, 1998), they were required to progress through the game’s remainder as Raiden, a star-struck rookie. As the game’s plot unfolds it emerges that Raiden has been ordered to accomplish a series of tasks analogous to those Snake had performed in the first game, with the intention of molding him into a soldier of a similar caliber. Thus, having learned to be the “legendary” Snake (himself a clone) in <italic>Metal Gear Solid</italic>, players had to learn to be someone learning to be Snake in <italic>Metal Gear Solid 2</italic>. Inevitably, the plan fails, enabling the disillusioned Raiden to become “his own man”—though even this twist echoes Snake’s trajectory in the prior game.</p><p>Suspecting (correctly) that director Hideo Kojima had conspired to “deceive” them, and faced with the implication that their own identities were being tagged as somehow vicarious, derivative, or failed, many fans responded to Raiden with marked animosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555412012466287">Keighley, 2001</xref>). With his smooth face and long blonde hair, Raiden was portrayed as more effeminate than the grizzled, stubbly Snake, and fans’ complaints repeatedly took the form of homophobic slurs, which drew on the tradition of associating queer sexualities with impersonation, repetition, sterility, and inauthenticity. These ignored the fact that the game had also compromised the “real” hero Snake’s claims to heroic, heterosexual masculinity by suggesting that, having “gotten the girl” at the end of the first game, he has returned to the battlefield because he is more comfortable following commands (a general’s orders, a player’s joypad inputs) than choosing for himself. Sex, understood as at once natural, properly “adult” and productive of something <italic>new</italic>, is implicitly beyond Snake, who frequently demonstrates a quasi-machinic lack of purpose, self-awareness, or autonomy. Even in <italic>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</italic> (Kojima Productions, 2004), which concludes with a sex scene (albeit a noninteractive one quickly curtailed with an ellipsis), eroticism is nothing more than a continuation of war by other means: Snake (who it should be noted, in the interests both of accuracy and of highlighting the series’ obsession with technological reproduction, is actually the character from whom the Snake who stars in <italic>MGS1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> will be cloned) awakens to find that the improbably buxom double-agent Eva has relieved him of the microfilm players have spent the game trying to secure. Carnality proves even more emasculating than celibacy.</p><p>We might say then that <italic>Metal Gear</italic>’s heroes fail at sex. This is perhaps because they also fails at <italic>failure</italic>: while he inevitably suffers setbacks and reverses en route, Snake always saves the day (presuming, of course, that the player is sufficiently motivated and competent to finish the game), as do his mentees, clones, and so on. This might make him a good action hero, but it renders him a somewhat subpar human being. And yet as <italic>games</italic>, the <italic>Metal Gear Solid</italic> titles are enjoyable because they perpetually tease the player with the threat of failure. The first <italic>Metal Gear Solid</italic> was instrumental in popularizing a new form of gamic pleasure seeking, contributing enormously to the development of the “stealth action” game, a genre concerned with sneaking, subterfuge, and tense cat-and-mouse pursuit. Where enemies in earlier action games tended either to charge at the player or stoically await their approach, <italic>Metal Gear Solid </italic>boasted adversaries who would track footprints, respond to noises, and become distracted by girlie magazines left in their sightline. Suits’ analogy between gameplay and sex seems particularly apt in the case of these texts, which solicit ingenious and elaborate play strategies, encouraging players to cultivate a pleasure in dalliance and indirection, in taking unnecessary chances.</p><p>Indeed, in arguing that “an erotic dimension” (2012, p. 156) can be found even in titles that feature no explicitly sexual content, Krzywinska cites <italic>Assassin’s Creed </italic>(Ubisoft Montreal, 2007), a game comfortable enough with its debt to <italic>Metal Gear Solid</italic> that for April Fool’s Day 2008 the series’ developers collaborated on a video showing Snake dressed as <italic>Assassin’s Creed</italic>’s hero Altair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1555412012466287">Yoon, 2008</xref>). For her, <italic>Assassin’s Creed</italic> exemplifies game designers’ use of an array of “ludo-poetic devices to please, tease and excite the player” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21a-1555412012466287">Krzywinska, 2012</xref>, p. 154). Arguing for the necessity of attending to what, evoking Susan Sontag, she calls the “erotics of play” (Krzywinska, 2012, p. 154), Krzywinska suggests that if sex seems to be absent from many games then perhaps this is because of our failure to register its “<italic>mis</italic>appearance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21a-1555412012466287">Krzywinska, 2012</xref>, emphasis added) in ostensibly nonsexual forms. While we may not see any nude bodies in <italic>Assassin’s Creed</italic>, the game establishes an “erotic economy” based around “kinetic power,” visual spectacle and the achievement of “violent yet artful penetration” with a distinctly phallic weapon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21a-1555412012466287">Krzywinska, 2012</xref>, p. 156). Sex “misappears” in the guise of traversal and combat, in the thrilling prospect of achieving the perfect “hit.”</p><p>Krzywinska’s account illuminates the paradox that <italic>Metal Gear Solid </italic>is sexiest when least concerned with sex. It also offers a means to approach those games that attempt to integrate the pleasures of play and the pleasures of the flesh by establishing a correlation between success and sexualized spectacle. The fighting game <italic>Dead or Alive</italic> (Tecmo/Team Ninja, 1996) and its sequels exemplify this approach: female characters perform salacious celebratory animations when they/you win a fight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1555412012466287">Figure 2</xref>), and, as in many games, repeated victories allow players to “unlock” new and more revealing outfits for them. Far from making themselves unconditionally available to the player, these sexualized gamic bodies play hard to get, with users earning the freedom to look that, in other media, is presumed and (within certain constraints) afforded. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1555412012466287">Brathwaite (2007</xref>) puts it, sex (or at least “sexiness”) functions as a “reward” (p. 3).</p><fig id="fig2-1555412012466287" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>A “sexy” win animation from <italic>Dead or Alive 2</italic>, exemplifying the use of sexualized spectacle as a reward (Tecmo/Team Ninja, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1555412012466287">Consolemad, n.d</xref>.).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1555412012466287-fig2.tif"/></fig><p>Even here though the pleasure has less to do with the scenes and bodies represented (which are often visually crude), then it does their having been “won” from the game against the odds. If, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1555412012466287">Graham (1995</xref>) has suggested,  </p><disp-quote><p>[a] pleasure in being able to crack codes could perhaps explain the willingness of people to ‘explore the outer reaches’ of the Internet for hours on end in order to track down very poor quality pornographic images which are so barely distinguishable (available in much more detail in any magazine) as to have surely <italic>only symbolic sexual value</italic> (p. 79, emphasis added)</p></disp-quote><p>then we should arguably understand the display of sexualized bodies in video games in the same way, seeing it less as a motivation in itself than as a particular way of signifying or acknowledging players’ achievements.</p><p>If this is the case then rather than seeing play as a means of venting or sublimating sexual urges we might instead view sexual imagery as a way of figuring or amplifying certain pleasures that are <italic>already</italic> a part of the gameplay experience. In insisting that the erotic need not be coextensive with the sexual, Krzywinska offers a useful way past overly literal takes on sex in gaming, a mode of reading attentive not merely to manifest visual content but also to rhythm and kinaesthetics, connotations and contradictions. The danger is that such an approach licenses us to find sex everywhere and that the gesture of revealing the presence of the erotic where we would least have expected it becomes rote. This is why, rather than simply conclude that sex was actually “there all along” just below the surface, it is important to attend (as Krzywinska does) to the nature or implications of sex’s “misappearance” in particular contexts and to the specific ways in which the sexual is dissembled, allegorized, evoked, or sublimated. It is also important to remember that the process may sometimes work, as it were, in the opposite direction; that scenes that might seem to be “about” sex might also or actually serve another purpose. Games’ sexualized representations of women, for example, might be a way of legitimizing other pleasures and processes, of framing the thrills provided by play (which could otherwise be seen as a suspiciously solitary, disembodied, or even homoerotic activity) as “properly” heterosexual and manly. (Incidentally I am by no means suggesting that we should as such ignore or forgive the blatant sexualization of female characters in such games). This is where Suits’ approach holds potential for thinking about the portrayal of sex in games; framing the pleasure of play and the pleasure of sex as <italic>analogous </italic>(rather than insisting on play’s being a way of sublimating or displacing energies that are “really” sexual), he suggests how particular kinds of gamic thrills and frustrations can become symbols or similes for aspects of our sexual experience.</p></sec><sec id="section3-1555412012466287"><title>Mechanical Failure, Visual Fixation</title><p>Krzywinska’s analysis of the erotics of <italic>Assassin’s Creed</italic> also suggests that, quite apart from sensationalistic media reporting, technological limitations, juvenility, or repression, video game sex represents a design problem. The business of the boudoir is difficult to translate into a medium that traditionally deals in the navigation of large spaces through the use of a limited repertoire of “moves” with distinct products and purposes. As Steve <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555412012466287">Gaynor (2010</xref>) points out “the easiest thing to do in a video game is to draw a line between the player and something else and then take hit points off of it.” Gunplay is, as such, a good fit. Coitus however is harder to model satisfactorily, and the difficulty of translating sex into a set of rewarding game mechanics (rather than using its depiction as a reward for mastering those mechanics) may play a bigger part than is sometimes supposed in preventing games from addressing sex.</p><p>This much is suggested by the fact that while <italic>Fable II</italic> (Lionhead, 2008) makes it possible for characters to have sex, it almost totally disregards the act itself, which is dealt with via a fade to black and a few racy speech samples. Sex is, in a sense, both present <italic>and</italic> absent in <italic>Fable II</italic>, with the game focusing on what happens before and after the fact. Courtship involves dressing and behaving in accordance with a prospective partner’s taste, presenting them with gifts, taking them on trips and deploying the game’s grammar of gestures to boost their esteem and desire for the player character. Then, once players have coaxed another character into bed, they have the choice of foregoing contraceptives (these can be found or bought around the gameworld), a decision that can result in their avatar conceiving a child or contracting a sexually transmitted disease. The game understands that sex is most <italic>gamically</italic> compelling when it requires strategy and entails consequences, and renders it a matter of planning and problem solving rather than one of acting out our fantasies on quiescent digital bodies.</p><p>While <italic>Fable II</italic> offers a wide array of possible sexual encounters (among them extra/marital sex, homosexual sex, protected or unprotected sex, sex with multiple partners and sex with prostitutes) these are not simply there to be selected from a menu according to the player’s caprice; rather the player has to work to bring them about. We may be uncomfortable with the way that this makes sex a matter of deploying optimally tailored chat-up strategies and buying affection—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1555412012466287">Raymond (2009)</xref>, who has blogged about “how games perpetuate the commodity model of sex,” is troubled by how “deeply invested” in that model the game remains. But, as Raymond also acknowledges, <italic>Fable II</italic> is in other respects, fairly progressive, “giving each NPC a sexuality, personality, and preferences” rather than making them subject to the player’s desires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1555412012466287">Raymond, 2009</xref>). More than this, the game makes efforts toward locating sex within a broader socioeconomic context, pointing the way toward simulations that would take into account how money, gossip, social mobility, cultural values, and divisions of public and private space modulate currents of sexual attraction. If the sexual act itself is absent from <italic>Fable II</italic>, then the game at least hints at how other, all-too-often ignored aspects of sex may be made visible in games.</p><p>Devoting our attention to video games’ visual depictions of sex may, then, be misguided. Games can be erotic without depicting sex, and sex can shape gameworlds and motivate players even when the audiences are not allowed into the bedroom. And yet games’ increasing graphical sophistication is continually cited in debates over the medium’s maturity and controversies concerning its potential to corrupt (McCullough [2008] gives this trope a strange twist by stating, rather confusingly, that <italic>Mass Effect</italic> enables players enables players “to engage in the most realistic sex acts ever conceived)”. In part this is the fault of video games’ programmers and publishers, who have, by and large, prioritized the pursuit of photorealistic visuals over other aspects of design and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1555412012466287">Bogost, 2006</xref>, pp. 63–64). Increases in graphical detail, besides being easy to communicate in advertising, endorse a narrative whereby games are evolving in the direction of “real life” and of the (now) culturally validated form of cinema, and the video game industry’s longstanding inferiority complex with regard to the big screen has only been exacerbated by the fact that video games seem to garner the most widespread praise when aping “classic” Hollywood formats—as Rockstar Games has done with the elegiac cowboy epic <italic>Red Dead Redemption</italic> (2010) and the Elmore Leonard-esque <italic>L.A. Noire</italic> (Team Bondi and Rockstar, 2011). Symptomatically, the latter has been praised for featuring “arguably the most lifelike [characters] ever seen in a video game” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1555412012466287">Fritz, 2011</xref>).</p><p>This issue is highlighted by a recent article in which, taking <italic>L.A. Noire </italic>as her point of departure, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1555412012466287">Graham (2011)</xref> asks “[a]re video games now more sophisticated than cinema?” Perhaps predictably, her answer turns out to be ‘no,’ but Graham’s methods of reaching this conclusion are interesting nonetheless. For while there are quantitative metrics by which games <italic>could</italic> be said to be more “sophisticated” than films (how hardware-intensive it is to run a game by comparison with showing a film, say, or how many possible narrative outcomes can be realized in a game playthrough as opposed to a film screening), Graham focuses on the qualitative, citing the nebulous but undeniable sexual chemistry of Bogey and Bacall in <italic>The Big Sleep</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555412012466287">Hawks and Warner, 1946</xref>) as evidence of cinema’s greater subtlety and sophistication. In framing <italic>The Big Sleep</italic> as a smoking gun, proof both of video games’ upstart inauthenticity and their coldly digital <italic>sexlessness</italic>, Graham makes use of two opposing notions of the “gratuitous.” On one hand, the film is made to embody an era before the “excessive” violence and carnality of the modern mediasphere to which games belong—denigrated, in this case, less on account of moralizing fears of corruption than an aesthetic distaste for all that is crass, spectacular, and inordinate. On the other hand, video games are felt to <italic>lack</italic> the subtle, supplementary, gratuitous pleasures that cinema affords, those felicities and haecceities that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1555412012466287">Barthes (1977)</xref> terms “obtuse” (p. 65) and which are made, here, to function as positive proofs that cinema is “better.”</p><p>Leaving aside the irony of her criticizing games for being crassly “goal oriented” even as she holds up cinema as a benchmark to be surpassed (not to mention her deriding their “rejection of ambiguity” while working to yoke two very different media into an agonistic opposition; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1555412012466287">Graham, 2011</xref>), Graham’s argument is hard to refute; <italic>The Big Sleep</italic>’s registration of the play of gesture and vocal inflexion, its status as an indexical record of the actions of real stars’ real, desiring bodies, does indeed lend the film a frisson no game could match. Interactive in-game sex is hamstrung by the limits of the control interface, which render avatar behavior a matter of a palette, however extensive, of predetermined actions (though teledildonics enthusiasts like Kyle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555412012466287">Machulis (2010)</xref> are enthusiastic about the cybersexual potentials that Microsoft’s Kinect hardware, designed for gesture-controlled play, may hold), while even noninteractive portrayals of sex come up against the artificiality of video game bodies. As Brad Abrams concedes, even with advances in graphical technology, rendering and animating avatar sex remains highly problematic, necessitating a degree of suspension of disbelief from sex-game consumers (Brathwaite, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1555412012466287">2007</xref>, p. 301). Of course, game designers have developed numerous techniques for tempering this sterility and incorporating “more” of the real world (and of real bodies) into gameworlds, from photographic texture mapping to performance capture techniques—of which <italic>L.A. Noire</italic>’s motion scan facial animation system is among the most advanced. Nevertheless, these problems remain and may even have been exacerbated by these “advances”—at least if we follow Masahiro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1555412012466287">Mori’s (1970)</xref> “uncanny valley” thesis, which would suggest discrepancies and errors become all the more jarring the closer to counterfeiting a real body a representation gets.</p><p>However, latent in Graham’s verdict on <italic>L.A. Noire</italic> is the suggestion of an alternative approach, one based on a trick that video games <italic>can</italic> learn from film—and specifically from Hollywood film circa <italic>The Big Sleep</italic>. As countless film scholars have pointed out, the introduction of the Motion Picture Production Code (or Hays Code) in 1930 necessitated the development of methods of working within—or playing with—strictures regarding what can be shown. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1555412012466287">Jacobs (2000)</xref> puts it, film makers became adept at “figur[ing]” (p. 97) acts and themes they could no longer approach directly, and especially at the oblique treatment of sex. While stories of actors having to keep one foot on the floor in bedroom scenes or of the required margins between onscreen spouses’ separate beds may be apocryphal, they nevertheless point to the comic and erotic energies that can be generated through the deft negotiation of prohibitions, suggesting how gamic portrayals of sexuality could tend toward something at once more gamelike (based around rules and affordances) and less troublingly uncanny than noninteractive portrayals of frotting polygonal mannequins. Given games’ status as interactive (or, as Moulthrop prefers, “configurative”, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1555412012466287">2004</xref>, p. 57) texts, works that involve the audience in the constitution of the onscreen spectacle, this play need not be, as it was in Hollywood, between the producers and the censors but could actually constitute part of gameplay. To phrase it in Peirce’s terms, while it seems that the prevailing, ocularcentric tendency among designers would have it that games’ iconic representations merely need to move further in the direction of film’s indexical ones, it may be the case that video game sex is better suited to symbolic modes of signification (Atkin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1555412012466287">2010</xref>). Then, rather than the strange disconnect between the sexiness of <italic>Metal Gear Solid</italic>’s mechanics and the celibacy of its characters, or the practice of signifying gamic success with literal-minded and often sexist displays of virtual flesh, designers might be able to concentrate on creating mechanics capable both of providing a satisfying play experience and of conveying, allegorizing, or commenting upon the nature of characters’ sexual relationships. Atlus’ <italic>Catherine</italic> (2012), in which the hero’s sexual anxieties are conveyed through fiendish block puzzles, arguably constitutes a move in this direction.</p></sec><sec id="section4-1555412012466287"><title>Beyond Sex?</title><p>I have, then, identified a number of factors to which video games’ apparent difficulties with sex can be attributed. Not least among these is the dilemma whereby, by virtue of their continuing association with children, games risk being seen as corrupting to younger players if they approach “adult” topics but seem juvenile, sterile, and lacking in sexual <italic>savoir faire</italic> if they do not. There is also the fact that, by contrast with both conservatives’ fears and publishers’ hyperbole, games are a medium devoted to frustrating their players at least as much as they are a means of virtually realizing fantasies. Connected to this point is the fact that sex represents a technical challenge for games designers. Not only do the limitations of graphics processors and interface hardware constrain them but so does the problem of devising systems and mechanics through which sex could be modeled. This is not least because games—widely considered a highly spatial medium (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20a-1555412012466287">Jenkins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1555412012466287">Nitsche, 2008</xref>)—have traditionally dealt in the conquest of wide-open expanses rather than the intimate zones of the body and the bedroom. These issues might not be such a problem were it not for another factor: the privileging of “realistic” (which is often to say <italic>cinematic</italic>) visual styles and narrative forms, which has arguably deterred designers from finding characteristically <italic>gamic</italic> ways of treating sex. That said, the absence of sex might equally be a result of an unwillingness to frame <italic>as</italic> sexual gameplay styles that, for Krzywinska at least, are plainly “erotic.” In any case, this complex of interacting pressures and problems continues to influence the production and reception of video games to a significant degree. Indeed, if games’ sexlessness may be read as a sign of designers’ still-nascent command of their medium’s own expressive potential, we might equally say that games are <italic>already </italic>proving uniquely apt records of the confused attitudes to sex and maturity, technology and progress that obtain in contemporary culture.</p><p>Of course, it need hardly be said that “sex” is a term of formidable semantic density. In the examples above it has been variously understood as transaction or reward, as illicit or healthy, as motivator and guarantor of identity, and as source of pleasure and means of procreation. I have mostly been concerned here with sex as an aspect of human interpersonal relations, as a catalyst for desire and jealousy and an engine of human drama. In closing I would like however to return to one of the ways of understanding sex touched upon in my reading of <italic>Metal Gear Solid</italic>, wherein sex is repeatedly held up as the “natural” counterpoint to technological methods of generation and replication. As I argued, in that series the uncannily infallible hero is too reliable, too obedient to be truly sexy. Indeed, in many ways the <italic>Metal Gear Solid </italic>games frame the human capacity for failure as our cardinal characteristic and saving grace; try as we hubristically might to perfectly recreate the perfect soldier, errors, and contingencies redemptively intervene, producing difference where we had thought to generate similarity. Reproduction triumphs over replication, and for all the comic hay made with Raiden’s effeminacy it may be in their recapitulation of this trajectory that the games flirt most troublingly with homophobia—at least if we follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1555412012466287">Edelman (2004</xref>) in detecting a heterosexist component to contemporary science’s “celebrat[ion of] the triumph of sexed reproduction over genetic duplication,” its perpetually retold “teleological narrative” of delivery from perpetual sameness into generative individuality (p. 62).</p><p><italic>Metal Gear Solid</italic>, with its apparently celibate “posthuman” cast of cyborgs, clones, and simulacra, is far from the only video game series to have dwelt on these themes, and in many games sex’s absence primarily means the loss of its privilege as point of origin and vector for genetic transmission. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1555412012466287">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1555412012466287">4</xref> show the “dragon morphing” system from <italic>Panzer Dragoon Saga</italic> (Team Andromeda, 1998), a roleplaying game in which the hero Edge and his trusty winged steed take to the skies to save a cloned girl. In many ways, the game conforms to the model of the roleplaying game as “statistical bildungsroman” (Wardrip-Fruin, 2009, p. 62), whereby players battle to earn points that are then invested in developing their avatar’s skills. But even as the dragon “evolves” in a linear, upward progression, becoming faster and stronger, its body also remains flexible. Players can adapt their dragon to the current situation by moving a cursor around a disc, each quadrant of which represents a particular attribute—attack, defense, spirituality, and agility. As the cursor changes position, so the dragon’s body shifts: bear toward defense and it becomes squat and rhinoceros-like (fig. iii); prioritize agility and its body attenuates and projects an aerodynamic horn (fig. iv).</p><fig id="fig3-1555412012466287" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><italic>Panzer Dragoon Saga</italic>’s dragon morphing screen.

To trace a line from any one point of the disc to any other is to posit a phylogenetic progression, to chart a “theoretical trajectory” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1555412012466287">Dawkins, 1986</xref>). Only where each animal in Dawkins’ posited space is contiguous with “its ancestors, its descendants and its cousins”, <italic>Saga</italic>’s various forms are meant to belong to one exceptionally plastic organism, which retains the power to revert to “earlier” forms—or else to transform into something different altogether. In other words, both sex and time have been taken out of the equation here, and the gradual process of mutation, inheritance, and adaptation across generations contracts to a timescale of near-instantaneity and the space of a single body. We might say that the system replaces the family tree—directional and time-bound—with a sort family rhizome: a spatial totality amenable to random access rather than branching passage.</p><p>This structure expresses a fantasy of spatializing (and so mastering) time, a fantasy also manifest in something as simple as the “sliders” used to create character models in <italic>Mass Effect 2 </italic>(Bioware, 2010) or<italic> Demon’s Souls</italic> (From Software, 2009): here moving a marker left or right enables players not merely to alter the location of a nasal bridge or the width of a mouth but also to change their avatar’s “age,” to reverse or arrest time’s passage (or, at any rate, to control the apparent depth of facial wrinkles). If technology enables these fantasies of immortality, autogenesis, and parthenogenesis at the level of the games’ code, it often does so within their plots too: in the PlayStation 3 version of <italic>Mass Effect 2</italic> for example the avatar customization sequence is framed as a space-age cloning operation aimed at “reconstructing” the body of the hero. In the <italic>Assassin’s Creed</italic> series’ fiction meanwhile, time travel is facilitated by a combination—or rather a <italic>conflation</italic>—of electronic code and genetics: by jacking into a computer the protagonist is able to relive his ancestors’ memories, notionally encrypted within his body in a version of Hans Moravec’s “propos[al] that human identity is essentially an informational pattern rather than an embodied enaction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1555412012466287">Hayles, 2007</xref>, p. xii), and hence (theoretically) capable of being “uploaded” to a computer. Players “jump” to different points in <italic>Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood</italic>’s (Ubisoft Montreal, 2010) diegetic space–time via a menu that represents them as coordinates on a computer-modeled DNA strand, a conceit that condenses the spatialization of time and the digitization of “life”—ideas often twinned in contemporary science fiction.</p><p>In these instances, video games’ representation of sexless modes of reproduction and evolution frame technology as benign, capable of reordering space, time, and matter, of granting us flexibility, agency, and exemption from entropy. Such fantasies are not <italic>too</italic> far from the altogether more fascinating prophecies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1555412012466287">Haraway (1991</xref>), with her famous vision of a word where technology enables sex to be “uncoupled from organic reproduction” and bodies from traditional conceptions of gender and even species, creating the potential for new and potentially “very fruitful couplings” (p. 150). Could games, as a new and indisputably “cyborgian” medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1555412012466287">Lahti, 2003</xref>, p.158) herald or help us imagine this liberatory era of “cyborg sex” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1555412012466287">Haraway, 1991</xref>, p. 150)?  While <italic>Metal Gear Solid</italic> seems to suggest as much it also expresses horror at the prospective elision of the fleshly and filial, conjuring Norbert Wiener’s pessimistic visions of a machinic order of “sexless sex” that sees humans reduced to constituent elements of a “connective membrane[,] with no desires and no ability to derive pleasure from them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1555412012466287">Hayles, 2007</xref>, p. 111). In either case, such games suggest another, perhaps more intriguing reason why video games shun sex: as a digital medium, games themselves operate not according to a logic of reproduction but one of replication, iteration, and modulation. Video games remind us of the fundamental otherness of digital technologies even as they ask us to engage with and enjoy those technologies—and it is this that suggests they may be capable of offering new perspectives on what “sex” means today. Rather than ask why games seem so little interested in the lusts, love triangles and <italic>grandes passions</italic> that have sustained literature and film, we might do better to explore this possibility.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn2-1555412012466287"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn3-1555412012466287"><label>Funding</label><p>The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-1555412012466287"><citation citation-type="web"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Atkin</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2010</year>). <article-title>Peirce’s theory of signs</article-title>.
