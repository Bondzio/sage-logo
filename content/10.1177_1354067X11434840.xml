<sec id="sec1-1354067X11434840"><title><italic>Children’s understanding of death, from biological to religious conceptions</italic>, edited by Victoria Talwar, Paul Harris and Michael Schleifer. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2011. 202 pages. ISBN 978-0 521-19459-4</title>
<p><bold>Reviewed by:</bold> Olga V Lehmann, <italic>La Sabana Unversity – Fundación Universitaria de Ciencias de la Salud (FUCS), Colombia</italic></p>
<p>As Paul Bloom points out in the book shaft, it is because death is an immanent taboo that its study is as fascinating as difficult. It is not our competence to determine what is before or after birth, so that those biological passages are precisely defined as Existence Transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354067X11434840">De Vries, 1981</xref>). What is more incumbent upon us to understand, is: how does death affect lifespan? and thus, the scenario is outside laboratories and libraries. From Spain to Madagascar, from the United States to Japan, theoretical and empirical issues are interwoven by the authors in order to explain the origins of our yet limited comprehension of finitude. In this way, the authors illustrate pretty well the membranes of cultural-developmental psychology with other sciences, as well as some intuitions of transcendence when we are beholders of science boundaries.</p>
<p>The cognitive and emotional development of children is primarily focused on the emergence of biological and spiritual explanations of death. Rita Astuti (London School of Economics, chapter 1) confronts Vezo children’s understanding of death with the points of view of adults in this Madagascar, and she suggests that while children create their own understanding of afterlife, they should be taught about their ancestors. Following the same line of ideas, Paul Harris (Harvard University, chapter 2) analyzes some findings about children in Spain and Madagascar in order to explore convergent perspectives of dualism: <italic>physical bodies/social beings</italic>, and <italic>biological-mental</italic> conceptions of death, as well as the role of cultural learning on them. Next, Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi (University of Haifa, chapter 3) includes examples such as funerals, the media, and the biomedical technology, so that he positions death within modernity and its implications for related practices, beliefs and, and conceptions.</p>
<p>At the same time, Margaret M. Mahon (George Mason University, chapter 4) delves into the participation of children in both death-related processes: dying and surviving the death of someone beloved. Different reactions involving emotions, information, communication, and decision-making are precisely taken into account so that clues for action are well mentioned. Likewise, Victoria Talwar (McGill University, chapter 5) introduces death talks with children in order to encourage expression of feelings and the development of conceptions about death and afterlife. Her suggestions are upheld on considerations about training for psychologists or educators, their personal background and that one of children. But, not so far from these operative guidelines, Miriam McCormick (University of Richmond, chapter 6) involves her philosophical and moral dissertation into the control—and freedom—of one’s beliefs. How responsible is one about them? In the case of death, there is not enough evidence that supports our beliefs and so, she questions adults’ teaching to children about reflection and choices concerning to death and thus, to life itself.</p>
<p>Then, and also with philosophical arguments, Michael Schleifer (Université du Québec á Montréal, chapter 7) recovers William James’ arguments of materialism and its boundaries in order to stand that religion and science do not contradict themselves in children’s development, so that brain as well as mental functions are yet far from a complete comprehension of wills and consciousness. And at last but not at least, Ray Madoff (Boston College Law School, chapter 8) calls the readers to be aware of some curious issues of legal instances about death, and, thus, about our life conceptions. Organ transplants, defamation, death definitions, wills, and inheritance are some of the topics analyzed by the author, and some comparisons are made between the United States of America, Italy, and Japan in order to illustrate their incidence in children’s psychosocial development—and beyond.</p>
<p>Altogether, with a complex exposure of the phenomena, smart critics of their own and other’s findings, as well as continuative cohesion between chapters, the authors achieve an integrative quality of arguments that, even starting from developmental psychology, anthropology, philosophy, pediatrics or laws could fit into widen applications. Indeed, this book should be read by believers and atheists, theorists, and practitioners of any field.</p>
<p>Not the topic, but the findings of the book are innovative. The paths dug out from the rock are awaiting more investigations to be done in order to uncover myths adults still have with their own conceptions of death, and thus with their comprehension of children’s understanding. Death is not something to be compiled in a book, but this one promises to enlighten current—cultural—research.</p>
