<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>The effect of war on suicide rates has been widely investigated since it was first discussed by Emile Durkheim<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213486218">1</xref></sup> more than a century ago. Great national wars such as world wars, referred to as ‘popular wars’, are considered to increase social integration, patriotism and a sense of purpose among citizens, resulting in fewer suicides, while ‘unpopular wars’, such as civil wars, are believed to cause despair, social disintegration and resignation to fate, with a resulting increase in suicides during the war.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213486218">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Suicide and war have both taken their toll on Sri Lanka in the last two decades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213486218">2</xref></sup> Sri Lanka had the highest suicide rate in the world in 1995 and it still remains high despite a gradual decline. Sri Lanka endured 26 years of civil war between 1983 and 2009, with an estimated 80,000–100,000 people killed during its course.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213486218">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Somasundaram and Rajadurai<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213486218">4</xref></sup> studied the effect of war from 1980 to 1989 on suicide rates in a northern city of Sri Lanka where fighting was heaviest, and found a marked drop during the war, particularly among males. Gunnel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213486218">5</xref></sup> studied country-wide available data from 1975–2005 and found no relationship between suicide rates and periods of civil war.</p>
<p>We compared suicide rates, methods and demographics in Sri Lanka during the last 2 years of civil war and in the subsequent 2 years of post-war period. Suicide data was obtained from the Sri Lanka Police Department. Sri Lanka is divided into 42 police divisions. Of these, three divisions that did not have records for this period, and that accounted for only 1% of the population, were excluded.</p>
<p>There was a significant reduction in completed suicide [<italic>n</italic>=7854; rate (per 100,000 population)=19.1] in the post war period when compared with the period during the war (<italic>n</italic>=8336; rate=20.7). The total suicide rate reduction was 8% (95%CI: 5–11%, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). This reduction was accounted for by the 10% (95%CI: 7–13%, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) reduction in male suicide rates. Among women, the suicide rate was not significantly different (95%CI: 6–17%, <italic>p</italic>=0.97) in the two periods.</p>
<p>The risk of suicide in men increased with age both during and after the war by almost 3% for each additional year of age. Overall, the gender ratio (male: female) in suicide rates changed from a female predominance (5.2:5.9; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) in the 0–19 year age group to 4:1 in the 30–39 year group and 8:1 (58.9:7.7, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) in the 50–59 year group. These gender differences remained similar in the ‘war’ and ‘post-war’ periods. During the 4-year study period, ingestion of agrochemicals accounted for nearly half of the deaths (48%), followed by hanging (32%). No differences were noted during the war and post-war periods in methods used, including use of firearms.</p>
<p>The act of suicide is the culmination and combination of multiple contributory factors. These include individual factors such as depression, as well as socioeconomic and cultural factors that could be either inhibitory or contributory to the act of suicide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213486218">6</xref></sup> The 26-year-long military campaign in Sri Lanka was generally unpopular, and its end saw the dawn of greater social cohesion among the different ethnic groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213486218">3</xref></sup> The civil war caused significant financial hardships and its end created a general euphoria with expectations of economic development.</p>
<p>There are several limitations in our study, aside from it being a retrospective analysis. Police records, although generally reliable, may have reduced validity in areas and times with ongoing military operations. Some suicides may not have been recorded as such due to stigma, but this limitation would have affected the entire study period similarly.</p>
<p>The reduction in suicide rates in the post war period augurs well for Sri Lanka. However, the increase in suicide rates with age in males is concerning. Suicide prevention strategies need to target the vulnerable groups and utilise the knowledge about commonly used methods.</p>
<p>We thank the Sri Lanka Police Department and Professor Damien Jolley, Monash University for their assistance with the study.</p>
