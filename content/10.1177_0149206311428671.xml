<abstract>
<p>Director selection is a critical board process and outcome that influences the board and its overall performance. Because of this influence, research from a variety of different disciplinary areas examines the antecedents and outcomes of director selection. The authors offer a synthesis of this literature from these different disciplines. The authors first delineate the process that drives the selection of an individual to a board. They then review and categorize the director selection literature into two distinct perspectives—a rational economic perspective focused on the organization-level benefits driving the selection decision and a socialized perspective emphasizing the social processes that influence the director selection process. Finally, from their review, the authors suggest promising areas of future research regarding director selection.</p>

<p>Understanding the determinants of director selection has long been an important issue in corporate governance research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206311428671">Adams, Hermalin, &amp; Weisbach, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206311428671">Finkelstein, Hambrick, &amp; Cannella, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206311428671">Hermalin &amp; Weisbach, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0149206311428671">Johannisson &amp; Huse, 2000</xref>). This is, in part, because the selection of a director is assumed to have an important impact on board actions and overall effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206311428671">Adams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206311428671">Gupta, Otley, &amp; Young, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206311428671">Hermalin &amp; Weisbach, 1988</xref>). We categorize this literature into two broad perspectives—a rational economic perspective representing a view of director selection as an attempt to meet the governance and resources needs of the firm and its shareholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206311428671">Hillman &amp; Dalziel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0149206311428671">Johnson, Ellstrand, &amp; Daily, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr169-0149206311428671">Zahra &amp; Pearce, 1989</xref>) and a socialized perspective emphasizing the social processes and biases that may affect director selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr161-0149206311428671">Westphal &amp; Stern, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr162-0149206311428671">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr163-0149206311428671">Westphal &amp; Zajac, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr171-0149206311428671">Zajac &amp; Westphal, 1996</xref>). This categorization is more reflective of how researchers have approached the direct selection question (following either a more rational or socialized perspective) than of how the process is carried out on boards, which is inevitably a combination of the two perspectives. As such, we are confident that a clearer picture of governance lies in the integration of these two views, resulting in a picture that is neither over- nor undersocialized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206311428671">Granovetter, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Boards are very powerful but also very hard to observe. This generates a level of intrigue that may be responsible for the extended and high levels of research interest about how and why specific individuals or types of individuals are appointed to boards. This research spans several disciplinary areas, including management (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0149206311428671">Lester, Hillman, Zardkoohi, &amp; Cannella, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr163-0149206311428671">Westphal &amp; Zajac, 1995</xref>), finance (e.g., S. P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0149206311428671">Ferris, Jagannathan, &amp; Pritchard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-0149206311428671">Shivdasani &amp; Yermack, 1999</xref>), accounting (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206311428671">Davidson, Xie, &amp; Xu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206311428671">Gupta et al., 2008</xref>), economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206311428671">Hermalin &amp; Weisbach, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206311428671">1998</xref>), sociology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0149206311428671">Mizruchi, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0149206311428671">Mizruchi, Stearns, &amp; Marquis, 2006</xref>), and law (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206311428671">Cohen, 1977</xref>; S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206311428671">Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0149206311428671">Olson &amp; Adams, 2004</xref>). Each of these disciplines offers a different set of lenses for examining the director selection process. For example, researchers have considered how a variety of organizational and environmental changes affect director selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206311428671">Finkelstein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr169-0149206311428671">Zahra &amp; Pearce, 1989</xref>). These include organization-level factors such as firm performance, strategy, and life cycle stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0149206311428671">Pearce &amp; Zahra, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr169-0149206311428671">Zahra &amp; Pearce, 1989</xref>) as well as environmental dependencies, uncertainty, and changes in the external environment (e.g., industry regulation). More recently, researchers have considered how social factors affect director selection such as director reputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206311428671">Gilson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr165-0149206311428671">Wiesenfeld, Wurthmann, &amp; Hambrick, 2008</xref>) and impression management skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr161-0149206311428671">Westphal &amp; Stern, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr162-0149206311428671">2007</xref>). Similarly, from an interlocking directorate perspective, directors may be selected for economic reasons (e.g., collusion, co-optation and monitoring, and organizational legitimacy) as well as for social reasons (e.g., career advancement and social cohesion; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0149206311428671">Mizruchi, 1996</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206311428671">Bazerman &amp; Schoorman, 1983</xref>). Overall, however, this research offers a number of key insights into the determinants of director selection (and, thus, board composition).</p>
<p>In this review, we provide an overview of the multidisciplinary research on director selection from the rational economic and social embeddedness perspectives. We first discuss how each article was categorized into the two perspectives of director selection. We then discuss director selection processes, as these drive board composition but are rarely explicitly discussed in the literature. Next, we review articles from the rational economic perspective of director selection, considering both supply- and demand-side considerations from that perspective. We then review the social embeddedness perspective, again considering both the supply and demand sides. Finally, building on our review, we suggest promising areas of director selection research, including the integration of the two perspectives.</p>
<sec id="section1-0149206311428671">
<title>Categorizing Articles Into Two Broad Perspectives</title>
<p>We examined each article’s theoretical and empirical focus with respect to director selection to categorize it. Those articles focused on prospective candidates obtaining (or being selected for) appointments based on their ability to provide monitoring or resources to a firm were categorized into the economic rational perspective. Articles examining director candidates’ expertise, skills, knowledge, and abilities that relate to the capacity for executing these functions as well as articles that viewed the market for corporate directors as a meritocracy were similarly categorized as economic rational. Conversely, those articles focused on the social process of director selection, including director candidates’ social capital and networks, CEO–board dynamics, or other social dynamics of the selection process, we categorized as following a social embeddedness perspective. We use our article categorizations not to suggest that boards select directors either with a more rational or socialized perspective but rather that researchers’ approaches to director selection have primarily been from one or the other.</p>
<p>To illustrate our categorization, we use two classic books on boards that reflect these differing views. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0149206311428671">Lorsch and MacIver (1989)</xref> address the question of director selection in their book, <italic>Pawns or Potentates</italic>. These authors both concede that CEOs play a large role in director selections (suggesting a certain dominance on the part of the social perspective) but also suggest that “the right people seem to be ending up on boards, and their purpose in serving is serious” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0149206311428671">1989</xref>: 23). From their perspective, directors are selected to serve shareholder interests and directors choose boards based on the quality of the top management team. Conversely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0149206311428671">Mace’s (1971)</xref> book, <italic>Directors: Myth and Reality</italic>, examines the criteria for director selection. Mace’s work emphasizes the “de facto powers of control” CEOs have over director selection and individual prestige is a major driver of selection to the point of “neglecting the possible contribution to company operations of able but less well-known people with less prestige” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0149206311428671">1971</xref>: 107). In these two examples, we would broadly categorize Lorsch and MacIver’s work in the more rational economic perspective, whereas Mace’s work fits better with the socialized perspective. We recognize that these categorizations are not purely black and white. For example, Lorsch and MacIver recognize the role a CEO can play in the process, and Mace recognizes that directors can provide advice and counsel and limited managerial discipline. However, in general, Lorsch and MacIver focus on director selection meeting firm and shareholder needs, whereas Mace emphasizes more of the social processes (i.e., CEO involvement) surrounding selection.</p>

<title>The Director Selection Process</title>
<p>The director selection process provides an illustrative example of the contrasting views of the rational and social perspectives. The director selection process is the formal process by which individuals are identified, screened, nominated, and elected (or appointed) to corporate boards.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0149206311428671">1</xref></sup> In terms of our two perspectives, the rational perspective is based on the assumption that the director selection process reflects an attempt to meet the monitoring and resource needs of the firm. In contrast, the social embeddedness perspective highlights a number of social factors that may influence the selection process. The latter approach challenges the assumption that the director selection process reflects the needs of the firm and its shareholders. And researchers from the rational economic perspective also frequently recognize the bounded rationality that accompanies director selections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206311428671">Bazerman &amp; Schoorman, 1983</xref>). In this regard, the director selection process, whether approached from an economic rational or socially embedded perspective, reflects the bounded rationality of the decision makers in the selection process. In this section, we highlight these counterviews of the director selection process.</p>
<sec id="section3-0149206311428671">
<title>A Rational Perspective of the Process</title>
<p>The formal nomination process begins when there is a vacancy on or expansion of the board (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206311428671">Bacon &amp; Brown, 1975</xref>). According to Lorsch and MacIver, “[L]egally, it is a multistep process, beginning when the incumbent directors search for potential nominees and ending when the shareholders elect those who are nominated by the directors or by the shareholders themselves” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0149206311428671">1989</xref>: 20). This process is affected by the institutional environment and mandates imposed by regulators of the firm seeking directors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0149206311428671">Olson &amp; Adams, 2004</xref>; for an extensive review of the regulatory mandates that have influenced the formal selection process, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0149206311428671">Murphy, 2008</xref>). For example, in most cases in the United States and United Kingdom, the candidates are identified and screened by a nominating committee composed of either all or a majority of independent directors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0149206311428671">Hoskisson, Castleton, &amp; Withers, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0149206311428671">Monks &amp; Minow, 2004</xref>). The source of these candidates can be incumbent directors, the CEO, or search firms employed to identify candidates. After the nominating committee screens the initial candidates, the entire board and CEO often interview them. Those who are deemed most qualified and best fit for the board are formally nominated and voted on by shareholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206311428671">Chisholm, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0149206311428671">Johnson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0149206311428671">Monks &amp; Minow, 2004</xref>). Candidates who are placed on the proxy for a shareholder vote are typically elected without opposition in that only one nominee is on the ballot for any one open position. Shareholders do have the option to withhold their votes, although this is extremely rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206311428671">Hillman, Shropshire, Certo, Dalton, &amp; Dalton, 2011</xref>). For this reason, our focus is on the identification, screening, and nomination of director candidates, and not on the vote of shareholders.</p>
<p>Searches for new directors are often initiated by exits of incumbent directors, and the reason behind the vacancy may affect the selection process. Vacancies can occur for a variety reasons, including the normal end of a director’s term, retirement, resignation, death, and (in rare cases) removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206311428671">Austin, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206311428671">Bacon &amp; Brown, 1975</xref>). When the reason is the departure of a respected director, the candidates are likely to be evaluated in reference to the departing director. Vacancies can also be created by board expansion, which may occur in response to the request of a major shareholder, the desire to retain executives secured in an acquisition or merger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0149206311428671">Hambrick &amp; Cannella, 1993</xref>), the desire to retain executives passed over in a CEO selection process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr157-0149206311428671">Vancil, 1987</xref>), or a variety of other organizational considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206311428671">Bacon &amp; Brown, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr155-0149206311428671">Vance, 1968</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0149206311428671">
<title>A Socialized Perspective of the Process</title>
<p>In the socialized perspective, the director nomination and selection processes can be driven by factors such as the desire of current directors or nominating committee members to affiliate with those similar to themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0149206311428671">Koenig, Gogel, &amp; Sonquist, 1979</xref>) or other social elites and develop a group that is less about good corporate governance and more about social status and prestige (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0149206311428671">Mace, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0149206311428671">Mills, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr154-0149206311428671">Useem, 1984</xref>). Research also suggests that director nominations are susceptible to influence attempts by prospective director candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr161-0149206311428671">Westphal &amp; Stern, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr162-0149206311428671">2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A long line of research also implies that CEOs influence the director selection process so that directors who are inclined to closely monitor management are avoided and those who are likely to be compliant are selected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206311428671">Finkelstein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206311428671">Hermalin &amp; Weisbach, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr171-0149206311428671">Zajac &amp; Westphal, 1996</xref>). Thus, research suggests that the self-interests of powerful individuals can drive director selection processes, challenging a fundamental assumption of the rational economic perspective.</p>
<p>Given the need for a new director, it is widely assumed that the personal attributes of candidates and their fit with the rest of the board are major determinants of director nominations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206311428671">Bacon &amp; Brown, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0149206311428671">Mueller, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0149206311428671">Olson &amp; Adams, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-0149206311428671">Schlueter, 1985</xref>). This assumption is shared by both the rational economic and social embeddedness approaches. The skills, including the experiences, expertise, and network ties of new directors, directly affect the board’s ability to carry out its functions. Following this line of thought, in making director nominations, firms may seek out candidates with specific types of human and social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206311428671">Hillman &amp; Dalziel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0149206311428671">Nicholson &amp; Kiel, 2004</xref>). We turn now to our review of research that examines director selection and changes in board composition.</p>

<title>The Rational Economic Perspective of Director Selection</title>
<p>The rational economic perspective of director selection assumes that directors serve the best interests of the organization (or alternatively, of its shareholders). This leads to the conclusion that those who are better able to carry out the traditional board functions and thus positively influence governance and organizational performance will be selected for board positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206311428671">Fama &amp; Jensen, 1983</xref>). Although a number of board functions have been considered, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206311428671">Hillman and Dalziel (2003)</xref> integrate and consolidate these into two broad categories. First, following agency theory, boards of directors are monitors that ensure the alignment of manager and shareholder interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206311428671">Fama, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206311428671">Fama &amp; Jensen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0149206311428671">Jensen &amp; Meckling, 1976</xref>). Second, following resource dependence theory, boards of directors reduce uncertainties and bring key resources to the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0149206311428671">Pfeffer &amp; Salancik, 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>Utilizing these critical functions as a foundation, most board research focuses on organizational and external changes that provide an impetus for board composition changes and typically emphasizes the firm (or board) as the appropriate level of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206311428671">Finkelstein et al., 2009</xref>). That is, most research has emphasized board composition and not the more micro-level specifics of director selection. This composition research often examines changes in the level of board independence (i.e., the mix of inside and outside directors) but beyond this rough categorization does not consider the individual characteristics a director brings to a board (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0149206311428671">Hillman, Cannella, &amp; Paetzold, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The literature on interlocking directorates also provides several key insights into director selection and board appointments. This literature captures how director selection and exit affect the broader intercorporate network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0149206311428671">Mizruchi, 1996</xref>). Director selection is seen as a way to gain access to critical resources derived from the director’s overall network position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0149206311428671">Mizruchi &amp; Stearns, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>The rational economic perspective of director selection assumes an efficiently operating labor market—the market for corporate directors. The market includes a supply of potential directors and the demand for the services of these individuals from corporate boards. This market serves to estimate the value of director service and discipline those directors who do not perform their fiduciary responsibilities effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206311428671">Fama, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206311428671">Fama &amp; Jensen, 1983</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206311428671">Fama and Jensen (1983</xref>: 315) posit,</p>

<p>The value of their [directors’] human capital depends primarily on their performance as internal decision managers in other organizations. They use their directorships to signal to internal and external markets for decision agents that (1) they are decision experts, (2) they understand the importance of diffuse and separate decision control, and (3) they can work with such decision control systems.</p>

<p>The market for corporate directors serves as one of the institutions of corporate governance that influences and guides the decisions made in organizations (G. F. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206311428671">Davis, 2005</xref>). As G. F. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206311428671">Davis (1993</xref>: 202) suggest, “The market for directors can be analyzed like other labor markets. Joining new boards is the only unambiguous indicator of how well a director is regarded by this market. Thus, determining who gets asked to join additional boards and why indicates the political economy of the network rewards.” Research in this tradition has mainly come from management, accounting, and finance and has emphasized both individual director and firm-level characteristics. On the supply side are candidates with unique expertise, experience, and skills, whereas on the demand side are the firms that seek to identify and nominate new directors.</p>
<sec id="section6-0149206311428671">
<title>The Supply Side: Individual-Level Characteristics</title>
<p>Much of what we know about director selection from the rational economic perspective comes not from studies of potential director candidates and who among them is ultimately selected (and the characteristics of the selected relative to those not selected) but rather is indirectly gleaned from studies of firm performance. Many scholars either compare boards at given points in time to identify performance differences attributable to observable differences across boards or examine changes in board composition and how they relate to performance outcomes. It is important to note, however, that these studies are largely empirical and their focus is on financial performance. That is, they do not typically try to identify any ideal individual characteristics for directors. We capture in our review what we have gleaned from studies of performance and describe in more depth the few exceptions that have studied director appointments explicitly.</p>
<p>Most board scholars assume that to perform their monitoring and resource provisioning functions, boards must be composed of individual directors who possess some necessary mix of human and social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206311428671">Hillman &amp; Dalziel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0149206311428671">Nicholson &amp; Kiel, 2004</xref>). Although it is not conceptually easy to distinguish between human and social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0149206311428671">Haynes &amp; Hillman, 2010</xref>), we define them as follows: Human capital refers to specific skills, expertise, and knowledge, and social capital refers to prestige and connections with other firms/valuable external contingencies.</p>
<sec id="section7-0149206311428671">
<title>Outsider–insider status</title>
<p>One of the earliest proxies of human and social capital among directors studied by governance scholars is insider–outsider status. By all accounts, inside directors provide very different human capital than outside directors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206311428671">Baysinger &amp; Hoskisson, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0149206311428671">Rosenstein and Wyatt (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0149206311428671">Luan and Tang (2007)</xref> find a positive relationship between the appointment of outsiders and shareholder wealth, regardless of the new director’s occupation or background. This signals the perceived differences and value outside directors bring to the boardroom. These positive benefits, along with recent regulations requiring a majority of directors be independent outsiders (e.g., the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the 2003 SEC Proposal, New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ listing guidelines) thus suggest outsiders are more likely to be selected than insiders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206311428671">Green, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0149206311428671">Hoskisson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0149206311428671">Murphy, 2008</xref>). However, given that the majority of directors serving are outsiders, research has pushed further into what specific human or social capital of outsiders predicts board selection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0149206311428671">
<title>CEOs</title>
<p>CEOs seem to be the most highly valued type of outside director. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206311428671">Fahlenbrach, Low, and Stulz (2010a</xref>: 30) suggest, “CEOs have their pick of boards and choose boards that have a favorable tradeoff between total expected compensation and workload.” These authors conclude that CEOs are more likely to serve on boards of large, established, and prestigious firms, firms whose financial and investment policies are similar to the policies of their home firms, and firms that are geographically located close to their home firms. Research, in general, suggests that CEOs of high-performing firms are more likely to receive board appointments. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0149206311428671">Brickley, Linck, and Coles (1999)</xref> find that home firm performance prior to retirement is significantly related to continued home board service and subsequent board appointments 2 years after retirement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206311428671">Fich (2005)</xref> finds that CEOs of high-performing firms are more likely to gain new board appointments, and these appointments are likely to be among firms with growth opportunities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206311428671">Fahlenbrach and colleagues (2010b)</xref> provide evidence of a positive relationship between the appointment of a CEO–director and investor reaction, although longer term firm performance is unaffected. Thus, the research focused on CEOs appointed as directors indicates that CEOs are more likely than non-CEOs to be selected and that CEOs of high-performing firms, of similar firms, or of firms with similar strategies are the most likely.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0149206311428671">
<title>Specific knowledge, skills, experience</title>
<p>Beyond CEO status, researchers have long recognized that directors bring unique knowledge, skills, and experiences to a board (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0149206311428671">Kesner, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0149206311428671">Kor &amp; Sundaramurthy, 2009</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0149206311428671">Hillman and colleagues (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206311428671">Baysinger and Zardkoohi (1986)</xref> both describe a number of different types of directors according to the unique resources and expertise each type brings to a board through their knowledge, skills, and experiences. Building on these different categorizations of directors, research suggests that firms may seek directors with certain human capital. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0149206311428671">Kroll, Walters, and Le (2007)</xref> find that young post-IPO firms may benefit from the appointment of business experts (i.e., current or former for-profit business executives) who provide advice and counsel to the top management team. At the same time, however, they noted that the same firms receive no benefit from “monitoring” by these business experts. Within the context of corporate acquisitions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0149206311428671">Kroll, Walters, and Wright (2008)</xref> provide evidence that directors with experience in an acquired firm’s industry and general experience in making acquisitions affect acquiring firms’ acquisition outcomes.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0149206311428671">Kor and Misangyi (2008)</xref> analyze directors’ resource provision by examining a specific type of resource provided by the directors—industry experience. The authors find a negative relationship between the top management team’s collective level of industry experience and the board’s collective level of industry experience, suggesting that directors supplement the experiences of top management teams. In the context of technology-based entrepreneurial firms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0149206311428671">Kor and Sundaramurthy (2009)</xref> find that firms benefit from directors’ general and industry-specific human and social capital.</p>
<p>Examining specific director expertise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206311428671">Davidson and colleagues (2004)</xref> find a positive investor reaction for the new appointment of financial experts to a firm’s audit committee. Mizruchi and Sterns have produced a series of studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0149206311428671">Mizruchi &amp; Stearns, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0149206311428671">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-0149206311428671">Stearns &amp; Mizruchi, 1993</xref>) showing the addition of financial representatives to boards leads to improved credit access for those firms.</p>
<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311428671">Hillman (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0149206311428671">Etzion and Davis (2008)</xref> find that having directors with political experience can be valuable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311428671">Hillman (2005)</xref> finds political experience is associated with financial performance, particularly in regulated industries. In a related study—one of the few to examine potential directors and subsequent appointments—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0149206311428671">Lester et al. (2008)</xref> examined the board service of members of the U.S. House of Representatives, senators, and presidential cabinet members when they leave political office. These authors concluded that breadth and depth of human and social capital directly affect the likelihood that a former government official will be selected as an outside director. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0149206311428671">Etzion and Davis (2008)</xref> find that service in either the Clinton or G. W. Bush administration (or both) increased the likelihood of receiving director nominations. Thus, scholars have successfully predicted that candidates with specific expertise relevant to a given context are more likely to gain directorships.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0149206311428671">
<title>An individual’s social capital</title>
<p>The ability to carry out board functions also reflects an individual’s social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0149206311428671">Kim, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0149206311428671">Kim &amp; Cannella, 2008</xref>), and, as such, director selection may reflect the social capital a potential director possesses. For example, following a sociocognitive perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206311428671">Carpenter and Westphal (2001)</xref> suggest that a director’s network of appointments directly affects his or her ability to provide monitoring and advice and counsel to the board. However, the authors suggest that it is not just the number of appointments but rather the strategic context of the appointments that influences a director’s board involvement. For example, in stable environments, a director’s subsequent appointment to strategically related firms increased his or her subsequent board involvement, whereas, in more dynamic environments, a director’s subsequent appointment to strategically distant firms increased board involvement. The overall finding of this literature is that individuals who are already directors and have multiple board appointments are more likely than novice directors or those with fewer board seats to be selected.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0149206311428671">Kim and Cannella (2008)</xref> examine the role of social capital in new director selection and subsequent board performance. In developing their social capital perspective of director selection, they delineate between internal social capital—ties within the focal organization and in particular within the board—and external social capital—ties to powerful forces outside the organization. They propose that both forms of social capital are positively related to director selection, although each represents a different causal logic for the new director appointment. The authors suggest a number of contextual variables that may strengthen the relationship between director internal and external social capital and director selection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0149206311428671">
<title>Director reputation</title>
<p>A potential director’s reputation is also an important part of his or her social capital, which, in turn, affects the candidate’s attractiveness. The appointment of an outside director serves as a signal for a firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311428671">Certo, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206311428671">Deutsch &amp; Ross, 2003</xref>), and many firms appear to use the selection of a prestigious director to bolster their own prestige. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206311428671">Deutsch and Ross (2003</xref>: 1008) posit, “Directors’ reputations act as a type of goodwill-assets that pay dividends to the holders by allowing them to make credible promises that it would not otherwise be possible to make. The promises of ‘reputable’ directors are credible because their reputational capital would be damaged if they did not keep their promises or tell the truth.” In this regard, the ability to appoint highly reputable directors who provide prestige to a firm lacking established prestige may serve as a compelling signal to investors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311428671">Certo, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206311428671">Deutsch &amp; Ross, 2003</xref>). Studies of IPO firms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206311428671">Certo, Daily, &amp; Dalton, 2001</xref>) confirm the link between prestigious directors and performance—at least for IPO pricing (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311428671">Certo, Holcomb, &amp; Holmes, 2009</xref>). Thus, this research suggests that the prestige of director candidates is positively associated with the likelihood of board appointments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0149206311428671">
<title>Firm performance</title>
<p>Several studies confirm that both inside and outside directors from better performing firms are more likely to receive subsequent appointments (S. P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0149206311428671">Ferris et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206311428671">Gupta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr168-0149206311428671">Yermack, 2004</xref>; also see the CEO research discussed above). In the context of acquisitions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206311428671">Fairchild and Li (2005)</xref> find that directors who come from “above average” target firms have more subsequent appointments, as do those acquiring firms experiencing “above average” postacquisition performance.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206311428671">Fama and Jensen (1983</xref>: 315) suggest that “there is a substantial devaluation of human capital when internal decision control breaks down.” In support of this prediction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206311428671">Gilson (1990)</xref> finds that directors of firms that enter bankruptcy are more likely to exit the bankrupt firm’s board and less likely to obtain subsequent board appointments. Similarly, directors serving on the boards of firms that are accused of ethical violations also are likely to experience negative repercussions in the market for corporate directors. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206311428671">Arthaud-Day, Certo, Dalton, and Daily (2006)</xref> find that directors of firms filing material financial restatements are 70% more likely to exit their directorships than directors of firms not filing financial restatements. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-0149206311428671">Srinivasan (2005)</xref> finds that outside directors, particularly audit committee members, are likely to experience labor market penalties when their firms issue accounting restatements. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206311428671">Fich and Shivdasani (2007)</xref> provide evidence that outside directors at firms facing shareholder class action lawsuits are likely to experience a decline in the number of other board seats they hold at the time of the lawsuit. In addition, the exits are more likely among firms with stronger governance (i.e., higher levels of board independence). Thus, firm performance is likely to both positively and negatively affect the future status of directors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0149206311428671">
<title>Other directorships</title>
<p>A director’s other board appointments are also likely to influence selection. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0149206311428671">Keys and Li (2005)</xref> find that after a takeover, directors with multiple board appointments are more likely to receive new board appointments than those without other directorships. The authors suggest that this greater likelihood of new appointments is in part the result of the professional directors’ valuable and transferable general human capital, offsetting the information processing concerns and other costs that come along with holding multiple directorships.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0149206311428671">
<title>Home firm or other board strategy</title>
<p>There is also a growing body of literature that supports the idea that the strategies of directors’ home firms or the strategies of the other firms on whose boards they serve will affect their subsequent board service. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0149206311428671">Li and Aguilera (2008)</xref> suggest the likelihood of outside director turnover following an acquisition depends on the director’s performance of the monitoring, advisory, and social roles preacquisition and during the acquisition. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206311428671">Coles and Hoi (2003)</xref> find that directors on boards that reject antitakeover provisions are 3 times more likely to gain additional directorships relative to those on boards that retain antitakeover provisions. As in the literature reviewed above, this suggests that predicting the likelihood of director appointment will depend heavily on the strategy of the selecting firm and that of the potential director’s home or other board firms.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0149206311428671">Farrell and Whidbee (2000)</xref> examine the consequence of firing a CEO on future directorships for the firing firm’s directors. They find that directors closely aligned with the outgoing CEO, those who possess little equity in the firm, and those who make poor replacement decisions (i.e., choose a poorly performing CEO to replace the dismissed one) are more likely to exit the board. Conversely, directors who are not aligned with the outgoing CEO and those who possess larger amounts of equity are more likely to receive subsequent board appointments when they replace a poorly performing CEO with a CEO who improves firm performance.</p>

<sec id="section15-0149206311428671">
<title>Gender and ethnicity</title>
<p>Women and ethnic minorities have also received a good deal of research attention. Researchers have tended to emphasize the unique resources that certain types of directors, such as minorities and females, may bring to corporate boards (for an excellent review of the literature on female directors, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr150-0149206311428671">Terjesen, Sealy, &amp; Singh, 2009</xref>). From this perspective, being a female or minority is an important factor behind director selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206311428671">Burke, 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206311428671">Hillman, Cannella, &amp; Harris, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-0149206311428671">Singh, 2007</xref>). Although clearly tied to human and social capital, this research has tended to consider gender and ethnicity as proxies for these underlying characteristics. Much like the market for CEO–directors, the restricted supply of female directors permits viable candidates to have more choices of boards to serve on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206311428671">Farrell &amp; Hersch, 2005</xref>). However, they also suggest that the likelihood of adding a female director is negatively related to the number of female directors already serving on a board (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206311428671">Farrell &amp; Hersch, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Some of the support for an increased likelihood of females or ethnic minorities being selected for boards comes from performance studies. Several studies have concluded that the selection of female directors positively affects subsequent firm performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206311428671">Carter, Simkins, &amp; Simpson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0149206311428671">Erhardt, Werbel, &amp; Shrader, 2003</xref>). Beyond the implication that women and minorities should be highly sought after for directorships, others have concluded that female and minority directors often have diverse and valuable knowledge, information, or skills. As examples, female directors often hold advanced degrees, a strong business track record, or specialized knowledge and information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206311428671">Burke, 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206311428671">Burke &amp; Leblanc, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0149206311428671">Peterson &amp; Philpot, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206311428671">Hillman et al. (2002)</xref> compare the attributes of female and minority directors with those of White male directors on boards in the <italic>Fortune</italic> 1000. They find that the female and minority directors are more likely to come from nonbusiness backgrounds and hold advanced degrees than their White male counterparts. These directors also tended to join additional boards at a much faster rate than White male directors.</p>

<title>The Demand Side: Appointing Firm Characteristics</title>
<p>Other studies mirror those above but with a more explicit focus on the firm seeking a new director. Some of the literature reviewed above points to demand-side characteristics that increase the attractiveness of specific directors. We now turn to the characteristics of appointing firms in more detail.</p>
<sec id="section17-0149206311428671">
<title>Appointing firm performance</title>
<p>Performance is one of the key firm-level characteristics thought to affect director selection and board composition change. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206311428671">Hermalin and Weisbach (1988)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr160-0149206311428671">Weisbach (1988)</xref> find that poor organizational performance is positively related to increases in the proportion of independent outside directors on a board. Conversely, other research suggests that independent directors may be more likely to leave poor performing firms to protect their reputations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206311428671">Fama, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206311428671">Finkelstein et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0149206311428671">Hambrick and D’Aveni (1992)</xref> present evidence that organizations facing bankruptcy are more likely to experience outside director exits as a part of a downward spiral of top team deterioration. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206311428671">Daily and Dalton (1995)</xref> find supporting evidence of director turnover as firms approach bankruptcy and find no evidence that the proportion of outsiders increases during bankruptcy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0149206311428671">Pearce and Zahra (1992)</xref> also find that poor prior performance is negatively related to outsider representation on the board. Thus, this research suggests firms performing poorly are more likely to seek out outsiders to join their board, but they may have difficulty keeping them.</p>

<sec id="section18-0149206311428671">
<title>Appointing firm environment</title>
<p>Several studies have considered the role of a firm’s environment in determining board composition. Many of these studies have utilized a resource-dependence perspective to examine the firm–environment interaction and its influence on board composition and change (for reviews, see G. F. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311428671">Davis &amp; Cobb, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206311428671">Hillman, Withers, &amp; Collins, 2009</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0149206311428671">Pfeffer (1972)</xref> examines the role of boards in serving as an instrument for co-opting environmental interdependences. He finds that firms alter the size of their boards to create more links to the environment when needed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206311428671">Boeker and Goodstein (1991)</xref> provide evidence that the composition of the board can be modified to meet the demands of a changing environment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206311428671">Daily and Schwenk (1996)</xref> suggest that outside resource dependence requirements are key factors along with other conditions in determining the governance structures that firms enact. Accordingly, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0149206311428671">Mizruchi and Stearns (1988)</xref> study discussed earlier also concluded that increased dependence on financial institutions leads to appointments of directors from financial institutions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206311428671">Boyd (1990)</xref> directly examines the relationship between a firm’s external environment and its board size and number of interlocks. Utilizing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0149206311428671">Dess and Beard’s (1984)</xref> dimensions of environmental uncertainty, Boyd finds a negative relationship between competitive uncertainty and board size and a positive relationship between competitive uncertainty and number of board interlocks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0149206311428671">Markarian and Parbonetti (2007)</xref> similarly find that firm external and internal complexity differentially affect the types of directors making up a board. For example, externally complex firms are more likely to substitute community influentials (e.g., academics, politicians, not-for-profit leaders) for insiders, whereas internally complex firms are more likely to substitute insiders for community influentials and support specialists (e.g., directors with marketing, legal, financial, or other support expertise).</p>
<p>Research also considers the impact of regulation on board composition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0149206311428671">Luoma and Goodstein (1999)</xref> find support for this notion in that firms in highly regulated industries have a higher proportion of directors who are nonshareholder stakeholders. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0149206311428671">Lang and Lockhart (1990)</xref> also found that after airline deregulation, indirect interlocks between competitors increased as firms attempted to cope with the increase in competitive uncertainty and resource dependences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0149206311428671">Hillman and colleagues (2000)</xref> developed a taxonomy of director categories to highlight how board composition changed as U.S. airlines underwent deregulation. They found that directors with business experience, expertise in support functions, and relationships to the community were more likely to be appointed to the board after deregulation than during regulation. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206311428671">Agrawal and Knoeber (2001)</xref> find that lawyer–directors are more prevalent in firms where costs of environmental regulation are higher.</p>

<title>Appointing firm strategy</title>
<p>Another important determinant of board composition is firm strategy. In support of this notion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0149206311428671">Pearce and Zahra (1992)</xref> find that firms employing diversification strategies were more likely to have larger boards and higher proportions of independent outside directors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206311428671">Agrawal and Knoeber (2001)</xref> also find that firms experiencing greater sales to government, higher levels of exports, and more need for lobbying are more likely to have directors with political experience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-0149206311428671">Sanders and Carpenter (1998)</xref> find that a firm’s level of internationalization is positively related to both board size and proportion of outsiders on the board, suggesting that as firms become more internationalized, they face more complex environments that require larger boards and more outsiders. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0149206311428671">Peng, Au, and Wang (2001)</xref> similarly examine the interlocking behaviors of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in third world economies and find that in Thailand MNEs tend to have more densely connected interlocks, occupy more central locations in the directorate network, and select more military personnel to serve on their boards than noninternationalized firms. In sum, this research, like that reviewed earlier regarding specific forms of director expertise (e.g., financial, political), suggests that certain strategies require different knowledge and skills from directors, and as such, board composition may reflect firm strategy.</p>

<sec id="section20-0149206311428671">
<title>Appointing firm life cycle stage</title>
<p>Closely related to a firm’s current strategy, the stage of development the organization is also suggested to influence board composition. For example, with each stage of the life cycle comes concomitant changes in the complexity of the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206311428671">Dewar &amp; Hage, 1978</xref>), and thus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0149206311428671">Lynall, Golden, and Hillman (2003)</xref> argue that governance requirements will similarly change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr169-0149206311428671">Zahra and Pearce (1989</xref>: 298) agree, noting “boards are expected to perform qualitatively different roles at various points in the cycle.” Lynall and colleagues theorize that in each of the four stages of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-0149206311428671">Quinn and Cameron’s (1983)</xref> life cycle model, board composition should vary (as does the relevance of different theoretical perspectives on composition). They contend that board composition is affected by the stage of organizational development in which the board was initially formed as well as the relative power of the CEO and external financiers at the time of founding.</p>
<p>As an example in the early stages of the firm life cycle (initial public offering, IPO), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206311428671">Chen, Hambrick, and Pollock (2008)</xref> find support for a “snowball model,” in which prestigious directors and executives are drawn toward firms with other prestigious parties, and a “dressing-up model,” in which firms lacking in prestige dramatically increase their hiring of prestigious directors and executives. In particular, the authors find that as a firm approaches the IPO date it increases its hiring of prestigious directors and executives. Furthermore, less prestigious and poor firms are even more likely to aggressively hire prestigious directors and executives. Thus, to succeed at IPO, firms seem to purposefully structure their boards to reduce uncertainty. In sum, once again, research suggests a matching perspective of firm needs (in this case strategy, life cycle state) and director characteristics.</p>

<title>The Social Embeddedness Perspective</title>
<p>Although the rational economic perspective of director selection suggests that the capacity of prospective directors to monitor and provide resources to the firm and the needs of the appointing firm is a critical driver of the selection process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206311428671">Finkelstein et al., 2009</xref>), a growing literature focuses more on the social determinants of director selection. This perspective recognizes the social nature of boards and board processes. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0149206311428671">Khurana and Pick (2004</xref>: 1260) suggest, “[A] board is not a simple aggregation of individuals but is, in fact, a complex social system and must be understood as such.” From this perspective, the directors selected are not necessarily those who can optimally serve the best interests of the overall organization but rather reflect the preferences and biases of those who are charged with new director selection. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206311428671">Bazerman and Schoorman (1983</xref>: 212) propose, “(1) the search for directors will not be complete and will be biased by social contacts; (2) selection of the perceived optimal director will be influenced by political factors due to social contacts; and (3) the cost of an optimal search often will lead to making the choice within the bounds of existing social networks” (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0149206311428671">O’Neal &amp; Thomas, 1995</xref>). At a minimum, this notion leads to the conclusion that the directors most likely to be selected to join a board are those who reflect boardroom norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0149206311428671">Khurana &amp; Pick, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The social embeddedness perspective examines both the social context and the alternative motives that may drive director nominations. Regarding motives, director nominations are viewed as a means for individuals to associate with and be identified with other individuals of high prestige and status, or others with whom they wish to associate for other personal reasons (e.g., ingratiation). Although this is a growing area of board research and the research questions it considers are fairly new, the idea that the interests of those charged with identifying new directors (including the CEO) are important in selection decisions is a time-honored one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0149206311428671">Mace, 1971</xref>). For example, more than 50 years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0149206311428671">Mills (1956</xref>: 294) noted that those occupying the upper echelons of large U.S. firms “often seem to know one another, seem quite naturally to work together, and share many organizations in common.”</p>

<title>The Supply Side: Individual-Level Characteristics</title>
<p>Much like the research from a rational economic perspective, research from the socialized perspective has examined individual-level influences on director selection. Our review emphasizes research on a director’s social capital, reputation, and influence tactics and skills.</p>
<sec id="section23-0149206311428671">
<title>An individual’s social capital</title>
<p>Although a director’s social capital can provide critical resources to a firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206311428671">Hillman &amp; Dalziel, 2003</xref>), this capital can also provide opportunities for gaining new board appointments and in turn can be a major influence on who is selected to serve on a particular board (e.g., G. F. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206311428671">Davis, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr154-0149206311428671">Useem, 1984</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr154-0149206311428671">Useem (1984</xref>: 51) provides from his qualitative study of boards,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>When managers holding outside directorships were asked to describe how at least one of the directorships was initiated, in more than three out of four instances they identified factors unrelated to trade or any other strictly business relation between the companies. Commonly, the man was already personally acquainted with the chairman or other directors on the board he was asked to join. Such contacts stemmed from a range of sources. Often, they had a prior business relationship—but not as a product of any dealing between the two companies. The individuals might have served together, for instance, on another corporate board, or perhaps on a business association task force.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From this perspective of social capital, the director’s personal and professional relationships provide opportunities for board appointments and can in turn influence who is selected to fill a board position.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0149206311428671">
<title>Director reputation</title>
<p>As previously discussed, at one level a director’s reputation can provide benefits to the appointing firm; however, at another level, a director’s reputation of how actively the individual monitors management on the boards he or she serves may be another form of reputation that influences the director selection decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr171-0149206311428671">Zajac &amp; Westphal, 1996</xref>). In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr171-0149206311428671">Zajac and Westphal (1996</xref>) suggest that the director’s reputation for either activism or passivity on his or her current boards can be a major determinant of his or her future board appointments and the types of boards these appointments represent (i.e., CEO or board controlled). Those directors with reputations of more passive board service are more likely to be appointed to boards in which the CEO controls the selection process and desires to maintain his or her control. Conversely, directors with reputations for more active involvement and monitoring are more likely to be appointed to boards in which the board has more relative power and control over the selection process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0149206311428671">
<title>Director influence, behaviors, and skills</title>
<p>Recent research also suggests that potential directors may engage in behaviors to influence the director selection process. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr161-0149206311428671">Westphal and Stern (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr162-0149206311428671">2007</xref>) find that ingratiatory behavior can be used by both top managers and directors to receive subsequent director nominations. Top managers or current directors who use impression management tactics (in this case ingratiation) toward their CEOs or other directors were more likely to receive subsequent board appointments at other firms where the CEO or other directors serve as well as firms connected to the CEO or other directors through their directorate networks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr161-0149206311428671">Westphal and Stern (2006)</xref> suggest ingratiatory tactics may substitute to some degree for an individual’s background. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr162-0149206311428671">Westphal and Stern (2007)</xref> again examine the specific ingratiatory behaviors that lead directors to receive future board appointments. They confirm that impression management tactics along with offering advice and counsel increases the likelihood of future appointments for directors. They also find those directors who engage in less monitoring were more likely to receive future appointments, that minorities required higher levels of ingratiatory behavior to receive future appointments, and that minorities were punished more for engaging in monitoring.</p>
<p>However, a director’s likelihood of obtaining new appointments depends not only on the use of ingratiatory behavior but also on the skills of the individual doing the ingratiating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr149-0149206311428671">Stern &amp; Westphal, 2010</xref>). Similar to research on impression management and political skill (e.g., G. R. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0149206311428671">Ferris et al., 2007</xref>; K. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206311428671">Harris, Kacmar, Zivnuska, &amp; Shaw, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr153-0149206311428671">Treadway, Hochwarter, Kacmar, &amp; Ferris, 2005</xref>), this evidence suggests that directors must not only manage impressions but also know when and how to do so. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr149-0149206311428671">Stern and Westphal (2010</xref>: 278) posit, “[M]anagers’ and directors’ ingratiatory behavior toward colleagues is more likely to yield board appointments at other firms to the extent that it comprises relatively subtle forms of flattery and opinion conformity, which our theory suggests are less likely to elicit cynical attributions of motive.” Related to this, those directors with backgrounds in politics, law, or sales may have higher levels of political skill or, in other words, be more adept at engaging in these sophisticated forms of ingratiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr149-0149206311428671">Stern &amp; Westphal, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>The Demand Side: Appointing Firm Characteristics</title>
<p>Other studies have examined the social influences that derive from the appointing firm. From this perspective, the CEO’s influence has long been recognized as central to the director selection decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0149206311428671">Lorsch &amp; MacIver, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0149206311428671">Mace, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr163-0149206311428671">Westphal &amp; Zajac, 1995</xref>), though as we discuss below, the recent Sarbanes-Oxley legislation may be changing CEO impact. Below, we discuss a key outcome of the presumed bargaining process between CEOs and boards in making selection decisions—the bifurcated market for directors.</p>
<sec id="section27-0149206311428671">
<title>CEO influence</title>
<p>Research has frequently considered the role that incumbent CEOs play in director selection. Director selection is one way in which CEOs can “acquire and institutionalize discretion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr152-0149206311428671">Tosi, Shen, &amp; Gentry, 2003</xref>: 183). Most often, the underlying assumption is that the selection of a new outside director is a function of negotiations between existing directors and the CEO over who will fill the vacancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206311428671">Hermalin &amp; Weisbach, 1998</xref>). The outcome of this bargaining process reflects board control in some firms and CEO dominance in others. The bargaining process may be explicit or implicit in which, “the CEO could nominate new board members subject to a tacit understanding about the set from which they may be chosen” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206311428671">Hermalin &amp; Weisbach, 1998</xref>: 96-97). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206311428671">Hermalin and Weisbach (1988)</xref> find that CEO succession greatly affects board composition. In particular, as a CEO draws closer to retirement, inside directors are more likely to be added to the board, potentially as candidates for the CEO position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0149206311428671">Mace, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr156-0149206311428671">Vance, 1983</xref>). However, after the CEO retires, those inside directors with shorter tenures are more likely to leave the board.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr163-0149206311428671">Westphal and Zajac (1995)</xref> more directly examine the influence of CEOs on the selection of directors as they consider demographic similarity between CEOs and the directors selected. These authors find that CEOs with greater power relative to the board attempt to select directors with similar demographic characteristics to themselves to reinforce their relative power. Conversely, when boards have greater relative power, new directors are more likely to be demographically similar to outside directors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr171-0149206311428671">Zajac and Westphal (1996</xref>) similarly find that directors currently serving on boards that have engaged in measures to reduce CEO power and increase board control are less likely to receive future appointments at firms with higher CEO power and more likely to receive future appointments at firms with higher board control.</p>
<p>CEOs in power may also seek out sympathetic directors. One approach to do this is to appoint individuals who can make up “mutual interlocks” or “two (or more) directors who are also members of another company’s board” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311428671">Fich &amp; White, 2003</xref>: 935). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311428671">Fich and White (2003)</xref> find a positive association between the number of board mutual interlocks and executive compensation and a negative association between the number of board mutual interlocks and CEO turnover. Related to this, a CEO may attempt to populate the board with directors who have previous social relationships with him or her (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0149206311428671">Johnson, Ellstrand, Dalton, &amp; Dalton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr152-0149206311428671">Tosi et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In the IPO context, executive power and experience are negatively related to board independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206311428671">Baker &amp; Gompers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206311428671">Filatotchev, 2006</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206311428671">Baker and Gompers (2003)</xref> find that firms backed by venture capital are more likely to have independent boards composed of directors with specialized expertise (e.g., bankers, lawyers, accountants, and consultants). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0149206311428671">Daily and Dalton (1993)</xref> find a significant negative relationship between firms with founder CEOs and the number and proportion of independent outside directors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0149206311428671">Fiegener, Brown, Dreux, and Dennis (2000)</xref> similarly find that CEOs with greater ownership and family stakes have boards that are less independent. Thus, ownership structure has been linked to director selection.</p>
<p>When CEOs serve on the nominating committee or a firm has no such committee, fewer independent directors are selected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-0149206311428671">Shivdasani &amp; Yermack, 1999</xref>). Conversely, firms with a nominating committee are more likely to have a higher proportion of independent directors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-0149206311428671">Ruigrok, Peck, Tacheva, Greve, &amp; Hu, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-0149206311428671">Shivdasani and Yermack (1999)</xref> also find that CEO involvement increases the likelihood that a firm will appoint a gray or affiliate director. When independent directors are selected, these individuals are more likely to meet the “overboarded” or busy definitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206311428671">Core, Holthausen, &amp; Larcker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206311428671">Fich &amp; Shivdasani, 2006</xref>; I. C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206311428671">Harris &amp; Shimizu, 2004</xref>)—that is, they simultaneously serve on multiple boards. Utilizing a sample of 135 firms drawn from the Australia Stock Exchange, which provides relatively little regulatory restrictions on the selection of directors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206311428671">Arthur (2001)</xref> finds strong evidence that CEO power is inversely related to the proportion of outside directors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206311428671">Eminet and Guedri (2010)</xref>, related to this, find that when the CEO or insider directors serve on the nominating committee, directors are not rewarded for their reputations as active monitors. Similarly, research suggests that when CEOs are directly involved in the selection of directors and there is no nominating committee, investors tend to react negatively to proposed incentive pay plans for directors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206311428671">Gerety, Chun-Keung, &amp; Robin, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206311428671">Callahan, Millar, and Schulman (2003)</xref> examine the relationship between firm performance and executive involvement in the selection of directors and find that CEO and other insider involvement is positively related to long-term financial performance. This study also finds that nominating committees and the number of nominating committee meetings are negatively related to firm performance. These authors conclude that there is little benefit to decoupling management from the director selection process.</p>
<p>In highly regulated environments, the director selection process may be less of a negotiation between the board and the firm’s CEO. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0149206311428671">Pathan and Skully (2010</xref>: 1590) find that board independence is less about the outcome of negotiations between a bank’s board and its CEO and more reflective of “constant monitoring by bank regulators and fear of severe disciplinary action” to those banks that do not conform. Thus, the degree to which the CEO controls the director selection process will influence the type of director chosen. Those candidates who have taken action to limit a CEO’s power in previous directorship service are unlikely to receive new directorship appointments from firms with powerful CEOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr171-0149206311428671">Zajac &amp; Westphal, 1996</xref>). And firms with powerful CEOs are more likely to appoint directors demographically similar to those CEOs.</p>

<title>Social elite cohesion or hegemony</title>
<p>A long tradition of research on boards has also considered the role boards play in maintaining the cohesion of the social elite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0149206311428671">Mills, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr154-0149206311428671">Useem, 1984</xref>). For example, G. F. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206311428671">Davis, Yoo, and Baker (2003)</xref> find support for the assertion that the small-world phenomenon (level of connectivity among several thousand directors) is quite stable, even when there is dramatic upheaval in corporate governance practices and industry conditions. This stable connectivity derives, in part, from the director selection process. As these authors suggest, “[A] recruitment process that relies on personal familiarity allows a handful of directors to become and remain highly central in the director network, thereby creating many ties among companies” (G. F. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206311428671">Davis et al., 2003</xref>: 304).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0149206311428671">Mizruchi (1996)</xref> also pointed out that director interlocks may be a means to maintain cohesion among the social elite and thus remain relatively stable. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr170-0149206311428671">Zajac (1988)</xref> found little support for the rational perspective that firms choose directors with multiple interlocks. He interpreted the lack of support as indicating that directors may instead join new boards because of economic incentives, a desire for prestige, opportunities for career advancement, and future board appointments. Under this logic, the existence of interlocks is little more than a by-product of directors’ desires and motivations and has little to do with a firm-level need to form links to specific organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0149206311428671">Mizruchi, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, in their examination of reconstituting interlocking ties, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0149206311428671">Koenig et al. (1979</xref>: 181) suggest that “[t]he picture that emerges . . . is one of a complex, stable, and pervasive network of interconnections between firms (especially those with headquarters in the same city), but with great instability of specific interlocks between any two specific companies.” A related line of research considers interlocking directorates as a way to facilitate political cohesion among corporate elites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311428671">Burris, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0149206311428671">Mizruchi, 1992</xref>). In a study investigating the political cohesion within the business community, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311428671">Burris (2005)</xref> finds that common membership on corporate boards is positively associated with the similarity of political behavior among corporate elites. This research concludes that not only firms but also individuals linked through directorate interlocks are more likely to engage in similar political behavior.</p>
<p>Finally, although their research is not from a social networks perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0149206311428671">Hillman, Shropshire, and Cannella (2007)</xref> find that organizational size, industry type, and the extent to which a focal firm is linked to other firms with female directors significantly affect the likelihood of female representation on corporate boards. Thus, linkages are likely to affect new director appointments.</p>

<title>Bifurcated market for corporate directors</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr163-0149206311428671">Westphal and Zajac’s (1995)</xref> research suggests that rather than the existence of a single efficient labor market that rewards directors for monitoring and providing resources, there exists a bifurcated market in which some firms seek directors to provide rigorous monitoring whereas other firms seek directors who acquiesce to their CEOs. This bifurcated market reflects the outcome of negotiations between outside directors and CEOs over who will fill board vacancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206311428671">Hermalin &amp; Weisbach, 1998</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr171-0149206311428671">Zajac and Westphal (1996</xref>: 509) point out, from this bifurcated market perspective, “appointments may reflect a political rather than an economic rationality, in which both active and passive board members can thrive in a labor market for directors that is segmented by orientation toward management.”</p>
<p>In support of this notion, G. F. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206311428671">Davis (1993)</xref> suggests that success in the market for directors is strongly affected by social connections and to a lesser extent by the director’s acquiescence to management. For example, Davis’s research findings suggest that directors serving on more boards are more likely to be selected for subsequent appointments. Similarly, those directors serving on boards of centrally located firms in the corporate network were more likely to be selected for subsequent appointments. Finally, directors on boards adopting golden parachutes subsequently joined more boards. The appointment of well-connected directors may not have a direct impact on corporate performance, but it can positively influence the reputational ratings of the appointing firm (G. F. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206311428671">Davis &amp; Robbins, 2004</xref>). Here, we see the same tests (interlocks leading to more board seats and those with certain behavior on other boards) but interpreted through a social lens. The story that emerges seems to indicate that selections are affected more by interpersonal connections (whom candidates are connected to) and less by a rational search for new connections.</p>
<p>The existence of a bifurcated market also helps to explain why some directors experience little reputational repercussions in the market for corporate directors. For example, although other research finds some discipline for bad behavior on the part of directors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206311428671">Agrawal, Jaffe, and Karpoff (1999)</xref> report little systematic evidence for the turnover of executives or directors of firms suspected or charged with fraud. Examining firms facing shareholder class action lawsuits, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206311428671">Fich and Shivdasani (2007)</xref> provide evidence that directors serving on these boards do not experience abnormally high turnover from the focal board (although as mentioned above these directors do experience turnover with their other directorships). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr158-0149206311428671">Walsh and Kosnik (1993)</xref> find little support for the disciplinary role of corporate raiders and hostile takeovers. In sum, directors may be embedded in the directorate network and thus resistant to expelling forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr159-0149206311428671">Ward &amp; Feldman, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>If there are concerns about the possibility of discipline, directors may attempt to exit a firm before there is the opportunity for them to be disciplined. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206311428671">Fahlenbrach, Low, and Stulz (2010a)</xref> find that when firms are experiencing poor performance or the disclosure of improper actions, outside directors have incentives to quit to protect their reputations and avoid increased workload. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206311428671">Asthana and Balsam (2010</xref>: 244), similarly, provide evidence that directors are more likely to leave just prior to deteriorating performance. As they suggest, this preemptive turnover “is consistent with directors having inside information and acting on that information to protect their wealth and reputation.” This would seem to reflect a desire to remain active in the (bifurcated) market for directorships and also to influence the decisions directors make on their current boards. For example, from a director’s job security perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206311428671">Davidson, Nemec, and Worrell (2006)</xref> suggest that directors may select successor CEOs demographically similar to themselves to maintain the long-term prospects of their board appointments.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this article, we have described the director selection process and offered a review of the extant literature across a variety of scholarly fields on director selection. Although these different fields provide several unique theoretical lenses to examine director selection, scholars tend to adopt one of the two broad perspectives, namely, rational economic or socially embedded. The rational economic perspective assumes that director selection reflects the best interests of the organization and its shareholders. Conversely, the social embeddedness perspective emphasizes the social processes that surround director selection.</p>
<p>As we have previously mentioned, our review speaks more to the approaches and perspectives researchers have taken than to the actual process, which encompasses both rational and socially embedded factors. For example, as we have suggested, CEOs are a valued commodity on the market; however, it is not as clear whether these executives are desired because they can provide important resources and monitoring or if the focal firm’s CEO desires a director who may identify with being a CEO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0149206311428671">Hillman, Nicholson, &amp; Shropshire, 2008</xref>) and as such provide less monitoring and more control to the focal firm CEO. In many ways, the preponderance of CEOs as directors and the overwhelming desire to fill boards with these executives reflect both perspectives. Furthermore, whether a study focuses on the rational or socially embedded drivers of CEO may depend on the theoretical foundations of their discipline. For example, many of the studies that espouse the benefits of CEO appointments derive from the finance literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0149206311428671">Brickley et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206311428671">Fahlenbrach et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206311428671">Fich, 2005</xref>) and, in many ways, are reflective of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206311428671">Fama and Jensen’s (1983)</xref> earlier perspective of board appointments reflecting an executive’s value as an internal decision managers in other organizations. Conversely, work derived from social psychology or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206311428671">Hermalin and Weisbach’s (1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206311428671">1998</xref>) board–CEO bargaining perspective of director selection may focus the social dynamics that lead a firm to select a CEO. (Below we suggest how an integrative approach may resolve the seemingly contradictory perspective and their respective findings.) We now build on our review to provide an integrated perspective of director selection and offer a number of potential areas for future research on director selection.</p>
<sec id="section31-0149206311428671">
<title>Integrating the Rational and Social Perspectives</title>
<p>From our review, we highlight four factors that influence director selection. On the rational side, there are individual-level characteristics that influence a potential director’s ability to perform the board functions and firm-level characteristics that determine the need for these director characteristics. Similarly, on the socially embedded side, there are individual-level characteristics that enable the potential director to influence the selection process and firm-level factors that similarly influence the selection process. Although scholars tend to adopt either the rational economic or socially embedded perspective, we believe the two should be integrated to advance our understanding of director selection. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0149206311428671">Figure 1</xref>, we provide that integration, moving toward a general level model of the determinants of director selection. As indicated in the figure, the director selection decision is inherently a two-sided process in which appointing firms and potential directors come together to produce the selection outcome. On the appointing firm side, a number of key factors determine whether a firm is in the market for a new board member and what characteristics the firm may be looking for in potential directors. Our review points to four broad and interrelated firm-level factors that influence the director selection decision—firm performance, strategy, environment, and life cycle stage. These firm-level factors provide the context in which decisions are made in the firm, and, in turn, the type of director needed to provide monitoring and resources to the firm. For example, a firm early in its life cycle may need a director who can provide greater advice and counsel to its executives and offer legitimacy to the firm to attract other resource providers (e.g., investors, established suppliers). In this regard, the firm-level characteristics determine the needed mix of human and social capital provided by an individual to perform the board functions for a particular firm.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0149206311428671-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>On the potential director side, director candidates’ stock of human and social capital underlies their ability to contribute to the board and firm. Human capital includes business expertise, director status, home firm and other board strategies, other directorships, gender, and ethnicity. Social capital includes the individual’s network ties, individual reputation, and home firm and other board reputations. As previously mentioned, human and social capital are interrelated, and a potential director’s ability to provide monitoring and other critical resources is reflective of both. More recently, research has begun to recognize that individual skills beyond those directly related to board functions (i.e., influence techniques or ingratiation) may also play a role in obtaining board seats.</p>
<p>However, the outcome of director selection is not just the result of the coming together of the appointing firm and potential directors. Rather, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0149206311428671">Figure 1</xref>, this interaction occurs within the context of the social dynamics of the board and the external environment. As the social embeddedness perspective points out, firms, as well as boards and individuals, are social entities influenced by social norms and behaviors within (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0149206311428671">Khurana &amp; Pick, 2004</xref>). The market for corporate directors and director selection is a social process in which directors gain appointments from their relationships and engage in behaviors to influence selection decisions. On the firm side, CEOs and boards bargain to determine who will join their boards, and the selection decision reflects the relative power of CEO and the board. Related to this, board social cohesion and the overall market for corporate directors (or social elite) may be major determinants of the type of director selected to serve on a given board and what type of board a given individual seeks to join.</p>
<p>Although our review suggests an interactive process of firm needs, board dynamics, and potential director characteristics coming together to produce director selection, empirical testing is more often limited to one set of factors to the exclusion of the rest. For example, research following the rational economic perspective often focuses on the firm needs and how they affect board composition with little consideration for the social dynamics among directors or individual motivations and behaviors of director candidates. Conversely, research more focused on the social embeddedness perspective typically follows an approach in which the selection process is overwhelmingly influenced by the social processes that arise from human interaction, and the needs of the firm or social or human capital of the director (beyond influence skills) are largely ignored. Not surprisingly, research following the social embeddedness perspective has also been less likely to consider the roles and functions that directors might be expected to perform. Thus, research that examines more than one type of antecedent simultaneously would seem to hold great promise for future research.</p>
<p>Having called for more integrative research, we note that providing more integrative views of director selection is not an easy task. One way to develop a more integrative perspective of director selection may be to step back and focus on the actual selection process. The selection process lies somewhere in between the two perspectives. As we described in our review, the selection process is formally defined in the literature; however, the research, to this point, is limited in both its level of theoretical development and empirical testing. Research examining the social dynamics of director selection (e.g., CEO–board bargaining and director ingratiation) approaches this process perspective most closely. Future research may emphasize the interpersonal processes that emerge when there is an opening on a board. Starting at the beginning (the emergence of a board vacancy) would begin with consideration of how a firm defines its needs with respect to the director search and its search tactics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206311428671">Bazerman and Schoorman (1983</xref>) offer an early attempt at developing such an integrated, multisided perspective in their study of the creation of interlocking directorates.</p>
<p>An integrated perspective also may resolve some seemingly contradictory evidence noted in our review. For example, research espousing a more rational economic perspective suggests that directors who are CEOs can provide a number of benefits to the firm, including business expertise that can aid in monitoring and providing advice and counsel. Conversely, much of the research following a more socialized perspective suggests that the appointment of a CEO as an outside director may reflect the focal firm CEO’s attempt to gain a sympathetic director and maintain or increase his or her power. An integrative perspective may allow researchers to consider contextual or intervening variables from the appointing firm, board, and potential director sides that affect whether the selection of a current CEO of another for-profit corporation reflects the focal firm’s needs for a director, the board’s social dynamics, or the CEO’s desires to cultivate his or her own power (or a confluence of all three). We now turn to offering a number of specific areas in which an integrated approach may bear fruit in future research.</p>

<title>Answering a Fundamental Question</title>
<p>Research on director selection has offered a number of insights into the antecedents of the selection of a new director. However, one fundamental question still remains unanswered: Why do certain individuals accept board appointments? As Finkelstein and colleagues (2009: 253) suggest, “[T]he process of being offered, and accepting, a board appointment is still not well understood.” Our review confirms this statement and suggests that we have learned quite a bit about the surface-level factors that affect director selection; however, we still know very little about why particular director candidates accept an appointment. Seeking answers to this question may provide new insights into how the more rational and social dynamics of selection process play out on the potential director’s side.</p>
<p>This question is vitally important also because the costs of serving on a board have been exacerbated by recent corporate scandals and reactionary legislation, which have increased the workload and responsibilities of outside directors and increased the scrutiny of governance mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206311428671">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). Research also indicates that the home firms of executives joining other firms’ boards of directors may experience negative abnormal returns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206311428671">Fich, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-0149206311428671">Rosenstein &amp; Wyatt, 1994</xref>). And yet individuals are still apparently willing to serve in a capacity that can be professionally demanding and time-consuming and subjects the individual to potential legal costs in the event the board is sued for not fulfilling its fiduciary obligation to shareholders.</p>
<p>In their study of boards of directors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0149206311428671">Lorsch and MacIver (1989)</xref> delve into the questions of why individuals refuse or accept board appointments (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206311428671">Bacon &amp; Brown, 1975</xref>). The authors report the following reasons (in order of importance) for declining an offer to join a board: (a) “lack of time,” (b) “meeting conflicts,” (c) “conflict of interest,” (d) “could not play useful role,” (e) “no interest in firm’s industry,” (f) “uncertainty about firm’s future,” and (g) “personal liability.” The authors also provide anecdotal evidence of director rationale for declining offers. As one director indicated, “[Y]ou have so little time that you really can’t take on more than two if you want to do the job properly” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0149206311428671">1989</xref>: 24). Another director provided, “When I evaluate an offer to join a board, first I determine whether . . . there is a conflict of interest. Next I have to find out whether there will be a conflict of days” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0149206311428671">1989</xref>: 25).</p>
<p>Similarly, Lorsch and MacIver report that directors accept an offer to join a board based on (a) “quality of top management,” (b) “opportunity to learn,” (c) “challenge as director,” (d) “prestige of the firm,” (e) “potential growth of the firm,” (f) “opportunity to work with board members,” (g) “personal prestige,” (h) “compensation,” and (i) “major stock ownership.” In support of this perspective, a director states,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Serving on a board is a way to see how somebody else is doing the same thing you’re doing. I usually look at the company to see if they are a strong, growing firm, but I also look at the senior people to see if they’re interesting and if they’ll be involved in interesting problems. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0149206311428671">1989</xref>: 27)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite Lorsch and MacIver’s findings, research on director selection has yet to develop theoretical models, much less empirical support for an individual’s motivation to serve as an outside director or why certain individuals are more or less likely to accept an invitation to join a board. The evidence Lorsch and MacIver present is also potentially biased by the fact that their sample consisted of only current corporate directors. Because these directors have already self-selected, their responses may not be representative of all individuals considered for corporate directorships.</p>
<p>Addressing this fundamental question may offer a number of new directions for future research. For example, how do potential directors cognitively evaluate a board appointment opportunity? Is this decision process more socially or rationally driven? What individual-level motives provide the impetus for accepting a board seat? How do an individual’s career motives influence his or her willingness to serve on a corporate board? Does board service represent a career-length phenomenon? That is, does a director’s initial board appointment affect subsequent board appointments? Do directors manage their directorship careers by leaving and joining boards, much like executives in a labor market? Does serving on a board have the desired effect on the career? What drives a director’s willingness to serve on less established boards (e.g., boards of IPOs)? What is the role of financial incentives in enticing individuals to serve on boards?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section33-0149206311428671">
<title>A Two-Side Perspective—Combining Supply and Demand Views</title>
<p>Related to the two previous sections, future research could examine the director selection process as a two-sided matching problem that includes considerations of the supply and demand sides operating in the market for corporate directors (for examples, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-0149206311428671">Roth &amp; Sotomayor, 1990</xref>). Invariably, the selection and appointment of a director occurs when the needs of a firm and desires of a director candidate align. In other words, a match occurs when a firm has a need for a potential director and a director candidate who fulfills those needs and/or uses influence tactics to be appointed views the benefits as greater than the costs of service and the opportunity cost of waiting for a better appointment. However, because of the inherent difficulties of empirically capturing the complexities of a two-sided matching process, previous research has often focused on either the supply or demand characteristics of the process while neglecting the other.</p>
<p>Labor economics provides a strong theoretical basis for developing a matching perspective of director selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0149206311428671">Gale, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-0149206311428671">Roth &amp; Sotomayor, 1990</xref>). And, as previously mentioned, research recognizes the possibility of analyzing the director selection process from a labor market perspective (i.e., the market for corporate directors; G. F. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206311428671">Davis, 1993</xref>). Firms in the market for directors represent the demand side in the market, and director candidates represent the labor supply available to fill this demand. The market for corporate directors represents a unique labor market context given that a single director may serve concurrently on multiple boards and may accept more than one appointment at a time. Conversely, in typical labor markets, the selection process represents a many-to-one matching problem in that a single employer may hire several employees, but the employees do not join multiple firms simultaneously.</p>
<p>A matching perspective of director selection will require the employment of more sophisticated theorizing and methodological approaches to represent the selection process. From a theoretical perspective, research will need to delve into the dual motivations of potential directors and firms evaluating candidates. Integrating the research review here may be an initial step in understanding how the alignment of directors and firms emerges. Empirically, recent research in the management literature may provide some guidance to confronting the empirical challenges. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0149206311428671">Mitsuhashi and Greve’s (2009)</xref> research on alliance formation may offer insights into approaching the matching problem of director selection. In this case, data limitations make assessing all potential matches difficult; however, using a random sample of potential matches or a limited sample of potential board seats may overcome some of these challenges. Following their approach, director selection research may attempt to limit the sample of potential director-board matches by focusing on a small population of directors and firms. For example, on the supply side, a sample of potential directors may include all CEOs in the <italic>Fortune</italic> 100, and, on the demand side, a sample of potential firms may include all <italic>Fortune</italic> 500 firms. Then, each potential match would represent an observation with director- and firm- or board-level data for each potential match. This approach would allow researchers to empirically compare actual matches with potential matches. Although this approach is not without its limitations, it does provide a closer approximation of the actual director selection process, and we believe this represents a critical area for future research.</p>

<sec id="section34-0149206311428671">
<title>How Do Other Governance Mechanisms Influence the Director Selection Process?</title>
<p>Boards of directors represent only one of several governance mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0149206311428671">Jensen &amp; Meckling, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-0149206311428671">Shleifer &amp; Vishny, 1997</xref>). Although governance research recognizes a number of different governance mechanisms, including ownership concentration, executive leadership structure, and the market for corporate control, director selection research often considers the director selection process as independent of these other governance mechanisms. However, research suggests that governance mechanisms may interact in ways that may complement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0149206311428671">Kosnik, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr151-0149206311428671">Tosi, Katz, &amp; Gomez-Mejia, 1997</xref>) or substitute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206311428671">Beatty &amp; Zajac, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-0149206311428671">Rediker &amp; Seth, 1995</xref>) for one another. In either case, the other governance mechanisms currently in place may directly influence the director selection process and, in turn, the ultimate selection. This interaction of governance mechanisms suggests that research on director selection should consider how other governance mechanisms influence the director selection process.</p>
<p>For example, owners with larger shareholdings have greater incentives to ensure that management acts in their (the large owners’) best interests, and these owners may have significant power to enforce their preferences about management actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-0149206311428671">Shleifer &amp; Vishny, 1997</xref>). Similarly, these owners may have greater influence in who is nominated and appointed to a board. In support of this perspective, in 2010, the SEC adopted changes to the federal proxy rules to facilitate shareholder rights to nominate and elect directors. This ruling change requires that companies include individuals nominated by beneficial shareholders alongside those individuals nominated by management. In this regard, other governance mechanisms may have a direct influence on the selection process. These new changes raise a number of important questions. For example, do owners have different preferences for the type of individual selected to serve?</p>
<p>As examples related to other governance mechanisms, what role does CEO equity compensation have on his or her preferences regarding new directors? Does CEO duality have an effect on the selection process or outcome? How do changes in governance mechanisms affect the board? In short, there is rich potential when one considers interactions among governance mechanisms and the effect on director selection.</p>
<p>Another possible extension may be to simultaneously consider current top management team and board members when examining director selection. In this approach, from a rational perspective, the director selection choice may be based on how the potential director’s skills, knowledge, and other resources complement those of executives of the top management team and not just the existing board members. Questions might include the following: Do the backgrounds of the top management team members influence new director selection? Does top management team homogeneity or heterogeneity reflect similarly on the composition of the board of directors? How might top management team behavioral integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0149206311428671">Hambrick, 1994</xref>) influence the types of individuals selected for a board? Are there other social processes at work within the firm that affect new director selection?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section35-0149206311428671">
<title>Examining the Gray Director</title>
<p>Much of the previous research on director selection and board composition in general has used the simple director categorization of insiders versus outsiders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206311428671">Dalton, Hitt, Certo, &amp; Dalton, 2007</xref>). However, research suggests that this dichotomous representation of directors may be an oversimplification as some directors do not easily fall into the insider or independent–outsider categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206311428671">Baysinger &amp; Zardkoohi, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206311428671">Finkelstein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0149206311428671">Hillman et al., 2000</xref>). In particular, the gray director—a director who is not an employee of the focal firm but has substantial business dealings with it—represents an understudied phenomenon in the selection process.</p>
<p>Gray directors are clearly not independent (according to the recent Sarbanes-Oxley legislation), but their implications for governance practices are ambiguous. For example, from their perspective of director identities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0149206311428671">Hillman and colleagues (2008)</xref> argue that directors may identify with other organizational stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, and this identification may lead them to monitor and provide resources to benefit those other stakeholders. In this scenario, a gray director who has a strong identification with an external stakeholder may be more likely to monitor for the benefit of that stakeholder. At the same time, such a director’s willingness to provide resources to a firm may exhibit a curvilinear relationship such that at some level of identification, the director may actually draw resources from the focal firm to benefit the stakeholder group. Because of their relationship with the focal firm and its external stakeholders, the selection of gray directors may represent unique challenges during the selection process. Future research may begin to unravel the underlying firm-level motivations for selecting gray directors. The selection of a gray director also represents the intersection of the rational and socially embedded perspectives. On one hand, these directors may be brought on to provide critical resources (i.e., linkages to resource providers and stakeholders). However, at the same time, these director appointments are reflective of a firm’s socially embedded contexts and attempts to manage this interdependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0149206311428671">Pfeffer &amp; Salancik, 1978</xref>).</p>

<title>Director Selection during Organizational Decline</title>
<p>As our review indicates, a fair amount of research considers different organizational contexts and how these contexts influence director selection decisions; however, there is still great opportunity to further contextualize the director selection process. Board scholars often suggest that firm context determines the importance of boards (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206311428671">Chatterjee &amp; Harrison, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr169-0149206311428671">Zahra &amp; Pearce, 1989</xref>). In certain contexts, the decision of who serves on these boards may be less critical if the board plays a less significant role in the organization. Thus, context is an important factor in predicting who will be selected to serve on a board and why.</p>
<p>One context, in particular, that may influence director selection is organizational decline. Research suggests that directors may play some of their most important roles in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206311428671">Chatterjee &amp; Harrison, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0149206311428671">Lorsch &amp; MacIver, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr167-0149206311428671">Withers, Corley, &amp; Hillman, in press</xref>). “Organizational decline is a condition in which a substantial, absolute decrease in an organization’s resource base occurs over a specified period of time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206311428671">Cameron, Kim, &amp; Whetten, 1987</xref>: 224). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0149206311428671">Lorsch and MacIver (1989)</xref> suggest, organizational decline often derives from a gradually emerging crisis that reflects both internal and external factors facing an organization. The firm’s resource availability begins to decrease as external constituents begin to see indicators of poor performance, and human capital (in the form of executives and other employees) begins to leave the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0149206311428671">Hambrick &amp; D’Aveni, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr164-0149206311428671">Whetten, 1980</xref>). In this situation, directors can provide both monitoring and advice and counsel to address underlying causes of decline and resources to help enact corrective actions. However, director exit is often a part of the downward spiral that some firms find themselves in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206311428671">Finkelstein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0149206311428671">Hambrick &amp; D’Aveni, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Because of the importance of directors in declining firms and the possible exit of some directors, the ability to attract directors that can provide monitoring and critical resources is imperative for turnaround efforts. Nonetheless, declining firms also face the challenge of attracting directors to a situation that may be very unattractive because of the time commitment and reputational costs that accompany trying to enact a turnaround. Thus, research is needed to explore how firms in these decline (or other crises) situations engage in the director selection process. For example, how do potentially stigmatized firms attract directors to their boards? What incentives might be provided to compensate directors for their time and the potential risks they face? How are directors who join a distressed firm perceived or valued by the market for corporate directors?</p>

<title>Director Selection in a Post–Sarbanes-Oxley World</title>
<p>As we mentioned in describing the formal process, the regulatory and institutional environments in which it occurs also affect director selection. No regulatory change has had the potential for greater impact on the selection process than Sarbanes-Oxley and the accompanying listing requirement changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0149206311428671">Monks &amp; Minow, 2004</xref>). Sarbanes-Oxley regulation changed the requirements for committee membership, requiring independent directors to serve on audit committees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206311428671">Green, 2005</xref>). Although this regulation did not directly address board composition or director selection processes, its impact on the listing requirements of the major stock exchanges has, in turn, influenced the selection process. For example, the New York Stock Exchange now requires that all listed firms have a governance committee composed entirely of independent outsiders, defines clearly what an independent outsider is, and mandates clear responsibilities for the committee. Those responsibilities include CEO performance evaluation and all new director nominations. As Hoskisson and colleagues (2009) report, after these changes, board independence increased as firms conformed to these institutional pressures (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0149206311428671">Linck, Netter, &amp; Yang, 2009</xref>). However, research is only beginning to take stock of the overall impact these institutional reforms have had on boards, board composition, and overall governance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0149206311428671">Linck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-0149206311428671">Wintoki, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>For example, research is documenting a shift in the types of directors who are appointed to boards. Studying an earlier time period (i.e., 1973–1994), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0149206311428671">Mizruchi and colleagues (2006)</xref> find a decreasing proportion of bankers on corporate boards. The authors suggest that this decline is in part the result of the increasing prominence of chief financial officers. As the authors posit,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The increased prominence of the CFO meant that the CEO now had a financial specialist to consult on a regular basis. Bankers on the board as advisors were no longer as essential, which may account for their decline. Moreover, the financial tools available to the firm were becoming increasingly complex, and reliance on traditional sources of funding from banks and insurance companies declined. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0149206311428671">2006</xref>: 316)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0149206311428671">Linck and colleagues (2009)</xref> find an increase in the proportion of financial experts (as well other support specialists and retired executives) in response to the requirements of having a designated financial expert on each board. Similarly, some executives are less likely to accept offers to serve as outside directors as a result of the increased personal risk of directorship service. In turn, these changes have increased the demand for outside directors while at the same time reducing the willingness of potential directors to serve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0149206311428671">Linck et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>As Sarbanes-Oxley and the accompanying listing requirement changes continue to have far-reaching impacts on the board, a number of areas for future research appear promising. For example, are there any unintended consequences of these regulatory and listing requirements that have influenced director selection? How does the decline in the number of inside directors affect board processes and overall governance? How do firms select new outside directors to compensate for the knowledge that insider directors formerly brought to boards? How have director incentives changed to accommodate the increase in personal risk for outside directors? Have these institutional changes reduced CEO influence over this selection process? If so, are CEOs finding more indirect ways to influence the selection process?</p>
<p>Returning to the question of why individuals are willing to serve, these recent regulatory changes also influence the candidates who are willing to serve on corporate boards. What is the profile of a current executive willing to serve on another board? What are the individual’s personal motivations underlying the decision to join a board? With more support specialists and retired executives on the board, does this change the subsequent director selection decision?</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our review has highlighted a number of promising avenues for future research on director selection. By reviewing the state of knowledge on director selection and providing some integration across the two most frequent approaches taken (rational economic and social embeddedness), we hope to prompt future research on director selection. Our discussion section has highlighted a number of research questions and issues that we believe will bear fruit. We believe that the future holds great promise for director selection research and for research about corporate governance generally.</p>

<p>This description of the director selection process reflects director selection in public corporations. Research has recognized that smaller firms face unique challenges. For example, in selecting outside directors, small family firms must “orchestrate and exploit <italic>the creative tensions between entrepreneurialism, paternalism and managerialism</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0149206311428671">Johannisson &amp; Huse, 2000</xref>: 375). In addition, smaller firms are less likely to provide disclosures regarding their board selection procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0149206311428671">Holder-Webb, Cohen, Nath, &amp; Wood, 2008</xref>).</p>
