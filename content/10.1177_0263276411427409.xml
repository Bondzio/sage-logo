<abstract>
<p>This article explores the contemporary scientific practice of human genome science in light of Michel Foucault’s articulation of the problem of population. Rather than transcending the politics of social categories and identities, human genome research mobilizes many different kinds of populations. How then might we aim to avoid overgeneralized readings of the refiguring of human difference in the life sciences and grapple with the multiple and contradictory logics of population classification? In exploring the study of human variation through the case of the ‘Quebec founder population’ at a private genome research laboratory in Canada, the article argues that the power to define and shape meanings of human variation and to organize vitality is not held by any one institution or form of scientific practice. While molecular genomics may be transforming conceptions of human difference, the laboratory is only one of many places where human genomic variation accrues value, meaning and relevance. Molecular configurations of human difference gain meaning through a traffic in populations that extends beyond the laboratory. In the case explored here this traffic in populations is constituted within a nexus of empire, national census practices and contemporary articulations of multicultural policies.</p>

<p>To do research you need populations. (Bioethicist, Montreal, 2007)</p></disp-quote>
<p>A decade ago, at the culmination of the Human Genome Project, the promises of genomics were twofold: the biological basis of disease would be unlocked and intervened upon, and the idea that there existed relevant biological differences relating to race would be obliterated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0263276411427409">NHGRI, 2000</xref>). However, subsequent years of post-Human Genome Project research have done neither of these things. What has emerged is a highly complex biology of disease that has both undermined and revolutionized previous understandings of human genetics and molecular biology. Moreover, rather than an overwhelming focus on human similarity, it is the study of differences between populations and groups that is seen to hold the key for turning genomic science into genomic medicine. The study of human genomes has turned out to be significantly more complicated than originally conceived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0263276411427409">Keller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0263276411427409">Lander, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0263276411427409">Lock, 2005</xref>). Indeed, life sciences research is built on multifarious and often changing understandings of genomes, biology and biomedicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0263276411427409">Barnes and Dupre, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276411427409">Clarke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0263276411427409">Rose, 2007</xref>). Yet while the idea of the gene as a discrete and bounded entity has come undone in contemporary biology, we have also witnessed what is being characterized as the re-biologization of race and are grappling with the new ways life sciences research is grouping human populations. In this article I explore these developments through a series of questions: what kinds of configurations of human difference come to matter in genomics research? How might different kinds of difference come to matter in national and local contexts? Furthermore, how should we approach concerns over the naturalization of human groups in the life sciences while attending to both local dynamics and globalizing processes in order to prevent over-generalized readings of how population concepts operate in human genome science?</p>
<p>In order to address these questions and avoid over-generalized readings of the refiguring of human difference, this article explores national and local contexts in Canada. In doing so, it demonstrates both the specificity of the <italic>making</italic> of human difference and also highlights the connections between arenas of genome research that are simultaneously molecular, national and global. The article begins by outlining how we might think the problem of population. Drawing on Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276411427409">Foucault’s (2003)</xref> metaphor of the concept of population as a body with too many heads to count, I suggest that we recognize the multiplicity and unruly nature of population categories as they are constituted through multiple registers and distributed across a broad array of organizations and governing bodies. The article explores the work of a private genome research laboratory in the Canadian province of Quebec. Drawing on interviews and documentary analysis, the article investigates the scientific practices of this laboratory, which conducts genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on what the company calls the ‘Quebec founder population’. GWAS, which form a significant component of biomedical genomics today, are based on correlating variation in DNA sequences with disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0263276411427409">Fujimura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0263276411427409">Kennedy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0263276411427409">Rose, 2008</xref>). The company uses samples of DNA from the Quebec founder population on the basis that this population features high levels of genetic homogeneity. The research firm draws on the Quebec founder population as a self-evident category, whose existence is confirmed by sets of genealogical records of births, deaths and marriages dating back to the 17th century. In this case, the frontier colonialism of the New World, consolidated through a range of sites such as national census practices, founding myths of the nation-state, 17th-century genealogical records and multicultural politics, becomes explicitly linked to the practices of what might be called frontier science. In connecting these different frontiers, however, I do not argue that new genomic techniques are a straightforward reproduction of the population management of frontier colonialism. Rather, I will show how the study of human genomes extends and constantly moves beyond the limits of the molecular scale for meaning, as well as scientific and social relevance.</p>
<p>The power to define and shape meanings of human variation and to organize vitality is not held by any one institution or form of scientific practice. Rather, there are multiple and contradictory logics of population difference that intersect with each other in the study of human genome variation. Thus, while genomics may be transforming conceptions of human difference, the laboratory is only one of many places where human genomic variation accrues value, meaning and relevance. In this regard I argue that it is crucial to explore not just an increasing emphasis on molecularization but also a range of other activities and sites that constitute and shape articulations of human difference. The latter half of the article is therefore dedicated to exploring how molecular configurations of human difference gain meaning through a traffic in populations that extends beyond the laboratory. In the case explored here, this traffic in populations is constituted within a nexus of empire, national census practices and contemporary articulations of multicultural policies in Canada.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0263276411427409"><title>A Body with Many Heads: The Concept of Population</title>
<p>While contemporary genomic research promises personalized medicine (or measures of risk) targeted at the level of the individual, it is primarily the comparison of groups and populations that drives human genome research. Despite the fact that individual genotyping costs continue to fall, the study of the human genome in relation to health and disease is fundamentally directed at population groups and the comparison of data gleaned in multiple ways from the study of such groups. This focus on populations in genome and biomedical research has revitalized debates about histories of human difference, ancestry and origin, as well as contemporary articulations of the settler, native, national and multicultural subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0263276411427409">Duster, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0263276411427409">Nash, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0263276411427409">Nelson, 2008</xref>; Whitmarsh and Jones, 2010). Recent work has shown that concepts of ‘race’, ‘ethnicity’ and ‘ancestry’ (to name only a few of the categorical schemas at play in studies on human genomic variation) are difficult to untangle in genetic studies as they often overlap and become conflated with one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0263276411427409">Feldman and Lewontin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0263276411427409">Fujimura et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, the meaning of terms such as ‘race’, ‘ethnicity’ and ‘ancestry’ vary greatly depending on local, regional and national context. For example, the meaning and use of the same population category changes depending upon national context where a range of variables in relation to health care provisions, census statistics and research programmes differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0263276411427409">Mozersky and Galen, 2010</xref>). While there is no doubt that large-scale genome science is a highly specialized global endeavour, these specificities suggest that the construction of population groups in contemporary genome science requires more sustained attention to the local dynamism of their production and consumption.</p>
<p>Populations, whether constructed through the latest statistical algorithms to divide human samples in the lab, or presented as a box to tick on a national census, are what Amade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0263276411427409">M’charek (2005</xref>) calls ‘technologically assisted categories’. This means that populations are enacted by the very technologies which aim to study them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0263276411427409">M’charek, 2005</xref>: 15). Hence, there is no single answer to the question <italic>what is a population?</italic> Indeed, there are many. This is an important epistemological and practical starting point for considering the concept of population. It is a starting point that I seek to emphasize rather than transcend, on the basis that it helps one to think the problem of population. Many scholars have demonstrated the diverse ways by which modern government takes the population as its primary object, or in other words, how the terrain of government is populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0263276411427409">Hacking, 1990</xref>: 22; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0263276411427409">Haraway, 1997</xref>: 219; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0263276411427409">Miller and Rose, 2008</xref>: 27). Much of this work engages with Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0263276411427409">Foucault’s (1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276411427409">2003</xref>) formulation of the population concept in relation to biopolitics. However, as opposed to focusing on a detailed discussion of biopolitics, I want to highlight one aspect of the population concept articulated by Foucault. In describing the rise of statistical knowledge produced through the population concept, such as birth rates, death rates, forecasting and estimates, Foucault explains that the population in modern government is neither a social nor an individual body, but rather ‘it is a new body, a multiple body, a body with so many heads that, while they might not be infinite in number, cannot necessarily be counted’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0263276411427409">2003</xref>: 245). This articulation of population as a body with too many heads to count illuminates both the multiple constructions of populations as well as their extraordinary importance for modern governance. The point to emphasize then is that regardless of how one differently interprets the stakes of contemporary biopolitical contexts (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0263276411427409">Agamben, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0263276411427409">Hardt and Negri, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0263276411427409">Rabinow and Rose, 2006</xref>) the population imagination has not faded in the post-genomic era.</p>
<p>Population categories are not only multiple but they are also unruly entities which tend to shirk any kind of discipline imposed upon them. The attempted regulation of population categories in DNA sequencing projects such as the International Haplotype Map Project illustrates these unruly aspects of population categories. In 2002 the International HapMap Project was set up to catalogue patterns of common genetic variation in human populations in order to inform and enable genome-wide studies. Almost any study published today on human health genomics uses the information established through the three phases of this project, which first identified common genetic variants in three population groups with African, Asian and European ancestry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0263276411427409">1</xref></sup> Detailed instructions on how to refer to the three ancestral categories first catalogued by HapMap scientists were constructed in efforts to be consistent, scientifically responsible and to dispel notions that the project equated geographical ancestry with racial groupings (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276411427409">HapMap, 2009b</xref>). Despite all this terminological care, however, there is an absolute plethora of terms used to describe HapMap populations which draw on various population typologies of race, ancestry and continental geography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0263276411427409">Reardon, 2007</xref>). Populations, in this regard, are notoriously slippery and it would be a mistake to assume that one can give a full account of, track, capture and regulate population categories in any systematic way. This is why attempts to regulate or resolve issues of race and genomics on the basis of prescribing categorical schemas to follow (such as in the HapMap population naming exercise) are often destined to fail.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0263276411427409">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, articulating these aspects of the population concept does not make the problem of population disappear. This is because the problem of population is a problem of power and politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276411427409">Foucault, 2003</xref>: 245). Population categories can preclude other, perhaps better ways of thinking and lead to what is often called reification, naturalization or re-biologization. The processes by which population categories have come to be thought of as natural and sorted into hierarchies are the same processes that facilitate dehumanization and systemic racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0263276411427409">Gilman, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0263276411427409">McClintock, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0263276411427409">Schiebinger, 1993</xref>). However, processes of reification, essentialism or naturalization are not necessarily themselves an evil. This is to say that essentialism does not necessarily have an essence itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0263276411427409">Fuss, 1989</xref>). In this regard it is not enough to only ask the question: do scientists reify categories of race/ethnicity/ancestry/population in studies of human genomic variation? This is because the answer will almost always, to some degree, be yes. In what follows, then, I argue that we need to embrace this multiplicity of populations as a starting point for analysis, not seek to transcend it. We should thus opt for an approach that interrogates what is at stake in population constructions, how they are negotiated by those both inside and outside the life sciences, as well as how categories travel and what is lost, or gained, in the process of producing genomic knowledge on human difference.</p>
<p>Within the field of biomedical genomics, discourses of human difference operate in heterogeneous zones where laboratories, genealogical databases, ethics committees, government agencies, hospitals and the nation-state meet. In the case examined here I will demonstrate how the French settlers who lived in the territory now known as Quebec have come to be at the forefront of cutting-edge genome studies on human variation and disease. Here a settler group becomes transformed into a genetically homogeneous population by a diverse set of genealogists, historical demographers, epidemiologists and geneticists. In this regard, the epistemic privilege of the laboratory in making and producing scientific facts about human difference is superseded by, or at least displaced through, the integration of diverse arenas and modes of human categorization that together constitute the production of genomic knowledge. A nexus of empire, national census practices and contemporary multicultural policy in Canada provides a set of connections from which to trace the multiple registers where human genomic studies accrue value and meaning. It is across these multiple and intermediate registers that the populations of human genomic research gain their purchase. There is no single logic of human or group difference governing current genomic science. Populations become operationalized along multiple lines in studies of human genomic variation in the name of health. Highlighting these multiple, and at times contradictory, logics of population construction in Canada adds a geopolitical perspective to globally connected scientific practice. However, in adding another geopolitical perspective to this field of enquiry (which is heavily dominated by accounts from the United States), the point is to illuminate how the use of populations is itself affected and has affected our ‘population thinking’ in social critiques of scientific practice. If, as Ian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0263276411427409">Hacking</xref> argues, ‘a concept is nothing more than a word in its sites’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276411427409">2002</xref>: 17), then the question of the population concept, not just population categories, needs to be reactivated in empirically grounded accounts of human scientific research.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0263276411427409"><title>Varied Variation</title>
<p>The high-throughput study of human DNA (or genomics) focuses on small-scale variations at the nucleotide level of the four bases (A, C, T and G) that make up genetic sequences. This study of the molecular changes in the human genome is a multifaceted process. As an approach to the study of human DNA, genomics requires the involvement not only of geneticists and molecular biologists, but also of statisticians, computational biologists, and often project managers, ethicists and communications experts. It also requires sophisticated equipment designed to visualize and represent genetic information at the molecular level, such as sequencers, along with the computational power required to analyse biological information and the capacity to store and retrieve these large amounts of data.</p>
<p>For genomic researchers, the genome sequences of humans represent foundational information for biology and biomedicine. Over the last ten to fifteen years, advances in molecular biology and genetics have made it faster and cheaper to detect and sequence genetic variation in individuals and human groups. These developments stem from a long history that began with the recognition of DNA as hereditary material, the determination of its structure, the elucidation of the genetic code, and the development of recombinant DNA technologies and ever-faster methods for sequencing DNA. In this regard, the emergence of genomics has diverse and complex intersections with the genetics that preceded it. Barry Barnes and John Dupre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0263276411427409">2008</xref>: 3) usefully emphasize that the central difference between genetics and genomics is one of increasing powers and capacities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0263276411427409">3</xref></sup> Genomics is thus a central part, but not the only part, of larger transformations in the life sciences becoming molecularized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0263276411427409">Barnes and Dupre, 2008</xref>: 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0263276411427409">Rose, 2007</xref>: 5–6). Genomes themselves are commonly understood as the hereditary material of an organism, and genomics as ‘the assemblage of techniques, tools, and concepts for producing, analyzing, and manipulating genomes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0263276411427409">Calvert, 2007</xref>: 209).</p>
<p>While there have been concerns over the problem of genetic determinism and geneticization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0263276411427409">Lippman, 1992</xref>), the field of genomics has had a powerful impact within the life sciences themselves. Genes are no longer conceptualized as deterministic or discrete entities in light of pressing questions relating to processes of regulation and expression in the genome (e.g. how genes are turned on and off). In this regard there has been no simple or unbridled translation of genomics research into biomedicine. Yet, as theorists have noted, sweeping claims continue to be made about the promise of genomics for medicine and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0263276411427409">Lock, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0263276411427409">Wynne, 2005</xref>). There is complex interplay, then, between forms of reductionism and the reality that genomic researchers find themselves in as the promise of genomic medicine gains further momentum, yet less and less clarity in regard to how the genome interacts with cellular functions.</p>
<p>Cataloguing and capturing human variation at the nucleotide level is central to the study of human disease. This is because it is areas of nucleotide variation in DNA sequences which are thought to correlate with the expression of a particular disease. Biomedical genomics thus has an overwhelming focus on the study of populations and their comparison. This focus has resulted in an explosion of debate and concern among academics, scientists and public policy experts over the links between human genetic variation and the reinvigoration of race-related biomedicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0263276411427409">Kahn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0263276411427409">Martin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0263276411427409">Risch et al., 2002</xref>). These debates highlight that the science of human genome variation and its relationship to disease is a contested field which is not necessarily unified. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to the diversity of methodologies and choices available to genetic researchers, suggesting that the study of human genetic variation is varied and contingent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0263276411427409">Fujimura et al., 2010</xref>: 180). The exploration of different national contexts has shown that local politics play a significant role in the negotiation and use of population categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0263276411427409">Gibbon et al., 2010</xref>). With this in mind, I argue below that the power to define and shape meanings of human variation and to organize vitality is not held by one institution or form of scientific practice. Rather, there are multiple and contradictory logics which make the study of human genomic variation both frustrating and, at times, hard to pin down. Within the field of biomedical genomics there is a variety of different ways in which scientists both produce and consume populations. Simply put, there are varied approaches to human variation.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0263276411427409"><title>Founder Populations and Frontier Technologies</title>
<p>Located in the Montreal suburb of St Laurent, Genizon Biosciences Inc. occupies a large yet unassuming warehouse-like building. Like other genetics research companies started through venture capital investment, it exists on shaky ground in its attempts to bring returns on investment through the gene-hunting of medical genetics and high-throughput genome science. The majority of work at the company is dedicated to identifying biomarkers in common diseases (such as cancer) using GWAS. GWAS seek to define genetic variation associated with disease susceptibility where more than one area of the genome is implicated or may have a modest effect. The studies statistically compare up to thousands of samples of people who have a disease (cases) and people who do not (controls) in order to ascertain whether certain biological markers (namely sequences of DNA) are associated with the disease under study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276411427409">Fujimura and Rajagopalan, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Most often GWAS involve the study of a particular kind of molecular variation called single-nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs (pronounced snips). A SNP is a single base of DNA whose nucleotide identity (A, T, C and G) varies among members of a species. To be considered a SNP, the single-base pair changes must occur at a frequency of more than 1 percent in the population under study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0263276411427409">Knight, 2009</xref>). Rather than examining specific candidate genes, researchers now examine between hundreds and thousands of locations on genomic sequences where SNPs have been identified. These studies are based on a hypothesis which has undergirded significant investment in sequencing human variation over the last seven years called the ‘common disease–common variant hypothesis’. This is the idea that ‘the risk of contracting common diseases is influenced by genetic variants that are relatively common in populations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0263276411427409">HapMap, 2009a</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0263276411427409">4</xref></sup> The significant point to pick out is that SNPs are biological markers which are not themselves thought to be responsible for a disease, but which point to the location on the genome where a sequence may confer an increased or decreased susceptibility to a disease. In the case of SNPs, correlation does not signify disease causality. Kaushik Sunder Rajan explains that this means that SNPs can ‘shade into disease but do not constitute one’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0263276411427409">2006</xref>: 161). In other words, GWAS currently scan for common SNP markers, not for the specific causative functional variants of a specific disease.</p>
<p>SNPs have mobilized new forms of population politics but SNPs are only a text, a string of As, Cs, Ts and Gs. What happens between the identification of SNPs and the potential health interventions offered by genomic research involves a vast configuration of distributed technologies. With regard to GWAS, there are aspects of clinical work, sample collection, national census statistics and political doctrines such as multiculturalism which need to be read alongside SNPs. Thus, while it may be the case that molecular biology is far more non-deterministic and open-ended than it ever has been before, studies of human genomic variation, such as GWAS, still must pass through a series of scales and grids (molecular, national and global, to name a few) that constrain, define and limit their promises.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0263276411427409"><title>Turning Colonial History into Genotypes?</title>
<p>When I met with a senior geneticist at the Genizon research laboratory our discussions did not begin with the nuts and bolts of cutting-edge genome science. Rather, our discussion began with a history lesson regarding the colonial settlement of Quebec and specifically the people who settled along the St Lawrence River. The geneticist showed me images of old and weathered maps on his computer marking out the settlements of the populations on which the company’s business plan is based: what it calls the ‘Quebec founder population’. Descended from what this scientist described as ‘a limited number of ancestors and isolated from intermarriage’, the Quebec founder population has high levels of genetic homogeneity, making it ‘one of the best founder populations in the world for gene discovery’ (interview, 2007, Montreal). Pointing to the maps displayed on his computer, the scientist told me that it was linguistic and religious barriers that discouraged the ‘admixture’ of this population with, for example, Protestant English-speaking colonists and other groups, thus giving rise to a founder effect. As a concept in genetics a founder effect refers to the loss of genetic variation in a population which has been established by a small number of people from a larger population. Founder populations, because they are more genetically homogeneous than other populations, are seen to have less genetic noise and are thus ‘easier’ to work with in GWAS (interview, 2007, Montreal).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0263276411427409">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Genizon’s approach is premised on the idea that SNP markers can be identified more easily in specific population groups where a disease has a high frequency and the genetic background is presumed to be more homogeneous. As was explained to me by the geneticist, the homogeneity of the Quebec founder population is used to enhance risk calculations. Genizon structures its GWAS according to the hypothesis that the homogeneity of the background will enable disease-linked SNPs to show up more clearly in smaller sample sizes:<disp-quote>
<p>The way to look at this is there is a thing called relative risk, which is the increased risk you have of having disease given you have this gene. … These genes we are finding for complex diseases like type 2 diabetes are between one and two. One means there is no increased risk at all. … But if you get a homogeneous situation it raises relative risk a little bit because you are defining your population more precisely and it’s more homogeneous, then you can get away with using a lot fewer samples. This is our hypothesis. (interview, 2007, Montreal)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Genetically homogeneous samples are intended to increase statistical power for gene discovery. The idea is that homogeneous samples should decrease the possibility of false-positive associations between variations and disease. Samples from French Canadians currently living in Quebec are eagerly sought after by the company, and are then turned into genotypes in the hopes that their homogeneity will provide a better basis to detect disease-related genetic variation. The company takes samples only from people with four ‘French grandparents’ at hospitals in Quebec by clinicians with whom the company works. The samples (about 50,000 of them so far) are stored in a case control biobank that sits adjacent to the large lab in four storage refrigerators. In another corner of the lab sit Illumina bead stations, through which the samples are genotyped. Supporting the analysis of the massive amount of data produced by these machines are specially developed ‘in-house analysis and algorithms’, written by computational biologists, statisticians and information technology experts who are employed by the firm.</p>
<p>The researchers at this firm did not themselves calculate the percentage of genes that particular French families contributed to the supposedly homogeneous gene pool of the Quebec founder population. They rely on already existing genealogical databases that have been developed in Quebec, and that are accessible to a variety of researchers. These databases consist of the aggregation of names and dates across centuries of church baptism, marriage and burial records, which are then turned into family trees. These genealogies are then matched with genetic data across a number of studies and institutions. It is here that the evolution of genes and their distribution meets up explicitly with the colonial settlement of Canada and relations between settlers and natives. Nina Kohli-Laven, an anthropologist who has studied these genealogical databases in Quebec, argues that the construction of these databases has ‘effectively overlooked the presence of non-Europeans in North American population histories, impacting the basic assumptions of subsequent genetic epidemiological studies’ (2007–8: 7). For example, Kohli-Laven explains that historical demographers rely heavily on parish records of births, deaths and marriages in Quebec from the 17th century onwards. These registers identify people through surnames. However, during colonization many indigenous people were given French Catholic names when they married French settlers or converted to Christianity and were then put into parish records (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0263276411427409">Kohli-Laven, 2007</xref>–8).</p>
<p>The emphasis on the homogeneity and purity of the Quebec founder population, then, is laden with historical negotiations of racialized population mixing in the settlement of the new world. The assumptions embedded in the self-evident nature of the Quebec founder population as a genetic isolate and founder population has roots that extend far deeper than the more recent developments of SNP analysis. While some of the methods and techniques of parsing human groups into populations with certain nucleotide frequencies might be new, the populations of GWAS, in this case, are intermeshed with specific colonial narratives. The story of the Quebec founder population is itself a very specific story which has the effect of silencing a complex set of both intimate and political relationships between the original inhabitants of Canada and colonial settlers. In this regard the meaning and relevance of the Quebec founder population extends far beyond the laboratory.</p></sec></sec>

<p>Both Canada’s contemporary national aspirations as a representative for multicultural harmony and its former colonial ambitions are intimately related to the politics of form, practice and narrative in human genomic variation. Indeed, as the case of the Quebec founder population highlights, older technologies of group categorization, such as genealogical records, are fundamental to understanding and approaching what might be considered ‘new’ genomic techniques and technologies. A census, for example, facilitates the statistical representation of populations and census categories are often imported, or versions of them may be used in clinical recruitment, biobanking and genome analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0263276411427409">Epstein, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0263276411427409">Smart et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>As a nation-state Canada is relatively young, becoming a dominion of the British Empire in 1867 and only gaining full autonomy from Britain in 1982. In this regard, Canada has a reputation of having little history of its own<italic>,</italic> but a significant amount of territory as the world’s second largest country. The notion that Canada has more geography than history reflects a persistent theme in the national imaginary of Canada as a vast expanse of unoccupied land (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0263276411427409">Piper, 2002</xref>). This idea, very much a part of settler society narratives, obfuscates the complex early history between settler colonists and the indigenous people in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0263276411427409">Van Kirk, 1980</xref>). Indeed, the making of Canada hinged upon the success of policies and practices that governed meanings of human difference. In the 19th century, these processes involved carefully written, legally binding racialized definitions of groups aimed primarily at classifying the indigenous peoples who inhabited the territory the British Empire wanted to enclose under the name Canada.</p>
<p>The settlement of Canada was thus partly a question of what <italic>desirable</italic> populations were to make up the nation. This was commented on by British journalist H.R. Whates, who in 1905 travelled to Canada to undertake a broad survey of the suitability (or otherwise) of the Dominion of Canada for English emigration (1906). In his book, he laments the settlement of Canada by not so desirable population groups:<disp-quote>
<p>Put shortly, the fundamental facts are these: In Canada, as in other self-governing Colonies, there are vast areas of uninhabited Crown land reserves of territory for our racial increase for centuries to come … and, in Canada, we are filling up the Empire with Russian and Galician Jews, Poles, Armenians, Greeks, Turks, Syrians, Arabs, Chinese, Japanese and other peoples who, however estimable, are not the material of which the British Empire of the future should be built. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0263276411427409">Whates, 1906</xref>: viii)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>I have quoted at length from this book because Whates’ remark highlights how governing the nation involved making sure the ‘right kinds’ of populations (as opposed to the ‘wrong kinds’) contributed to the building of the nation. There was, during European colonial expansion, a governmental struggle to manage the right kinds of populations and do away with the wrong ones. Historians Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker richly capture these governmental dilemmas of population management, demonstrating how the building of empire was a ‘Herculean’ task of government where colonists were always confronted by new manifestations of the wrong kinds of populations – pirates, rebellious slaves, independent women, religious radicals, ‘war-like’ tribal peoples – ‘which like a monstrous hydra would undermine their attempts for government and order’ (2000: 29). The authors argue that: ‘from the beginning of English colonial expansion in the early seventeenth century through the metropolitan industrialization of the early nineteenth century, rulers referred to the Hercules-Hydra myth to describe the difficulty of imposing order on increasingly global systems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0263276411427409">Linebaugh and Rediker, 2000</xref>: 3). According to the Greek myth, the second labour of Hercules was to kill the Lernaean hydra, a monstrous serpent with nine heads which would rise up and terrorize the countryside. The concept of population is, as Linebaugh and Rediker suggest, ‘a many-headed hydra’, or as Foucault articulated it, ‘a body with so many heads that, while they might not be infinite in number, cannot necessarily be counted’ (2003: 245).</p>
<p>In Canada, the governing of the right and wrong kinds of populations played out in the census. For example, the early 20th century saw a debate over whether the category ‘Canadian’ should be a choice on the national census. At that time the census offered a range of ‘ethnic identifiers’, such as English, French, Chinese or German, but not Canadian. According to historian and sociologist Evelyn Ruppert, this was because the Canadian government did not want the category ‘Canadian’ on the census on the basis that it did not provide enough detail regarding the nation’s ‘basic ethnic stock’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0263276411427409">2007</xref>: 26). Though terms such as ‘ethnic stock’ have fallen into disuse, Canada continues to maintain a rather complicated counting system for group difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0263276411427409">Goldscheider, 2002</xref>: 81). However, these counting systems are currently narrated through the rhetoric of attending to Canada’s ‘rich <italic>cultural</italic> mosaic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0263276411427409">Statistics Canada, 2010</xref>). The political logics of Canada’s institutionalized multiculturalism are based on a specific kind of population monitoring. There is no explicit rhetoric to monitor and classify undesirable populations, but precisely the opposite. Official multiculturalism is narrated through the idea that different population groups add value to Canadian society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0263276411427409">6</xref></sup> This idea of the mosaic has powerfully shaped larger narratives of Canada’s international reputation as an exemplar of multicultural harmony. It has also, however, elicited and shaped critiques that have emerged as a result of the state institutionalization of multicultural policies and the recognition of cultural difference in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0263276411427409">Bannerji, 2000</xref>). Not surprisingly, but in a way that is perhaps under-appreciated, these histories and their contemporary manifestations have come to shape the traffic in population at molecular, national and global levels.</p>
<p>The example of the Quebec founder population, which finds continued life within this nexus of empire, census and multiculturalism, demonstrates how the formation of genomic populations exceeds and moves beyond the limits of the molecular scale. Recently, the value of the genetic homogeneity offered by the Quebec founder population has been seen to be under threat. Researchers at Genizon have lamented that the genetic uniqueness of the Quebec founder population may be ‘lost in the next few generations’ because ‘Quebec is becoming highly multiethnic, and intermarriage between different groups is becoming more and more common’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0263276411427409">Secko, 2008</xref>: 38). Citing Canadian census data, the genetic researchers go on to explain that it is becoming difficult to find recruits for their studies because ‘interracial marriages have increased more than 30% from 2001 to 2006’ and ‘<italic>visible minorities</italic> (many of whom are new immigrants) also rose more than 30% during the same period’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0263276411427409">Secko, 2008</xref>). Though researchers at Genizon may not be using something called a <italic>visible minority</italic> population in the genomic studies they conduct, there is an explicit assumption that the proximity of this group to the Quebec founder population (through ‘interracial marriage’ and ‘immigration’) will have consequences on the underlying genetic structure of the Quebec founder population.</p>
<p>The category ‘visible minority’ is in some respects a Canadian invention and an exemplar of the political logics of multicultural classification. In committing to the inclusion of diverse groups through policies of multiculturalism, Canadian governmental agencies faced a dilemma, which was: ‘how to effectively prevent discrimination without statistically distinguishing the people most likely to be discriminated against’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0263276411427409">Kertzer and Arel, 2002</xref>: 13). In order to address this, Statistics Canada added what it called ‘the visible minority group variable’ to the census. Officially defined, the category ‘visible minority’ applies ‘to persons who are identified according to the Employment Equity Act as being non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0263276411427409">Statistics Canada, 2008</xref>). It is here that we need to appreciate the irony of multicultural classification systems where progressive attempts at social inclusion can end up reinforcing the very structures they seek to counter. Indeed, recently the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0263276411427409">UNCERD, 2007</xref>) told Canadian government representatives that the use of the term ‘visible minority’ to identify people it considers susceptible to racial discrimination was potentially ‘racist’ and may contravene the international treaty aimed at combating racism, which Canada has signed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0263276411427409">Edwards, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>This traffic in populations, illuminated by the case of the Quebec founder population, is a powerful example of what sociologist Steven Epstein has called categorical alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0263276411427409">2007</xref>: 91). This is where ‘common-sense’ group differences (such as those naturalized in the census and used by governmental agencies) take on an increased salience in biomedical and genetic research. Processes of categorical alignment are not necessarily overarching or all encompassing, however, as categories can also be de-aligned. This is because there are multiple choices and logics operating within local arenas, meaning that the production and consumption of certain population categories will differ. The creation and use of population categories may depend on what investments certain actors and institutions have in the political, social and economic stakes of human genome research. For example, as a private company, Genizon draws on what might be characterized as a ‘national’ population tied to the founding of the nation-state through frontier colonialism. However, Genizon’s unabashed use of the Quebec founder population is not shared by other publicly funded large-scale genomics projects in Quebec. A recently established biobank in Quebec has explicitly distanced itself from an emphasis on Quebec homogeneity or purity at molecular and molar levels. This is not based on scientific arguments but rather on political investments. Publicly funded projects cannot be seen to support or associate themselves with notions of Quebec purity and exceptionalism because of larger political histories in Quebec and the rest of Canada. The ability to draw on settler populations (such as the Quebec founder population) is thus mediated by a range of factors, particularly the privately funded status of Genizon. Genizon is not seeking to sell its products in Canada, but rather to global pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms located in the United States. They are not accountable to the Canadian taxpayer or embedded in a web of ethical requirements on which their funding is based. Rather, they are accountable to the venture-capitalist investors from Europe who support their research.</p>
<p>This traffic in populations means that we must more fully consider the analytical parameters of drawing on the molecular scale to characterize contemporary understandings of human difference. There is no doubt that the molecular sciences are continuing to transform understandings of health, disease and the human body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0263276411427409">Lock, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0263276411427409">Rose, 2007</xref>). However, we need to be wary of attaching overarching normative assumptions to what these processes may mean for social and cultural politics. The term ‘molecularization’ should not come to stand in, or be a placeholder for, assumed meaning as processes of molecularization may hold little meaning, with regards to human difference, outside of the specific technologies, histories and populations it is used to describe and analyse. Different kinds of categories come to matter in practices of human genome research, which is itself varied and contingent. The politics of these choices, and the intended, or unintended consequences that follow these choices, are not always easily discerned.</p>
<p>The case of the Quebec founder population shows that the populations of genome science do not only accrue value through dominant national imaginaries, but also find life within diverse processes informed by national and international politics, as well as global and international commercialization. This means that analysis of the political economy of vital processes must extend beyond formulations which often frame a version of Benedict <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276411427409">Anderson’s (1983)</xref> ‘imagined communities’ as replicated in genetic studies. In the case of the Quebec founder population at Genizon there is a scientific cobbling together of a useful genomic population by drawing on particular historically situated and exclusionary notions of national community and settlement. Yet if we look very briefly at political culture in Quebec, the idea of the founder population, or <italic>pure laine</italic> (meaning pure wool, as in those with original French Canadian ancestry), is significantly contested. Meanings of national identity and belonging in Quebec are continually undergoing transformations in public institutions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0263276411427409">Bouchard and Taylor, 2007</xref>). It would appear that in Quebec the story of the founder population as formulated at Genizon is not the story that everyone wants to tell. Thus, while there are explicit examples of clear connections between how national identity and ideologies become readily embodied in genetic populations (such as in the case of Iceland and DeCODE Genetics), this kind of connection should not necessarily be assumed in all cases, or at least it should be extended to include contestation and contradiction about the contemporary nation-state and global scientific practice. We need to be able to hold together the ways in which the nation-state continues to be at the heart of population histories and the management of populations, while also being attentive to the ways in which these categories travel, who is using them and to what end. In this regard, the emergence of the molecular scale and processes of molecularization should not be over-determined.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0263276411427409"><title>Conclusion: Thinking with Population</title>
<p>In this article I suggest that we consider the ways in which human variation is described by recourse to labels, but also the very concept of population itself. The question of population needs to be reactivated as human genome science is increasingly linked to promises of individualized and personalized medicine. While the governing discourses of health (in Europe and America) may be formulated and directed to the construction of the responsible and self-policing individual, scientific research undergirding health services is concerned with populations. When drug companies or governments talk about individualized or personalized medicine they do not mean one drug for one person. They mean one drug for a certain population, however defined. In a chapter entitled ‘From Individuals to Populations’, Evelyn Fox Keller explains how the erasure of distinctions between the idea of the individual and the population is responsible for a significant amount of confusion that surrounds discussions of heritability and variation in human populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0263276411427409">2010</xref>: 59). She argues that it is not just social and political agendas that are at work in these confusions, but that equally significant is the extent to which our linguistic and thinking practices ‘actively elide’ what she calls the ‘distinction between causal dynamics of individual development and statistical patterns of correlation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0263276411427409">Keller, 2010</xref>: 65). The population concept thus continues to have significant traction in our own thought, often in ways that, as Fox Keller makes clear, are thoroughly ambiguous and contradictory.</p>
<p>If, as Foucault points out, population is a problem of power and politics, then it continues to be a problem for all of us, not just for genetic scientists. This is especially the case when it comes to large-scale human genome science, which is not practised in single, lone laboratories, but involves a diverse array of institutions and funders, who often require, from the outset, the involvement of social sciences and humanities perspectives under the umbrella of ‘social and ethical aspects’. The population has been, from its inception, both the focus of political economy (Malthus) and biology (Darwin), and it continues to be so. Given that we do not live in a post-population world, the concept of population should not be left untouched, or seen as a relic of the past, in the new human genome sciences. The term itself does not tend to conjure up notions of fluidity, flow or fragmentation, more likely the idea of static categories, often imposed through eugenic notions of improvement by the nation-state. This association with the term ‘population’ might be extended to include the ways in which the population concept continues to shape our own thought in social theory, as well our own investment in population thinking in social critiques of scientific practice.</p>
<p>More than ever before, the study of the human genome is a global pursuit. The links between the genome, biology and biomedicine have proved to be highly seductive for a range of nations which are engaged in collecting samples and sequencing their own populations’ genomes. These research projects are legitimated in a variety of ways. Some, like Genizon, use national population categories to sell their research globally, while others explicitly link the nation-state to genomic research through arguments of ‘genomic sovereignty’, as in Mexico (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0263276411427409">Schwartz-Marín and Silva-Zolezzi, 2010</xref>). Others have argued that the benefits of genomic medicine should not be limited to the West and that sequencing the ‘Asian genome’ is part of delivering future health care to people in Asia (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0263276411427409">Borrell, 2007</xref>). These investments are premised on a connection linking the study of human DNA to new forms of public health and the eradication of health inequalities. Indeed, investment in the large-scale study of human DNA continues to be offered as a way to transport individuals, families and nations to new frontiers where a vast array of medical and social problems are remedied. However, investing in these forms of life requires investing in the study of human genome variation, without which the biological basis of disease cannot be understood or intervened in. Investing in life thus requires investing in difference.</p>
<p>The case of the Quebec founder population sheds light on the specific cultural and biological practices that produce populations in local contexts, highlighting the various means by which research in biomedical genomics both creates and utilizes population differences. In drawing on Canada as a case study the article treats Canada as a single entity, which, however, contains within it plenty of traces from other places and spaces. For example, British colonial influences of population classification, along with European venture capital investment for private genomics research, have played a role in the preceding account. While I emphasized the specificities of the examples explored here, the case is also worldly and relevant to places that are not Canada. The arguments presented here are therefore relevant to places, contexts and people that may be ‘elsewhere’ in order to contribute to a larger project of developing transnational perspectives on the new kinds of social arrangements that have arisen in the place of genomic cures.</p></sec>
