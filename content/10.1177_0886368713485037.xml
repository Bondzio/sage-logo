<abstract>
<p>Despite substantial corporate governance and regulatory reform on both sides of the Atlantic, which started over two decades ago, executive pay remains an unresolved problem. Twenty years since the publication of the groundbreaking Cadbury Report, criticism of executive pay is more severe than ever before in the United Kingdom. The relationship between pay and performance is still highly questionable, and executive remuneration continues to vastly exceed and outpace average employee pay. In this article, we discuss and evaluate the U.K. coalition government’s attempts to influence practice, through the Hutton Review of Fair Pay and the latest revised U.K. remuneration reporting regulations. Although we welcome these changes, it is our view that regulation can only go so far in addressing executive pay and in creating a wider perception of fairness. Ultimately, individual remuneration committees must focus far more on managing internal relativities rather than on the external executive pay market, which as well as improving external perceptions is also more likely to increase levels of employee engagement and performance.</p>

<title>A Critical Context</title>
<p>Executive pay has been in the spotlight for several decades, but not more so than during and since the 2008 financial crisis and the demise of prominent financial institutions like the Royal Bank of Scotland, which was partially nationalized to prevent its failure. Executive pay in both the private and public sector has been fundamentally criticized during these austere times, and the criticism directed toward the top executives by politicians, the media and the general public is more prominent than ever before.</p>
<p>Criticism has focused on both the absolute level of remuneration and the ways in which variable pay has not just failed to reflect performance but also allegedly incentivized and rewarded poor performance. With major U.K. banks still increasing the funds to compensate customers who were missold Pensions Protection Insurance, Royal Bank of Scotland Chief Executive Stephen Hester told an audience at The London School of Economics, “Our reform agenda has to go further, so that pay takes proper account of the customer interest.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0886368713485037">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this article, we assess the nature and validity of some of the common criticisms of executive remuneration, outline the latest U.K. coalition government’s proposals for reform and consider other potential “solutions.”</p>
<p>As soon as the financial crash and economic downturn started, the U.K. government launched a verbal assault on top pay, demanding further regulation and an end to reckless behavior and excessive incentive payments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0886368713485037">2</xref></sup> The U.S. administration also called for further regulation on executive pay, with President Obama making growing inequality a key feature of both of his election campaigns. “America cannot succeed,” he said at his second inauguration, “when a shrinking few do very well, and a growing minority barely make it.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0886368713485037">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is also some evidence that the structure of remuneration in the investment banks encouraged excessive risk taking. Financial Services Authority (FSA) chair Adair Turner observed, “There is widespread concern that inappropriate (bankers’) remuneration schemes contributed to the market crisis,” and he supports putting declared maximum pay levels on all executives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0886368713485037">4</xref></sup> (The FSA is the financial regulator for the United Kingdom.)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0886368713485037">
<title>Pay for Performance?</title>
<p>Despite numerous disclosure requirements over the past two decades on both sides of the Atlantic designed to enhance the transparency and accountability of boards of directors to their shareholders, investors and investor organizations remain concerned that executives continue to be rewarded substantially, even when company performance is poor. Banks and firms in other sectors are accused of paying their executives high personal rewards despite poor organizational performance and when other employees are suffering declines in real wages, which has led to major shareholder revolts against packages at companies such as Citigroup, BP and Shell. Trade Union Congress General Secretary Frances O’Grady recently complained that “the meteoric rise in directors’ pay over the last decade bears no resemblance to company performance or the far lower pay rises that ordinary staff have received.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0886368713485037">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, many recent studies have investigated whether corporate governance reform, with its intention to align pay more closely to performance, has had the desired effect. But the findings show at best a weak association between performance and pay.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0886368713485037">6</xref></sup> Bebchuk and Fried<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0886368713485037">7</xref></sup> argue that this is due to top executives controlling the compensation setting process and securing pay arrangements linked to their preferences rather than those of the shareholders.</p>
<p>Investor body PIRC claims, “The remuneration committees of our largest public companies are comprised of people whose own earnings are stratospheric . . . it’s hardly surprising they seem oblivious to the tough environment their own workforce faces.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0886368713485037">8</xref></sup> (PIRC is the UK’s leading independent research and advisory consultancy providing services to institutional investors on corporate governance and social responsibility.)</p>
<p>PIRC is now opposing the introduction of any new long-term incentive (LTI) plan in the companies in which it invests, arguing that such plans are neither long term nor performance related.</p>
<p>Following the finding of a low correlation between CEO pay and firm performance in a seminal study conducted by Jensen and Murphy<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0886368713485037">9</xref></sup> and the publication of the Cadbury Report<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0886368713485037">10</xref></sup> on corporate governance, reformers have focused on trying to ensure a clearer link between executive pay and firm performance. Hence, the past two decades have seen a dramatic change in the composition and complexity of executive pay packages, which, at least on the surface, appear to be largely linked to measures of firm financial performance. However, the pursuit of performance-related pay for top executives has coincided with a dramatic rise in total compensation (offsetting the potential losses of not earning a bonus due to poor performance) and a widening of pay differentials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0886368713485037">
<title>All in This Together?</title>
<p>The contrast with the rest of the workforce is striking, with average pay increase rates falling behind inflation and the biggest decline in real incomes occurring in the United Kingdom and United States since the 1930s’ Great Depression. A variety of economic factors have contributed to this, such as the recession and higher price inflation lasting longer than was initially forecast. What the economist Diana Coyle terms <italic>winner-takes-all</italic> economic trends have seen differentials increasing in many sectors, with average remuneration, as an example, for Premier League soccer players increasing by more than 1,500% since 1992.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0886368713485037">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Prominent economists have broadened the debate by claiming that with declining real incomes for the majority and a higher share of national income going to the highest 1% of earners in the United Kingdom and United States, domestic consumption is depressed and levels of borrowing and current account deficits have increased, severely limiting the ability of the economy to recover. Will Hutton, for example, has argued that “capitalism is in crisis” because of this long-term trend “to confer fortunes on those at the top, with little risk, while directing pain onto others.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0886368713485037">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The U.K. opposition Labour Party has recently, using similar language to President Obama, supported actions to stop further escalation in differentials, including a new 10% tax rate for those with lower earnings, funded by a new “mansion tax” on properties worth over £2 million.</p>
<p>Research from the U.K. High Pay Centre, an independent think tank, shows that the average pay of the chief executives of FTSE 100 companies trebled over the past decade, hugely increasing pay differentials. They found that executive pay had increased by over 12% in the last financial year, more than 3 times the growth in average U.K. earnings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0886368713485037">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although a whole range of economic factors help explain the trend toward growing levels of income inequality in more than two thirds of OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) member countries, one cause of a widening pay gap is undoubtedly the reward policies and procedures common in large organizations, such as the divorce of executive remuneration from the pay in the rest of the organization and an excessive reliance on market benchmarking. Research indicates that CEO benchmarking can ratchet up executive pay and thus increases the pay gap between executive pay and average employee pay.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0886368713485037">14</xref></sup> Investor bodies such as the Association of British Insurers have warned remuneration committees to be wary of this effect.</p>
<p>The global debate on executive pay now revolves around not only the pay-for-performance relationship but also the scale of executive pay. In the face of continuing economic austerity, the media and the electorate are demanding governments deal with the high levels of executive pay in their pursuit of “fairness.”</p>
<p>The concept of fairness helps explain the widespread criticisms of “fat-cat” remuneration and underpins much of the current political discourse. In a recent CIPD (Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development) survey, 42 % of U.K. employers regarded establishing internal equity as one of their top three reward goals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0886368713485037">15</xref></sup> The agreement establishing the U.K.’s coalition government promises “fairness and responsibility.” As we illustrate later, we believe that a greater focus on internal relativities and hence fairness by remuneration committees could help improve employee engagement and well-being to the benefit of long-term performance, and a move away from an exclusive focus on market pay levels would help close the income gap and reduce the costs of inequality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0886368713485037">
<title>Policy Responses: Fair Pay in the Public Sector</title>
<p>The Hutton Review of Fair Pay,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0886368713485037">16</xref></sup> established by the coalition government to address concern with escalating senior pay in the public sector, following on the coattails of private sector executive remuneration, developed a framework of fair pay in its 2011 report. Although the Hutton review focused on top executive pay in the public sector, the U.K. government is hopeful that the framework will set a precedent for fairer pay throughout all sectors of the economy.</p>
<p>Although they rejected the government-suggested imposition of a cap on executive pay equal to 20 times the pay of lowest earning employee, public sector organizations are required in future to provide a written explanation of their reward policies and to justify their top executive pay arrangements. Public bodies in future will also need to disclose pay multiples comparing executive pay with average employee pay and relative to relevant economic indicators such as retail price inflation, (as under the Dodd–Franks Act in the United States). Furthermore, public sector organizations are now required to prepare fair-pay reports highlighting long-term trends in pay multiples.</p>
<p>The review also called for greater use of gain-sharing incentive plans to share the benefits of productivity gains with all staff, not just executives, and to open up the internal supply of labor for top positions, so as to reduce the pressures to recruit externally at high market rates. Government pressure has also seen some prominent examples since the report’s publication of public sector bodies recruiting new executives on salaries significantly below their predecessors, with some departments promoting the use of the Prime Minister’s salary as a maximum pay level (though Hutton’s report rejected this approach).</p>
<p>Many of the recommendations deal with enhanced disclosure requirements, and the Fair Pay Review anticipates that the disclosure requirements will enable behavioral change in the public sector and ultimately deal with income differentials between top executives and other employees. We have some concern that without “hard” rules, increased disclosure could simply encourage excess, since enhanced disclosure requirements have not curbed escalating pay in the private sector. Some argue it has had precisely the opposite effect. Yet this is also where the government’s latest proposed private sector reforms focus, with a rejection of pay caps or wider governance changes such as worker representatives on remuneration committees, which the opposition Labour Party supports.</p>
<p>Executive pay is frequently criticized for not having any downside risk, and therefore a fundamental aspect of the Hutton Review’s Fair Pay framework is that it advocates “earn back pay.” “Earn back” requires that public sector executives must earn a part of their basic pay through achieving predetermined performance objectives. So in return for, say, a 10% bonus opportunity, the executive would have 10% of their base pay put at risk, and reduction occurs if they did not achieve core job objectives. Basic pay is therefore reduced if objectives are not satisfied.</p>
<p>We might argue that this approach is simply complicating existing well-established approaches to managing pay. Executives will view the guaranteed element as basic pay and the “unearned” element as variable pay. This might be construed as window dressing. Moreover, since people are inclined to dislike losses substantially more than they like gains, there is a concern that executives will greatly discount the amount to be earned back.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0886368713485037">17</xref></sup> Very few public sector organizations are still following this proposal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0886368713485037">
<title>Private Sector Reform</title>
<p>Following the Hutton Review of Fair Pay, the Secretary of State for Business Innovation and Skills launched a consultation and review of executive pay in the private sector and announced revised reporting regulations for executive pay,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0886368713485037">18</xref></sup> to be implemented in October 2013, for listed firms. The main outcome of the review will be the introduction of a shareholder binding vote on the policy section of the remuneration report and exit payments. A binding vote will be held every 3 years, unless there are policy changes that will lead to more frequent votes. If the binding vote does not achieve an ordinary majority, then the firm must revert to the existing policy. All payments must be made within the agreed policy. Shareholders will continue to have an annual advisory vote on payments made to the directors.</p>
<p>It appears to us to be sensible to only require an annual vote if there are policy changes. It also makes sense to maintain an advisory vote in order to deal with unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>The binding vote is intended to give more voice to shareholders and therefore improve pay discipline. It follows all previous reform in being based on assumptions of agency theory. A cynic might question whether shareholder-orientated reform will fix the scale of executive pay since shareholder requirements are different from other stakeholders. Richard Lambert, the former head of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) employers’ organization, makes the point that shareholders have not always used their influence and exercised voting rights in the past.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0886368713485037">19</xref></sup> Therefore, will new regulation, invoking more power, encourage shareholders to behave responsibly? Certainly last year’s round of annual general meetings saw a growing level of dissent expressed in advisory votes on remuneration packages, even if most were still supported by the vast majority of shareholders.</p>
<p>In an effort to reduce complexity, under the new regulations remuneration committees will also have to disclose in a company’s annual report and accounts a single remuneration figure for each board director, based on actual payments received. Although some remuneration reports disclose total pay, most commentators are surprised that for many firms this figure is not already available and so is difficult to determine. A possible reason for nondisclosure is that due to the complexity and variety of compensation plans, there are so many different ways to measure and report total pay. Will Hutton observed in his report that “we need less disclosure and more transparency,” which is what the single figure is designed to achieve.</p>
<p>But this will only enable comparisons if firms are consistent in their measurement. We note the definition is still being worked on. We might argue that although this requires more disclosure, it does not deal directly with the complexity inherent in many compensation plans. A useful enhancement of this requirement would also be to show the amount of pay forfeited due to nonachievement of performance conditions.</p>
<p>The current simplification of executive pay and incentive programs under way in a number of major U.K. companies, such as Tesco, based on a reduction in the number of different plans, is a trend that we very much support and that will make the general understanding of the levels and workings of executive pay far easier and more transparent. Critics might argue that, as is currently being proposed under discussions based on German corporate governance requirements, specifically stating a maximum amount of remuneration that can be earned under each incentive plan in advance of any payments would do far more to actually control executive remuneration levels.</p>
<p>Remuneration committees will under the proposed requirements also have to publish a performance graph showing the 5-year pay trend for directors versus the 5-year total shareholder return. We might question the usefulness of such a graph because it assumes a contemporaneous relationship between executive pay and share price performance. It also ignores other important indicators such as nonfinancial performance measures like customer service, which, as Stephen Hester said, is key for most companies. But perhaps it is better than nothing in this regard.</p>
<p>The revised reporting regulations refer to desirable information on wider employee pay, but the regulations stop short of requiring firms to disclose pay ratios (executive pay relative to average employee pay) as some critics proposed. Currently only one FTSE 100 firm publishes this ratio on a voluntary basis, though a number of external organizations attempt to calculate and compare the ratios. Instead, the regulations call for firms to present the percentage pay increase for executives versus the percentage increase granted to the workforce each year. Although this is an important reflection on how firms are managing pay increases across the board, it might do very little to encourage a fairer distribution of wealth or performance gains. But the growth in external criticism does appear to have moderated the rate of pay increases in large U.K. firms to a level that is much closer to the general wage inflation rate so far in 2013.</p>
<p>Our examination of recent policy recommendations in the public sector and private sector shows them to be primarily concerned with enhanced disclosure, which it could be argued is not substantially different from all previous reform. The theme emanating from the public sector reform is fair pay for all, whereas private sector reform continues to maintain a strong focus on executive accountability to shareholders and on visibility.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0886368713485037">
<title>Practitioner Responses and Commentary</title>
<p>There seem to be two main issues of substance with regard to executive pay: first, the level of pay, and second, the relationship between pay and performance. The review of pay in the public sector has focused on addressing the level of pay, whereas regulation in the private sector continues to focus on the question of pay for performance. The U.K. Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills (BIS) consultation highlighted concerns held by business leaders that rising executive pay was not linked to performance. The consultation also established that business leaders expressed concerns over introducing reporting requirements to disclose the ratio of CEO pay versus median workforce earnings.</p>
<p>The BIS proposals attempt to deal with the problem of performance through the introduction of the shareholder binding vote on remuneration and via enhanced disclosure. However, the outcomes of the BIS consultation have not dealt with fairness or the complexity or the absolute levels of executive pay, which many stakeholders had supported. The BIS review has undoubtedly missed the opportunity to deal explicitly with income disparities and to provide a wider voice to stakeholders other than shareholders. However, the problems of wider income differentials, low pay, declining real incomes and “the squeezed middle” require a much broader range of policy responses beyond executive remuneration reforms—in taxation and benefits, public investment programs, training and skills policy, possibly moving from the national minimum to a living wage, and so on.</p>
<p>Bodies such as the self-appointed High Pay Commission and Trades Union Congress have advocated stronger institutional reforms to address executive remuneration issues, such as requiring worker representatives to sit on remuneration committees. Controversy over this issue reemerged when in giving evidence to the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, Alison Carnworth, the former chair of Barclays’ remuneration committee, told MPs that she believed that the then chief executive Bob Diamond should not have received any bonus in 2011. But she was overruled by the Company Chairman, Marcus Agius, and a multimillion pound payment was made.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0886368713485037">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>But without wider employee involvement at senior levels, as occurs through the two-tiered board structure in German companies, and to some extent through European Works Councils, we doubt that individual representatives would be able to have much impact. There is also some new evidence to suggest that remuneration committees have been successful in fulfilling the requirements of the U.K. Corporate Governance Code<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0886368713485037">21</xref></sup> to link executive pay to relative firm performance. Research from Kingston University<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0886368713485037">22</xref></sup> shows that payouts from chief executive bonus plans and payouts from LTI plans are in fact strongly related to relative shareholder performance. This finding is consistent with agency theory predictions and consistent with the U.K. Corporate Governance Code. Many previous studies investigating this issue do not consider relative measures of firm performance or the timing of bonus payouts or the duration over which performance is measured, which is potentially why they do not uncover similar findings. The media also rely on comparing pay with absolute share price performance. Although investors seek absolute increases in their investment, actual share price is a poor indicator of individual performance since it is highly influenced by the macro economy.</p>
<p>The typical corporate executive compensation package includes base salary, annual incentives and LTI grants. Of the three, the annual incentive is typically the smallest in value. A complication is that the payment of annual incentives occurs in the year following, when performance may be significantly different. The value of shares and stock options is affected not only by company performance but also by other factors. For these reasons, an executive’s total remuneration in a year may not reflect his or her company’s results at year-end.</p>
<p>For that reason, it is not clear whether the focus on pay for performance has been a factor in increasing overall levels of pay. Potential losses incurred by executives for not meeting all the performance conditions can be offset by absolute increases in basic pay and in the bonus opportunity. Payouts might decrease with poor firm performance, but at the same time, total executive pay might increase, thereby negating the losses. We have seen this occurring under pressure from the FSA with a deleveraging of variable pay levels for executives in banks offset by proportionately higher and higher increases in their base pay. And, as in North America, clawback arrangements have now generally been introduced into U.K. executive packages, though it is too early as yet to assess their impact.</p>
<p>Remuneration committees claim they must deliver competitive executive pay packages in order to retain key talent. This mantra is also acknowledged within the U.K. Code of Corporate Governance. The Code also requires remuneration committees to be mindful of all employee pay when determining the pay of executives. Remuneration committees are then left with the task of maintaining both external and internal pay relativities, which without explicit guidelines is perhaps impossible to achieve, and their focus has been overwhelmingly on the former.</p>
<p>Perhaps a new focus is required. Boards seem obsessed with achieving external market equity and will rely on market data to achieve this. Executives have generally been removed from the pay structures where internal job value is important in determining the pay of other employees. Why? In itself, the external market obsession can create a never-ending spiral of increasing executive pay without ever considering desirable internal relativities. It is interesting that since the Hutton review, the public sector seems to be successfully hiring executives, despite reductions in the levels of remuneration, and more posts are being filled through internal promotions. Might such approaches also pay off in the private sector?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0886368713485037">
<title>Conclusions: Where Do We Go From Here?</title>
<p>The Hutton review put forward a framework of fair pay based on “pay for just desserts” rather than pay for performance. It would require a substantial shift from the traditional agency focus before a similar approach could be adopted by the private sector. Not surprisingly, genuinely putting base pay at risk is not gaining much traction in the public sector, never mind the private.</p>
<p>Reforms to executive pay policies, however radical they might be, will not address the global trend toward wider inequality. That will require much more fundamental reforms to government economic, social and educational policies, as well as to capitalism itself. Most commentators seem to agree that the latest BIS reforms for quoted U.K. companies are an improvement, even if some wanted the changes to be far more extensive.</p>
<p>Without much more extensive legislative policy reforms, such as establishing a statutory High Pay Commission to control pay levels, we do not believe that more radical changes such as pay caps or worker representatives would in any case be effective. President Clinton’s attempts to cap executive pay levels at $1 million in the 1990s illustrated the law of unintended consequences, which often prevail in this arena, in that it resulted in the proliferation of complex incentive plans and thus helped bring about the current complex, opaque and mistrusted situation.</p>
<p>Government action is certainly needed to address growing economic inequality and low pay in the United Kingdom. We would like to have seen the BIS reforms include the requirement to publish internal pay differentials and numbers paid below a Living Wage level. But ultimately governments are never going to, and should not, set executive pay levels. And for all the criticisms of them for being in each other’s pockets and out of touch, we can see no viable alternative going forward for executive pay setting other than it being done by independent remuneration committees.</p>
<p>Remuneration committees in large companies at last seem to be recognizing that they need to take account of developments elsewhere in society and the economy. As the High Pay Centre’s Deborah Hargreaves puts it, “It is wrong that Britain’s bosses are taking home more and more money as their companies shrink, their employees’ incomes are squeezed and jobs are lost.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0886368713485037">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have seen and indeed given a number of remuneration committee briefings over the past year on general pay trends and developments for the rest of the workforce prior to their decisions on executive pay. We note base pay awards for the directors of FTSE 100 companies fell to a median 3.5% last year whereas the value of annual bonus payments was 4.9% lower than in the previous year on average. Admittedly, median executive earnings in the United Kingdom still went up by 10%, more than 3 times the increase in average earnings. But that was driven by LTI payments, and these longer term and share-based plans have generally been encouraged by investors, governments and regulators.</p>
<p>In order to achieve a wider perception of fairness, we believe that remuneration committees must focus far more on managing internal relativities. This should also be a major requirement for policy makers, since there is evidence that reducing income disparities will have positive social effects. Furthermore, executive pay sends an important signal, and it is likely that higher employee perceptions of fairness will result in increased levels of engagement and enhanced long-term performance. Currently, according to Aon Hewitt, fewer than one third of employees in the United Kingdom and Europe think that pay in their organizations is fair.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0886368713485037">24</xref></sup> And that perhaps is a statistic that all boardrooms and remuneration committees should be forced to consider.</p>
<p>A number of voluntary actions could substantially improve the executive and general pay landscape in the United Kingdom—reviewing, monitoring and publishing their internal pay differentials; introducing more gain-sharing and profit-sharing plans so that all employees, not just executives, can share in the gains of higher performance; more general adoption of Living Wage policies and applying tried-and-tested pay management tools such as job-evaluated grading structures that are good enough for all other employees to executives. To focus on one change, the estimates are that adoption of a Living Wage policy would cost large companies as a whole less than 1% of their payroll. One hour of an FTSE chief executive’s earnings would be enough to move a low-paid employee from the national minimum to the Living Wage level for a year. These and other changes would result in improved employee and wider social perceptions and hopefully better company and economic performance.</p>
<p>The U.K. organization with the highest customer satisfaction levels and also excellent financial performance is the retailer, The John Lewis Partnership. It manages to succeed with no executive short- or long-term or sales bonus plans but simply with an annual general staff profit-sharing plan.</p>
<p>And perhaps remuneration committees might also occasionally ask themselves just “how much is enough?”</p>
