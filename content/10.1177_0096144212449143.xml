<abstract>
<p>Using materials from British government and oil company archives, as well as magazine articles, newspaper articles, and other published sources in English and Arabic, this article addresses the group identities of the ethnic communities of Kirkuk, Iraq, in the context of the city’s growth as a result of the presence of the Iraqi oil industry. It contends that in the early to mid-twentieth century, Kirkuk developed a distinct domain of urban politics in which previously fluid ethnic identities hardened and in which Kirkukis, at one time more reliant on external patronage, became deeply invested. These circumstances led to intercommunal tensions and violence in the city in Iraq’s post-1958 revolutionary era.</p>

<p>The status of Kirkuk, one of Iraq’s largest cities and the former center of its oil industry, is currently disputed between those who wish to bring it under the control of the autonomous Kurdistan region in Iraq’s northeast and those who are determined to maintain the status quo. Its multiethnic and multilingual population has long consisted of people who self-identify as ethnic Kurds, Turkmens, Arabs, and, in smaller numbers, as Chaldo-Assyrian Christians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144212449143">1</xref></sup> Kirkuk’s Kurds generally believe that Kirkuk should become part of the area administered by the Kurdish-led Kurdistan Regional Government. Consequently, they are pushing for the implementation of Article 140 of the 2005 Iraqi constitution, which decrees that a referendum should be held in Kirkuk in order to allow its inhabitants to determine their own status. The Turkmens, Arabs, and other groups, however, as well as the non-Kurdish Iraqi population in general, are bitterly opposed to any measures that might result in the Kurdish government formally taking control of the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144212449143">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Journalists and scholars who have written about Kirkuk since 2003 have generally argued that the Kirkuk crisis is best understood as consisting of three main narratives, each powerfully associated with an ethnic identity. The Kurdish narrative asserts that Kirkuk is rightfully a part of Kurdistan. The Turkmen narrative holds that Kirkuk is historically, even presently, a Turkmen city and must retain that characterization. The Arab narrative insists that Kirkuk is an Iraqi city first and foremost, and hence must retain its Iraqi identity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144212449143">3</xref></sup> It is not inconceivable that some members of one ethnic group may subscribe to another’s viewpoint, or another political narrative entirely; it is also inevitably the case that because of the nuances of self-identity and some intermarriage, there are Kirkukis who consider themselves members of more than one group. These complexities notwithstanding, the association of the three ethnopolitical narratives with self-identified Kurds, Turkmens, and Arabs is strong enough that two political scientists were able to use the results of Iraq’s 2005 parliamentary elections in the Kirkuk governorate, in which each of the major parties with candidates up for election held to one of these narratives, to estimate reasonably its numerical ethnic composition in the absence of a recent census.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144212449143">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, the city of Kirkuk occupies a central position in Kurdish, Turkmen, Iraqi, and other nationalisms as articulated by politicians, journalists, scholars, and other writers both inside and outside of Kirkuk.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144212449143">5</xref></sup> Thus, people of various group identities in Kirkuk—and throughout Iraq in general—perceive themselves as having a stake in the characterization of the city. This article explores how these Kirkuki ethnic identities developed, as well as how and why the city itself played such a central role in this development and in consequent ethnopolitical agendas.</p>
<p>This approach questions the assumption, universally prevalent in the news media, that the conflict between Kurds, Turkmens, and Arabs is primarily about attempts to gain or maintain control of Kirkuk’s considerable oil resources.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144212449143">6</xref></sup> While the importance of Kirkuk’s oil in the current conflict is undeniable, those who characterize oil only as a commodity perilously simplify the matter by ignoring the role of the numerous historical processes, including oil urbanization, that created ethnic identities and rivalries. The few accounts of the Kirkuk crisis that have sought to give historical context to the present situation typically do so by confining their discussion to the “Arabization” campaign that picked up speed in the 1960s during the era of Ba‘th Party rule in Iraq. This was an often brutal effort to achieve demographic change in Kirkuk in which the Arab-led government expelled Kurds and Turkmens from the city and its surrounding areas, settled Arabs there from other parts of Iraq, and gerrymandered the Kirkuk governorate’s borders to exclude Kurdish areas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144212449143">7</xref></sup> These policies, which are themselves worthy of further scholarly examination, unquestionably intensified antagonism between ethnic groups. However, this article analyzes periods in Kirkuk’s history that have typically been overlooked and yet are essential to understanding its inhabitants’ self-identities as well as their relationships with other ethnic groups and to the city. The periods examined below include the era of British mandate rule in Iraq from 1920 to 1932, subsequent years in which the city of Kirkuk grew and changed with the development of the Iraqi oil industry, and the immediate aftermath of the 1958 Iraqi revolution. The article does not aim to provide a comprehensive history of the evolution of group identities and intercommunal relations in Kirkuk up to the present, but rather to provide a more thorough historical context for these issues than that which currently exists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144212449143">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>It will be argued that in the early twentieth century, group identities did not exist in hardened forms among Kirkukis and were not a strong determinant of the population’s political interests when the status of the city was in dispute. Rather, such interests were tied to inhabitants’ relationships with powerful external patrons. The city’s growth as a result of the development of the Iraqi oil industry created a distinct urban character and an accompanying domain of local politics. Kirkuk’s local political domain rested on an unstable foundation of ethnically based fault lines that had been apparent, but not pervasive, in the British mandate era. This instability led to intercommunal tensions and violence after the 1958 revolution in which the city’s largest communities, the Turkmens and the Kurds, competed for authority, reflecting the extent to which Kirkukis were invested in the politics of the city along ethnic lines as early as the 1950s.</p>

<title>Kirkuk, Iraqi Centralization, and the “Mosul Question,” 1918-1926</title>
<p>At the turn of the twentieth century, when the region that is now Iraq was under Ottoman rule, Kirkuk was a provincial town that served as a market center for agricultural goods from the surrounding region. Contemporary accounts by Western travelers and British military intelligence indicate that the town of Kirkuk was home to an Ottoman army division and was part of the arc-shaped caravan route between the city of Mosul, to its northwest, and Baghdad, to its south; it was connected by major roads to these cities and to the Kurdish city of Sulaymaniyya in the northeast.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144212449143">9</xref></sup> Kirkuk was also the seat of an Ottoman administrative subdivision within the province of Mosul.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0096144212449143">10</xref></sup> While Ottoman administrative reforms of the nineteenth century had curbed centuries of local autonomy through increased centralization, the municipalities, including Kirkuk, were still accustomed to operating relatively free from intervention by higher authorities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0096144212449143">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The town had a population of about 25,000, and Turkish-speaking people predominated both in number and sociopolitical power, making it a “centre of Ottoman influence” in the Mosul province.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0096144212449143">12</xref></sup> British accounts of Kirkuk in the early twentieth century use the terms “Turk” and “Turkmen” interchangeably to refer to Iraq’s Turkish-speaking population, a practice that reflects the ethnic ambiguity of this group; an individual’s or family’s self-identity often stemmed from a combination of their preferred language and social status rather than their ancestry. C. J. Edmonds, a British military officer in Iraq during World War I and later a civilian official in Kirkuk, remarked in his memoirs that “the leading aristocratic families [in Kirkuk] either were in fact Turks or, even if their origins were Kurdish, nevertheless considered themselves to be such.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0096144212449143">13</xref></sup> The rural countryside immediately surrounding Kirkuk was well populated with predominantly Kurdish and Arab tribes, such that within any administrative subdivision that had urban Kirkuk as its seat and included its rural hinterland, the overall population typically had a Kurdish plurality and a comparably large population of Arabs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0096144212449143">14</xref></sup> In 1921, when considering the issue of drawing boundaries in northern Iraq that would take ethnicity into account, the British High Commissioner for Iraq acknowledged that the lines between Turkmens, Arabs, and Kurds were “very blurred” and that separating them was difficult in practice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0096144212449143">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The United Kingdom obtained a League of Nations mandate for the administration of Iraq after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I and subsequently began the process of bringing the three former provinces of Mosul, Baghdad, and Basra under Baghdad’s authority. Shortly thereafter, the main political fault line that emerged in Kirkuk was between those who wished to cooperate with Anglo-Iraqi centralization and those who opposed it. The status of the former Mosul province soon came to be contested between British Iraq and the nascent Republic of Turkey, which claimed the entire region as part of its territory. This dispute, which the British termed the “Mosul question,” was left unresolved at the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, leading to more than three years’ worth of negotiations, intermittent violence on the Turkish–Iraqi frontier, and the intervention of a special League of Nations commission in 1925.</p>
<p>Anticentralization forces in the Mosul province tended to side with Turkey in the dispute, and Kirkuk emerged as a center of operation for these groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0096144212449143">16</xref></sup> British officials were thus inclined to refer to anticentralization figures and groups in Kirkuk as “pro-Turkish elements” despite the fact that these elements did not specifically express approval of the politics of the new Turkish republic. Indeed, the “pro-Turkish” propaganda that manifested in posters, petitions, speeches, and slogans in Kirkuk conveyed a desire to join the Islamic caliphate, which had most recently been under Ottoman auspices. After the secularist government of Mustafa Kemal abolished the caliphate, inhabitants of the Mosul province consistently expressed dismay at that fact.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0096144212449143">17</xref></sup> In addition, the concept of an independent Kurdish state, or “Kurdistan,” had gained some currency among self-identified Kurds in Kirkuk. British officials had left open the possibility of the creation of a Kurdish state, which had been mentioned in the abortive postwar Treaty of Sèvres, although they did not seriously pursue the project.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0096144212449143">18</xref></sup> Kirkukis occasionally articulated their opposition to inclusion in Iraq, and especially to Anglo-Iraqi administration, in the form of a demand to join such a state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0096144212449143">19</xref></sup> This sentiment cannot be described accurately as Kurdish nationalism in this time period. There does not appear to have been any clear concept among Kurds in Kirkuk of what “Kurdistan” would constitute, since Kurdish tribes there had poor relations with those in other areas, particularly Sulaymaniyya, and did not favor unification with those areas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0096144212449143">20</xref></sup> Overall, Kirkukis of any ethnicity who opposed Anglo-Iraqi administration, particularly those who expressed a desire to join the Republic of Turkey in the context of the Mosul question, were chiefly seeking a return to Ottoman-era autonomy and dreaded the prospect of having to answer to an Arab-led government in Baghdad.</p>
<p>That the central Iraqi government was predominantly made up of Arabs and that the possibility of joining the Republic of Turkey meant a return to rule by Turks cannot be overlooked as factors that galvanized both support for the Anglo-Iraqi government and anti centralization sentiment in Kirkuk. The instances of “pro-Turkish” activity chronicled by British intelligence in the early to mid-1920s suggest that this activity was almost always spearheaded by self-identified Turkmens and Kurds.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0096144212449143">21</xref></sup> These groups led Kirkuk to reject resoundingly Britain’s chosen monarch for Iraq, the Arab amir Faysal, in a 1921 referendum in which the rest of the country almost unanimously accepted him.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0096144212449143">22</xref></sup> Accordingly, much of the rhetoric surrounding the Mosul question in Kirkuk and nearby areas referred to ethnic tensions; for example, a Turkish-language notice posted in Kirkuk’s central market in 1921 castigating Faysal declared that “the Arabs have always disliked the Turks.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0096144212449143">23</xref></sup> In some cases, inhabitants of the Mosul province even adopted nineteenth-century European racial ideas, as in a petition signed by a number of Kurdish notables circa 1925 in support of British Iraq’s claim to the region which noted that Kurds were “Aryan,” or “white,” and Turks “Turanian,” or “yellow,” concluding that the two groups had “no language or national connections.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0096144212449143">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the use of ethnicity and “race” in their rhetoric, however, the political positions of Kirkuki families and tribes with regard to the Mosul question were not easily predictable on the basis of their self-identities. Indeed, some prominent aristocratic families straddled the political divide. One of Kirkuk’s most prominent Turkmens, Nazim Beg Naftchizada, fled Kirkuk for Turkey following the British-instigated arrest of a Kurdish religious leader who had been delivering anti-British and anti-Iraqi sermons. He returned to Iraq in January of 1925 as a member of the Turkish delegation to the League of Nations commission tasked with resolving the Mosul question.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0096144212449143">25</xref></sup> His uncle, Salih Beg Naftchizada, who represented Kirkuk in the central government’s Constituent Assembly, reportedly opposed Nazim’s defection; a report in the Baghdad-based newspaper <italic>Al-Istiqlal</italic> went so far as to claim that he was “bitterly angered” by his nephew’s “lack of faith to his country.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0096144212449143">26</xref></sup> The elite Ya‘qubizada family, who claimed Kurdish descent but self-identified as Turkish-speakers, exhibited a similar rift. One of the family’s patriarchs, ‘Abd al-Majid Beg, cultivated a close relationship with local British authorities as the mayor of Kirkuk and eventually rose to the position of governor of the Kirkuk governorate in 1924.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0096144212449143">27</xref></sup> Yet at the same time, his brother Mustafa was among the influential Kirkukis who formed what British officials termed “pro-Turkish committees,” or clandestine groups that opposed Anglo-Iraqi administration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0096144212449143">28</xref></sup> One British official later suggested that at least one member of the family had to keep “a foot in the Turkish camp” as part of “the family Insurance Policy.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0096144212449143">29</xref></sup> This comment adroitly captures the fact that self-interest as determined by one’s political patronage was the essence of what drove Kirkuki elites’ loyalties and affiliations in the era of the Mosul question. While ethnic self-identities and perceived tensions between ethnic groups certainly existed, they did not necessarily play a role in determining political interests.</p>
<p>The complexity of the relationship between identities and affiliations in the Mosul province surprised and confused the multilateral League of Nations commission appointed to resolve the Mosul question. E. af Wirsen of Sweden, Paul Teleki of Hungary, and Albert Paulis of Belgium traveled around the region in early 1925, accompanied by a secretary and several liaison officers and “experts” from Anglo-Iraqi and Turkish delegations, and extensively interviewed its more prominent inhabitants with the goal of determining whether they wished, as a whole, to be part of Turkey or Iraq. In its final report, the commission reported that in the Kirkuk division, virtually all Christians favored inclusion in Iraq and a majority of “Turks” (i.e., those who primarily spoke Turkish) favored inclusion in Turkey, but the opinions of Arabs and Kurds were divided. The commission’s persistent attempts to understand public opinion in terms of “race” are remarkable given their conclusion elsewhere in the report that throughout the Mosul province, multilingualism and intermarriage rendered impossible such a simplified approach. They did, however, also recognize that political and economic interests, or what they called “opportunism,” played a role in the opinions of certain respondents. For instance, they noted that the Kurdish tribal leaders of Kirkuk who favored inclusion in Iraq were often those who were being paid by the Iraqi government to police the roads leading into the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0096144212449143">30</xref></sup> Ultimately, the commission made its decision as to the proper status of the Mosul province primarily on the basis of preexisting economic ties, which, they argued, were stronger with Baghdad than with southeastern Anatolia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0096144212449143">31</xref></sup> Consequently, they ruled in favor of British Iraq. After some further negotiations with Turkish officials, a tripartite Anglo-Iraqi-Turkish treaty cemented the Mosul province’s status as part of Iraq in 1926.</p>

<title>Emerging Fault Lines at the End of the Mandate, 1926-1932</title>
<p>While the integration of Kirkuk and the rest of the Mosul region into Baghdad’s domain had been an ongoing process since the creation of the monarchy in 1921, the political developments that took place after the settlement of the Mosul question underscored the fact that this was the overarching goal of Anglo-Iraqi policy in predominantly non-Arab areas. As the Baghdad-based Iraqi government progressively became more involved in affairs at the levels of provincial and municipal government in Kirkuk, changes in patronage led to shifting loyalties among its communities. The fact that the Iraqi government was Arab-led strengthened the ethnic dimension of these affiliations and antagonisms in a way that did not occur when Kirkukis who supported the Baghdad-based government were more heavily reliant on the patronage of the British, a wholly external and (at least ostensibly) temporary power. The shift in loyalty appears to have been especially pronounced among Turkish-speaking elites. For instance, Mustafa of the Ya‘qubizada family, who had previously engaged in clandestine anticentralization activity and supported Turkey in the Mosul-province dispute, was acting in full support of the Iraqi government by 1931, even distributing progovernment propaganda to tribal chiefs in Kirkuk.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0096144212449143">32</xref></sup> Turkmens constituted a majority of Kirkuk’s provincial officials appointed by Baghdad, a fact that caused consternation among Kirkuki Kurds as well as some concern among British officials.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0096144212449143">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>The impending end of mandate administration in Iraq, as definitively indicated by the Anglo-Iraqi treaty of 1930, also caused considerable unease among Iraq’s Kurds. They feared that inattention to their interests, especially their concern with the continuous Arabization of local governments and schools in predominantly Kurdish areas, would be a permanent policy under a fully sovereign Arab government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0096144212449143">34</xref></sup> For its part, the Iraqi government denied that this was the case while simultaneously resisting Kurdish efforts to ensure that the majority of appointees to local government posts in predominantly Kurdish governorates would be ethnic Kurds.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0096144212449143">35</xref></sup> The eventual compromise, reached after British authorities applied pressure on the Iraqi government to solve the problem, was the Language Law of 1931, which ensured that the official language of administration, courts, and schools in Kurdish-dominated parts of these governorates would be Kurdish.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0096144212449143">36</xref></sup> Many Kurds were dissatisfied by this compromise, which only ensured that local officials would <italic>know</italic> the Kurdish language, an unexceptional requirement in a multilingual region.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0096144212449143">37</xref></sup> Indeed, of 232 officials in the Kirkuk governorate in 1931, only 42 were self-identifying Kurds and only about 39 of the non-Kurds did not know Kurdish.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0096144212449143">38</xref></sup> Virtually all of the officials who were self-identified Turkmens also knew Kurdish.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0096144212449143">39</xref></sup> Therefore, even the implementation of the Language Law would do little to rectify the problem, from the Kurdish viewpoint, of Kurdish underrepresentation in local government.</p>
<p>This lack of Kurdish representation implied that the steady Arabization of primary and secondary education in Kirkuk and throughout predominantly non-Arab areas of Iraq in general, which began in earnest toward the end of the mandate, would continue unabated. Amir Hassanpour has argued that mandate- and monarchy-era educational policies in Iraq endangered Kurdish language usage and may have even hindered Kurdish students’ ability to obtain a postsecondary education.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0096144212449143">40</xref></sup> It was also especially important for self-identified Kurds in rural areas to have some recourse to influence in the local government because of Iraq’s mandate-era political and economic system in which landowning elites who were in the service of the central government wielded considerable autonomous power over taxation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0096144212449143">41</xref></sup> This problem is illustrated in a forceful petition that the chiefs of the Dawudi tribe, who lived in the area south of urban Kirkuk, submitted to the League of Nations when the latter were considering the question of Iraq’s membership and its subsequent independence from mandate rule. The Dawudi chiefs complained that they were “subject to a pitiless and ruthless treatment” by Arab and Turkmen officials of the Kirkuk governorate, who treated them as “aliens” and imposed exorbitant taxes. They also explicitly demanded inclusion in a Kurdish state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0096144212449143">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is therefore clear that while Kurdish grievance was less “pronounced” among Kirkuk’s thoroughly multiethnic and multilingual population in comparison to other largely Kurdish areas, according to one official,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0096144212449143">43</xref></sup> it was nonetheless present. Kurds throughout the region sent numerous petitions to the Iraqi prime minister and to the League of Nations advocating the creation of an independent Kurdish province or state. The Dawudi petition was the only major petition to originate in Kirkuk, although various Kirkuki Kurds put their names to other petitions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0096144212449143">44</xref></sup> Furthermore, British intelligence reports from Kirkuk indicated that there was some sympathy among Kurdish tribes for the cause of the Sulaymaniyya-based Kurdish separatist Shaykh Mahmud Barzinji,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0096144212449143">45</xref></sup> to whom the Kurds of Kirkuk had previously been hostile. Hence, as Arab-led Iraq approached independence, a combination of increased centralization and language-based policies that failed to effectively expand Kurdish representation in local government strengthened the divide between Arabs and Kurds in Kirkuk. With so many Turkmen civil servants now unequivocally answering to the Baghdad government, these policies also led to the emergence of a distinct fault line between Turkmens and Kurds.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Kirkukis’ political interests were still not necessarily tied to their ethnic identities in such a way as to pit its ethnic communities against each other inexorably. After the tripartite treaty of 1926 settled the Mosul question, anticentralization sentiment continued to manifest to the extent that some Kirkuki Turkmens, including members of the Naftchizada family, were inclined to sympathize with those who advocated the creation of an independent Kurdish region or state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0096144212449143">46</xref></sup> One British intelligence report from 1929 went so far as to allege that a Turkmen notable in Kirkuk, ‘Izzat Pasha, was cooperating with local Kurdish tribal leaders to spread propaganda in support of Shaykh Mahmud Barzinji as a step toward the reinstatement of Turkish rule.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0096144212449143">47</xref></sup> While some aspects of this claim are undoubtedly exaggerated, an underlying assumption of common political interests between some Turkmens and Kurds is apparent. These examples demonstrate that as of the end of British mandate rule of Iraq in 1932, Kirkuk’s ethnic communities continued to often share political concerns and did not, at this time, develop specific goals that were antithetical to one another.</p>

<title>Kirkuk, Iraq’s “Oil City”</title>
<p>Another event in the years leading up to Iraq’s independence that profoundly affected Kirkuk was the striking of oil at Baba Gurgur, just northwest of the town, in 1927. It soon became clear that Kirkuk was resting on a massive oil field. The area had been known to be rich with petroleum for as long as it had been inhabited, and a minor local oil trade that consisted of the collection of oil from surface-level seepages had existed for centuries. (The “Naftchi” part of the name “Naftchizada,” combining an Arabic word with a Turkish suffix, means “oilman.”) European expeditions confirmed this fact in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; the Royal Geographical Society of the United Kingdom was particularly diligent about publishing papers in its journal by British explorer-spies who had been to “Mesopotamia” and “Kurdistan.” Many of these explorers cited Kirkuk as a promising area for its especially extensive “petroleum springs.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0096144212449143">48</xref></sup> As early as the 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement, when Britain and France provisionally divided the Ottoman Empire into their desired zones of “direct control” and “influence” in anticipation of an Allied victory, British officials ensured that the oil-rich area surrounding Kirkuk would be under their auspices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0096144212449143">49</xref></sup> There is little question that the desire to incorporate the Mosul province’s presumed oil riches into the fledgling Iraqi state was the primary reason that Britain fought Turkey for control over the region.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0096144212449143">50</xref></sup> However, despite the centrality of oil to the Mosul question, it was very rarely mentioned in the meetings, negotiations, correspondences, and League of Nations activities surrounding the dispute. British, Iraqi, and Turkish officials did not regard the city of Kirkuk and its hinterland as specifically important.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0096144212449143">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>Kirkuk took on new significance when the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), recognizing it as “the best labour centre outside of Baghdad and Mosul” and considering its proximity to Baba Gurgur, moved their headquarters and operations there in 1931.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0096144212449143">52</xref></sup> The IPC was a British-registered company jointly owned by British, French, American, and Dutch interests in which the British predominated. Owing in large part to British officials’ maneuvering, it had obtained a monopoly for the development of Iraqi oil fields.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0096144212449143">53</xref></sup> The IPC’s impact in Kirkuk was strong and immediate. As of January 1931, the IPC employed more than 2,300 workers throughout Iraq, nearly 2,000 of whom were native Iraqis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0096144212449143">54</xref></sup> The majority of the latter were working at Baba Gurgur, thereby already forming a significant portion of Kirkuk’s workforce. When the company laid off more than 1,400 of its Iraqi workers by October 1931 in order to temporarily stop drilling, crime increased in Kirkuk as a result of the surge in unemployment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0096144212449143">55</xref></sup> This episode was an early sign of the influence that the IPC would soon wield in Kirkuk.</p>
<p>In view of this influence, the company immediately positioned itself as a positive force for economically developing the city, a position that the Iraqi government promptly recognized. In a visit to Kirkuk in June 1931, King Faysal told IPC officials at a reception that the town had “grown and altered beyond recognition” since his last visit five years before and credited the company with this achievement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0096144212449143">56</xref></sup> After a disastrous 1946 strike of Kirkuki IPC employees in which they demanded housing, the company planned and built a neighborhood, the Arrapha Estate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0096144212449143">Figure 1</xref>), just northwest of the city, and undertook a housing scheme beginning in 1952 to allow some workers to purchase newly built homes in other parts of the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0096144212449143">57</xref></sup> The IPC explicitly viewed the housing scheme as a politically advantageous way of promoting a stronger civic identity in Kirkuk, as illustrated by a memorandum that described one purpose of the scheme as giving each worker “a positive stake in the community of the town of which he is a member.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0096144212449143">58</xref></sup> Also in 1946, the governor of the Kirkuk governorate asked the IPC to help provide the municipality of Kirkuk with drinking water due to perpetual shortages in the summer months as a result of the city’s rapidly growing population. The IPC obliged, viewing such involvement in the city’s public works as politically necessary, and the project eventually developed into a water supply scheme undertaken in collaboration with Iraq’s newly formed Development Board.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0096144212449143">59</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>The city’s dire need for such economic development projects reflected the fact that by the late 1940s, Kirkuk had undergone dramatic social and economic changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0096144212449143">Figure 2</xref>). Many people had migrated into the city from the surrounding areas and from other parts of Iraq to work for the Iraq Petroleum Company and associated trades; the 1957 census estimated that its population was more than 120,000. Furthermore, people who spoke Turkish as their first language no longer constituted a majority of the urban population. While Turkish-speakers constituted a plurality at over 45,000, there were more than 40,000 Kurds and 27,000 Arabs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0096144212449143">60</xref></sup> Another major change was that the usage of Arabic was rising in prevalence in the multilingual city, a phenomenon that must have been partly a result of Baghdad’s effort to promote Arabic-language primary and secondary education in predominantly non-Arab areas. Accordingly, the IPC offered its foreign workers classes in colloquial Iraqi Arabic in order to allow them to communicate with Kirkukis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0096144212449143">61</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>Kirkuk had also taken on a new, unique characterization among Iraqis and non-Iraqis alike: that of Iraq’s “oil city.” The IPC’s general-interest magazine, <italic>Iraq Petroleum</italic>, and its Arabic-language companion, <italic>Ahl al-Naft</italic> (People of Oil), which both began publication in 1951, regularly featured articles and photographic spreads touting the progress made on Kirkuk’s public works projects in conjunction with those highlighting the company’s installations for extracting, refining, and exporting oil, lauding the role oil had played in modernizing the provincial town.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0096144212449143">62</xref></sup> The Iraqi press sometimes did the same, as in an August 1950 article that detailed what the IPC was “doing for its workers” and its electricity scheme for the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0096144212449143">63</xref></sup> These articles coincided with the first concerted and highly publicized nationwide economic development projects undertaken by the Iraqi government under the auspices of the Development Board, which had been tasked with the allotment of 70 percent of Iraq’s oil revenue toward these projects. Iraqi and Western publications alike therefore portrayed Iraq’s “oil city” not only as a marvel unto itself but as an essential component of the country’s modernization in general. In a 1952 speech, the chairman of the IPC declared that Iraq’s newly realized higher oil revenues would “open the prospect of a new era of prosperity for the people, assuring them of a better standard of living, with a better future for their children.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0096144212449143">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>An interest in Kirkuk’s history, generally understood as its ancient, medieval, and Ottoman-era history, accompanied the newfound attention to the city. For instance, an American oil company’s informational film about the construction of an oil pipeline from Kirkuk emphasized its assumed Biblical connection; the famed natural gas fires constantly burning just outside the city at Baba Gurgur were imagined to be the “fiery furnace” of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0096144212449143">65</xref></sup> The aforementioned 1952 speech by the IPC chairman stated that the company had “been privileged to contribute to the prosperity of this ancient town,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0096144212449143">66</xref></sup> thus using Kirkuk’s long documented history simultaneously as a contrast with its oil-enabled modernity and to lend the latter extra prestige. Local intellectuals also participated in constructing an image of Kirkuk as a city with a rich history and prosperous present. In the mid-1950s, a Kirkuki Assyrian established an Arabic and English publishing house, Matba‘at al-Tatwij (Coronation Press), which printed a thorough informational book about Kirkuk in the past and present, <italic>Madha fi Karkuk</italic> (What’s in Kirkuk), in 1957.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0096144212449143">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>Kirkuk’s “oil city” character also carried emotive significance, as reflected by the more affective phrase “the city of black gold,” a phrase sometimes used to describe Kirkuk in contexts in which the author wished to convey a sense of astonishment at the city’s riches and its transformation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0096144212449143">68</xref></sup> For example, in the February 1958 issue of <italic>Ahl al-Naft</italic>, a poet named Bashir Mustafa published a poem about Kirkuk called “The Eternal Fire” (<italic>Al-Nar al-Khalida</italic>), a reference to the natural gas fires of Baba Gurgur. The poem begins:
<disp-quote>
<p>Kirkuk, O city of black gold,</p>
<p>This flame of yours does not have a hearth</p>
<p>as though your insides burned</p>
<p>blazingly, bursting forth from a closed heart</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Using a bombastic classical Arabic meter and persistent fire imagery, Mustafa portrays Kirkuk as volatile and passionate. The poem goes on, in two stanzas, to develop the fire imagery as a metaphor for the “grief and rebellion” that Kirkuk “endures.” The last stanza contains references to pre-Abrahamic concepts and practices, including the worship of “Magi,” and ends with a suggestion that the poet may have been moved to write the poem because the city of Kirkuk is “the holiest temple.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0096144212449143">69</xref></sup> Much like the combination of history writing and praise for modernization that accompanied Kirkuk’s urban development, this poem juxtaposes ancient images with the modern city; the phrase “city of black gold” comes to invoke both. Even more striking is the poet’s reverence for Kirkuk’s mineral resources, as evident in his association of the surface-level manifestation of Kirkuk’s natural gas, the fires, with worship. This allegory reflects the laudatory tone of the writing about Kirkuk’s oil and urban development in general.</p>
<p>Therefore, by the late 1950s, Kirkuk had developed a distinctive local character in which both Kirkukis and non-Kirkukis were deeply invested. It had gained a sense of its history and its purpose as an “oil city”: an example of Iraqi modernity and the lifeblood that made the country’s economic development possible. It had not obtained the autonomy from Baghdad, whether partial or complete, that so many of its inhabitants had desired during the era of the British mandate; on the contrary, it was politically and economically more closely intertwined with Baghdad than ever before and had experienced major demographic and social changes in the process. The sudden political change brought about by the Iraqi revolution in 1958 would soon lend powerful significance to Kirkuk’s local political domain and exacerbate the divisions between the communities participating in it.</p>

<sec id="section4-0096144212449143">
<title>Authority and Violence in Postrevolution Kirkuk, 1958-1959</title>
<p>On July 14, 1958, two brigades of the Iraqi Army took over Baghdad, killing the entire royal family and, eventually, the government’s most powerful establishment figure, Nuri al-Sa‘id. The coup, which encountered no resistance and was met with supportive demonstrations and mob violence, quickly evolved into a revolution, and the leaders of the coup declared the establishment of the Republic of Iraq. On assuming power as the Prime Minister of Iraq, one of Brigadier General ‘Abd al-Karim Qasim’s early moves was to allow the Iraqi Communist Party, which had been suppressed under the monarchy, to operate freely. Qasim believed that the growth of Communist influence would be politically beneficial to him because, once powerful, they would serve as a foil to his political opponents. Furthermore, the Communist Party was already well organized and had more of an established popular base, including among Kurds in northern Iraq, than any other political entity in the country. In some respects, then, Qasim had no choice but to cooperate with them. His strategy of using the party to his own advantage notwithstanding, the Communists soon emerged as a formidable force with the potential to threaten his position.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0096144212449143">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Kirkuk, the first major change due to the rise of the Communist Party was an immediate rise in Kurdish influence in the city, which Turkmens perceived as occurring at their expense. Affiliates of the Communists in Kirkuk were predominantly Kurdish, and political affiliations in this era corresponded roughly to the class lines along which the city’s Kurdish and Turkmen communities tended to fall. The city’s Turkmen community was long accustomed to making up a disproportionate share of the urban elite and such middle-class groups as shopkeepers and artisans. The Kurds of Kirkuk, many of whom had moved into the city from surrounding rural areas over the past three decades, tended to be poor and therefore more receptive to unionizing. Kurdish members of the Communist Party came to hold several top positions in Kirkuk’s local government in the early Qasim era, including the mayor’s office and the leadership of the court.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0096144212449143">71</xref></sup> Several crucial social, political, and economic factors, such as ideology and socioeconomic status, thus came to be closely associated with ethnic identities in the radically changed political landscape of postrevolution Kirkuk.</p>
<p>These identities had also hardened by the late 1950s, a process reflected by the fact that in the fall of 1958, Kirkuk fell into a pattern of intercommunal violence between Turkmens and Kurds. The spark that set off the violence was the visit of the Kurdish nationalist leader Mustafa Barzani, who had left Iraq under duress after the collapse of his rebellion in 1947, to Kirkuk after Qasim permitted his return to the country in October 1958. The government’s official stance with regard to the Kurds, as reflected in its new constitution, was that Arabs and Kurds were considered “partners” in the “Iraqi homeland.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0096144212449143">72</xref></sup> Accordingly, when Barzani visited Kirkuk on October 25 on a tour of Iraq, Kurds had decorated the city with banners associating him with Qasim. This prominent emphasis on “Arab-Kurdish unity” in Kirkuk infuriated many members of the city’s Turkmen community, and angry Turkmens tore down the banners, starting a riot. The Turkmens were also perturbed by the presence of Kurds from outside of the city, who had evidently come in from Arbil and Sulaymaniyya.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0096144212449143">73</xref></sup> A declaration purporting to represent the views of “democratic Turkmens” issued after the events of October 1958 protested the “extremist Kurds who came from outside Kirkuk” and who, according to them, chanted “Kirkuk is the city of the Kurds” during Barzani’s visit to the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0096144212449143">74</xref></sup> Hence, the army was forced to step in to prevent further rioting and the entrance of more Kurds from outside of Kirkuk.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0096144212449143">75</xref></sup> Episodic hostility between the communities would continue into the 1960s.</p>
<p>What is remarkable about this series of clashes is the extent to which ethnic affiliations, more than any other single factor, determined the sides that Kirkukis took in each episode. Hanna Batatu, an American historian who wrote the definitive account of Kirkuk’s intercommunal violence of 1958 and 1959 based on his onetime access to municipal police documents in 1964, found that the troops who were called to quell the Kurdish–Turkmen clash in Kirkuk in October 1958 ended up dividing along ethnic lines and fighting each other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0096144212449143">76</xref></sup> The fight between Kirkuk’s two largest groups in the nascent Iraqi republic was therefore fundamentally driven by the desire of each group to assume authority over the city, both literal and perceived. The city’s inhabitants were more concerned than before with controlling local institutions rather than relying solely on the patronage of external entities. While the issue of representation in local government was still one that mainly concerned elites, the explosion of violence in public spaces suggests that hardened ethnic identities had also taken on a popular form by this time.</p>
<p>The fact that Iraq’s “oil city” had become imbued with a profound sense of current and historical importance manifested in the intellectual component of the competition for perceived authority in Kirkuk. In one episode, this competition occurred in a Baghdad newspaper. On March 1, 1959, a Turkmen from Kirkuk named Shakir ‘Umar published an article in <italic>Al-Ahali</italic> titled “The History of the Peoples of Iraq” (<italic>Tarikh al-Aqwam fī al-‘Iraq</italic>) that argued that Iraqi civilization was of Turkic origin. He claimed that the Sumerian people of ancient Mesopotamia were “Turks” or “Turkmens,” offered apocryphal Turkish etymologies for the names of Iraqi cities, and most strikingly, asserted that the Kurds were descendants of a branch of the Turks who had split off.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0096144212449143">77</xref></sup> A Kurdish student from Sulaymaniyya who was studying history in Baghdad at the time, Kamal Muzhir Ahmad, wrote an incredulous and often indignant six-part response to the article that was published in <italic>Al-Ahali</italic> throughout the rest of March 1959.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0096144212449143">78</xref></sup> Part of Ahmad’s goal was to straightforwardly refute ‘Umar’s more egregious distortions of history, but his arguments and rhetoric also revealed the underlying hostility between Turkmens and Kurds that catalyzed the exchange. For instance, Ahmad claimed that ‘Umar believed the Kurds of Arbil and Kirkuk, in particular, were “Turks,” although ‘Umar had not explicitly stated this. Ahmad’s assertion indicates his attention to a subtext, whether imagined or real, of Turkmen claims to rightful authority over those cities. Ahmad then went so far as to claim that the Turkmen presence in Iraq dated back four centuries at the most, as they were the descendants of Turkish soldiers who had been settled there by the Ottomans along a line running southeast from Arbil to Mandali, with Kirkuk in between, in order to strengthen the Ottoman position in the region.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0096144212449143">79</xref></sup> Years later, Ahmad recalled being told by a friend in Kirkuk that people there had purchased the issues of <italic>Al-Ahali</italic> in which his articles appeared and, owing to a lack of copies, passed them around to each other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0096144212449143">80</xref></sup> This public exchange between two intellectuals, one Turkmen and one Kurdish, reveals a dimension of the conflict between the groups that is not obvious when considering intercommunal violence alone: namely, the investment that these groups already had in claiming their historical legitimacy in opposition to one another throughout northern Iraq, but especially in Kirkuk. The forceful tone of Ahmad’s articles also reflects the highly charged atmosphere between Turkmens and Kurds in the spring of 1959.</p>
<p>Similar tensions existed between Qasim’s government and the Communists, exacerbated by five days of chaotically complex intercommunal violence in the city of Mosul in March 1959 that began with a massive demonstration by Communist affiliates that Qasim had initially approved.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0096144212449143">81</xref></sup> Qasim’s subsequent efforts to quell Communist influence included the firing on July 1, 1959, of the Communist-affiliated Arab commanding officer of an army brigade stationed in Kirkuk, Brigadier Dawud Salman ‘Abbas al-Janabi, who was later reported to have been arrested along with five other army officers who were suspected of Communist ties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0096144212449143">82</xref></sup> It was in this context that the worst episode yet of intercommunal violence between Turkmens and Kurds occurred in Kirkuk.</p>
<p>Kurdish affiliates of the Communist Party decided to stage a demonstration in the center of Kirkuk on the first anniversary of the coup, July 14, 1959, as a defiant show of their strength in the city. Turkmens planned their own demonstration for the same day, apparently in response. The Kurdish-led Kirkuk police took “appropriate precautionary measures” in anticipation of a clash between the two groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0096144212449143">83</xref></sup> On July 14, the two processions went ahead as planned and passed by each other in the center of the city, at first without incident. Disaster struck when an unknown provocation caused the Kurdish demonstrators to attack a Turkmen-owned coffee shop, destroying it and killing the owner. A fight between the demonstrators ensued and the Turkmens, who were evidently not carrying firearms, were overwhelmed by the armed Kurds. The Kurdish demonstrators were then joined by Kurdish troops from an army division stationed locally in attacking the Turkmen quarter and destroying more buildings. These attacks continued for two days until government reinforcements restored order. In the end, at least thirty-one people had been killed and 130 injured. The overwhelming majority of people in both categories were Turkmens; twenty-four out of twenty-eight of the perpetrators of the attacks who were eventually convicted and executed were Kurds.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0096144212449143">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is telling that this horrific event, which riveted Iraq and devastated the standing of the Communist Party nationwide, began with symbolic and highly visible demonstrations of force consisting of ethnically homogeneous groups of Kurds and Turkmens. The Kurds’ position of influence in Kirkuk had been recently threatened by Baghdad, as exemplified by the firing of Brigadier al-Janabi, and the Turkmens’ standing was endangered as long as Kurds were well organized under the auspices of labor organizations and held powerful local offices. Simultaneously perceiving challenges to their authority in the city, these groups attempted to assert control over Kirkuk’s public space and ended up in a violent confrontation. The intercommunal violence in postrevolution Kirkuk is therefore an indication of the fact that the city’s communities, especially the Turkmens and Kurds, had thoroughly invested themselves in a distinct domain of local politics.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has demonstrated that in the era of the British mandate in Iraq, when the state had just been formed and local politics were largely subsumed under relations between powerful external entities, the political interests of the people of Kirkuk relied primarily on their ties to one or more of three patrons: the British administrators of Iraq, the fledgling Iraqi government, or the Turks. The debate surrounding the Mosul question was driven by these three forces, leaving Kirkukis to choose a side based on which entity best served their interests—or, as was often the case, to position themselves against a side based on its perceived hostility to their concerns. Group identities, which were fluid at the time, were not the main determining factor of those concerns. Even as antagonisms between Kurds, Turkmens, and Arabs were already present in some rhetoric and became more apparent during the prelude to Iraqi independence, when Kirkuki Kurds began to protest their treatment at the hands of mostly Turkmen and Arab provincial officials, the groups were not necessarily on a path toward intercommunal violence because their interests were not in conflict with one another.</p>
<p>The growth of Kirkuk, which transformed it from a provincial town into Iraq’s “oil city” and brought about profound social and economic changes, gave its inhabitants a stake in the city and, in doing so, fostered competition for authority within it. The competition, over both its institutions and its characterization, fell along the lines that had been evident at the end of the mandate. The events of 1958 and 1959 show that by that time, Kirkuk had a fully developed domain of urban politics largely distinct from more powerful external interests over which Kurds and Turkmens, in particular, were determined to assert their claims. As Kirkuk’s growth led to a greater consciousness of its past, both on the part of Westerners who were fascinated with Iraq’s ancient heritage and Iraqis who sought to write about its history as part of their stronger civic identity, these groups also became conscious of the need to articulate their historical legitimacy in the city.</p>
<p>Today, it is common for Kirkukis of all ethnicities to claim that the Ba‘th Party “implanted” antagonism among the city’s ethnic groups with its “Arabization” policies. Kirkukis would, it is assumed, otherwise be living together peacefully.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0096144212449143">85</xref></sup> It is also common to encounter the opposite notion that deeply entrenched hostilities between Kurds, Turkmens, and Arabs in Kirkuk have been ongoing for centuries. Even Hanna Batatu, arguably the most formidable historian of modern Iraq, repeatedly stresses the role of the “inveterate enmity” between the “old antagonists,” the Kurds and Turkmens, in his account of Kirkuk’s postrevolutionary intercommunal violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0096144212449143">86</xref></sup> This article has questioned both of these notions. It has shown that distinct fault lines between Kirkuk’s ethnic groups began to emerge as early as the British mandate era. It has also shown that those fault lines are by no means primordial and that conflict between Kirkuk’s ethnic groups has never been inevitable.</p>

<p>Kurds often refer to Kirkuk as “the Kurdish Jerusalem”; see, e.g.: Maggy Zanger, “Refugees in Their Own Country,” <italic>Middle East Report</italic> 222 (Spring 2002), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.merip.org/mer/mer222/222_zanger.html">http://www.merip.org/mer/mer222/222_zanger.html</ext-link> (accessed June 10, 2010). Turkmens sometimes call the city the “ancestral capital” of the Turkmen people; see, e.g.: Yücel Güçlü, “Who Owns Kirkuk? The Turkoman Case,” <italic>The Middle East Quarterly</italic> (Winter 2007), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.meforum.org/article/1074">http://www.meforum.org/article/1074</ext-link> (accessed June 10, 2010). Chaldo-Assyrians have asserted the significance of Kirkuk to their identity by emphasizing its location near the ancient Assyrian city of Arrapha; see, e.g.: Sargon Yousip Potros, “The History of Kirkuk City,” <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://assyriansofkirkuk.com/kirkukhistory.html">http://assyriansofkirkuk.com/kirkukhistory.html</ext-link> (accessed June 10, 2010).</p></fn>

<p>Among other topics, a comprehensive history of the evolution of group identities in Kirkuk would have to include a broader discussion of the development of ethnic and other types of nationalisms in Iraq in general. For the development of Kurdish nationalism, see, e.g.: Wadie Jwaideh, <italic>The Kurdish National Movement: Its Origins and Development</italic> (Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 2006); David McDowall, <italic>A Modern History of the Kurds</italic>, 3rd ed. (London: I.B. Tauris, 2007). There is a robust literature on predominantly Arab Iraqi nationalisms in various periods, including: Orit Bashkin, “Hybrid Nationalisms: Watani and Qawmi Visions in Iraq Under ‘Abd al-Karim Qasim, 1958-61,” <italic>International Journal of Middle Eastern Studies</italic> 43 (2011): 293-312; Eric Davis, <italic>Memories of State: Politics, History and Collective Identity in Modern Iraq</italic> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005); Reeva Simon, <italic>Iraq Between the Two World Wars: The Militarist Origins of Tyranny</italic> (New York: Columbia University Press, 2004).</p></fn>

<p>The administrative boundaries surrounding Kirkuk changed many times in the late Ottoman and early British mandate periods. The British estimate of the ethnic composition of the Kirkuk qada’ (provincial subdivision including rural villages but excluding other urban areas) in 1925, however, provides an illustrative example: it consisted of 29,073 Kurds, 20,642 “Turcomans,” 19,644 Arabs, 1,000 Christians, and 1,003 Jews. “Map Showing the Boundaries of the Liwas and Qadhas of the Mosul Vilayet, Together with the Composition of the Estimated Population of Each Qadha,” 1925, MPKK 1/54, National Archives of the United Kingdom, London (hereinafter UK).</p></fn>

<p>Batatu, <italic>The Old Social Classes</italic>, 912. Batatu’s fundamental argument in his discussion of the violent events of July 1959 in Kirkuk is that the Iraqi Communist Party did not plan them and that their motivation had nothing to do with Communist ideology; hence, in the absence of Communist complicity, he settles on the argument that inherent ethnic hatreds caused these events.</p></fn>
