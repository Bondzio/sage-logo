<title>Defining Mind-Set</title>
<p>Reed and Stoltz (2011) introduced the concept of mind-set in their book <italic>Put Your Mindset to Work: The One Asset You Really Need to Win and Keep the Job You Love. </italic> They purported that mind-set is even more important than any skill set an employee brings to the job. More specifically, the authors defined mind-set as “the internal lens through which you see and navigate life. Mind-set influences everything you see as well as everything you do” (p. 6). The authors further explained that mind-set is about what we see, think, and believe not just about skills we have learned. Reed and Stoltz listed the top six mind-set qualities identified by employers: honesty, trustworthiness, commitment, adaptability, accountability, and flexibility. They asserted that if one masters these qualities their “value to employers grows dramatically” (p. 23).</p>
<p>The book also included microchallenges designed to assist the reader with understanding and applying the key concepts presented in the chapter. In many ways, the book assists the reader in discovering and fostering their own mind-set. Anecdotal examples are also included to help the reader grasp the material and understand how mind-set is used in professional settings. Furthermore, each chapter concludes with a “recap” section to support introduced concepts.</p>

<title>Mind-Set Path</title>
<p>Reed and Stoltz (2011) described the mind-set path to include four stages: understand, gauge, strengthen, and apply. The authors explained understand helps the reader discover the ideal winning mind-set. Gauge introduces the 3G panorama to assess mind-set. Strengthen examines way to fortify mind-set. Finally, apply is using mind-set to obtain and advance in employment. Each of these sections of the mind-set path was explored in detail.</p>

<sec id="section3-1066480712449800">
<title>Understand</title>
<p>The authors stated that the ideal winning mind-set can be broken down into three categories including global mind-set, good mind-set, and grit mind-set. The first, global mind-set, is described as the vantage point: “It is about how far you see, reach, and go to understand and address the everyday challenges and issues” (p. 29). The authors suggested that this is one aspect that determines one’s long-term career growth. Second, good mind-set, “is about seeing and approaching the world in a way that truly benefits those around you” (p. 3). They explain that leaders cultivate the “good” around them and foster it within others. Finally, grit mind-set, is referred to as the “fuel cell of the 3G Mind-set: it propels you forward and brings your 3G Mind-set to life, even in the darkest moments” (p. 32). The authors clarified that grit shows that anyone can come out ahead regardless of their starting point including advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<sec id="section4-1066480712449800">
<title>Gauge</title>
<p>Reed and Stoltz introduce a tool called the 3G panorama. In its entirety, this is an online tool that provides the reader with a report of findings from the assessment. The 3G panorama uses a Likert-type scale to assess the global, good, and grit portions of mind-set. In general, the higher the reader scores in each of the areas the better for one’s mind-set. The lower the scores the more one has to work on developing the full potential of their mind-set.</p>

<sec id="section5-1066480712449800">
<title>Strengthen</title>
<p>According to the authors the 3G mind-set is something that can be enhanced and strengthened. They provided a neurobiological explanation of the science behind mind-set. In addition, Reed and Stoltz (2011) explained, “Your biological makeup programs you to absorb and copy other people automatically (p. 81). They encouraged people to surround themselves with individuals who possess a desirable mind-set. By doing this, one is able to strength the aspects of their own mind-set by emulating others. The science of motivation including behavioral, external, and intrinsic drivers was also applied to strengthening one’s mind-set. The authors encouraged identification of how motivation influenced moments in life where one is fully engaged in an activity. They outline how 3G mind-set is impacted by motivation.</p>
<p>Growing one’s mind-set is further described by the influence of “good.” The authors purported that good as it related to the 3G mind-set refers to an individual “who stands up to and is strengthened by the most difficult tests” (p. 133). They elaborated further that the worse things become in society contextually (political, financials, business crises), “the more good matters” (p. 133). Finally, Reed and Stoltz (2011) explained that growth, resilience, intensity, and tenacity are tools that can be used to improve and grow one’s mind-set. </p>

<title>Apply</title>
<p>In the final chapters of the book, the authors described how to increase one’s chances for securing a preferred job. They provide a detailed explanation about résumé composition and development. More specifically, the authors encouraged creating statements that demonstrate how the 3G mind-set qualities have been used to produce tangible results. Sample statements are provided within the chapters. In addition, they suggested the use of a CMe that replaces a résumé. The results from the online 3G panorama described above are automatically transferred into a CMe template. They provided five steps for completing a CMe. </p>
<p>The final aspect of applying mind-set to the world of work is described as the personal return on individual (ROI). The authors defined personal ROI as “comparing everything you add with everything you subtract to determine how much you truly contribute” (p. 221). A formula is provided to calculate one’s personal ROI. A discussion of minimal and maximal ROI is also integrated into the chapter. Reed and Stoltz (2011) included valuable information related to employer and employee perspectives in the job market.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, the editors of the book provide the reader with practical information about developing, fostering, and applying one’s mind-set. This book is appropriate for clinicians working with individuals on career-related issues or concerns. It certainly presents a refreshing, comprehensive approach related to job procurement. This book could be a helpful resource for clinicians who want to foster self-awareness and career perspective taking in their work with clients.</p>
