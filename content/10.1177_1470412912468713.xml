<p>With Michael Haneke’s triumph at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, where he won the Palme d’Or for the second time – first for <italic>Das weisse Band</italic> (2009), now for <italic>Amour</italic> (2012) – the Austrian filmmaker has once again demonstrated his centrality to contemporary visual culture. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470412912468713">Manohla Dargis (2012)</xref> reported in <italic>The New York Times</italic>: ‘judging by the unusually sustained standing ovation that greeted the announcement of the Palme, “Amour” seemed like the only possible choice.’ In view of these events, this volume of interdisciplinary essays on Haneke’s cinema seems especially welcome, responding to the most pressing questions raised in these films – among them, the ethics of the gaze, media violence, the function of the mediated image in a society dominated by forms of surveillance, issues of transcendence, and the limits of intersubjective understanding. Editorially, though, the volume makes a hurried impression: errors of fact (Haneke did not receive the Palme for <italic>Funny Games</italic> as the editors claim in their introduction) and multiple problems of translation and even proofreading do not establish the best foundation for the book’s critical project. So when Serge Goriely, in his discussion of <italic>Caché</italic> (p. 119), cites the dialogue of the tense scene between Georges and Majid that ends shockingly in Majid’s suicide, one is not entirely surprised to find this strange rendering:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Majid:</speaker>
<p>I wanted to repeat you that I was totally unaware of the tapes.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Georges:</speaker>
<p>And then, it is everything?</p>
</speech>
<p>Such surface blemishes notwithstanding, this collection offers a unique blend of critical perspectives on Haneke’s films, with a clear focus on the dialogue between theology and film studies. The editors’ hope is that this volume of essays ‘might encourage further interdisciplinary work in the realm of theology and culture’ (p. 10), and a number of the essays dwell at length on the question of how to <italic>justify</italic> an interest in film, from the perspective of theological disciplinarity. Indeed, the first of the book’s five sections, entitled ‘Voices’, offers Haneke’s own voice in the interview with Franz Grabner, but then moves to Charles Martig’s ‘<italic>How Much Haneke Do We Deserve? Against Sadistic–Philosophical Tendencies in Filmmaking</italic>’. Martig, theologian and general manager of the Catholic Media Service Switzerland, plays ‘<italic>advocatus diaboli</italic>’ and warns of the perils of Haneke’s films (p. 35). For a filmmaker whose (frequently cited) authorial intention is to ‘rape the viewer into independence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470412912468713">Wray, 2007</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470412912468713">1</xref></sup> there is certainly room for principled rejection, but Martig’s conclusion is that Haneke’s negative aesthetic is simply too difficult:
<disp-quote>
<p>Adorno had a point with his dialectic of negation. But is there anybody left who actually understands this intellectual movement? Adorno and Haneke are both lost on a lonely island. While we can certainly admire Haneke as the author of a negative contrast, he deserves our clear rejection for his aesthetic gesture and his role as an enlightened-sadistic filmmaker. (p. 39)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although Haneke’s films certainly challenge the ethics of looking and the stability of the viewer’s subject position as either victim or perpetrator of the systemic violence on display, the intellectual difficulty of negotiating these questions is exactly the wrong criterion for rejecting Haneke’s cinematic vision.</p>
<p>The next section, ‘Traces’, begins with Gerhard Larcher’s fundamental-theological prolegomena, which offers an interesting ‘proposition of an alliance between theology and arts’ (p. 53), emphasizing the theological relevance of Haneke’s films for their ‘meticulous description of human existence under the conditions of the death of God’, that is, ‘under the conditions of the disintegration of the traditional idea of the human being in a situation of spiritual and moral exhaustion’ (p. 59). Christian Wessely and Michael Hoelzl follow closely on this track in their respective essays. Wessely attributes to Haneke a ‘transcendental style’, which builds on and modifies Paul Schrader’s theory of <italic>Transcendental Style in Film</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470412912468713">1972</xref>). In Wessely’s argument, Haneke’s films effectively produce in the viewer a self-reflexive sublime gaze, modeled on the performative effect of Rilke’s ‘Archaic Torso of Apollo’ with its enactment of an aesthetically mediated self-reflexive gaze with an ethical imperative: ‘Du mußt dein Leben ändern’ [You must change your life] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470412912468713">Rilke, 2004</xref>: 503). Hoelzl picks up on the concern with transcendence in his discussion of guilt and sin in <italic>La pianiste</italic> (2001), arguing for a concept of ‘<italic>internalized transcendence</italic>’ (p. 98), which replicates the structure of sin outside the context of the relation to the divine. Hoelzl’s essay is also an(other) exploratory attempt at a justification for the relevance of film for theology, as he poses the questions of whether and how it is possible ‘to extract pure theological substance from a film’ (p. 87), and ‘What is the true intention of analyzing films in theological terms?’ (p. 86). This volume’s insistent focus on these methodological questions, anterior even to theological questions as such, narrows the scope of the discussion in these first two sections significantly.</p>
<p>In subsequent sections these methodological concerns recede and the discussion broadens, as in the case of Serge Goriely’s discussion of death as unrepresentable, which focuses on Haneke’s filmic language and his strategies for the retention of ‘the dimension of mystery that prevails over human death’ (p. 112). Even the suicide scene in <italic>Caché</italic>, Goriely argues, should be read in ‘its theatrical dimension’ (p. 120), as Majid stages his death for Georges, while the scene is also staged, within the structure of the film within the film, for the viewer, so that the representation of death is heavily mediated and ‘cannot be looked at directly’ (p. 123). Davide Zordan raises similar questions of the problem of the <italic>mise-en-scène</italic> of liminal human experience, which resists representation, in his essay on Haneke’s depiction of prayer in <italic>71 Fragmente einer Chronologie des Zufalls</italic> (1994) and <italic>Funny Games</italic>, with some comparison of the original with the remake <italic>Funny Games U.S.</italic> (2007). Zordan examines Hans’s ‘mechanical’ prayer in his bathroom in <italic>71 Fragmente</italic> and Anna’s tortured performance of prayer in <italic>Funny Games</italic>, reading ‘the gesture of the prayer in its complexity of hesitations, inconsistencies, and the uncertainty of the addressee’ (p. 143). Ornella delivers an engaging essay on ‘media violence’ to round out this section of the volume, looking particularly at Haneke’s paradoxical use of violence as a critique of violence and the possibility that this critical project will simply fail. He suggests that, although ‘one might argue that violence can never be safe … [that] violence is never harmless … it is important to foster media and film literacy rather than ban violent material from the cinema or computer screens’ (p. 165). Despite this liberal stance, Ornella’s essay, like many in the volume, ends by questioning whether Haneke’s approach will ultimately achieve his stated aim of alerting spectators to their potential complicity to systemic violence, or whether Haneke’s films will actually incite the viewer to violence.</p>
<p>It is in the final two sections, titled ‘Dialogue’ and ‘Constructions’ respectively, that one finds the volume’s strongest contributions, beginning with an excellent essay on intertextual (mis)quotation in Haneke’s <italic>Fraulein</italic> (1984) and Fassbinder’s <italic>Die Ehe der Maria Braun</italic> (1979) by Oliver C Speck. By working within the ‘critical interstitial of intermediality’, as Speck argues, Haneke and Fassbinder play on <italic>Trümmerfilm</italic> images in order to develop a set of ‘virtual images’, retroactively fabricated, to question postwar discourses on ethics. Scott Loren and Jörg Metelmann then put Haneke into dialogue with Lars von Trier and David Lynch, whose works are collectively read as working against the grain of melodrama as <italic>the</italic> Hollywood blueprint, as Linda Williams has argued: Haneke, like Von Trier and Lynch, evokes a sustained sense of moral discomfort through his ‘political aesthetics of irritation’ (p. 215), subverting audience expectations of moral clarity and demanding that the viewer–subject recognize the complications of ambiguity and the necessity of self-reflection. The final essay in the section on ‘Dialogue’ compares Haneke and Dumont on the issue of the representation of sexuality as an instance of ‘failed communication, violence, disruption of patterns of seeing and making sense’, and an experience that is ‘inherently ambiguous and … potentially painful’ (p. 229). As Knauss argues, sexuality is for both filmmakers ‘a part of the general non-communication and non-relationing [sic] of individuals in contemporary society’ (p. 234). Monica Filimon’s close reading of space in <italic>71 Fragmente</italic> also looks at individuals’ difficulties in relating to each other, as shared spaces, both public and private, fragment and explode into violence under the stress of constant surveillance and disciplinary domination. This thread of surveillance is then picked up in Andrea Gogröf-Voorhees’s reading of <italic>Code inconnu</italic> (2000) and <italic>Caché</italic>, where she offers a convincing Foucauldian/Deleuzian reading of our contemporary ‘control society’. The final two essays in the collection offer further reflection on the ethical questions raised by Haneke’s films, first by considering the cognitive consequences of ‘disturbing deeply ingrained viewing habits’ (p. 283), which Alyda Faber argues results in an invitation to ‘infraperception’; and then by focusing on the significance of narrative in the project of dynamic identity-construction, with Florian Mittl presenting a study of <italic>Caché</italic>, specifically Georges’s refusal to integrate his childhood episodes with Majid into his self-representation.</p>
<p>The book offers an interesting survey of many of the problems raised by Haneke’s cinema, but the methodological focus will limit the readership somewhat, as not every reader interested in a collection of interdisciplinary perspectives on Haneke’s ‘fascinatingly disturbing’ films will expect to find so much attention given to the concerns of how to ‘do theology through films’ (p. 85).</p>
