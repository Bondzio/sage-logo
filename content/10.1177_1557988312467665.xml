<p>On October 18, 2012, the Men’s Health Network convened approximately 50 agencies in Washington, DC, to dialogue regarding strategic initiatives and best practices on men’s health. This is intended to be the first of many dialogues to formulate strategic national coordinated initiatives to advance the men’s health movement and men’s health outcomes. This meeting provided several presentations on “Why Men’s Health,” “The Hispanic/Latino Challenge,” “Putting Men’s Health Care Disparities on the Map,” and an overview of the Men’s Health Network titled the “Men’s Health Landscape.” After these presentations, agency representatives were permitted an opportunity to present their agencies’ men’s health program to the entire group.</p>
<p>This forum will form the “brain trust” to continue the national dialogue regarding men’s health. This is the first of many national meetings to extend the dialogue on men’s health and to also generate a collaborative coalition of agencies that advances men’s health initiatives. In this editorial, I want to focus on some salient points emphasized during this dialogue to reiterate the importance of men’s health. These salient points were presented by Dr Jean J. E. Bonhomme, MD, MPH, at the meeting:</p>
<list id="list1-1557988312467665" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Men have some of the highest rates of morbidity and mortality—cancer, homicide, suicide, heart disease</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Men’s health is a societal and family issue</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Men’s health affects spouses and children—loss of companion/bereavement, diminished family income</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Societal impact of male illness and death—loss of work time, diminished productivity, children face financial repercussions, poverty associated with widowhood</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Children’s impact—men’s health affects normal sperm production, men’s occupation and environmental exposures may affect children’s development of cancer later in life and the ability of the unborn infant to be carried to term and born alive, and advanced paternal age is associated with congenital anomalies</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Psychiatric issues—fathers’ mental health problems are more associated with child’s behavioral problems than emotional problems</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fatherlessness—children are at increased risk for drug and alcohol use, lower grade point averages, lower college aspirations, poor school attendance, higher school dropout rates, more likely to encounter the criminal justice system</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>From a maternal and child perspective, Dr Bonhomme called for an inclusive model and paradigm of parental and child health</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Preventive care—men are less likely to engage in annual examinations and preventive health services</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>At the conclusion of these presentations an open dialogue occurred among the agencies, the majority of agencies committed to ongoing dialogue and future initiatives that promote a forum of national dialogue among various types of agencies focusing on men’s health. For more information on this national dialogue, please contact Mr Scott Williams at the Men’s Health Network (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.menshealthnetwork.org">www.menshealthnetwork.org</ext-link>). In addition, the Men’s Health Network has developed a series of books—<italic>A Blueprint for Men’s Health</italic>—focusing on topics such as cardiovascular disease, mental health, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which can be accessed through the Men’s Health Network. Please join our national dialogue regarding men’s health.</p>
