<abstract>
<p>Few academic studies have addressed the question of how teenagers respond in school social contexts to peer criticism about their choice of brand. To better determine the outlines of this societal issue and associated education marketing, these reactions are studied through the concept of coping, deployed with a combined process-style approach. Three successive quantitative surveys (<italic>n1</italic> = 208; <italic>n2</italic> = 200; <italic>n3</italic> = 446) were used to highlight five specific coping strategies: justification of the purchase circumstances, revenge, denial of the problem, self-reproach, and making the criticizers feel guilty. Gender, perceived controllability of the situation and brand sensitivity are the main determinants of these strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Playgrounds have long been sites for the exclusion of those teenagers who do not wear the ‘right’ brands in the eyes of their peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2051570713487478">Grant and Walsh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2051570713487478">Isaksen and Roper, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2051570713487478">Marcilhacy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2051570713487478">Wooten, 2006</xref>). The last decade has been characterized in particular by young people’s growing awareness of brands through access to the internet and by the proliferation of designer brands offered in all the markets that affect them (clothes, cell phones, etc.). School officials and parents have become concerned about the social pressure exerted by peers linked to the ever-increasing parade of brands at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2051570713487478">Marcilhacy, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Brands play a socially symbolic role in the life of teenagers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2051570713487478">Belk, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2051570713487478">Grant and Walsh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2051570713487478">Isaksen and Roper, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-2051570713487478">Souiden and M’saad, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2051570713487478">Wooten, 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, there is little academic work on how teenagers react to criticism from peers on their choice of brands and on the influence of individual characteristics on these reactions. The present study aims to examine such reactions using the concept of coping strategies – a term that covers everything a person does and thinks for dealing with a stressful situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2051570713487478">Lazarus, 1993a</xref>).</p>
<p>There are two streams of research on coping. The first concerns coping as style, in which coping depends on individual characteristics, regardless of the time or the situation. The second stream refers to coping as process, where coping varies according to the situation. Although most research on consumer behavior adopts the second of these, it seems appropriate to offer a new perspective on the use of this concept by considering a dual view that combines these two streams. Our approach also aims to provide a detailed understanding of consumer situations that generate negative emotions, by identifying the behavior and thoughts associated with a particular stressful situation (coping as process), and distinguishing between individuals who implement a coping reaction according to their personal characteristics (coping as style).</p>
<p>We focus on the use of branded products at school, where peers can play the role of social stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2051570713487478">Coslin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2051570713487478">Giron, 2001</xref>). In particular, we focus on a teenager’s closest school friends. These peers, with whom he/she has a close and intimate relationship, who exert a day-to-day influence, and can pass judgment <italic>a posteriori</italic> on the choice of a branded product.</p>
<p>First, this study aims to reveal the main coping strategies deployed by adolescents when their peers criticize a brand choice. We focus here on brand attribute, because this a key element in the array of possessions of the adolescent. It enables him or her to communicate a certain image to others, which can also be the subject of criticism. In a second stage, this study examines the influence of certain individual characteristics (for example, gender or brand sensitivity) on the use of these coping strategies.</p>
<p>After a literature review, we detail the research methodology. We then develop the key steps that allowed us to identify the five main coping strategies of adolescent consumers in the stressful consumption context being studied. We next present the findings as regards the effect of individual variables on these reactions. Finally, we discuss the study’s theoretical, managerial and societal implications, its limitations, and future research.</p>

<title>Literature review</title>
<p>The literature review helps highlight the role of brands in schools and the potential stress associated with peer criticism as regards brand choice. We also explain why we chose to study junior high school (<italic>collège</italic>) students. From this perspective, the advantage of using the concept of coping strategies is underlined, with particular emphasis on the specifics of coping in adolescence and the different theoretical perspectives on the subject. Finally, the relevant individual characteristics used are presented.</p>

<title>The issue of brands in a school context</title>
<p>From an early age, so as not to be marginalized in their peer group, children try and adopt its codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2051570713487478">Ezan, 2007</xref>). From the age of 12, they become fully conscious of the impact on other adolescents of their consumption choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051570713487478">Bachmann et al., 1993</xref>). The brands chosen therefore have great importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2051570713487478">Grant and Walsh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2051570713487478">Isaksen and Roper, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2051570713487478">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2051570713487478">Liu and Hu, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2051570713487478">Nguyen Chaplin and Roedder John, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2051570713487478">Wooten, 2006</xref>). However, the brand chosen may not match peer expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2051570713487478">Grant and Walsh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2051570713487478">Wooten, 2006</xref>). On the one hand, adolescents are subject to parental authority and therefore the budget constraints set by their family. They may therefore make a choice that conforms to price limitations or simply to their parents’ wishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2051570713487478">Isaksen and Roper, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2051570713487478">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2051570713487478">Marcilhacy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2051570713487478">Wooten, 2006</xref>). On the other hand, they may be convinced that a brand choice is the right one, but simply be mistaken. If this choice does not match the expectations of their peers, they may be criticized; and this will inform them about the group norms and values to be adhered to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2051570713487478">Wooten, 2006</xref>). Such criticisms may threaten the adolescent’s fragile self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2051570713487478">Rosenberg, 1986</xref>), give rise to stress and drive him/her to seek solutions for coping with peer group reproaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2051570713487478">Wooten, 2006</xref>). An adolescent experiencing such a discordant situation with these reference points risks being socially stigmatized and held up to ridicule by them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2051570713487478">Grant and Walsh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2051570713487478">Isaksen and Roper, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>To our knowledge, only <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2051570713487478">Elliott and Leonard (2004)</xref>, in regard to preteens from disadvantaged backgrounds, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2051570713487478">Wooten (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2051570713487478">Grant and Walsh (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2051570713487478">Isaksen and Roper (2012)</xref> for teenagers, have explicitly referred to the problems associated with not wearing the ‘right’ brands at school. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2051570713487478">Elliott and Leonard (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2051570713487478">Isaksen and Roper (2012)</xref> show that the use of designer products avoids being judged negatively by peers. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2051570713487478">Wooten (2006)</xref> points out that criticism of consumption choices plays a part in the socialization of teenagers. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2051570713487478">Grant and Walsh (2009)</xref> highlight the importance of brands in school, where young consumers risk being rejected or criticized, and the unhappiness this may cause. In this article, we will study the reactions of adolescents to peer criticism, concentrating in particular on junior high school students.</p>

<title>Junior high school (<italic>college</italic>), the most sensitive period of adolescence as regards peer group opinion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2051570713487478">Fosse-Gomez (1991</xref>: 106) defines adolescents as ‘individuals aged between 12 and 18, who live with their family and attend school’. We have chosen to focus on one part of this age group: those attending junior high school (<italic>collège</italic>). Early adolescence is a period marked by a very pronounced search for similarities with regard to peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2051570713487478">Coleman, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2051570713487478">Costanzo and Shaw, 1966</xref>). This educational period is, moreover, most marked by ridicule on the subject of possessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2051570713487478">Wooten, 2006</xref>) and in which adolescents are most materialist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2051570713487478">Nguyen Chaplin and Roedder John, 2007</xref>). Self-esteem is also very low in early adolescence and progressively increases in the later teens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2051570713487478">Alsaker and Olweus, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2051570713487478">Maïano et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2051570713487478">Marsh, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2051570713487478">Nguyen Chaplin and Roedder John, 2007</xref>), which makes students at <italic>collège</italic> even more sensitive than students at <italic>lycée</italic> (equivalent to high school) to group influence. The choice of brands at this age thus plays an even greater role in integrating oneself in a group. We will therefore explore in particular reactions to peer criticism of brand choice in this population by using the concept of coping.</p>

<sec id="section5-2051570713487478">
<title>Coping strategies for a clearer understanding teenage consumers’ reactions</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2051570713487478">Lazarus and Folkman (1984</xref>: 141) define coping as ‘constantly changing cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage specific external and/or internal demands that are appraised as taxing or exceeding the resources of the person’. This concept is therefore relevant for studying the reactions of an individual to a consumption situation that generates negative emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-2051570713487478">Yi and Baumgartner, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In view of the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2051570713487478">Wooten (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2051570713487478">Isaksen and Roper (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2051570713487478">2012</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2051570713487478">Grant and Walsh (2009)</xref>, the concept of coping appears to be appropriate for deepening our understanding of problems related to brand choice among adolescents. Their researches show that adolescents have difficulty emotionally managing criticism of the brands worn in the school environment.</p>
<p>We will therefore focus specifically on the coping strategies of adolescent consumers faced with a situation where one of their brand choices for a given product category, in a post-purchase context (i.e. when they wear the product at school), is called into question by their closest school friends.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2051570713487478">Lazarus (1993a)</xref>, there are two research fields on coping. First, coping as style is based on the principle that people present stable characteristics that predispose them to act in the same way faced with all kinds of stressful situations. This view of coping is concerned with individual characteristics. We then refer to personality traits or coping style. This approach originates in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2051570713487478">Menninger (1954)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2051570713487478">Haan (1969)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-2051570713487478">Vaillant (1977)</xref> and has been taken up in various studies of adolescents (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2051570713487478">Kavsek and Seiffge-Krenke, 1996</xref>). Second, coping as process involves a view of stress where the individual attempts to manage a problem in a way that varies depending on the moment and the situation. Based on the work of Lazarus and his colleagues, this person–environment transactional view is characterized by its evolving and changing conception of coping according to the context.</p>
<p>The approaches of studies on consumer behavior are mainly based on coping as process (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2051570713487478">Mathur et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2051570713487478">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-2051570713487478">Yi and Baumgartner, 2004</xref>). The main relationships studied generally concern the effect of stress on the coping strategies used. However, with a view to better understanding consumer behavior, one should question the direct link between the individual characteristics of adolescents and the use of coping strategies in the stressful context concerned. We therefore adopt a mixed approach that combines these two perspectives.</p>
<p>In the first stage, we take the coping-as-process approach: the coping strategies highlighted stem from a situational approach where the specific context is taken into account. In the second stage, the analysis is refined by showing the direct effect of individual characteristics on these coping responses, which corresponds to the view of coping as style.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-2051570713487478">
<title>The specifics of coping among teenagers</title>
<p>The original studies on stress and coping among teenagers were based on work concerned with adults. However, researchers quickly realized that the subject needed to be addressed in a way that was specific to teenagers. There are in fact four major differences between adolescents and adults in regard to coping with stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2051570713487478">Fields and Prinz, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-2051570713487478">Smith and Carlson, 1997</xref>). First, the stressors of adolescence are different from the stressful events experienced by adults: teenagers tend to encounter more negative events stemming from peers, school, family and the psychological and physical changes characterizing this period, compared to other age groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2051570713487478">Liu et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, teenagers tend to have less control over adverse situations than adults because they are limited by financial and legal constraints. Their capacity for coping is also different from that of adults: they are much more limited in their coping repertoire because of their lack of experience. And finally, stressful events affect not only the adolescent as an individual but also his or her whole development process. Furthermore, consumer behavior studies on coping have mainly used samples composed of adults or seniors. Hence, the strategies identified in these latter populations cannot be generalized to teenage consumers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-2051570713487478">
<title>Theoretical perspectives on coping among teenagers</title>
<p>Stress is a ‘state of imbalance within a person, elicited by an actual or perceived disparity between environmental demands and the person’s capacity to cope with these demands’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2051570713487478">Maes et al., 1987</xref>: 567). This definition is consistent with the view of stress proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-2051570713487478">Smith and Carlson (1997)</xref> with regard to teenagers. Several studies allow the nature of the stressor studied here to be characterized. Criticisms by classmates of brand choice is essentially social in origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2051570713487478">Morse and Furst, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2051570713487478">Lepisto et al., 1991</xref>). This type of stressor is mainly a result of the interaction of the adolescent with his/her environment. It is not a matter of stress from external physical factors such as food or drugs. A criticism of a brand choice can generate psychological stress that arouses emotions such as anger or shame. With regard to its intensity, the stress factor studied can be considered as a micro-stressor that reflects the hassles of everyday life, contrasting with a macro-stressor related to major events such as the death of a loved one. In terms of duration, it is a matter of an acute stressor that occurs over a limited time and stems from a one-off event, as opposed to a chronic stressor that endures over time.</p>
<p>There is no consensus on the conceptualization and measurement of how people cope with adverse situations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-2051570713487478">Skinner et al. (2003)</xref> list more than 400 accounts of types of coping strategies. In regard to coping by adolescents, there are two major debates among researchers. The first questions the need to focus the approach on the general dimensions of coping that govern the different responses to stress (for example, problem-centered coping versus emotion-centered coping) or on coping strategies (for example, denial, social support, etc.) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2051570713487478">Figure 1</xref>). The second debate concerns the variability of coping strategies deployed by teenagers. These two debates stem in particular from the existence of a large number of categorizations of adolescent coping. For purposes of aggregating these, it is possible to discern two main types of strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2051570713487478">Fields and Prinz, 1997</xref>):</p>

</list>
<p>This classification into two large groups should be treated with caution, because the strategies may be mutually imbricated; for example, emotion-focused strategies may also be approach strategies (for example, changing one’s way of conceiving of a problem) or avoidance strategies (for example, distancing oneself from the situation by watching TV).</p>

<title>The importance of individual characteristics in the deployment of coping strategies</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-2051570713487478">Smith and Carlson (1997)</xref>, the way in which teenagers cope with a stressful situation depends on their individual characteristics. With regard to our problematic, we can distinguish four main types.</p>
<list id="list2-2051570713487478" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>– A personality trait from the field of psychology: self-esteem, an important resource for coping with stressful events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2051570713487478">Thoits, 1995</xref>). Most studies emphasize that when people have high self-esteem, they implement more strategies geared towards resolving the problem (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2051570713487478">Mullis and Chapman, 2000</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– Variables from marketing research: susceptibility to peer influence in the area of consumption, brand sensitivity, and involvement in the product category. The first of these is relevant to studies of adolescents and their relations to brands (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2051570713487478">Auty and Elliott, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2051570713487478">Lachance et al., 2003</xref>). It covers two forms of interpersonal influence – normative and informational – exerted by peers on teenagers’ brand choices. Furthermore, given the nature of the stressor studied, the calling into question of a brand choice by the most influential people on a young person’s brand sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2051570713487478">Lachance et al., 2003</xref>) gives the latter variable an important role. Finally, regarding involvement, in their key book on the theory of coping, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2051570713487478">Lazarus and Folkman (1984)</xref> evoke the notion of commitment. This refers to what a person deems to be important and thus influences the way he or she copes. In the marketing literature, researchers refer to involvement in a product category. Thus, we believe that this variable affects a teenager’s reaction to peer criticism about a brand choice of a given product.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– Socio-demographic variables: gender, age, and the social class of the family. As regards the first variable, despite a lack of consensus, a number of studies reveal differences between girls and boys in coping with a stressful situations (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2051570713487478">Dumont et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2051570713487478">Liu et al., 2004</xref>). Regarding age, some studies have found differences in the manner of coping in terms of this variable (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2051570713487478">Hampel and Petermann, 2005</xref>). However, this relationship is controversial and needs to be clarified by further research. Finally, with regard to social class, it appears that peer group pressure on consumption may be more pronounced among teenagers from poorer backgrounds compared to those from more favored backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2051570713487478">Isaksen and Roper, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2051570713487478">2012</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– A perception variable on individual capacity to confront a stressful situation: perceived controllability of the situation. The way in which people cope with stressful situations may be influenced by their beliefs and their capacity to deal with a particular problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2051570713487478">Lazarus and Folkman, 1984</xref>). In order to adopt strategies focused on the problem, they must believe that their efforts will be effective. Thus the controllable character (as perceived by the individual) of a stressful situation influences the choice of strategies implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-2051570713487478">Smith and Carlson, 1997</xref>). Perceived controllability of the situation has a hybrid character in that each individual has a personal evaluation of their capacity to control a situation. In this sense, it is a personality variable. But it also varies according to the specific situation, and from this standpoint, it also presents a contextual aspect.</p></list-item>

<title>Description of the three quantitative data collections</title>
<p>To address the first objective of this article, we carried out three successive surveys on teenagers (<italic>n1</italic> = 208, <italic>n2</italic> = 200, <italic>n3</italic> = 446). The different methodological steps are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2051570713487478">Table A1</xref>. The last data collection (<italic>n3</italic> = 446) also allowed us to address the article’s second objective. For all three surveys, we chose the method of self-administration of the questionnaire.</p>
<p>The first data collection was carried out on 208 adolescents from two schools in the Paris region, mainly aged from 13 to 15 (age 13: 44.1%, age 14: 36.3%, and age 15: 16.2%), with 47.1% of them girls. The second data collection was carried out on 200 adolescents, again from two schools in the Paris region, and again mostly aged from 13 to 15 (age 13 years: 26.8%, age 14: 32.3% and age 15: 34.8%). This sample comprised 54% girls. The final sample consisted of 446 adolescents (of which 52.5% were girls), mostly aged from 13 to 15 (age 13: 26.8%, age 14: 32.3%, age 15: 34.8%) from four different schools in the Paris region.</p>

<sec id="section12-2051570713487478">
<title>The scenario method</title>
<p>For all three data collections, the questionnaire began with a hypothetical scenario that enabled the respondent to easily project themselves into the situation being studied. We were not able to use terms corresponding exactly to the vocabulary used for the adolescents for potentially similar situations. Indeed the school officials checked, among other things, that the questionnaires conformed to the rules of French literature and made sure that our approach was not for commercial purposes. After a first draft of the scenario, six experts in consumer behavior made suggestions for improvement. In the scenario, we ‘staged’ a girl called Laura for the female respondents and a boy, Thomas, for the male respondents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-2051570713487478">3</xref></sup> By matching the name to the respondent’s gender we were able to ensure better identification with the person being criticized in the scenario. We also reduced the effect of social desirability on the teenagers by asking them later in the questionnaire to ‘put themselves in the place of’ of the person criticized. The scenario was then qualitatively pre-tested on the teenagers in order to check that they clearly understood the vocabulary used. We then developed the final version, show in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2051570713487478">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>We quantitatively pre-tested the scenario on 46 teenagers to make sure that the peer criticism and its object (i.e. the brand) were clearly perceived. This pre-test was also an opportunity to evaluate the stress that the situation described in the scenario could produce in the adolescents by measuring the relevant single-item emotions that we adopted in the context of the study (taken from the negative stress emotions identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2051570713487478">Lazarus, 1993b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2051570713487478">2000</xref>): shame, sadness, anger and anxiety. Given the lack of consensus on a direct measure of stress, the researchers suggest studying the felt emotion induced by stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2051570713487478">Lazarus, 1993a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2051570713487478">1993b</xref>). The means of emotions obtained (each measured on a five-point scale) are: shame mean = 3.93; anxiety mean = 3.83; anger mean = 3.80; and sadness mean = 3.54. These levels well reflect a day-to-day hassle-type stressor, which generates moderately negative emotions.</p>

<title>The choice of brand type criticized and the product category studied</title>
<p>In this study, we focus on the case where the brand criticized by peers is new on the market and is therefore not familiar to them. The field of application was chosen on the basis of the preliminary qualitative survey, which showed that brand awareness is an important factor in the choice of adolescents. It is very difficult for them to select a new brand. Moreover, the stressful situation investigated here is linked to product categories whose brands are easily identifiable by the peers. The marketing literature reveals that jeans are products of this type. They form part of the clothing repertoire of both boy and girl teenagers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051570713487478">Badaoui et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-2051570713487478">North and Kotz, 2001</xref>) and jeans brands are viewed as easily identifiable and symbolically important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2051570713487478">Auty and Elliott, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2051570713487478">Belk et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2051570713487478">Hogg and Banister, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-2051570713487478">Souiden and M’saad, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Measurement of individual characteristics</title>
<p>In the questionnaires of the second and third data collections, questions directly linked to the stressful situation (including its perceived controllability) were first asked. Then the second part of the questionnaires covered variables that concerned the adolescent themselves – involvement in the product category studied, brand sensitivity, self-esteem and susceptibility to peer influence. Finally, a descriptive sheet was used to collect data such as the respondent’s gender and age and the perceived economic status of their family. This last variable was chosen because it is extremely difficult to assess the social class of an individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2051570713487478">Coleman, 1983</xref>). To measure an individual’s social class, income level is generally used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2051570713487478">Darpy and Volle, 2007</xref>) or even a multi-criterion approach (income, educational level, socio-professional category, etc.). However, in the qualitative pre-tests, a number of the teenagers were unable to say with any accuracy what their parents’ income level was. Further, in the first quantitative data collection, some of them were not sure they could find out what their parents’ professions or jobs were, while others saw this as a personal question and refused to answer. It therefore seemed appropriate to ask respondents about the perceived economic level of their families (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2051570713487478">Benmoyal-Bouzaglo and Moschis, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>The situational approach to coping: Teenagers’ main coping strategies</title>
<p>The aim is to identify behaviors and thoughts specific to a given stressful consumption situation. Because of the weakness of the psychometric qualities and the instability of the structures criticized as tools for evaluating existing coping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2051570713487478">Compas et al., 2001</xref>), we choose, firstly, to follow the recommendations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-2051570713487478">Schwarzer and Schwarzer (1996)</xref> for developing a scale for measuring coping strategies and, secondly, to rely on the main stages recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2051570713487478">Churchill’s (1979)</xref> paradigm.</p>

<title>Generation of items</title>
<p>From the literature, we listed the main coping strategies that seemed to us to be relevant to our problematic (for example, denial of the problem, social support, etc.). Other strategies specific to our problematic stem from the preliminary qualitative survey (justification and understanding the reasons for the criticism). The items thus obtained and the scenario were then evaluated by six experts in consumer behavior. This stage gave us 37 comments classified into 12 coping strategies: understanding, justification, intention to conform, social support, denial of the problem, humor, aggressive reactions, self-reproach, concealment of feelings, passivity, making the critics feel guilty, and breaking off relations.</p>

<title>Confirmatory factor analysis</title>
<p>The second data collection (<italic>n2</italic> = 200) allowed us to carry out confirmatory factor analysis and to assess the convergent and discriminant validity of the measure.</p>
<p>After verifying the implementation conditions of the confirmatory factor analysis (sample size of 200 respondents and multinormality of the variables), the five factors obtained at the end of the exploratory factor analysis are represented in AMOS 5 as a first order model. The model’s parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood method. The model provides a good fit with indicators meeting the threshold of acceptance: chi-square = 70.955 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.101), normalized chi-square = 1.245, GFI = 0.950, AGFI = 0.921, TLI = 0.975, CFI = 0.982, CAIC = 285.098 &lt; CAIC of the saturated model = 573.147 and RMSEA = 0.035. The contributions of the items on the factors range from 0.650 to 0. 847.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-2051570713487478">5</xref></sup> Furthermore, correlations between the constructs of the model are low (the maximum correlation between two constructs is 0.284 in absolute value). This enables us to strengthen the situational measure of teenagers’ coping strategies as a first-order measurement model. Thus the final structure of the adolescent consumers’ coping strategies consists of five dimensions: justification of the circumstances of the purchase, making the criticizers feel guilty, reaction of revenge, denial of the problem and self-reproach for mistakenly choosing that particular brand. The first three strategies are intended to directly affect the stressor and correspond to problem-focused strategies, in accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2051570713487478">Lazarus and Folkman’s (1984)</xref> dichotomy. With regard to these studies, the last two strategies may be considered as reactions whose function is manage the negative emotions induced by criticism by classmates of a brand choice. Thus, denial and self-reproach fall within emotion-centered coping strategies.</p>

<title>The inter-individual perspective: Analysis of the effect of individual characteristics on the use of coping strategies</title>
<sec id="section22-2051570713487478">
<title>Multivariate analysis of variance</title>
<p>To analyze the effect of individual characteristics on the use of coping strategies, we conduct a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), which mobilizes five quantitative dependent variables.</p>
<p>For the metric variables relating to individual characteristics (i.e. self-esteem, sensitivity to peer group informational and normative influences, brand sensitivity, involvement in the product category, and perceived controllability of the situation), we create two groups according to the median, thus forming two equivalent groups in terms of the number of adolescents for each variable in two modalities: ‘weak’ (group 1) and ‘strong’ (group 2). As an indicator of the age of the adolescents and in order to have clearly distinct groups, we use grade level, namely fifth (age 12–13), fourth (age 13–14) and third (age 14–15). As regards classification in relation to perceived economic level, we retain five modalities of the scale, because the initial coding makes it a categorical variable because it is single-item: (1) very affluent, (2) reasonably affluent, (3) moderately affluent, (4) not very affluent and (5) not at all affluent.</p>
<p>We also examine relevant interaction effects between four independent variables, which seem to us to be essential with regard to the problematic: educational level, self-esteem, brand sensitivity and involvement in the product category. Our study is concerned with teenagers in junior high school, who are characterized by lower self-esteem than high school students, especially at the stage of life we were investigating. This low level of self-esteem is correlated with their level of materialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2051570713487478">Nguyen Chaplin and Roedder John, 2007</xref>). This result partly explains the difficulty young people have in deviating from the social norm in terms of consumer choice, the subject on which the problematic of the study is based. In addition, peers are most influential on teenagers’ brand sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2051570713487478">Lachance et al., 2003</xref>); in the framework of a criticism of brand choice, the variable ‘brand sensitivity’ thus emerges as important. The impact of this criticism may also depend on the importance that the adolescent attributes to the product category associated with it, i.e. their involvement in the product category. These four retained variables have the advantage of being action levers for managers when they target adolescents: brand and product levers (linked to brand sensitivity and involvement in the product category) and targeting criteria (educational level and self-esteem).</p>
<p>The results of the multivariate analysis of variance are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-2051570713487478">Tables A3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-2051570713487478">A4</xref> (in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-2051570713487478">Appendix</xref>).</p>

<title>The effect of individual variables and interactions on coping strategies</title>
<p>From the standpoint of Pillai’s value and its significance, we observe that the multivariate tests are significant at the 1% threshold for six individual characteristics: ‘self-esteem’, ‘susceptibility to normative influence’, ‘brand sensitivity’, ‘gender’, ‘educational level’ and ‘perceived controllability of the situation’. These figures suggest that teenagers’ coping strategies vary depending on the level of these six individual variables.</p>
<p>The strategy of justification is significantly influenced by four individual variables: ‘sensitivity to informational influence’, ‘gender’, ‘educational level’ and ‘perceived economic status of the family’. The teenagers use this strategy more when they are strongly sensitive to the informational influence of peers, when they are boys, when they are in fifth grade (age 12–13) and when they are from affluent backgrounds. The individual characteristic having the most influence on this variable is ‘gender’ (partial eta squared = 0.024). The interaction ‘brand sensitivity × self-esteem’ and ‘involvement in the product category × self-esteem’ also influences this coping strategy at the 5% threshold. For the first interaction term, it is teenagers who combine strong ‘brand sensitivity’ and high ‘self-esteem’ who justify more. For the second interaction, those individuals who have strong ‘self-esteem’ and involvement most use this strategy.</p>
<p>The strategy of making the critics feel guilty is influenced by three individual variables: ‘brand sensitivity’, ‘gender’ and ‘sensitivity to informational influence’. Those who most make their peers feel guilty are characterized by low ‘brand sensitivity’ and high ‘sensitivity to the informational influence of peers’. Furthermore, girls use this strategy more than boys. ‘Gender’ is the variable that has most influence of making the critics feel guilty (partial eta squared = 0.019). Three interactions influence this variable: for the interaction ‘involvement in the product category × brand sensitivity’, those who most make their peers feel guilty are both the least involved in the product category and the least sensitive to brands. The significant effect of the interaction ‘brand sensitivity × educational level’ designates the youngest adolescents and the least sensitive to brands as using this strategy the most. The significance of the influence of the interaction ‘involvement in the product category × brand sensitivity × self-esteem’ refers to subjects who are least involved in the product category, least sensitive to brands and have high ‘self-esteem’ as being those who most make their peers feel guilty.</p>
<p>The strategy of revenge is significantly affected by ‘self-esteem’, ‘brand sensitivity’ and ‘gender’. Those who most take revenge are boys, and are characterized by high ‘self-esteem’ and high ‘brand sensitivity’. Again, gender influences this dependent variable the most (partial eta squared = 0.035). Revenge is significantly influenced by the interaction term ‘brand sensitivity × educational level’. Those adolescents who are youngest and strongly sensitive to brands use revenge significantly more.</p>
<p>Two individual variables influence the strategy of denying the problem: ‘brand sensitivity’ and ‘perceived controllability’. Those teenagers most likely to deny the problem come from the group that is least sensitive to brands and consider themselves most able to control the stressful situation. Perceived controllability of the situation is the variable with the strongest effect on this strategy (partial eta squared = 0.009).</p>
<p>The strategy of self-reproach is influenced by five independent variables: ‘self-esteem’, ‘susceptibility to the normative influence of peers’, ‘brand sensitivity’, ‘educational level’ and ‘perceived controllability of the situation’. Teenagers who reproach themselves the most have low ‘self-esteem’, strong ‘susceptibility to normative influence’, high ‘brand sensitivity’, and low ‘perceived controllability of the situation’ and are mostly in fourth grade (age 13–14). It is also ‘perceived controllability of the situation’ (partial eta squared = 0.054) that has the strongest effect on this coping strategy. Four interaction terms influence self-reproach for the problem: ‘brand sensitivity × educational level’, ‘brand sensitivity × self-esteem’, ‘educational level × self-esteem’ and ‘educational level × brand sensitivity × self-esteem’. For these four combinations of variables, it is teenagers combining a low level of self-esteem, strong brand sensitivity and/or young junior high school students who reproach themselves more for their brand choice mistake.</p>

<title>Discussion of the results</title>
<p>Our initial objective was to clarify the coping strategies used by adolescents when they are criticized by their classmates regarding a choice of brand. During the first stage of developing the scale, we considered 11 coping strategies. Following the stage of statistical refinement of the scale, we retained just five of them. Two main reasons account for this result. On the one hand, it concerns a measure of adolescents’ situational coping strategies and not a general measure. In this study, the adolescents were asked to say how they would react to a particular situation. The range of possible responses is therefore more limited than in the case where adolescents can cope in a variety of ways in response to the various stressful situations they experience. On the other hand, the samples chosen in this study are composed of junior high school students, and therefore in early adolescence. The preferred coping strategies are very indicative of this period of life. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2051570713487478">Costanzo and Shaw (1966)</xref> showed that blaming oneself for mistakes peaks in early adolescence. Revealing the strategy of self-reproach strengthens this result. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2051570713487478">Le Bigot et al. (2004)</xref> note that the two main modes of expression of 11- to 14-year-olds (which corresponds to the age group of most of the adolescents in our sample) is contestation, to which the strategies of revenge and making the critics feel guilty correspond.</p>
<p>This study has also allowed us to highlight the significant effect of individual variables on coping strategies used by teenagers. Perceived controllability has the strongest effect on denial of the problem and on self-reproach. According to the classical dichotomy of Lazarus and his colleagues, the theory assumes that when people expect to be able to control a situation, they tend to adopt forms of coping focused on the problem, whereas when they have a low expectation of control, they rely more on coping strategies centered on emotion. Yet in this study we found that two strategies, viewed as emotion-centered (denial and self-reproach) were most strongly influenced by perceived controllability of the situation. Indeed it was teenagers presenting a high level on this variable that tend more to deny the problem, while those with a low perception of controllability tend to reproach themselves for getting their choice of brand wrong. The result for denial runs counter to the theory, thus underscoring the importance of integrating the contextual approach when dealing with individual coping: a strategy chosen in a particular context may not have the same expected effects in another situation. The results for perceived controllability show the need to treat cautiously approaches that rely solely on the major dimensions of coping, because they are liable to obscure differences in terms of the effect of individual characteristics on strategies that comprise a single dimension. The findings regarding the effect of gender on the other three coping problem-centered strategies (justification, revenge and making the critics feel guilty) also confirm this approach. The first two reactions apply more to boys, while the third is used more by girls.</p>

<title>Implications of the research</title>
<p>There are still few studies on the problems experienced by adolescents in the school environment in relation to clothing brands. None of these studies has yet specifically addressed the cognitive and behavioral reactions of young people when they undergo criticism from their peers on brand choices. This research was able to reveal five coping strategies: justification, denial of the problem, making the criticizers feel guilty, revenge and self-reproach. Furthermore, justification of the circumstances of purchasing the criticized brand is a strategy that emerged from our preliminary qualitative study and has not been brought out in previous studies. We have also provided some answers as to the influence of young consumers’ individual characteristics on these coping strategies. The results obtained regarding gender, perceived controllability of the situation and brand sensitivity suggest that these variables are determinants of the coping strategies in this work.</p>
<p>Moreover, we have adopted a unique position in that we understood situational coping strategies as also resulting from individual characteristics. This dual approach to coping (both as process and as style), where people’s reactions to a given stressful situation produced by consumption problem are analyzed as effects of individual characteristics, paves the way for other promising research topics in marketing. Indeed, several stress factors linked to consumption exist for all age groups: unsatisfactory service, financial difficulties in making everyday purchases, or social pressure to buy a product/service/brand that one does not want or cannot afford … . Faced with all these consumption-related stress factors, consumers have to adjust. From this perspective, the use of the concept of coping turns out to be appropriate.</p>
<p>From a managerial point of view, it appears difficult for teenagers to choose a new brand that their peers are unaware of. It therefore seems essential for professionals to create, through advertising campaigns, brand awareness in the young population before selling it. The objective is to ensure a certain awareness in teenagers’ minds, so that ignorance of a brand is not a barrier to its success. Advertisers could thus use launch strategies that would generate buzz. From this standpoint, the role of community manager appears central. With all the possibilities offered by the internet, it becomes possible to create a new brand in line with young people’s online modes of communication. This approach could be envisaged with the circulation of demonstration videos for a new designer product on shared video platforms or social networks, or disseminating photographs of celebrities favored by adolescents wearing a new brand. We also revealed interactions that significantly influence coping strategies. Marketers can thus develop combinations of operational choices between the degree of highlighting a brand attribute (linked to the teenager’s brand sensitivity) and the choice of product category or categories to develop in the context of a brand extensions (according to the degree of involvement). Such choices may be optimized according to the age of the teenagers targeted and the degree of reassurance they need (relative to their level of self-esteem). Moreover, we have seen that it is possible to predict the main coping strategies used on the basis of people’s individual characteristics. Practitioners could thus distinguish the coping responses most deployed by the adolescents comprising their target. They could also identify the main modes of exchange between young people and use these in advertising arguments to address their target with appropriate communication codes. For example, in the case of a new brand, depending on the profile of the intended adolescent target, managers might decide to highlight a teenager who would explain to their peers the strengths of this brand (strategy of justification).</p>
<p>In a context where social problems are increasingly recurrent among children in schools, our study also makes an important contribution in terms of consumer education. It has revealed the crucial role of brands and the stress that this can occasion for adolescents if they are criticized by their peers for one of their choices. This finding should encourage educational authorities, particularly school principals, to envisage the inclusion of an informative and preventive component in young consumers’ education. Such an orientation would, moreover, have positive repercussions on parents’ choices in regard to schools that might adopt this kind of ‘educational marketing’. Furthermore, in this situation, the findings in regard to self-reproach are especially exploitable. This strategy refers to the fact of blaming oneself for the mistakes associated with the object of the criticism and in this sense one can imagine the long-term harmful effects on the young consumer in term of guilt and withdrawal at a personal level. Educational psychologists could evaluate the level of junior high school students on the strategy of self-reproach as well as the individual characteristics that influence it by administering questionnaires in class. This technique could identify those adolescents likely to be most affected by peer criticism in regard to their choice of brands and could help them protect themselves emotionally in the event of such a situation arising. Discussion on the role of consumption and problems connected to it could then be introduced by these psychologists in group sessions comprising teenagers identified as potentially ‘sensitive’.</p>
<p>Lastly, our study leads us to conclude that the wearing of a school uniform, already common in countries such as the UK, is an interesting possibility that could alleviate the stress associated with choosing brands in the school environment.</p>

<sec id="section26-2051570713487478">
<title>Limitations and future research</title>
<p>The primary objective was to reveal teenagers’ coping strategies in response to peer criticism of their brand choice. In the first stages of identifying of these strategies, we selected only the strategies presented in the most relevant previous research and those stemming from our qualitative survey. The aim was to avoid overloading the questionnaire and tiring the respondents. Moreover, other coping strategies could be investigated in future work, such as distraction. This strategy consists of engaging in recreational activities such as reading, watching TV or playing video games in order to hide the problem.</p>
<p>In addition, the measurement of social class presents a methodological problem, especially with regard to the population investigated. Here we used a single-item evaluation focusing on the economic level of the family as perceived by the respondent. This measure did not give conclusive results. However, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2051570713487478">Isaksen and Roper (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2051570713487478">2012</xref>), when an adolescent comes from a modest social environment, the consumption of brands plays an even more instrumental role. Like the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2051570713487478">Isaksen and Roper (2008)</xref>, we could have tested for differences between the schools the respondents came from. However, there was no clear difference in terms of socioeconomic background among the adolescents surveyed from the different schools. The difficulty of access to this population did not allow us to include respondents from a school located in a geographical area where the students are, in most cases, from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
<p>Moreover, a scenario that depicts criticism by close school friends of the teenager’s brand choice was drawn up. Being fictional, it does not capture the real conditions of such a situation. The personality of peers, the sensitivity level of the adolescent criticized or a strong relationship with the person making the criticism (such as one’s best friend) may also impart a special meaning to the reproach as to the teenager’s brand choice. The intrinsic characteristics of the product where the brand is challenged – quality, style, color, etc. – may also diminish the impact of the criticism. As this study focuses on internal validity, we did not take all such aspects into account. Another limitation of the scenario concerns its presentation of a single choice of an unknown brand. Of course, the question remains open as to what extent the results would have been different if the product label chosen had been known to the peers but not at all highly regarded by them (a ‘has-been’ brand). In addition, there is the important fact that there was only one product category considered in our scenario, namely jeans. Future studies could easily replicate the scenario while manipulating the product category for the brand criticized (sports shoes or cell phones, for example).</p>
<p>To deepen the results regarding the relationship between perceived controllability of the situation and the denial of the problem, the effects of other individual characteristics could be investigated in the future: the opinion leadership, the tendency to innovate and the need for uniqueness.</p>
<p>The two quantitative studies were implemented only on <italic>collège</italic> (junior high school) students. The findings therefore should therefore be generalized with caution. It is possible that <italic>lycée</italic> (high school) students would have reacted differently, as social anxiety and group conformity are less pronounced in later adolescence. Further studies should be carried to ascertain whether there are in fact differences between these two populations in terms of coping strategies. A final point: our respondents live in the Paris region; it is therefore conceivable that their relation to brands and, consequently reactions to the brand-related peer criticism, has distinctive features. It would be interesting, therefore, to replicate our study on teenagers from a rural environment or from other large cities.</p>
