<p><bold>Reviewed by:</bold> Jan Nordoff, <italic>Glyndwr University, Wales</italic></p>
<p>Sadly, the task of protecting children from harm is never far from political and public view. It is after all, an emotive topic, and one that raises strong feelings, especially when things go wrong. Often accompanied by very public inquiries that seek to understand what happened and why, the tragic death of Maria Colwell in 1973 was one such case. Now nearly 40 years later, this case remains seminal in relation to child protection work and is often cited in relevant books and articles. In <italic>Social Work on Trial</italic>, Butler and Drakeford provide an insightful and reflective account of the Maria Colwell case. A chronology of events takes the reader through the weeks and days before her death in January 1973, including a précis of what followed afterwards and the public inquiry that followed. Finally the authors examine the implications with all the complexities and difficulties of social work practice and the ‘lessons learnt’.</p>
<p>What makes this book stand out from other social work or child protection books, is the detail with which the authors paint a picture of Maria’s life, drawing upon actual accounts of people who knew her or who were involved in the case. Public records and documents of the trial and the ensuing inquiry into the tragedy are used to examine the events surrounding the case. Because of the detail contained in the book, it can seem a little ‘voyeuristic’ in places, yet it is exactly this attention to detail which makes this book so compelling. Particularly poignant were the accounts from people who had known Maria and her family, or who had seen her out and about in the neighbourhood just days before her death. The strength of the book is that the focus of attention remains with Maria and what happened to her. The authors make no apology for this, noting at the beginning that ‘the book is one way in which, we hope, the memory of Maria Colwell will be preserved’ (p. viii). That said, this is not a sentimental book, rather it exposes the very real and human face of child protection work with all its complexities and difficulties child protection and social work practice in the 1970s.</p>
<p>The book is divided into seven chapters making it easy for the reader to access particular areas of interest. In chapters one and two, the authors explore the chronology of events leading up to Maria’s death, and the immediate aftermath of what happened. In chapter three and four the authors move on to examine the broader political framework of social work bringing in key government reports of the time and the public inquiry which followed. By examining the political and policy context to social work the authors are able to locate the Colwell case within the context of the time. Although the content of this chapter will be familiar to many people in social work, nonetheless by including this information quite early on, the authors provide the reader with a ‘backdrop’ to social work, highlighting the driving forces, but also the frustrations and confusions that surrounded the protection of children at the time. Chapter five entitled ‘Social Work on Trial’ continues to expand this theme, before moving on to discuss social work and the Colwell case in more depth. Chapter six, notably called ‘Afterwards’ does just that. Its focus is the ‘immediate and medium term consequences of the Maria Colwell inquiry’ (p. 161), including the implications of the inquiry in Whitehall. The final chapter, chapter seven, brings together a synopsis of the ‘contemporary debates about social work “problem families” and how the state orders the relationship between the two’, p. 193), unpicking the lasting legacies of the Colwell case on child protection law, policy and practice.</p>
<p>Butler and Drakeford have successfully mastered the difficult task of bringing to life the human and very real face of child protection work with all its complexities and challenges. At the heart of the book is Maria herself, and those who were involved before, during and after her death. Information is presented sensitively and each chapters is informative and interesting, keeping the reader engaged throughout. Not perhaps a book for everyone, but certainly a ‘must read’ for people who wish to learn more about the Colwell case and its significance to social work and child protection.</p>
