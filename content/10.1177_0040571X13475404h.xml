<sec id="sec1-0040571X13475404h"><title>James W. Thompson, <bold><italic>Moral Formation according to Paul: The Context and Coherence of Pauline Ethics</italic></bold>, Baker Academic: Grand Rapids, 2011; 272 pp.: 9780801039027, £15.99/$25.00 (pbk); 9781441234483, £15.99/$25.00 (e-book)</title>
<p>James Thompson explores the origin, logic and meaning of Paul’s moral instruction. He unpacks the Jewish and Greco-Roman traditions appropriated by Paul concluding that it is primarily the Jewish tradition that forms the bulk of Paul’s moral vision in his undisputed <italic>and</italic> disputed letters. Additionally, Thompson argues that (1) Paul integrates faith and ethics forming a coherent moral vision; (2) <italic>agapē</italic> is unique to Paul; and (3) Paul rejects homosexual relationships.</p>
<p>In Chapter 1 Thompson deals with ethics in Hellenistic Judaism. He concludes that it intersects with the Greek ethical traditions <italic>but</italic> that all commandments are derived from the Torah. In Chapter 2 the focus is on the Corinthian correspondence where he concludes that Paul’s moral instruction is permeated by the vocabulary of ancient Israel, with boundaries between the in-group and the outsiders, and a call to live as members of a family. Chapter 3 focuses on ethos and ethics in 1 Thessalonians where Thompson uncovers the basic template for Paul’s moral instruction in the areas of sexual morality and love for one another, and unpacks Paul’s famous triad of faith, hope and love.</p>
<p>Thompson addresses Pauline catechesis and lists of vices and virtues in Chapter 4. His analysis of the ever controversial <italic>malakoi</italic> and <italic>arsenokoitai</italic> is both interesting and illuminating. He provides convincing evidence that Paul knew about homosexual relationships and that he rejected them. In Chapter 5 Thompson argues that Scripture plays a decisive role in forming the moral insights of new converts. In Chapter 6 he argues that Paul has a distinctive anthropological pessimism, exemplified by his claim that <italic>no one is righteous</italic>, which is without parallel in antiquity.</p>
<p>Probably the most significant contribution to Pauline ethics is found in Chapter 7 where Thompson discusses Paul’s focus on putting love into practice. He defines love (<italic>agapē</italic>) as the central and unique category in Paul’s moral instruction.</p>
<p>In Chapter 8 Thompson deals with ethics in the disputed letters of Paul. The household codes represent the apodictic style that recalls the legal tradition of the Old Testament, as well as the direct address and imperatival discourse of the Wisdom literature. The household code ‘is scarcely a radical departure’ (p. 194) from the undisputed Pauline letters. Discussing the Pastoral Epistles, Thompson acknowledges that their portrayal of the life in godliness has parallels with the Roman understanding of <italic>pietas</italic>, but they also reflect Jewish moral instruction that is based on the Torah.</p>
<p>A minor surprise for this reviewer is the complete absence of 1 Cor. 15.32–34, 58 (cf. Isa. 22.13), which would have strengthened Thompson’s main aims. As for the discussion on the household code in Colossians and Ephesians, Thompson has rolled several stones out of the way that it seems almost possible for him to join other able scholars like Simon Gathercole and N. T. Wright to argue for its Pauline authorship.</p>
<p>Thompson demonstrates convincingly that Paul’s moral thought owes its significance primarily to the Jewish tradition. Anyone concerned with Pauline ethics should have this thoroughly researched book on their shelves.</p>
