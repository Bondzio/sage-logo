<abstract>
<p>Immigration to Europe from Asia and Africa started soon after Second World War. The Muslims were the largest group among them. Those who arrived were looking for work and most were unskilled workers who were absorbed by the economy seriously short of manpower. The cultural and ethnic differences between the immigrants and mainstream society resulted in the anti-immigration forces expressing concern over such immigration. Till about the late 1970s, such concerns were expressed in racial/ethnic terms, but thereafter the emphasis shifted on the Muslims who were perceived to be asserting their communal identity as a separate group. In the 1980s and thenceforth more Muslims headed towards Europe seeking refuge on political and humanitarian grounds. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks and similar attacks in some European countries by Muslim extremists, the Muslim presence in Europe has been seen as subversive by some while others have described it as overreaction condemning a whole community for the crimes of a few. Security, human rights and minority rights arguments have been advanced for and against the Muslim presence. This study analyses such concerns in terms of notions of ‘ethnic affinity’ as a social construct.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Samuel P. Huntington’s <italic>The Clash of Civilizations</italic>: <italic>Remaking of World Order</italic> (1996) dramatised the alleged incompatibility between ‘Western’ and ‘Islamic’ civilisations. The argument was rather simple, but sensational: with the demise of the bipolar East–West ideological–political–economic–military confrontation, the world was no longer in the grip of a total struggle of mutually exclusive ideologies. The great vacuum which has been created will be filled by a more deep-rooted clash of historical cultures or civilisations. He identified the Islamic civilisation in particular as an aggressive and expansionist global force with a pronounced zeal and proclivity towards violence and warfare. In this regard, the growing Muslim presence in Europe as a result of immigration from Asia and Africa poses an issue that has been the subject of considerable discussion and debate.</p>
<p>Muslim–Christian encounters in the past have included conflict and warfare. Nevertheless Muslim incursions into Europe too have a long history with southern Spain and Italy coming under Muslim rule in the eighth century. In the late fifteenth century, Muslims were expelled by force from Spain where Isabella and Ferdinand, fired by religious nationalism, wanted to cleanse Western Europe of the Islamic menace. On the other hand, the Ottoman Turks expanded deep into Eastern Europe and even knocked at the gates of Vienna in 1683.</p>
<p>According to a report of the Pew Research Center, <italic>Mapping the Global Muslim Population</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0974928413489468">2009</xref>), the total number of Muslims in Europe (including Russia) in 2007 was about 38 million, excluding Turkey, and constituted 5.2 per cent of its total population. The Muslim population in Eastern Europe dates from the time of the Ottoman Empire. Albania, Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina and some Russian regions in Northern Caucasus and the Volga region have Muslim majorities or a sizeable Muslim minority. Another report suggests that the total population of Europe is to increase to 8 per cent by 2030. However, Muslim fertility rate in Europe would drop from 2.2 to 2.0 in 2030, while the non-Muslim fertility rate would increase from 1.5 to 1.6 per cent in 2030 (<italic>Europe’s Muslim Population Expected to Rise by a Third</italic>
<italic>by 2030</italic>, 2011). In 2007, there were an estimated 16 million Muslims in the European Union that made up 3.2 per cent of its total population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0974928413489468">Cole 2011</xref>, 367). The largest group is that of Turks (which includes ethnic Kurds), while Algerians, Bangladeshis, Moroccans, Pakistanis and Somalians are the other major national groups. In Northern Europe, Iranians, Bosnians and Lebanese are also significant groups; immigration from war-torn Somalia has also been noticed.</p>
<p>In this article the focus is on the post–Second World War Muslim immigration to north-western Europe. The Maastricht Treaty of 1993 replaced the European Common Market or European Community with the European Union (EU), which greatly facilitated nationals of member-states to seek employment and settle down in any part of the EU freely. It also opened the doors to former Communist states of Eastern Europe extending to the Baltic region. However, Muslim immigrants have headed mainly to the richer north-western European countries (including the Scandinavian countries), where economic prospects and standards of living are much higher. The historical Muslim communities of Eastern Europe are, therefore, not included in this investigation.</p>
<p>The concerns regarding Muslim immigration range from routine matters pertaining to management of immigration in the background of shrinking job opportunities in an economy that seems to have stagnated to panic, known as Islamophobia, over a perceived demographic time bomb, a grand Trojan Horse conspiracy, that the Muslims pose to Western ideals and cultural values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0974928413489468">Caldwell 2009</xref>). A 2006 document on this subject published by the European Union details such a problem as well as that of unemployment, poor housing and feelings of discrimination among Muslims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0974928413489468"><italic>Muslims in the European Union</italic>, 2006</xref>). It is to be noted that non-Muslims from Asia and Africa and even Latin America have been migrating and settling in Europe in large numbers. It is seldom that one hears of any major problem with other immigrants, while the Muslim immigrant communities have figured both in the media and in government discussions.</p>
<p>Besides the demographic implications of a growing Muslim presence in Europe, areas where tensions exist and where Islamic law and Western law are in harmony have been examined in a number of studies. In this regard, Jorgen S. Nielsen and Lisbet Christoffersen’s edited work, <italic>Sharia as Discourse: Legal Traditions and the Encounter with Europe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0974928413489468">Nielsen and Christoffersen 2010</xref>), is a useful contribution. Scholars have also pointed out that processes of socialisation are at work and the younger generation of Muslims adopt mainstream values and habits while adhering to family traditions and mores as well. Such situations create tension and conflict between their elders and them, but such experiences are normal. Notions of ‘Euro-Islam’, a process indicative of the Muslims establishing home, mosques and other cultural centres while interacting routinely with mainstream society, have also been examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0974928413489468">AlSayyad and Castells 2002</xref>). It is to be noted that Muslims have been elected to several legislatures in Europe and gradually educated Muslims who speak the native languages have been taking part in media debates.</p>
<p>However, literature speaking of an Islamic threat to Europe, emphasising the incompatibility of Islam and Western values, also exists. Some ex-Muslim groups also exist in Europe that actively oppose sharia being given recognition as a source of law and warn against uncontrolled immigration. Fears that Europe is becoming a springboard of Islamist terrorism carried by individuals born and raised in Europe have also been expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0974928413489468">Vidino and Emerson 2006</xref>). This is an interesting aspect of the post-war immigration. Millions of second and even third generation immigrants are now present in Europe. Rates of juvenile delinquency have reportedly been higher among them just as the rates of unemployment among them tend to be higher than among mainstream young people. The immigrants tend to be concentrated in poorer, rundown areas and there the formation of gangs of young men involved in criminal activities, including drug trafficking, has been reported. In this regard, the role of religious institutions in offering a more chaste and moral alternative has meant some young individuals being attracted to them. However, some such entities have also served as recruiting units for the jihadist organisations. On the other hand, the European governments have started regulating Islamic organisations instead of the earlier policy of neglecting them. The new strategy seeks to give recognition to the Islamic councils in exchange for recognition of the legitimacy of the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0974928413489468">Leiken 2011</xref>). To what extent such strategy would help integrate Muslims with the mainstream and resolve the tension between secular law and Islamic law remains to be seen.</p>

<title>Tightening of Immigration Policy</title>
<p>In 1962, the UK introduced legislation which required Indians, Pakistanis and other non-whites to find an employer and then apply for immigration. Later, tighter regulations began to be introduced. Elsewhere too tighter controls were introduced by individual countries as well as in the general framework of the European Union. However, from the late 1970s large numbers of people from Iran, the Middle East and Africa began to arrive as political and humanitarian refugees. Given the generous laws that applied to such victims, a constant increase in the Muslim presence in Europe took place. Voices were raised that many who claimed to be victims of political persecution were, in fact, economic migrants. There were also complaints that smuggling people from Asia and Africa was being carried out by gangs who made a lot of money from such trafficking. The general direction in which EU policy is moving is towards greater controls on illicit human smuggling while liberalising immigration for professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0974928413489468"><italic>European Pact on Immigration and Asylum</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In this regard it is important to note that Turkey’s application for membership of the European Union has consistently been postponed while many of the former Communist states of Eastern Europe, which applied later, have been granted membership. Therefore, the demographic factor plays an important role in European perceptions of the place of Muslims in Europe.</p>

<title>International Migration, Security and Ethnic Affiliation</title>
<p>Myron Weiner argues that the paramount concern for states about immigration is security, and ‘ethnic affinity’ is the plausible explanation for the willingness of states to accept or reject immigration. He writes: ‘A government and its citizens are likely to be receptive to those who share the same language, religion or race, while it might regard as threatening those with whom such an identity is not shared’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0974928413489468">Weiner 1993</xref>, 10). More importantly, he notes that ethnic affinity is a social construct and not given objective reality, necessarily. He asserts: ‘Nineteenth-century American Protestants did not regard Jews and Catholics “as one of us” and many contemporary Europeans do not regard Muslims as “one of us”’ (ibid.). At the bottom of such perceptions is the notion of security. Security too, however, is a social construct, which conveys different meanings to different societies and states. One can add that it is in the context of overall absorptive capacity, economic situation, volumes of inflow and the concerns about ethnic affinity, receiving states accept or reject immigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0974928413489468">Ahmed 1997</xref>, 165).</p>

<sec id="section4-0974928413489468">
<title>Post–Second World War Non-white Immigration</title>
<p>Until the end of Second World War Europe practised, with regard to non-whites, a policy of tight immigration controls. Only some students, princes, rich upper class individuals and some political fugitives from Asia and Africa could be found in Europe. The prevalent nation-state model, originating in the Treaty of Westphalia, 1648, applied as the general framework for the territorial nation-states, notwithstanding the fact that it was violated several times as a result of wars. Such nation-states were founded on state churches whereby the rulers could patronise a national church. Citizens were expected to belong to the state church. The state was formally obliged to permit religious freedom privately to minority Christians as well as non-Christians. On the whole, the minorities were marginalised, especially Jews and Roma (previously known as Gypsies). However, the Holocaust and overall maltreatment of non-Christians shocked European sensibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0974928413489468">Ahmed 2005</xref>, 13–14).</p>
<p>The founding of the United Nations (1945) and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) generated a vision and norms that proved positively transformative with regard to attitudes towards race and religion. The debate which ensued privileged individual rights of citizens as their inalienable entitlements but arguments in favour of ethnic and religious minorities, indigenous peoples, stigmatised or disadvantaged ethnic groups (used here to include religious, cultural, sectarian and other such groups), and women, enjoying equal rights with members of the majority population, were also advanced. Alongside this process, the idea of cultural heterogeneity within the bounds of law and public order gained acceptance among the educated classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0974928413489468">Ahmed 2005</xref>, 14–18; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0974928413489468">Packer and Myntti 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Keynesian principles were adopted in many parts of Europe, which meant that the welfare state models were adopted to establish peace and prosperity; the Marshall Plan (1949) had already ushered in state-managed rebuilding of Western Europe. For it to happen manpower was badly needed but it could not be obtained from Europe. It had to be found elsewhere: the vast pool of poor Asians and Africans looking for work began to arrive in small numbers and over time chain immigration inflows began to take place. Consequently, a liberalisation of naturalisation procedures took place. As a result, post–Second World War South-to-North migration began to take place. Religious freedom was now guaranteed in all Western democracies. In general, Western governments responded sympathetically to immigrant communities seeking to establish places of worship and cultural organisations for themselves. However, such inclusive policy of immigration and citizenship was premised on the assumption that in the event of conflict or dispute, fundamental national law, based on secular principles, will apply to both civil and criminal matters no matter what the religious affiliation of the parties (Ahmed: 1–5).</p>
<p>It was in these circumstances that immigration from Asia and Africa picked pace. Such migration was not organised and most people came on their own and were absorbed in the industrial sector. The UK and France, the two former colonial powers, received the earliest immigrants. The UK began to receive Muslims mainly from Pakistan; while Hindus and Sikhs came from India. Immigrants of African descent came mainly from the Caribbean. France received Muslim immigrants mainly from Algeria followed by Morocco. From sub-Saharan Africa came religiously mixed populations. Most of the early immigrants were unskilled workers. Gradually, other parts of Europe also began to receive immigrants from Asia and Africa. The Muslims were the large component of the post-war immigration. It was essentially family and friends who helped new arrivals find work and a place to live in.</p>

<sec id="section5-0974928413489468">
<title>Strategies of Immigration Management</title>
<p>One can identify a number of strategies or models that applied to immigration. The British model came to be known as the integration model. It meant that the immigrants were not expected to adopt British culture and assimilate themselves in the larger society. They could integrate into the economy and within the confines of the law and informal rules and norms prevalent in the society, continue to follow their traditions and customs. The French from the outset favoured and expected assimilation. As an explicitly secular state (since 1905), there was a strict separation of state and church. The immigrants were expected to adapt to the French way of life though not Roman Catholicism as their religion. On the other hand, Germany followed an exclusionist approach. It recruited workers from Turkey who were expected to return home after their work expired. Sweden too recruited workers from Southern Europe and Turkey but government policy aimed at encouraging them to settle down permanently. Therefore, progressive policy was adopted on building homes equipped with modern facilities and providing language courses that were paid for by the authorities.</p>
<p>Liberalisation of citizenship from the 1970s onwards in Western Europe enabled immigrants to adopt the nationality of the countries where they settled. Germany was the exception which restricted citizenship only to ethnic Germans. However, later Germany too relaxed such rules and non-Germans could adopt German citizenship. It is important to note that while Germany followed the exclusionist strategy with regard to citizenship; it simultaneously adopted a generous policy towards refugees, first to those coming from the Communist countries and then Asia and Africa. As a result hundreds of thousands of humanitarian and political refugees settled in Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0974928413489468">Constant and Tien 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>On the whole, the variation in strategies has not meant a marked difference in the relationship between mainstream society and the Muslim immigrants. The quiet, imperceptible socialisation notwithstanding, tensions were noticed that required discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0974928413489468">Gerholm and Lithman 1988</xref>).</p>

<title>Concerns over Non-white Immigration</title>
<p>While liberal values informed the attitudes of the European democracies, alarm over non-whites becoming a permanent feature of the social and political order began to be expressed as early as the 1960s. Thus, for example, a Conservative member of the British Parliament and Minister of Health (1960–1963), Enoch Powell, made the infamous ‘Rivers of Blood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0974928413489468">Powell 2007</xref>) speech against immigration, delivered in Birmingham on 20 April 1968 (reprinted in <italic>The Telegraph</italic>, 7 November 2007). In it he warned that the British people were worried about being swamped by non-whites who would multiply by leaps and bounds and become a source of disturbance and instability. He warned such developments would culminate in rivers of blood as a result of race wars and proposed repatriation of such people. Prime Minister Edward Heath sacked him from his position as Shadow Secretary of State, but it was reported that a poll showed that 74 per cent of the UK population agreed with him. The British National Front, the French National Front and the German Neo-Nazis were the earliest parties that took a stand against non-white immigrants. Various groups in Holland, Belgium, Germany and Scandinavia too began to air similar views. Over time emphasis changed from racial terminology to explicitly religious jargon about the Islamic threat to Europe.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0974928413489468">
<title>The Demand for Islamic Law</title>
<p>Since the late 1960s, some Muslim organisations in Western Europe had been demanding the right to apply dogmatic Islamic law, the sharia, to the ‘internal affairs’ of Muslims. Justification for such exceptionalism derived from the notion of autonomy, which democratic states were expected to grant and honour to religious and cultural communities. In 1975, for example, Sheikh Syed Darsh, the head cleric of the Regent’s Park Mosque in London, said:
<disp-quote>
<p>[Muslims] firmly believe that the British society, with its rich experience of different cultures and ways of life, especially the Islamic way of life which they used to see in India, Malaysia, Nigeria and so many other nations of Islamic orientation, together with their respect for personal and communal freedom, will enable the Muslim migrants to realize their entity within the freedom of British society. When we request the host society to recognize our point of view we are appealing to a tradition of justice and equity well established in this country. The scope of [Islamic] family law is not wide and does not contradict, in essence, the law here in this country. Both aim at the fulfillment of justice and happiness of the members of the family. Still, there are certain Islamic points which, with understanding and the spirit of accommodation, would not go so far as to create difficulties in the judiciary system. (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0974928413489468">Nielsen 1993</xref>, 1–2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sheikh Darsh’s argument in favour of communal autonomy had a distinctive theological sanction in the Qur’an: the traditional <italic>dhimmi</italic> system. Islamic jurisprudence defines the <italic>dhimmi</italic> as non-Muslims recognised by the Qur’an as ‘People of the Book’ (that is, Jews, Christians and a now nearly extinct group called the Sabaeans; Shia Islamic law recognises even Zoroastrians as People of the Book). The <italic>dhimmi</italic> system recognised non-Muslims as legitimate residents in Islamic societies if they paid the protection tax, <italic>jizya</italic>, for which they were exempted from military service. They were allowed to practise their religion and maintain business and commerce and own property. However, they were not included among the political community that comprised of Muslims exclusively, although they could make a representation to the state about their specific religious and other interests. Political power remained in the hands of Muslims.</p>
<p>Under the circumstance, contrary to Sheikh Darsh’s assertions, any autonomy based on ‘Islamic points’ of family law seemed destined to cause serious legal, philosophical–theoretical and political problems with prevailing Western notions of justice and equality. Among these were matters of marriage, divorce and inheritance. Sharia allowed a Muslim male, for example, to be married simultaneously to up to four wives, while it does not allow any Muslim, male or female, to marry a polytheist or an atheist; and a Muslim man may marry a Jewish or Christian woman, but a Muslim woman cannot marry a non-Muslim man. Moreover, under Islamic law inheritance favoured male descendants; the rule is that female children inherit one-half of the shares of male children. Children born out of wedlock are disinherited. Children of a deceased son are excluded from inheriting property from their grandfather; it is distributed instead among the deceased’s siblings. Further examples could be given (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0974928413489468">Doi 1984</xref>, 289–291).</p>
<p>Thus, it is quite clear that sharia laws pertaining to family matters differ radically from Western family-law systems. Moreover, serious procedural questions could arise with regard to the practical application of sharia. Who would be competent to interpret and enforce it in respect of family law? Could non-Muslim judges do so, or should the state set up separate courts with Muslim judges to try disputed cases? Even more intractable would be problems stemming from mixed marriages. Additionally, there is a distinct possibility that some Muslims may prefer to seek redress from the mainstream legal system, or worse still that the conflicting parties may appeal to the two different legal systems. Who should decide then which court is appropriate for a Muslim? The complications are legion, for sharia provisions are underpinned by values which identify divine revelation and community as superior to reason and the individual, and this view conflicts directly with the Western trend over the last two centuries towards growing secularism and individual rights in the legal–social order. Nor, incidentally, is sharia applied universally to family and inheritance matters in the Muslim world: in Turkey, for instance, and the former Soviet republics of Central Asia, it is completely absent from the legal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0974928413489468">Ahmed 2005</xref>, 4).</p>
<p>In any event, the European states and EU have resisted calls for communal autonomy that would confer legal status on sharia but it has been reported that informally Muslims do seek help from Islamic organisations and Islamic experts are involved in arbitration. The opinion of such experts is also sought in some courts. Moreover, governments maintain links with Muslim organisations.</p>

<title>The Rushdie Affair, Muslim Parliament and Growing Tension</title>
<p>In 1979, the Iranian Shia clergy led by Ayatollah Khomeini came to power after months of mass agitations against the pro-Western Shah regime. A UK-based Pakistani journalist Kalim Siddiqui and many other Sunnis were profoundly impressed by it. Khomeini projected his regime as Islamic and not sectarian (though the constitution it adopted unequivocally stated that Shia Jafari jurisprudence would be the law of the land of Iran). Thus, radical Shia clerics played the pioneering role in influencing Muslims to turn to political Islam; later, Saudi Arabia entered the arena hoping to contain Iranian influence and claim instead leadership of the Muslims worldwide. In 1989, Khomeini issued a fatwa condemning to death the writer Salman Rushdie for his book, <italic>The Satanic Verses</italic> (1988), alleging that it grievously insulted Islam and such a crime could not be condoned.</p>
<p>The Iranians offered fat prize money for his head, and Muslims in the UK began to agitate and demonstrate. Suddenly the Muslim presence in a secularised, Christian society where freedom of expression and opinion was firmly entrenched drew attention not only of the authorities who were keen to maintain law and order but also the general public. The public debate which started polarised around those on the left who thought Rushdie had played into the hands of the West by writing a book scurrilous of the Prophet of Islam, while mainstream politicians and media denounced the fatwa and the death sentence as illegitimate and unlawful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0974928413489468">Pipes 1990</xref>). Kalim Siddiqui came out forcefully in support of the fatwa. For a long time, the threat of an assassination attempt on Rushie remained in the news and by and large public opinion began to be concerned with the clash of values between them and Muslims. Rushdie went underground and the conservative Thatcher government provided him full protection.</p>
<p>In 1989, Kalim Siddiqui floated the notion of a Muslim parliament of Great Britain. In 1990, <italic>Muslim Manifesto: A Strategy for Survival</italic> was launched authored primarily by Siddiqui. It was alleged:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is a matter of deep regret that the Government, all political parties and the mass media in Britain are now engaged in a relentless campaign to reduce Muslim citizens of this country to the status of a disparaged and oppressed minority. We have no alternative but to resist this invidious campaign. To do so Muslims in Britain must define their collective goals and move towards a consensus on major issues. The established network of 1,000 mosques and a wide range of organisations already serving the community must develop greater cohesion and dynamism. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0974928413489468">Siddiqui 1990</xref>, 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Manifesto was based on five assumptions:
<list id="list1-0974928413489468" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>that Muslims in Britain have to accept neither subservience as their inevitable and permanent condition nor the disintegration of their identity, culture and religion;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>that, despite being a minority, Muslims here can define and pursue goals compatible with the goals of the global Ummah, the world community of Muslims, of which they are an integral part;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>that Muslims in Britain need to create institutions and mobilise resources in pursuit of these goals;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>that for Muslims this is also the only way to secure an honourable place in the wider British society;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>that the option of ‘integration’ and/or ‘assimilation’ that is on offer as official policy in Britain must be firmly resisted and rejected. (ibid., 2)</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>However, six points defining relations with British authorities were also enunciated:
<list id="list2-0974928413489468" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Islam allowed Muslims to accept protection of life, property and liberty from non-Muslim rulers and their political systems. Muslims placed in this situation may also pay taxes and other dues to a non-Muslim state.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Muslims living under the protection of a non-Muslim state must obey the laws of that state, as long as such obedience does not conflict with their commitment to Islam and the <italic>Ummah</italic>. Other minorities in Britain, notably Jews and Roman Catholics, do the same.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There were laws on the British Statute Book that are in direct conflict with the laws of Allah; these relate to such matters as usury, abortion, homosexuality, gambling, sale and consumption of alcohol, and the abolition of capital punishment.</p></list-item>

<p>The Muslim parliament never took off as a representative body of British Muslims. Very few Muslims showed interest in it. Siddiqui died in 1996. His successor Ghiasuddin Siddiqui (no relative) tried to keep his legacy alive; it remains a marginal opinion in British politics. On the whole, such developments were indicative of cultural tensions and serious disagreement on values that were coming to the surface.</p>
<p>However, the cultural tensions in the UK and elsewhere remained dormant. Economic migrants as well as political and humanitarian migrants and refugees were able to enter Western Europe despite national and EU controls. On the whole, in the UK and the rest of Europe the Muslim communities were able to get permission and municipal support (where allowed by law) to set up cultural and religious centres, including building of mosques. Generally, the right to Muslim food for children where lunch was provided by the state was also agreed. Many countries allowed even ritual slaughter of animals so that Muslims could eat meat they considered clean. On the whole, Muslim girls were discouraged from taking part in gymnastic and swimming. In Germany, neo-Nazis assaulted the Turkish minority on a number of occasions and loss of life and property has taken place. In France, the Netherlands, Norway and Denmark, anti-foreigner and anti-Muslim parties became more vocal and visible.</p>
<p>In the background, of course, the Arab–Israeli wars and occupation of Palestinian territory by Israel generated considerable tension and most Western European states tread the path carefully, supporting peace and the two-state solution to the problem. On the whole, the pro-Israel stance of Western European states remained steadfast. However, from early 1980s, the Iranian–Saudi competition to influence Muslims and their funding of some organisations widened the radical Islam constituency. After the Afghan jihad found American and British backing, radical Islam gained increasingly militant overtones. It was the beginning of volunteers from Western Europe joining the jihad and thus nexuses and networks came into being that came to haunt the West, including Western Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0974928413489468">Ahmed 2013</xref>).</p>

<title>Multiculturalism</title>
<p>It was in such circumstances that notions of differentiated citizenship and multiculturalism surfaced in the 1990s. The Canadian, Will Kymlicka (1995), proceeding from a communitarian perspective, emphasised the vital role of immigrant groups and communal autonomy in helping individuals feel secure and free to function as citizens. However, if group-based autonomy was illiberal and oppressive of members it had to be curtailed. John Rex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0974928413489468">1996</xref>) laid stress on the distinction between the public domain based on a single culture of equality covering law, politics and economy and other civic matters and a private domain in which moral education, primary socialisation and the teaching of religious beliefs should freely be pursued by individuals and communities. He hoped that different perceptions of the public and private domains among mainstream society and immigrants could be resolved through better communications. Thus, neither Kymlicka nor Rex favoured multiculturalism that created differentiated citizenship that isolated them from the mainstream and adversely affected their status as citizens or denizens.</p>

<title>The 9/11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks</title>
<p>It is a cliché to say that the terrorist attacks carried out by al-Qaeda in the US on 11 September 2001 transformed the world. In Europe, as elsewhere, it greatly increased anxiety in the host societies, while Muslim immigrants felt insecure and vulnerable. For quite some time, Islamists of all varieties had been trying to establish their influence through religious organisations and also through mosques that they could control. Al-Qaeda had its cells in Western Europe and some of the culprits involved in the 9/11 attacks had been in Western Europe before congregating in the US to carry out their attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0974928413489468">Vidino and Emerson 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>After the US launched massive aerial bombing of Afghanistan on 7 October 2001 and NATO and other forces joined the war in combat or peace-maintenance activities, the ‘clash of civilizations’ thesis assumed global relevance. Such a situation was greatly exacerbated when George W. Bush decided to oust Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq without securing proper authorisation from the UN Security Council. No conclusive evidence had been found that the Iraqis possessed chemical and other types of weapons of mass destruction and Bush and Tony Blair of the UK defied international public opinion, including that in their countries to launch an all-out-war that greatly aggravated the suffering of the Iraqi people who for years had been groaning under crushing sanctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0974928413489468">Curtis 2010</xref>, 231–236; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0974928413489468">Pijl 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Violence and Terrorism</title>
<p>On the one hand, Muslim extremists in many parts of Europe threatened to strike back and angry demonstrations and protest actions were taken in the UK. On the other hand, voices against the growing Muslim presence and demonstration of power resulted in a number of incidents. Pim Fortuyn, a Dutch politician, university professor and a homosexual spoke out against multiculturalism and Islam. He was murdered by Volkert Van Der Graaf who accused him of scapegoating Muslims, whom he regarded as weak members of society. More significantly, the film-maker Theo Van Gogh was murdered on 2 Number 2004 by Mohammed Bouyeri, a Dutch Muslim of Moroccan descent. Theo Van Gough had worked with Ayaan Hirsi Ali, an ex-Muslim Somali-born writer, to produce a film which criticised the treatment of women in Islam. That did not deter right-wing politician and member of the Dutch parliament, Geert Wilders, from producing the film <italic>Fitna</italic> (2008), which is unabashedly critical of Islam. In his public pronouncements, Wilders rejected that Islam was part of the Judeo-Christian tradition, describing it as alien to Western culture and civilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0974928413489468">Brown 2012</xref>). He was accused of inciting hatred and discrimination by the Amsterdam Court of Appeal on 23 June 2011.</p>
<p>However, the first country to experience al-Qaeda inspired terrorism was Spain. On 14 March 2004, a series of explosions took place on morning commuters in Madrid; 191 people were killed and 1,800 injured. The perpetrators acknowledged that they were inspired by al-Qaeda. The next country to go through such trauma was the UK. On 7 July 2005 four suicide bombers, three of them born in the UK, carried out strikes in three London underground trains and a double-decker bus in central London. Fifty-six people were killed and nearly 700 injured. Their links to militant organisations in Pakistan were discovered indicating the international nature of such terrorism. Two weeks later, four other bombing attempts took place but the detonators failed to ignite and no casualties took place. In August 2006, British police foiled a terrorist plot to explode at least 10 trans-Atlantic commercial flights. On 29 June 2007, British police thwarted a planned terrorist bombing, when two cars were discovered and the explosives disabled. Next day, in Glasgow two men drove a car loaded with explosives into the terminal of Glasgow Airport with a view to setting the airport on fire. They were apprehended in time. One of the perpetrators was killed by the burns from the fire. In September 2010, British authorities announced that they had uncovered and prevented another al-Qaeda threat to the UK, France and Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0974928413489468">Carsten 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Although Sweden has since more than 200 years been keeping out of direct participation in armed conflicts, it has taken part in UN-approved conflicts in non-combative role. On 11 December 2010, a young Arab, Taimour Abdulwahab al-Abdaly, 29, married and with three children, blew himself up accidently before he could get to his target: Christmas shoppers in the most crowded parts of central Stockholm. As a result, instead of hundreds of innocent people being killed, the culprit only managed to extinguish his own life. Minutes before the bomb blasts took place he had sent a message to the Swedish intelligence agency, SAPO, warning them that this attack was just the beginning. He promised that more such attacks would follow because Sweden had sent 500 soldiers to Afghanistan and the Swedish cartoonist, Lars Vilks, had drawn a derogatory cartoon of Prophet Mohammad (PBUH). He announced that just as Muslim men, women and children were being killed in Afghanistan, Swedish men, women and children would also be killed. Immediately afterwards, extremist Islamist websites affiliated to al-Qaeda backed his threat, saying that Sweden would pay a heavy price (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0974928413489468">Ahmed 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Al-Abdaly had arrived in Sweden as a child in 1991 from war-ravaged Iraq along with his parents who sought asylum in Sweden. He went to school in a small Swedish town, and then studied at a British university. His wife and children were living in Luton, outside London. He had been socialising with local Muslims in Luton, attending a mosque for prayers. Some of them remembered that he held extremist views, but they did not report him to the police. It is important to point out that Luton gained considerable notoriety for being a stronghold of extremist Muslims—most of them of Pakistani or Azad Kashmiri origin. The five individuals from northern England who carried out suicide terrorist attacks on the London underground and buses in July 2005 had links with extremists in Luton. The Swedish government and administration have responded in a most restrained and calm manner. Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt emphasised the need to maintain an open, tolerant society and not to blame a whole community for the misdeeds of one malevolent individual.</p>
<p>Representatives of the Islamic Council of Sweden and the head Imam of the main mosque in Stockholm condemned the terrorist attack as un-Islamic, cowardly and deeply inhuman. Other Imams and Islamic figures also issued similar statements on the radio, television and in the press. A representative body of Iraqi refugees took out a demonstration condemning the criminal act of Al-Abdaly. Some Muslims, interviewed on television, expressed shame but also fear as to how their Swedish neighbours and workmates would treat them from now onwards.</p>
<p>The right-wing, anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim Sweden Democratic Party which won 20 seats in the Swedish parliament in the September 2010 elections on an anti-immigration and anti-Muslim campaign called for immediate stop to Muslim immigration under one pretext or another (ibid.).</p>
<p>On 20 March 2012 a gunman, Mohamed Merah, shot and severely wounded three soldiers in Toulouse region of France. He then fired on adults and children outside a Jewish school in Toulouse, killing the rabbi and two of his sons and a seven-year-old girl. He was shot dead in a police shootout. A French citizen of Algerian descent, it was revealed that Merah had been networking with extremist groups worldwide and also went to Afghanistan and Pakistan. The French authorities intensified their campaign against suspected extremists and their organisations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0974928413489468">Carsten 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>The Oslo Slaughter</title>
<p>Perhaps the most shocking terrorist attack post 9/11 was not carried out by suspected al-Qaeda operatives but a Norwegian Islam and Muslim-hater, Anders Behring Breivik (32), on 22 July 2011 in Oslo and an island on the outskirts of the Norwegian capital. Breivik did not target the Muslims but the Norwegian government and the youth league of the Norwegian Labour Party in two sequential attacks that claimed 77 lives. The first was a car bomb in the executive government quarter of Norway. The car was placed in front of the office of Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg and other government buildings. The explosion killed 8 people and injured at least 209 people, 12 of them seriously. The second attack occurred less than two hours later at a summer camp on an island where the youth wing of the Labour Party had set up a summer camp. He gunned down his victims in a cold-blooded shooting spree as he hunted them down, killing 69 of them and injuring many more.</p>
<p>Breivik was arrested and put on trial where he proudly admitted having carried out the carnage but denied criminal charges asserting that he was acting to defend Norway and Europe from a Muslim-Islamic takeover. He accused the government and the Labour Party of being accomplices in a grand conspiracy to impose Islam. He claimed to enjoy support all over Europe of like-minded parties and organisations and considered himself a champion of Christianity against the Islamic scourge. He said history will exonerate him (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0974928413489468">Myhre 2012</xref>). The authorities could not find evidence of linkages with other individuals and organisations and it was suggested that he probably acted as a lone wolf. On 24 August 2012, the court convicted him as charged and sentenced him to 21 years of preventive detention in prison, which at the end can be extended repeatedly for 5 years as long as he is considered a threat to society. Far-right forces in the UK praised Breivik and described him as a ‘role model’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0974928413489468">Townsend 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>On the whole the government of all the affected states have taken the position that the majority of Muslims are peaceful and law-abiding individuals and mainstream media too has emphasised the very small numbers of people involved in terrorism or extremists movements. The common approach has been not to use security concerns to trump the freedoms and rights of citizens as well as aliens but there can be little doubt that the Oslo slaughter in a rude and traumatising manner draws attention to the growing radicalisation of racist and neo-Nazi forces, many of whom saw Islam and Muslims as the villain of the piece in a sinister plot to subvert Christianity and the cultural and racial homogeneity of Europe. Therefore, surveillance of both Muslim extremists and the anti-Muslim cells and organisations has increased. There is a visible increase in anxiety and worry in the host societies and the Muslim minorities feel increasingly exposed and vulnerable. No case of spontaneous or organised mob attacks on Muslims has been reported though individual acts of violence have taken place. By and large, life has gone on as usual.</p>

<title>The Hijab and Burqa/Niqab Controversies</title>
<p>While reaction to the 9/11 attacks were no doubt the trigger that set in motion concerns for security in Europe, such fears were compounded by related issues that generated tension. On the one hand, for a long time the French National Front had been calling for repatriation of Muslims to their home countries. On the other hand, among the Muslim immigrant, especially those from the Maghreb, the trend to adhere more strictly to Islamic attire and other symbols had been gaining ground. In particular girls had begun to use headscarves in schools, which were deemed as a violation of the rules that required religion being kept out of educational institutions. There was considerable agitation before the bill was passed as clerics and others claimed that such a headgear was a religious obligation of Muslims. A public debate took place which generated consensus against the hijab and on 15 March 2004, President Jacques Chirac signed into law the bill passed by the French national legislature which came into effect on 2 September 2004. The law does not mention any particular symbol and thus bans even girl students of other religions from observing religious symbols in schools. Such a ban did not apply to grown-up girls or outside the educational institutions even for younger Muslim girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0974928413489468">Bowen 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0974928413489468">Winter 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Later, some women began donning an extreme form of dress to mark their social isolation when in public places: the burqa or niqab. Very few women wore it, but it was considered as an extremist provocation which was inimical to the principles of French secularism. It meant covering the whole face and even other parts of the body. The burqa was also banned in April 2011. There was again public debate in the media and in the legislature before the ban was introduced. It was particularly identified as incompatible with the equality of women. Very few women violated the burqa ban and those who did have been penalised. The Dutch and Belgian parliaments have also passed bills banning wearing of niqab in public places; the completion of the legal procedure is expected to be completed soon. Elsewhere the governments have either openly rejected such legislation or adopted a policy of non-action. Arguments based on human rights, women’s rights and minority rights have been advanced both for and against the ban on the burqa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0974928413489468">Chesler 2010</xref>, 33–45).</p>

<title>The Cartoon Controversy</title>
<p>On 30 September 2005, the Danish newspaper <italic>Jyllands-Posten</italic> published 12 cartoons, most of them depicting the Prophet Muhammad in negatively and insulting ways. It was justified as the freedom of expression. Danish Muslim organisations objected to the caricatures and the embassies of Muslim nations in Copenhagen urged the Danish government to take action against such provocation. The Danish prime minister refused to meet a delegation of Muslim diplomats. A judicial complaint was also filed in the courts by Muslim organisations but it was dismissed. Some Muslim imams then toured the Middle East to raise awareness of the issue. The cartoons were reprinted in some other countries as well including Sweden. It resulted in large-scale protests in places as far as Pakistan and Bangladesh. More than 200 deaths were reported. Attacks on Danish and European foreign missions and local Christian minorities took place as well. Saudi Arabia and some other countries decided to boycott Danish goods. In the media once again discussion took place on the conflict between the freedom of expression and the religious sensibilities of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0974928413489468">Hussain 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In July 2007, the Swedish artist Lars Vilks presented a number of drawings of the Prophet which portrayed him in a manner considered highly blasphemous by Muslims. A regional newspaper published one of the drawings on 18 August 2007, which further incensed Muslim sensibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0974928413489468">Lindekilde, Mouritzen and Zapata-Barrero 2009</xref>, 291–313).

<title>The Swedish Television’s Sting Operation</title>
<p>In May 2012 Swedish television showed a documentary based on the findings of an investigative team called <italic>Uppdrag Granskning</italic> (Task Scrutiny), which for a long time had been exposing corruption scandals, prostitution, oppressive Christian sects and abuse of power by politicians, big business, and so on. The latest was a sting operation against double standards of Muslim family counsellors (imams) at mosques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0974928413489468">Ahmed 2012</xref>). All mosques receive funding from the state to help Muslims integrate with Swedish society. For scrutiny, 10 leading mosques—Sunni and Shia—were selected in major Swedish cities and towns. First, some members of the team met the imams officially to find out the rights and status of men and women in Islam. Not surprisingly, they were told that Islamic law was in perfect harmony with Swedish law on equality and rights of men and women. Two women—one a believing Muslim and the other born a Muslim but who no longer adhered to the faith—dressed up in black burqas, covered from head to toe, met the imams by prior appointment. The two women carried hidden cameras and voice recorders.</p>
<p>They met the counsellors and posed questions on family affairs. The first question was if a Muslim man could marry four wives simultaneously and nine out of 10 imams, Sunni and Shia, confirmed that they could. The second was if a man could demand sexual service from his wife even if she was not willing. The majority said yes. Under Swedish law, this constitutes rape. The third was if a Muslim woman whose husband beats her should inform the police. They were told not to. Such advice too was in conflict with Swedish law and practice. The team then met the spokesmen for the mosque committees and showed them the recorded interviews. Most of them conceded that the advice was wrong; some suggested that the imams gave advice in their personal capacity, even though mosque committees had appointed them for family counselling! (ibid.).</p>
<p>Later, Muslim representatives and women rights activists took part in another popular discussion on Swedish television called ‘Debate’. Some of the representatives tried to hit back by alleging that the programme was unethical, hidden cameras were unacceptable, and the responses of the imams had been edited to suit the biases of the documentary producer. One female Muslim imam (a novel innovation) supported the investigation. The most interesting outcome was that a Swedish minister said that Muslims, born and brought up in Sweden and trained as imams, could facilitate understanding and adjustment between the majority and Muslim minorities (ibid.).</p>

<title>The Economic Downturn</title>
<p>Such developments in the post-war period have been taking place in the background of drastic changes in the structure of European economies. In the post-war period, most of them were in need of foreign workers and allowed immigration to continue as long as their industries needed them. Technological changes that followed after that resulted in production of many important goods moving to Asia and elsewhere. Such transformation began to take place already in the 1980s and was accelerated in the 1990s. As a result, unemployment rose and 5–10 per cent unemployment became a permanent feature of the European economies. There was also a structural transformation from industrial production to the services sector and in that sector the need for an immigrant workforce is expected to increase in the foreseeable future. However, at present most of Europe is reeling under the impact of the 2008 financial crisis that originated in Wall Street but the contagion spread forthwith to Europe and many other parts of the world. Widespread corruption and malfunctioning in the banking sector have resulted in stagnation and fears of a long recession. As a result job creation has shrunk in almost all European countries. In such circumstances, foreigners typically become the scapegoat. That probably renders the Muslim presence all the more complicated. Thus far, however, calls for a complete stop to Muslim migration have been ignored as discriminatory and with many parts of the Middle East suffering from armed conflicts, such as in Syria, the stream of Muslim refugees will continue. In the long run, however, Europe would need people to manage its economic and social needs as its aging population would grow even bigger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0974928413489468"><italic>Migration and the Economic Crisis in the European Union</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The vicissitudes attendant upon post-war immigration of Muslims to Europe from Asia and Africa are primarily about the perceived lack of ethnic affinity. Differences of ethnic (race) origin, religion and language between Muslim immigrants and host Christian societies are obvious. However, as mentioned earlier, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and others too have immigrated to Europe. Initially, those who began to oppose immigration identified race as the main factor that differentiated the immigrants from the locals. However, over time the Muslim group has been in the limelight with regard to security threats posed by it to the host societies. The fact that the Muslims are the largest group among them surely makes a difference, but that alone does not explain the increase in tensions. The 9/11 terrorist attacks carried out by al-Qaeda and it repercussions in Europe, including several terrorists attacks, have greatly accentuated the perceived threat posed by Muslims.</p>
<p>The clash of civilisation that Huntington predicted is premised on the assumption that cultures are constant entities and that Islam and the West subscribe to irreconcilable <italic>Weltanschauungs</italic>. There is no dearth of extremist behaviour of Muslims that seems to confirm the clash of civilisation thesis. However, the evidence also points out that activists who indulge in such behaviour constitute a miniscule minority. On the other hand, Myron Weiner argues that the existence or the lack of ‘ethnic affinity’ determines whether host societies would accept or reject immigration, but that ethnic affinity is a social construction is thus confirmed. The idea of a social construct does not mean it is a manipulation of objective facts; it can be based in actual experience. However, feelings of sympathy or antipathy are not permanent and immutable. These can, in principle, change if both sides learn to adjust and make reasonable accommodations of each other’s concerns, asserts Weiner.</p>
<p>Perhaps the imperceptible socialisation that is going on needs to be probed more carefully while better methods and strategies to deal with the extremists can be devised. In which direction would the attitudes of the majority of Muslims evolve is too early to say. It takes several generations to understand and adjust and requires efforts from both sides. Because of recurring disturbances in the Middle East and increasing economic difficulties in other parts of the Muslim world, people claiming political and humanitarian status are likely to continue making efforts to enter Europe.</p>
<p>It is important that the secular–democratic European state remains steadfast. Claims to cultural autonomy should be treated with sympathy case by case, but the notion of multiculturalism should not mean that Muslims or any other community is able to obtain exemptions that conflict with the overall inclusive and equal citizenship that applies to most of Europe. Equally, it is important that vigilance and surveillance of extremist Muslims is maintained and improved but without jeopardising the rights of the Muslims in general to equal treatment under the law. The immigrant communities need to be properly informed about not only their rights but also obligations. In the aftermath of the Oslo carnage, it is being realised increasingly that the policy of letting immigrant communities violate the law has inadvertently created grounds for anti-immigration and anti-Muslim movements and parties to gain popularity. Integration that in the long run results in voluntary assimilation into mainstream society is probably what public policy might want to accomplish. However, its opposite is possible if al-Qaeda type terrorism continues. Thus far no spontaneous attacks by ‘normal’ society have taken place and such outbursts are most unlikely, but without the current lack of ethnic affinity somehow being transformed into positive ethnic affinity the alienation of the Muslims from mainstream society will always be a problem for a democratic, pluralist order stabilising in Europe.</p>
