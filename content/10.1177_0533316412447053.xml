<abstract>
<p>This work describes an attempt to challenge the prototypical isolation of autistic individuals with the psychotherapeutic group. The challenge is to group people who avoid people, either because of constitutional deficits or due to a life-long history of deficient approaches to their specific patterns of interaction. Here an account of a successful intervention of group analytic psychotherapy will allow a better evaluation of the potential of the group as a therapeutic means of helping severely disabled individuals to live better lives.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Social isolation, severe communicational difficulties and stereotyped behaviour are the pathognomonic symptoms of autism. Sufferers are considered permanently disabled in their social lives due to impairment of interpersonal relationships and cognitive development with a great burden on the family and community.</p>
<p>Since its first description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0533316412447053">Kanner, 1943</xref>), autism has been increasingly diagnosed, culminating in a supposed ‘epidemics’ at the end of the 1990s. Nowadays, this is mostly acknowledged a result of refinement of diagnostic criteria, the spread of information about the condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0533316412447053">MMWR Surveill Summ, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0533316412447053">Fombonne, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0533316412447053">Losh and Piven, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0533316412447053">Department of Health and Human Services, 2010</xref>) and, in particular, the decision to categorize autism as a ‘spectrum of disorders’, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0533316412447053">Volkmar, Klin and Cohen, 1997</xref>) ranging from mild manifestations of isolation but with good intellectual functioning, to greatly disabled individuals, mentally and socially.</p>
<p>Autism and the other categories included as Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDDs—Asperger’s Syndrome, Rett Syndrome, Disintegrative Disorder in Childhood and Pervasive Developmental Disorder not otherwise specified) are considered severe disturbances of complex and heterogeneous etiology, affecting emotional, cognitive and social development, with symptoms appearing before the age of three (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0533316412447053">Baron-Cohen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0533316412447053">Tager-Flusberg and Caronna, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Epidemiological studies show that autism is the commonest of the PDDs, ranging from four cases in 10,000 to estimates of one in every 1000 children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316412447053">Fombonne, 1999</xref>) independently of social class, cultural background or region. The prevalence is higher in boys at a proportion of 4:1.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0533316412447053">the National Autistic Society (2010)</xref> states:
<disp-quote><p>Autism is a life-long developmental disability affecting social and communication skills. People with autism often have accompanying learning disabilities but, whatever their general level of intelligence, they will share a common difficulty in making sense of the world in the way most people do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0533316412447053">2010</xref>: 1)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The consensus is to recommend early diagnosis and treatment for all areas of impairment. The social difficulties must be treated by well trained professionals in the areas of psychology, education and occupational therapy. Language deficits should be treated with speech therapy and special learning programmes. Behavioural manifestations need to be understood and modified by appropriate psychotherapeutic approaches.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0533316412447053">
<title>Psychoanalytical Perspectives</title>
<p>Psychoanalysis has long been dedicated to the treatment of individuals who suffer primitive anxieties and encapsulations. The work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0533316412447053">Margareth Mahler (1958)</xref> is very important for the understanding of these primitive stages in the development of the infant mind. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0533316412447053">Donald Meltzer and collaborators (1975)</xref> studied typical autistic mental processes. They considered the fragmentation of the psyche as essential, declaring that the basis of autism is a suspension of mental life. They also described that rapid changes in thoughts and the complexity of their minds causes continuous turmoil for therapists.</p>
<p>The basic process that interrupts and disorganizes the mental life of an autistic person is a dismantling through which facts and experiences are fragmented and become discontinuous. They cannot configure memories and thus learning by experience does not take place:
<disp-quote><p>When the self is dismantled in its sensory components due to the suspension of the ego function of attention, a coherent ego temporarily interrupts its existence; each fragment or component is reduced to its primitive state, dominated by the id and its economy and dynamics. We suggest that this primitivism is essentially absent of mental activity, that is to say, dementalized. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0533316412447053">Meltzer, 1979</xref>: 25)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Frances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0533316412447053">Tustin (1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0533316412447053">1992</xref>) believes in a possible evolution of this condition through a concentration of institutional and therapeutic resources. For Tustin, autistic children have an intense fear of disintegration and annihilation, because they develop, while babies, mechanisms to avoid the traumatic awareness of being physically separated from their mothers. The ‘self’ is still poorly developed, and the feeling of ‘continuity of being’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0533316412447053">Winnicott, 1957</xref>) is not well established. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0533316412447053">Tustin (1992)</xref> considers that the emotional and cognitive development is slowed down or virtually stopped. It is as if the child becomes ‘frozen’, inside a protective shell, protecting him/her from the dangers of the outside world and blocking his/her access to the common reality. Autism is a defence against disintegration and the lack of intermediation between the child’s strong sensations and the chaotic environment where he/she lives in a state of desperation.</p>

<title>Is Group Psychotherapy Possible for Autistic Individuals?</title>
<p>The I.C.D. 10 and D.S.M. IV consider autism as a condition where severe developmental disorders affect social interaction, language and communication, accompanied by poverty in the use of imaginative or symbolic play. How, with these limitations, could we consider the possibility of grouping and analysing these individuals?</p>
<p>Our work resembles the perspectives adopted in the Tavistock Clinic, London:
<disp-quote><p>We try to identify where the autism arises from deficit, where from defence against trauma, where from disorder, and where from deviance . . . Our approach is both psychoanalytic and developmental. It is psychoanalytic in its emphasis on the close observation of events in their interpersonal context. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316412447053">Alvarez and Reid, 1999</xref>: xi–xii)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Alvarez (1999: 2) comments on autism: it is ‘an impairment of the normal <italic>sense of emotionally based curiosity about, and desire for, interpersonal relationships</italic>’ and goes further:
<disp-quote><p>Although we do not suggest that the lack of emotional relatedness to others is the primary cause of the disorder, we do think it is the core and primary symptom, and it is toward that area of the patient’s condition that we direct our treatment. (1999: 3)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Describing the technical requirements of the therapist, she says:
<disp-quote><p>Therapists’ particular training involves the toleration and exploration of intense feelings—of anxiety, of despair or of boredom . . . The therapist must have a mind for two, energy for two, hope for two, imagination for two. Gradually, patients may begin to get interested, not yet in us, but in our interest in them. (1999: 6–7)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The Tavistock group stresses ‘the importance of an enduring emotional setting, properly balanced between firmness and receptivity’ (1999: 91). They consider the autistic person as a unique and distinct personality, although stressing their ‘vast impatience with the otherness of the world’ (1999: 70). ‘People with autism are more than a collection of symptoms—they are always mysterious, often fascinating and certainly challenging’ (1999: 76).</p>
<p>Therapeutic groups have a long tradition in dealing with difficult patients and they are the best choice to handle situations where transference and counter-transference puts many questions to the analysts.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0533316412447053">Foulkes (1957)</xref> declared that the essential therapeutic agent is the active participation inside the collective environment and proposed that an active and enthusiastic participation in matters of the group creates the way that allows the group to understand its internal difficulties and become responsible for them.</p>
<p>His concept of group matrix, as the dynamically inter-connected psychical net of the group, organizing and giving meaning to any event, is essential for the understanding of processes such as the ones we lived in this group with autistic individuals. According to Xenitides, Barnes and White: ‘Group-analytic psychotherapy, like any analytic psychotherapy, is an emotional rather than intellectual experience. What makes or breaks a therapeutic group is its capacity for members to link each other’s experiences, to relate with and trust each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0533316412447053">2005</xref>: 437).’</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0533316412447053">Ivan Urlic (1999)</xref> maintains that the concept of group matrix should encompass the notion of a psychogenic autistic barrier, albeit the difficulties it may raise in the technical handling:
<disp-quote><p>How to interpret an autistic barrier? How to reach the split-off and deeply repressed parts of personality, parts which are also most probably undeveloped—autistic islands within a personality, influencing the development and functioning of a person, and whose mirroring in the group process is very difficult to recognize and interpret?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0533316412447053">1999</xref>: 536).</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>We believe that the hard task of investigating a group of autistic individuals is worthy and can help in the development of the theory and technique of group analyses. Similar to Urlic, we deem that ‘Besides the skill of the therapist, a long-term perspective is also necessary which, although prolonged (four, five, or more years) permanently requires very active relationship, active efforts, but also active waiting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0533316412447053">1999</xref>: 546).</p>
<p>An inter-personal interaction is the main instrument in group psychotherapy. Understanding the psychical functioning in terms of internal links of a group matrix, the experiences, communication and interactions inside the therapeutic group are tools to operate changes in the relationship of each individual within himself and in his external reality. ‘In the therapeutic group acceptance is the keyword. With increasing socialization the character of intercommunication changes. From being rigid, absolute and repetitive, communication becomes plastic, relative and modifiable by group experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0533316412447053">Foulkes and Anthony, 1957</xref>: 197).’</p>
<p>We think that group analytic psychotherapy configures a privileged situation for investigation and transformation of the psychical organization and for the social development of these individuals. The psychotherapeutic group favours inter-connections and intersubjectivity, and represents the possibility of a new field to manifest the particular way of being-in-the-world that autistic individuals have. The group, with its potentiality of promoting links, can create factors that allow a channeling of desires to interact.</p>

<title>The Institutional Setting</title>
<p>The Maria Lucia de Oliveira School is a clinical-educational institution devoted to the care of autistic and psychotic people in Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Brazil. The work is conceived from a psychoanalytic standpoint. The professional group work as a team aiming to provide as many advances in the areas of language, learning, social skills and symbolization processes as possible.</p>
<p>In 1996 we organized an intervention team comprised of four psychotherapists, with the purpose of starting group analytic psychotherapy with autistic individuals who were attending the school. Our aim was to know if a group situation might contribute to communication between group members. We believe that autistic communication is different and not an absence of communication. With an understanding of verbal and non-verbal autistic signs we expected to provide affective communication, and in consequence better development of each individual and improve their socialization. Group analytic psychotherapy was chosen as the best setting for this investigation; the choice of two couples of therapists aimed to broaden the perspectives in the group dynamics.</p>
<p>Seven students were chosen to participate; six had been diagnosed as autistic according to ICD 10 classification (category F84.0) and one was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome (F84.5).</p>
<p>The beginning of this group, an account of which was published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0533316412447053">Ávila, 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0533316412447053">Ávila, 1998b</xref>), is summarized here. Subsequently, we will present three ‘vignettes’ of recent sessions in this 15-year experience.</p>
<p>The beginning of the sessions was almost completely decided by the autistic individuals, themselves, that is, while we were still preparing the room, they entered. The therapeutic team lived intense counter-transferential experiences: fear, anxiety and excitement with the novelty of the situation. The psychotherapeutic challenge was to constitute a sense of belonging to a group. We believed that the students were capable of developing active links and consequently, communication and interaction. The first ten sessions showed how, with different forms of languages (music, sounds, games, interchanges of objects, dances, etc.), the participants really interacted, creating and expanding the group dynamics.</p>
<p>We learned with them, inventing approaches, having thorough discussions after each session, changing attitudes, criticizing ourselves and revising our postures. They showed unequivocal signs of progress in communication and understanding. In this brief period of time, several situations emerged bringing new patterns of behaviour, such as the diminution of stereotypes, body language, expression of different affects and a general improvement in adaptation and learning. These seven adolescents were able to produce reciprocal affective movements and a set of shared representations, evidenced by different interactions and plastic representations, such as drawing. The autistic symptoms were always present, but could achieve representation and a beginning of symbolization of their meaning.</p>
<p>This initial set of sessions also demonstrated the possibility of links among students and with us. They truly interacted, albeit in their fragmented and idiosyncratic way—the links were undeniable, and we acknowledged that a real group experience could emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0533316412447053">Ávila, 1998a</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0533316412447053">1998b</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0533316412447053">
<title>Structural Changes of the Group</title>
<p>As this group is held in an institutional setting, very different from a private practice, several structural transformations caused by external events occurred over the years. The therapeutic team changed; over the last four years it is composed of Carina Macedo, Leticia Mogioli and Fernanda Marcondes, with Lazslo Ávila working as supervisor.</p>
<p>Carina is the only therapist who remains from the beginning. Of the original seven participants, two autistic students continue in the psychotherapeutic process. The current group has six members: Peter (36 years-old, 21 at the beginning of the psychotherapeutic group), Angela (32 years-old, 17 at the beginning), Erik (26 years-old, participating since 2004), Anthony (25 years-old, participating since 2004) and Edwin (18 years-old, participating since 2009) all of whom have autism (ICD 10, F 84.0,), and Virgil (20 years-old, participating since 2009) who is psychotic (infantile schizophrenia).</p>
<p>This psychotherapeutic group was never interrupted; it met once a week for one and a half hours in a room adapted for this purpose in the Maria Lucia de Oliveira School.</p>
<p>Three ‘vignettes’ of recent sessions will show the evolution of the group and the continuous effort to give meaning and to help these subjects to achieve self-development.</p>
<sec id="section6-0533316412447053">
<title>Situation One</title>
<p>One of the therapists (Leticia) takes a strip of paper off the ceiling fan that Erik is striving to reach. She gives it to him and he plays with it, showing his pleasure. Then Angela offers him a magazine but he ignores her. She insists and the therapists tell him that she is giving him a gift similar to the strip of paper that made him so happy. He agrees to accept the magazine but then drops it on the ground. Angela picks it up and gives it him back, but he ignores her once more. Again she insists and after some resistance he accepts the ‘gift’ and plays with it. Afterwards, Angela gives the photograph albums to Anthony and stares at him. This is very different to her habitual attitude of throwing the albums on the floor. She does the same with a pen she is holding. Instead of throwing it on the ground she hands it to therapist Carina and waits for her to write her name on a sheet of paper. Today, she smiles and offers to shake the therapist’s hand.</p>
<p>Virgil asks one of the therapists to turn on the CD player. That has always been the task of Angela but she stays calm. Virgil plays with a therapist holding out the pen, and then taking it away before she can grab it. The game is joyful and both of them laugh. He asks her to draw a carrot, which she does. Then they draw together. She glues pictures on to a piece of card and he eats the glue. She glues others with his help. Everybody shows interest in this activity and approach the table where they are. Peter brings some magazines. Edwin looks at the drawings and picks up some photos. Angela sits close to them and pays attention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0533316412447053">
<title>Discussion of Situation One</title>
<p>The therapists could have adopted a neutral posture, without encouraging Erik to accept the gift offered by Angela and leaving her to become frustrated, and then left to deal with the consequences. But, for the therapists, the counter-transference feeling was that her frustration would possibly be unbearable. It could be converted into such a painful and devastating experience that would lead her to return to the safety of her autistic state from where she was bravely emerging.</p>
<p>On considering the psychogenesis of these structures, these patients have severe disturbances in primary relationships. The therapist’s neutrality, when dealing with deeply ill patients, may be considered by the patients as ‘coldness’, which may cause further injury to the patients.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0533316412447053">Bion (1995)</xref> considers that the absence of maternal containment, when the mother refuses the dangerous content and sends it back to the infant, can generate a particular kind of anxiety, called (by him) ‘nameless terror’. In psychotherapy there is a clear difference between the containment function and mere reception of the patient’s anxieties.</p>
<p>Angela had never before directed herself to any group participant, except to the therapists, nor had she ever offered gifts. She always paid attention to Erik, especially when he took off his trousers and urinated on the carpet in front of her. She used to smile, make some sounds, shake her body and bite her own hand. It seems as if she considered his urine a gift.</p>
<p>The therapists felt that by offering a gift, Angela was crossing an abyss. It was surprising how she dared to interact, which left her in a vulnerable position, remembering that Erik was severely affected by autism. So, when he refused her gift, this seemed to be the start of a catastrophe. The therapists were not acting out, nor identifying with Angela’s fears, but understood that this was something new. They felt that Angela would not be able to bear the frustration.</p>
<p>The trust achieved through a strong therapeutic relationship over many years probably enabled Angela to take a risk in this protected setting. Counter-transference allowed the therapists to share these feelings with her in a way that her experience was a <italic>continuity of being</italic>, uninterrupted by anxiety because of the absence of the therapist, as highlighted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0533316412447053">Winnicott (1957)</xref>. The sequence of sessions showed how this attitude favoured a series of other group interactions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0533316412447053">
<title>Situation Two</title>
<p>Before the beginning of the session, a school attendant warns the therapists, ‘Today Angela is very angry, she hit me when I tried to help her to go to the bathroom and it was occupied’. Typical rituals of Angela include: going to the bathroom next to the consulting room, choosing the music that the group will listen to during psychotherapy sessions, looking at the photograph albums before any other group member, selecting magazines and working with ‘collage’.</p>
<p>In recent sessions, photo albums have been the object of disagreement between participants while Angela goes to the bathroom, which clearly disturbs her. On this particular day, when she arrives, all the albums are being looked at by other group members, music is already being played, and the magazines are untidily thrown around the room. She looks at the CD player, then to the photo box and shows a perplexed, distressed expression, which is normal when she is in a state of intense excitement or anguish.</p>
<p>This situation immediately brought to the mind of therapist Carina another event that had happened about two years previously. After a similar sequence of frustrating situations during a group session, Angela had an intense crisis of anguish, which had not been possible to contain. An efficient link was not established with her, and she reacted by biting the therapist several times and many people were needed to stop the attack. On that occasion, after successive breaks in her rituals, she had had a crisis that had probably been triggered by a picture of a cat in a magazine. When Angela was a child, she accidentally killed a kitten, while stroking it.</p>
<p>On remembering this, Carina felt much fear, but continued close to Angela, helping her to gradually control her feelings. Carina carefully placed some photographs and magazines ready for Angela to start a collage, if she wanted to. The other members of the group showed containment to Angela’s feelings and were very cooperative as they offered photos and magazines to her.</p>
<p>At the same time, Carina explained to everyone what had happened and that she was trying to calm Angela down. She explained that the disorganization of materials had made Angela upset and impeded her rituals. Surprisingly, Angela accepted the help and settled down. At moments, she imitated the ‘claws’ of a cat threatening its prey with her hands and then the therapist said in a serene voice: ‘I know, I know, everything is different today’.</p>
<p>Slowly her expression changed and she became less agitated. She picked up the magazines and accepted help. After this, looking at the magazines, she showed the picture of a kitten and said, ‘the cat’ (she spoke very little). Then, Carina said, ‘Is it possible that Angela linked that moment with the tragic situation in her childhood when she killed her kitten, and also with the similar situation that had happened two years previously in this same group?’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0533316412447053">
<title>Discussion of Situation Two</title>
<p>In the first situation, after biting Carina, Angela sank in a <italic>nameless terror</italic> and it was not possible to overcome the autistic barrier to reach her. The therapist perceived her <italic>dismantling</italic> (as was defined by Meltzer) and the link between them was not sufficiently good to permit containment. Carina perceived that Angela was in panic, and had attained a state of such disintegration that she would not be able, alone, to achieve psychical reorganization.</p>
<p>In the current clinical content, the situation repeated. Finding the bathroom door locked, Angela was faced with a breakdown of her omnipotence and of the tranquillity brought by the illusion of obsessive control provided by her rituals. Soon, her unstable emotional condition was evidenced when she hit the school attendant as she had attacked the therapist previously.</p>
<p>Then, other rituals were successively broken. The therapist perceived in her counter-transference what this may represent, recalling the prior catastrophic situation. She knew that she had to offer herself as support, for the patient not to dismantle again, which may have been irreversible. The therapist–mother offered herself as a recipient of projective identifications, filtering and reflecting positive feelings. Angela accepted them, and this acceptance allowed her to escape from a state of terror of a mother incapable of ‘reverie’.</p>
<p>This time she could recognize in the other a source of resources to deal with the tensions of the environment. Then, an organizing and reparatory situation could develop. The group was also capable of containing Angela—and to the proposal of the therapist, allowing and cooperating for Angela to recover her psychical imbalance.</p>
<p>The capacity of the therapists to exert the functions of ‘reverie’ and ‘containment’, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0533316412447053">Bion (1995)</xref>, are essential for therapeutic success. Through them, the therapist can receive, contain, decode, transform and elaborate the projective identification of the patient and give it back in adequate doses, after renaming it and giving it meaning. The tough feelings are projected on to the therapist rather than on to the mother. What is necessary is that the therapist is able to contain them, in order to allow the patient to <italic>continue to be</italic>, without being interrupted by the reactions of the therapist fear of being invaded by these feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0533316412447053">Khan, 1957</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0533316412447053">
<title>Situation Three</title>
<p>In the first session after the death of Rose, who had been part of this therapeutic group for several years, Virgil was very aggressive in a way that had not been common for a long time. He hit and spat at everybody. Carina said that he looked different and questioned whether he was trying to communicate something in this way. Edwin looked at a photo and after a while he cried very sensitively, although tears did not flow. Carina told the group that he was looking at a photo of Rose. Then the therapists introduced the theme of her death, which had been recent. They pointed out that maybe some of the participants were aware of this event. Edwin cried louder at the same time as the therapist named his emotion. His tears started to fall until his crying became total. He affected the entire group and everyone was silent.</p>
<p>The therapists talked about death and its consequences: you never see the person again. You feel his/her absence, sadness, loneliness and miss the person. Virgil calmed down during the session. Erik, who fell asleep, woke up and stayed lying next to Edwin. They used to sit together. As the therapists talked, Edwin cried more and more. Leticia approached him and told him that he was sad. He took a tear, looked her directly in her eye and gave it to her by putting it in her hand. The group was still, watching and following his suffering. The therapists were also deeply touched and felt a great void, a lot of pain and nothing to say, only the sharing of emotions. In the next two sessions the same scene re-occurred, Edwin looked at photos of Rose and cried.</p>

<title>Discussion of Situation Three</title>
<p>Edwin is the ‘spokesperson’ of the feelings caused by the news of Rose’s death. He expresses the pain that the rest of the group denies. His cry without tears is perceived as the expression of deep suffering and the therapists try to give it a name and meaning. Slowly, his ‘nameless pain’ is converted into living suffering. Edwin cries as long as his ‘feeling-thing’, his ‘concrete feeling’ is converted into mourning for the loss. His pain is harboured, translated, understood and given meaning by the interventions of the therapists. At last he can cry openly and his pain is released, as is expected in the normal process of mourning.</p>
<p>This offers the group the possibility of being in contact with the denied pain, showing that it is possible to suffer, and the participants do not avoid the experience.</p>
<p>We observed the containment of the group for this strong feeling. Similar to what a mother does for her baby, the group received these manifestations as natural components of the experience. The therapists, shaken by their counter-transference feelings, named the pain and pointed out the possibility of containment.</p>
<p>When Edwin took one teardrop and put it in the hand of his therapist he was concretely delivering his suffering into her hands. The therapists were completely taken aback by his feeling of pain; they shared his and the group’s suffering. They felt that this act communicated his request for help to deal with his feelings and his acknowledgement that the therapists were capable of providing him the support structure that he still had not constructed for himself.</p>
<p>Edwin, until now, continues to look at the photos of Rose, but he does not cry anymore. He has not autistically denied the object of suffering by avoiding the memories as would be expected. On the contrary, he uses the photos to remember, which suggests that Rose is still conserved somewhere inside him and inside the group.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In our experience with this group analytic psychotherapy we follow how different possibilities of linkages favour the conditions to search for unconscious meanings, and to diminish autistic defences, such as isolation and negation of external reality. To develop the mind, the environment and other individuals are indispensible, and the therapeutic group can further promote this action. Surprisingly, we observed that the individuals with autism did not improve their defence mechanisms while taking part in the group.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the group seems to create a variety of options and conditions that result in many interactions, that are visible in all sessions. It is indeed a victory over the pathognomonic isolation of these individuals.</p>
<p>Meltzer and his followers in the Tavistock Clinic showed how precarious and fragmented the mental functioning is in the autistic condition. The dismantling, followed by dementalized mental states, is one of the main characteristics of these individuals. In our experience, we confirm that only a very long and patient psychotherapeutic work can provide the necessary means for the slow construction of mental integrity and self-continuity for people under the continuous threat of mental catastrophes.</p>
<p>When these adolescents started in this group they showed no intention of perceiving the other’s stimulation, rejected any proposition, refused to keep eye contact, seemed to be exclusively turned into themselves, possibly trying to control the invasion of stimulation that their sensitivity could not bear. The beginning of this group presented several important instants of this ‘refusal’ but, at the same time, there were other moments when the ‘other’ was perceived, acknowledged and even actively desired. Over 15 years, we saw important developments both in the individual’s and in the group process. An effective group matrix was constructed, allowing communication (both verbal and non-verbal) and understanding between the participants and the team of therapists, who learnt how to discover the elements to interpret and to promote changes from group interactions.</p>
<p>The three situations we describe here show how the group structure gives support to provide the autistic individual new manners to perceive ‘others’ as real sources of pleasure, help and partnership.</p>
<p>The conception of a post-autistic condition permits us to consider a possible evolution of autistic individuals and the huge investment necessary for their rehabilitation. We think that psychoanalytical group psychotherapy, together with multidisciplinary approaches, should be considered as an effective means to treat severe conditions, such as pervasive developmental disorders.</p>
<p>Thus, we conclude in the hope that our experience with this group may contribute to others who also dare to adventure into the unknown world of the autistic individuals’ subjectivity. Faced with the challenge of people that avoid other people, group analytic psychotherapy may represent more than a promise, it may represent a deep transformation of lives.</p>
