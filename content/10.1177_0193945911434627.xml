<p>Providing sufficient details about study interventions, methods, and outcomes in research reports is a fundamental aspect of the scientific process. When information in reports is vague, poorly detailed, or missing altogether, understanding and critical evaluation of associations among study intervention, design, and observed outcomes cannot occur, and the study contributes little to scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>In nursing, intervention research is critical for the development of evidence-based practice. Accordingly, if progress is to occur, research reports of intervention studies must provide details about the interventions. In the case of successful interventions, detailed descriptions permit replication research and permit implementation in the clinical setting. With regard to feasibility and practicality of implementation, provision of detail may permit a cost-benefit analysis of the intervention. For example, an intervention may be highly effective in terms of improving clinical outcomes, but may be so complex or of such a long duration that it places undue burden on the patient or is too costly to be implemented in a real-world setting. Even when interventions are ineffective, findings should be reported and details provided, because this can prevent future unnecessary testing. Detailed intervention descriptions also enable comparison of interventions effectiveness across studies using meta-analytic methods. When information about individual intervention components is provided in studies, they can be analyzed to determine whether they function as moderators of intervention effect size in meta-analysis to develop knowledge about the most effective interventions.</p>
<p>The unfortunate reality is that even though intervention details are important, they are reported incompletely and inconsistently in research reports. A recent normative analysis of 141 intervention studies published in 27 general nursing research journals showed that on average, only 7% of article space was devoted to intervention descriptions, and a substantial number of reports failed to provide sufficient details to permit study replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945911434627">Conn, Cooper, Ruppar, &amp; Russell, 2008</xref>). For example, even though intervention dosage is of fundamental importance, 25% of papers failed to specify the total number of doses study participants received, 33% did not provide information regarding the strength of each dose, and 13% did not specify the time interval between doses. Despite decades of discussion within the nursing discipline about the importance of credentials, interventionists’ education level and professional credentials were missing from 63% of papers reporting nurse-delivered interventions. In studies focusing on specific ethnic groups, more than one third failed to provide any information regarding the cultural relevance of the intervention content.</p>
<p>Studies reporting educational and psychosocial interventions were the most likely to be lacking in details. Nearly 40% of these studies used vague, general terms when describing interventions rather than delineating specific intervention components. As an example, authors might state that participants received a social support intervention and leave it at that. Some interventions were so inadequately described that they constituted “black box” interventions.</p>
<p>Other investigators have since corroborated this dearth of intervention details in nursing research reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945911434627">Forbes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945911434627">McGilton et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, the problem is not limited to nursing: poorly described interventions are common in other disciplines as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945911434627">Davidson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945911434627">Glasziou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193945911434627">Glasziou, Meats, Heneghan, &amp; Shepperd, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945911434627">Marks, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945911434627">Michie &amp; Abraham, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To begin to address this problem within its own pages, <italic>Western Journal of Nursing Research</italic> (WJNR) is instituting an intervention content requirement for intervention research reports submitted for publication. In addition to undergoing the usual peer review, reports also will be evaluated by the editorial office using the checklist shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945911434627">Table 1</xref>. The checklist will ensure that pertinent intervention details are included in papers before any final decisions are made regarding acceptance for publication.</p>

<p>Investigators may find it challenging that the journal is requiring more information while retaining limits on overall manuscript length. For some investigators, this will mean having to spend more time honing their writing skills to produce manuscripts that are succinct yet information-rich. However, there are a number of simple strategies that writers of any skill level can use to increase intervention content but still keep manuscript length under control.</p>
<p>The first step away from the long and winding manuscript is to prepare an outline of the paper before beginning to write. A manuscript generated from an outline will be more succinct simply by virtue of its higher level of organization by eliminating redundancies and extraneous paragraphs that do not address the main points delineated in the outline.</p>
<p>When writing a paper, there is often a temptation to cut and paste content from previously drafted documents in the interest of saving time. However, a cut-and-paste approach usually makes for higher word counts because additional sentences often have to be added to render the pasted-in material seamless with other text. From the standpoint of keeping the word count down, writing fresh sentences is a much more efficient approach.</p>
<p>Using active rather than passive voice will reduce the number of words per sentence, as will constructing sentences that contain single rather than multiple clauses. Word count can also be reduced by avoiding the use of adjectives and strings of prepositional phrases. Even tightly written sentences can be made tighter still by close examination of words that can be deleted without affecting the meaning of the sentence. At the paragraph level, entire sentences can sometimes be deleted with no discernible impact on content or understanding.</p>
<p>Another strategy to generate space is to cut down on unnecessary detail by judicious use of relevant citations. Detailed descriptions of well-established statistical or measurement methods are unnecessary and often can be replaced by a single citation to a paper that describes the procedure in full. In these instances, details that should be provided in the method sections are any modifications that were made to the original procedures. Synthesized content is space efficient. The introductory content can be shortened by synthesizing extant research rather than going into exhaustive detail on the findings of individual studies.</p>
<p>Another good way to create more space is to avoid redundancy across the different sections of the manuscript. A favorite approach of many authors is to begin the discussion with a summary of the study’s purpose and findings—unnecessary because these have been addressed earlier in the paper. The discussion content is best limited to a critical assessment of study findings and their implications. For the same reason, general statements regarding the significance of the research area can also be eliminated from the discussion content.</p>
<p>Even experienced writers can develop tunnel vision regarding their own prose, so it is a good idea to get others involved in the writing and editing process. Coauthors who are willing to be active cowriters can provide a fresh perspective to correct awkwardly constructed sentences and eliminate unnecessary content. Another solution is to hire a professional editor to do a substantive edit of the manuscript, not only to get the word count down but also to ensure that the paper is clear and well organized.</p>
<p>Finding solutions to patient health care problems has always been a central goal within the nursing discipline, and intervention research is a highly effective means of achieving that goal. However, if an intervention produces improved outcomes, the findings are of little use if no information is provided about what was done to bring about the improvements. Systematic examinations of intervention studies published in nursing journals shows that inadequate reporting of intervention details is a pervasive problem. From an economic standpoint, poor reporting of intervention content constitutes inefficient use of the increasingly limited resources available to fund intervention research.</p>
<p>WJNR’s decision to implement a check of intervention content as part of its manuscript review process is both an acknowledgment of the gravity of the problem and way to begin to address it. The checklist will be available as a downloadable file at the WJNR website, and we encourage authors to use it whenever preparing manuscripts for publication. Authors can find additional useful information and illustrative examples of intervention content in recent publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945911434627">Conn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945911434627">Conn &amp; Groves, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945911434627">Donovan, Kwekkeboom, Rosenzweig, &amp; Ward, 2009</xref>). As always, we welcome your feedback and are open to suggestions regarding ways to improve the checklist.</p>
