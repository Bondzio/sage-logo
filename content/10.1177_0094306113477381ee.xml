<p>
<italic>Challenging Genetic Determinism</italic>, edited by Louis Maheu and Roderick A. Macdonald, is part of a growing intellectual trend to declare the longstanding antagonism between the social sciences and genetics a thing of the past. The book is a collection of papers originally presented at a 2007 Royal Society of Canada symposium ponderously titled <italic>Social Sciences Facing Modern Genetics Challenges: Changing Boundaries between Gene Expressions, Behaviour and the Social Fabric</italic>. The aim was to ask how the social sciences and genetics have influenced each other and to open an intellectual space where it is possible to imagine a new scholarly synthesis of the questions and methods of social and genetic analysis. Interestingly, the book is less successful at producing this new scientific possibility than dramatizing some of the social and intellectual barriers hindering its emergence.</p>
<p>The book’s thesis is that longstanding genetic determinist models of behavior and disease have been discredited by more recent sophisticated work. Rather than being replaced by social determinist models, “more probabilistic and complex models of gene and environment interrelationships” (p. xvii) are emerging. The editors make this argument in two framing chapters: at the beginning by reviewing recent thinking about “gene-environment interplay” in behavioral genetics and at the book’s conclusion about laying the groundwork for effective interdisciplinary research. The nine other chapters are evenly divided into sections on genetics and personality, social and ethical issues of gene-environment interplay, and new models of research at the gene-environment intersection.</p>
<p>The premise of the book, and particularly the framing chapters, stands in marked tension with what the other chapters actually demonstrate. The first three chapters by prominent behavioral and psychiatric geneticists challenge the notion, from the introduction, that newly sophisticated models are successfully synthesizing genetic and environmental data to explain behavior in subtle ways. Douglas Wahlsten, reviewing research on the genetics of intelligence, shows that no links between DNA and normal range intelligence have been, nor are likely to be, found and that resources should be focused on genetic disorders. Jonathan Flint shows that hundreds of studies have failed to yield convincing links between DNA and personality (though despite his pessimistic litany he concludes the links’ existence is “indubitable” (p. 92)). And David Goldman argues that links between DNA and stress behaviors are likely to be found when researchers drill further into biochemical functions, not when they study social environments more effectively. None of these chapters lends any support to the idea that genetics and social science will mutually benefit each other.</p>
<p>Three other chapters demonstrate how in a variety of contexts genetic determinism is not dead. Bioethicist Françoise Baylis argues that geneticists’ public statements denouncing genetic determinism are belied by their tendencies to engage in “genes for” talk, to fail to take organisms’ development seriously, and to belittle ethical arguments that aim to criticize rather than ease the relationship between science and society. Timothy Caulfield argues scientific and social forces have combined to reinforce the idea that race is a biologically determined category contrary to the wide expectations that contemporary genomics would undermine the race concept. And Richard Tremblay’s chapter on epigenetic research on aggression, while emphasizing a combination of factors that make it not genetic determinist, is highly fatalistic in its argument about the intergenerational transmission of aggression and the extreme difficulty of unlearning aggressive behavior after childhood. These chapters suggest that genetic determinism and fatalism is inscribed in both the cognitive and the reward structures of genetics research, and that more than pious statements will be needed to bring about their demise.</p>
<p>The other three chapters are more successful studies of biosocial interactions. Two of these, however—chapters on genetic discrimination by Yvonne Bombard and Michael Hayden, and individuals’ ambivalent reactions to genetic tests for Alzheimer’s by Margaret Lock—are in the broad vein of science studies and bioethics. The chapter by Martha McClintock and colleagues on racial health disparities in breast cancer describes the social and intellectual infrastructure necessary to do effective, potentially paradigm-altering research at the biosocial interface. This is the one chapter that seems to exemplify successfully the transdisciplinary intellectual synthesis announced as the volume’s purpose.</p>
<p>Overall, the book should hold interest both for scholars who do research on behavior, health, or inequality at the intersection of the social sciences and genetics, or for sociologists of scientific knowledge interested in the social life of genetics research and the reorganization of the sciences. The chapters are interesting and of fine quality (less so the framing pieces), though much of the material has been articulated elsewhere.</p>
<p>Equally interesting to the substance of its specific arguments is the book’s performance as a conundrum of the current intellectual zeitgeist. We have perhaps moved beyond collections of social scientific articles that denounce deterministic genetics, and those that begin with a set of scientific “facts” to then present commentaries on their social, legal, and ethical implications. Mutual fear and loathing between geneticists and social scientists is out; and there is tremendous interest in working together. There has been great hope (and money) invested in gene association studies. That paradigm is teetering, though scientists have a lot to work through before knowing if it is going to settle upright or topple. What will come next is hotly debated. The present book demonstrates that statements of interest and good will are not enough to open up the new intellectual possibilities. It shows—sometimes explicitly, often inadvertently—that numerous intellectual and social contradictions are standing in the way.</p>
