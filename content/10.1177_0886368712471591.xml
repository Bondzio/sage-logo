<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article is based on a research survey of the use of incentives in Jamaica’s hotel industry. Using theories of motivation to construct a theoretical framework for the study, it is asserted that where organizations are on a quest to improve workforce productivity, their employees need to be motivated to do so. There are different ways of motivating employees to higher performance. Rewards are seen as one motivational strategy that has been used by organizations over the annals of time. The belief is that the right types of rewards should lead to employees performing at desired levels. Employee performance is fundamentally important to success in the hotel industry.</p>
<p>It is accepted that the motivational strategies are influenced by the thinking of an organization’s leadership team as well as the culture of the organization. Additionally, it is argued that there is no “one-size-fits-all” remedy for employee performance improvement, although there are commonly similarities in the types of practices employed by organizations, especially those proven to be effective in a specific industry.</p>
<p>The study focused on the motivational value of short-term incentives (STIs), whether they are financial or otherwise. Understandably, the debate by both academicians and human resource (HR) practitioners is on going about the right types as well as the right mix of workplace motivators. There are acknowledged to be strong arguments on all sides. This article seeks to add to the academic debate by positing that finding the right strategies to improve worker productivity should not be viewed as optional but must be fully appreciated, planned and implemented thoughtfully by employers.</p>

<title>Theories on Incentives and Motivation</title>
<p>The current economic environment necessitates high levels of efficiency, quality and cost-consciousness. One of the current buzz terms is <italic>high-performance work culture</italic>, which suggests optimal productivity in terms of delivery of goods or services. With respect to the term <italic>culture</italic>, Marquez states that company executives attribute their success to a “corporate culture based on using positive strategies to motivate employees and then rewarding and celebrating their victories.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0886368712471591">1</xref></sup> He further opined that a corporate culture “rooted in kindness and positive feedback can make companies winners in the cutthroat world of business.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0886368712471591">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>That argument focuses on the business of workforce motivation and rewards within the right type of organizational culture as a strategy for business success. Specifically with regard to organizations offering services, there is also the belief that “Front line employees . . . often have significant autonomy and responsibility for providing their firm’s services to clients.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0886368712471591">3</xref></sup> It is therefore seen as critical to motivate these workers with the objective of improving organizational performance.</p>
<p>A number of theoretical models have been developed by researchers linking incentives to behavioral outcomes and explaining the psychological mechanisms governing behavior. Kroumova and Lazarova, assert that existing models share important similarities in advocating that “ financial participation . . . is expected to influence employee attitudes (commitment and involvement), and thus have an effect on employee behaviors (performance, cooperation etc).”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0886368712471591">4</xref></sup> At the same time, it is advanced that for these positive behaviors to emerge, certain management practices need to accompany the incentive plan, such as employee empowerment and information sharing, as well as other management practices that clarify and strengthen the link between individual performance and organizational performance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0886368712471591">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>This viewpoint serves as a launching pad for the discussion in this article about the effectiveness of STIs, as well as the policies and processes governing their management. It is important to reiterate that there are strong arguments for and against the use of incentives as motivational tools. Whichever side of the debate one wishes to accept, organizational reward systems have their genesis in motivation.</p>
<p>Richard Henderson differentiates “content” theories from the “process” theories of motivation. The content theories focus on “the needs individuals attempt to satisfy through various kinds of actions or behaviors,” which underscores the basic definition of motivation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0886368712471591">6</xref></sup> This definition sees it as a path through which individuals are seeking to satisfy a need that is possibly induced or brought about by an incentive. Among the notable researchers of the content theories are Abraham Maslow, Frederick Herzberg, Edward Deci and Edward Lawler. Some of the arguments that have been put forward by those researchers are that there are both intrinsic and extrinsic motivators; satisfaction is highly individualistic and situationally based; and incentives must bear a strong relationship to the “work performed, behaviors demonstrated, and results achieved” because, if not, they can become demotivators instead of being positive motivators.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0886368712471591">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The process theories of motivation expand on the content theories and have been accepted by both behavioral science researchers and reward system designers. The acceptance of the process theories lies within their implicit recognition of motivation as a process with identifiable and potentially observable parts. Among the process theories are expectancy theory, operant conditioning and reinforcement theory. The expectancy theory, developed by Victor Vroom, is the most widely accepted of these theories. It attributes an individual’s behavior to the anticipated or expected consequences resulting from a certain action. Two main assumptions underlie the theory: (a) individuals have choices among possible responses and (b) behavior is directed toward pleasure and away from pain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0886368712471591">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another researcher, B. F. Skinner, developed the concept of operant conditioning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0886368712471591">9</xref></sup> This concept sees operant or learned behavior being not only a function of its consequences but also being directed, shaped and changed by circumstances in the environment. The concept was developed further by other researchers into the reinforcement theory, which focuses on “the relationship between the target behavior (e.g., performance) and a motivational tool” (e.g., pay for performance) and is premised on the principles and techniques of organizational behavior modification.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0886368712471591">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Organizational behavior modification is a framework within which employee behaviors are identified, measured and analyzed in terms of their functional consequences, and intervention is developed using the principle of reinforcement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0886368712471591">11</xref></sup> Additionally, Henderson identified the four reinforcement approaches used to achieve desired behavior as positive reinforcement, punishment, negative reinforcement and extinction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0886368712471591">12</xref></sup> STIs are designed to foster positive reinforcement; therefore the other approaches are not pertinent to this discussion. The arguments for and against the use of incentives follow.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0886368712471591">
<title>Arguments Against the Use of Incentives</title>
<p>Strickler, who is among those arguing against incentives, describes the reward–motivation relationship as “subjugation in return for safety” and calls it a bad deal where “workers give up their freedom for money.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0886368712471591">13</xref></sup> It is seen as leading to a deteriorating state of affairs where workers resent their supervisors and do less and less work but expect rewards in return. Rosenzweig, too, thinks that it is highly debatable that a generous employee reward system will yield better business performance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0886368712471591">14</xref></sup> Alfie Kohn, who has been one of the main opponents of organizational reward systems, calls the thinking “pop behaviorism,” which essentially states, “Do this and you will get that.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0886368712471591">15</xref></sup> He sees the practice as based on misleading assumptions and generating behaviors that are “intrinsically objectionable and counter-productive.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0886368712471591">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Kohn contends that there is “uncritical allegiance to the use of rewards” and if one truly gets into the mechanics of reward systems they are not sustainable for a number of reasons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0886368712471591">17</xref></sup> Rewards and punishment “not only lie at the core of faith, but are central to our idea of rationality as well, particularly as it makes its presence felt in economic choices.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0886368712471591">18</xref></sup> This means that rational decision makers by definition will naturally seek what is pleasurable and avoid what is painful or costly.</p>
<p>This reasoning is seen as the coming together of behavioral psychology and orthodox economic theory. Among the common features to both disciplines is the assumption that the “reward-seeking/punishment avoiding” impulse that drives our behavior is necessarily and exclusively dictated by self-interest. The older model of this is the “carrot-and-stick” model of motivation, which is deemed to generate immediate and short-lived responses. Kohn says that most people are raised that way and find it easy to pass it on to others with the hope that it will have a longer term effect on behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0886368712471591">19</xref></sup> Crano, who is also an opponent of the use of incentives, stated that the “apparently obvious connection between incentive and performance is just that—apparent, not real.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0886368712471591">20</xref></sup> He felt that when the necessary assumptions that mediate the effects of financial incentives on behavior are inspected closely, “the difficulty of the transposition becomes clear.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0886368712471591">21</xref></sup> His argument is that while the evidence suggests that monetary incentives appear easy to manipulate and control and their influence can extend across a number of crucial performance dimensions, in actuality it is a far more complex process than meets the eye.</p>
<p>Johnson and Dickinson add another negative aspect to the reward-motivation relationship. Their study focused on employee-of-the-month (EOM) programs, which are expected to “give credit to deserving individuals, boost morale through symbolic rewards and motivate excellence by providing positive examples for other employees to emulate.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0886368712471591">22</xref></sup> They conclude that the EOM incentives are based on results, without consideration for the behaviors that may have produced those results. As such, they contend, employees may be engaging in undesirable behaviors to produce the results, including unethical or illegal behaviors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0886368712471591">23</xref></sup> Behavior described as sabotage was seen as a common temptation and thus an aspect of EOM programs. This means a contender might engage in activities that will worsen the appearance of another employee’s efforts in order to improve his or her own chance of obtaining the desired outcome. This type of behavior is usually done covertly, hence will go undetected and unpunished by supervisors. Therefore, undesirable behavior may be rewarded and desirable behavior may be neglected under the program.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for this is, Johnson and Dickinson believe, the structure of EOM programs, in which the winner takes all. The actual competition for an indivisible prize may be unhealthy and counterproductive for the organization. They therefore believe that the winner-take-all nature of the competition is its worst aspect in that many employees end up not being rewarded despite potentially small differences in performance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0886368712471591">24</xref></sup> Additionally, even if sabotage does not occur, there is a high probability that some desirable behaviors are being unduly neglected.</p>
<p>In concluding those arguments from the opponents, two sets of viewpoints are outlined, which are deemed to be essential for understanding the reward–motivation relationship. Ellingsen and Johnnsen, proposed a model of motivation that is consistent with McGregor’s Theory Y, which sees individuals as innately responsible, honest and creative who will respond positively when treated well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0886368712471591">25</xref></sup> Their view is that the principal–agent relationship is based on reciprocity. This is essentially saying that, being social animals, people’s altruism or spite is influenced by their social esteem and also by their beliefs about their opponents. Using that premise for the motivation–reward relationship, they believe that “the principal’s [employer’s] choice of incentive scheme wholly or partly reveals the principal’s character to the agent [employee], thereby affecting the agent’s esteem for the principal.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0886368712471591">26</xref></sup> Moreover, “the agent’s [employee’s] behavior in response to an incentive reveals the agent’s character to the principal, affecting the principal’s esteem for the agent.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0886368712471591">27</xref></sup> In other words, people care relatively more about the approval of those that they themselves approve of. This viewpoint suggests that ultimately the response to rewards is not really based on the reward or program itself but rather is determined by people’s views about each other.</p>
<p>This focus on individuals’ behavior as social animals, with respect to their response to motivational tools, was also examined by Rynes, Gerhart and Minette.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0886368712471591">28</xref></sup> Their study revealed that people are likely to do or say what is socially acceptable and hence will say one thing but do another in keeping with socially desirable responses. This behavior pattern, they believe, accounts for people downplaying the importance of pay as a motivational tool. Their research indicates that pay is much more important in people’s actual choices and behaviors than it is in their self-reports of what motivates them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0886368712471591">29</xref></sup> This they believe is because social norms view money as a less noble source of motivation than factors such as challenging work or work that makes a contribution to society.</p>
<p>Their review of the research, however, reveals that “no other incentive or motivational technique comes even close to money with respect to its instrumental value.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0886368712471591">30</xref></sup> These innate human tendencies that influence people’s responses to rewards cannot be ignored in a discussion on factors that will stimulate or motivate employees to perform at high levels. In seeking a better understanding of the relationship, Kohn captures it well in saying that “we need to look at the intention of the rewarder, the perception of the rewardee, and various characteristics of the reward itself.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0886368712471591">31</xref></sup> Yet he believes that all rewards, by virtue of being rewards, “are not attempts to influence or persuade or solve problems together, but simply to control.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0886368712471591">32</xref></sup> Therefore, “if a task is undertaken in response to a contingency set up by the rewarder, the person’s initial action in choosing the task is constrained.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0886368712471591">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>These latter arguments about social behavior point to one of the main issues governing rewards: Do they lead to only temporary change or can they bring about lasting change? Kohn critically advocates that “rewards must be judged on whether they lead to lasting change—change that persists when there are no longer any goodies to be gained” and argues that they cannot.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0886368712471591">34</xref></sup> If, therefore, as Kohn contends, the main intention of the rewarder is to find ways and means to control people, the system will not be sustainable, because by its very nature “it is inimical to democracy, critical questioning, and the free exchange of ideas among equal participants.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0886368712471591">35</xref></sup> In spite of these strong arguments against them, hope springs eternal, and there are equally robust arguments in favor of incentives, as outlined in the next section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0886368712471591">
<title>Arguments Supporting the Use of Incentives</title>
<p>According to Henderson, “with ever-increasing employer interest in controlling labour costs, the use of STI schemes or variable pay for employees at all levels in an organization continues to receive greatly increased interest and attention.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0886368712471591">36</xref></sup> STIs is one component that usually form part of a comprehensive compensation package comprising base pay, STIs, long-term incentives, perquisites and benefits. Not all components of the package will purposefully apply across the board to all categories of employees. STIs can be applied to all employees. They are add-ons to base pay within the current operating year. (An expanded definition of STIs is in the Study Design section.) STIs can take a variety of forms, which practically allows any organization to be able to offer one or more of these incentives. The four levels at which STIs may be offered are the following: individual employees; teams of various sizes and configurations; departments, divisions or other types of work units; and organization-wide. Henderson advises that one of the secrets in designing STI schemes is to know when to provide an incentive for individual effort and when to provide incentives for a group.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0886368712471591">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is important to note here that this article seeks to examine the business of incentives not as an end in itself or just for the benefit to individuals, but as an investment based on an expectation of gains that the organization will make as a result of that investment. Boachie-Mensah and Dogbe, in emphasizing the need for strategies to keep up with the competitiveness of the current business environment, state that “the potential to influence employees’ work attitudes and behavior, and subsequently the productivity and effectiveness of the organization, is . . . why many people believe that pay decisions can become a source of competitive advantage.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0886368712471591">38</xref></sup> Wolf and Zwick further state that:<disp-quote>
<p>although changes in the work organization during the last decades are diverse and difficult to summarize by a few key concepts, there has emerged an agreement that employee involvement and monetary incentive systems are important measures in modern personnel management.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0886368712471591">39</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Additionally, Zingheim and Schuster see pay and other rewards as a powerful way to help communicate business directions and values and for linking goals and results to workforce efforts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0886368712471591">40</xref></sup> They see STIs (or variable pay) as “flexible, agile, adaptable, responsive and capable of rewarding a combination of individual and collaborative results, as well as focusing on a host of measures and goals, from financial to strategic.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0886368712471591">41</xref></sup> The above arguments are strengthened by the view that not only do employees consider compensation as a return for services rendered but they further see it as a reflection of their personal worth in terms of skills and abilities, as well as the education and training that they have acquired. Against that background, McCoy’s reminder is useful that the “potential for employees to affect overall performance is the single largest competitive asset that a company has.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0886368712471591">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>Further, on the side of the organization, according to Henderson, if a higher level of competitiveness is to be achieved, the traditional employee mentality of “I’m owed it” has to be changed to “I earned it.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0886368712471591">43</xref></sup> Hence, in linking the importance of compensation to the individual with the organization’s need for competitiveness, it is advanced that a major opportunity available to organizations to bring about this change in attitude is through the use of incentives in pay-for-performance programs. The incentives or rewards must, however, be linked directly to the desired employee behaviors, contributions or results achieved. McCoy sees the change thus: “Instead of having a closed view of competitive equity, incentive compensation presents a business strategy of competition not only for labor but for the customer.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0886368712471591">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Evidently, it is a quid pro quo relationship, which states that when employee effort yields the desired (or better, unexpected) growth and other gains, then those gains will be shared among all those who made it happen. When properly designed and administered, incentive programs are expected to relate to an entirely different set of behavioral factors than do mere wages and salaries. McCoy views behavior-based compensation as a better way of distributing compensation funds, because it is based on performance improvement and is contingent on results.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0886368712471591">45</xref></sup> He adds that changing this approach to compensation changes the employment relationship into a partnership, which brings a new set of psychological elements into play.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0886368712471591">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>These elements are the motivational tools that differentiate incentive compensation from the traditional approaches to compensation. In this approach, behavioral psychology’s motivational tools are combined with incentive compensation’s reward mechanisms. McCoy posited that incentive-based compensation plans, properly designed and implemented, are effective because they tap into the basic desire to participate and contribute that exists in each of us.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0886368712471591">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>Along the lines of the desire of humans to contribute, which again is in keeping with Theory Y, Harari identified a generic performance equation, which states that “performance equals ability × motivation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0886368712471591">48</xref></sup> He added that since the equation is multiplicative, a high level of one factor cannot compensate for a low level of another. The formula was subsequently updated with respect to managers adding the component of accuracy of role perception. This role perception is essentially an individual’s understanding of the specific contribution that he or she is expected to make toward enhancing the work process. The revised formula Harari used is “performance = ability × motivation × accuracy of role perception.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0886368712471591">49</xref></sup> That formula is being extended in this discussion to all employees because of the definition of accuracy of role perception. Essentially, those individuals who possess accuracy of role perception strongly believe that it is their responsibility to plan and act proactively in the face of challenges, and they characteristically<disp-quote>
<p>do not cling to behaviors and decisions that may have led to success in the past but are no longer relevant, do not shirk from challenging sacred cows, do not procrastinate about embarking on paths that may be uncharted, are not squeamish in committing to tenacity and persistence, even in the face of organizational lethargy and resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0886368712471591">50</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What more could an organization desire by way of employee performance? It may be that such individuals are intrinsically (self-) motivated and do not need inducements, but using the old adage that “reward sweetens labor,” it is advanced that there is something to be gained from providing some kind of extrinsic stimulus. In fact, Henderson asserts that to have true motivational value, incentives should be compensation components designed to recognize contributions considered to be beyond the call of normal duty assignments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0886368712471591">51</xref></sup> These contributions require extra intellectual, emotional and physical efforts, and by stimulating the kind of extra effort described, incentives will lead to improved individual and team performance, which in turn results in increased work unit and organizational productivity.</p>
<p>It is also well known that productivity improvements result in increased and improved output, lower costs and higher profitability, among other organizational gains. The underlying partnership philosophy is emphasized when employees share the gains or profits, strengthening the employment bond and even leading to higher levels of trust. Higher levels of trust should then result in higher levels of involvement and commitment. In clear opposition to Kohn’s views, Henderson states that the message sent by the incentives is “Your contribution is essential to our success and, and here is a thank you from the organization.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0886368712471591">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is further advocated that group incentives can yield even greater advantages by generating positive attitudes such as job satisfaction, commitment and team spirit if employees value the expected incentive reward and believe that they can attain it, if they perceive the incentive plan as fair and if they are involved in decision making.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0886368712471591">53</xref></sup> Henderson strongly supports organization-wide incentives, describing them as “possibly the easiest kind of incentive program to implement.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0886368712471591">54</xref></sup> The philosophy underlying that type of incentive plan is that profit sharing and cost reduction are opportunities and should be the responsibility of every member of the organization. Group incentives give sections of, or better yet the entire workforce, a chance to share the attendant performance-related gains with the employer.</p>
<p>Finally, Kroumova and Lazarova see the use of incentives as part and parcel of a suite of strategic HR practices. By aligning HR practices, organizations can create mutually reinforcing conditions that will support employee motivation and concurrent skill acquisition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0886368712471591">55</xref></sup> They identified “employee voice,” information sharing and training as complementary to company-wide incentives. Ostensibly, this suggests that the incentives by themselves will not likely have the potential impact on performance. They see the need for complementary practices through “co-occurrence and reinforcement.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0886368712471591">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>This means that a number of mutually reinforcing processes must be actioned at the same time (which include the use of STIs) to yield the desired productivity outcome(s).</p>

<title>Study Design</title>
<p>The study’s primary objective was to identify the types of incentives that exist in Jamaica’s hotel industry and to ascertain the linkages, if any, between STIs and levels of employee motivation, with a view to identifying appropriate organizational practices that can stimulate higher levels of productivity. The study employed a mixed-method research of both quantitative and qualitative data collection that used two survey instruments and interviews with senior hotel and tourism officials. A mix of measures and a summary of attitudes and opinions were also used in an inductive way to influence theory with respect to the Jamaican situation.</p>
<p>In the study, over 900 employees of all categories were surveyed at 50 hotel properties in Jamaica. Interviews were conducted with property owners, managers and tourism officials to gain a working understanding of the nature of the industry, especially with regard to the main competitiveness “ingredients.” Hotels of different sizes and product category across the island were included in the survey to ensure that (a) as many of the incentive systems currently in use were examined and (b) a wide cross section of the workforce was covered. The 50 hotel properties that participated in the survey were categorized as small, medium, large and extra large as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886368712471591">Table 1.</xref><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0886368712471591">57</xref></sup></p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886368712471591">Table 1</xref> also shows the breakdown of the participation level of each category of hotel against the total number of employees, plus the number of employees who were surveyed per segment. The hotel participation level was seen to be reflective of the property size makeup of the country’s hotel industry. The basic criterion for participants was that they should be employed by one of the participating hotels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0886368712471591">58</xref></sup> They were then randomly selected on their properties based on their availability to participate in the exercise. This approach produced an overall 88.6% employee response rate or 907 respondents. From the industry target population of approximately 35,000 employees, the total employee response of 907 to the survey yielded a 3% to 4% margin of error, at the 95% confidence interval.</p>
<p>Additionally, using the information provided by the hotels on their organization structures and qualifications required for the various job levels, all the positions stated as being held by the employees at the various hotels were collapsed into 10 job categories. These categories are senior manager/executive, managerial, professional, supervisory, clerical administrative, operational (front of the house and heart of the house), ancillary, casual temporary, contractor and consultant. The six skill groupings that were used to determine the skills mix within the industry were the following: (a) Higher Professional/Executive, (b) Lower Professional/Managerial, (c) Highly skilled, (d) Skilled, (e) Semiskilled and (f) Unskilled. The frequency of responses regarding gender showed 61% female versus 39% male.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0886368712471591">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is important to mention that the study did not seek to ascertain whether employees were individually skilled enough to perform their jobs properly, nor was the connection between skills and motivation levels examined. That would require examination of the relevant indicators and variables as a specific exercise and was deemed beyond the scope of the study.</p>
<p>The focus of this study is employer determined and paid, job-related incentives awarded to individual employees, or collectively to employee groups or to an organization’s entire workforce, based on performance targets. These targets or goals would either be set by prevailing organizational policy/practice or be specific to a particular program. Broadly defined, STIs include the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0886368712471591" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Pay for additional units produced or work done</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Individual-based bonuses and awards, for example, suggestion plans, attendance, special achievement and contest awards</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Organization-wide STIs, for example, productivity gain–sharing programs, profit-sharing plans</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As stated earlier the incentives listed above may be applied to all categories of employees. It is worth mentioning that some employers included premiums and differentials in their incentive schemes as “sweetners” to address extended or unorthodox hours of work, or peculiar circumstances related to some jobs. The latter are treated separately from overtime and holiday compensation stipulated by law.</p>
<p>Following on the above, the variables being examined are (a) STI schemes, (b) employee motivation and (c) productivity (performance). The independent variables are (a) and (b), and the dependent variable is (c). This article seeks to establish whether or not there is a relationship in the Jamaica hotel industry among (a), (b) and (c) and the direction of that relationship. Of necessity and relatedly, selected intrinsic motivators and indicators of job satisfaction, as well as some industry-specific measures of performance (service quality), were also examined. As indicated in the theoretical overview, elements of the workplace environment other than compensation must be considered if levels of motivation are examined. The following hypothesis is being used:</p>
<list id="list2-0886368712471591" list-type="simple">

<title>Study Results</title>
<p>Key findings of the study would be (a) the existence of STIs in the organization and (b) establishing a link between those incentives and motivation and between incentive-induced motivation and productivity. Other findings about performance-enhancing organizational elements such as communication, as well as employees’ levels of job satisfaction, were also useful.</p>
<p>The survey data revealed that 91.7% of the employees surveyed had received an incentive from either their current or their previous employer. The data also showed that the highest percentage, 36.9%, of employees fell in the 1 to 3 years of service category, followed by the under-12 months category with 23.6%, which means that some were not at their current place of work long enough to receive an incentive there. However, having received an incentive elsewhere meant that they could answer the survey questions.</p>
<p>Among the incentives that the respondents reported they received were tips from guests, gratuity payments from the company, productivity payments, EOM/quarter/year awards, profit sharing, attendance bonuses and most improved department award. Additionally, some listed health benefits, travelling allowances and educational benefits, which are not incentives by definition. In response to the question about the importance of those incentives, 97.7% of the employees responded (yes vs. no) that receiving incentives is important to them. The level of importance was also examined; this found 75.1% of respondents saying that receiving incentives is very important, with 20.6% saying that incentives are important. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886368712471591">Table 2</xref> shows the responses to the question on why receiving incentives is important.</p>

<p>The overall results show that STIs are highly valued by the employees. It is important to mention here that the hotel industry is usually characterized as a low-paying industry, because the majority of the jobs do not require a high skill level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0886368712471591">60</xref></sup> From the skills groupings used, the survey showed that the largest group of employees, 35.4%, falls in the semiskilled group, followed by the skilled group, which comprised 30.8% of the workforce. The unskilled group was 2.6%, to yield a combined total of 68.8% of the workforce requiring basic technical skills and/or education up to the secondary level.</p>
<p>The employee and hotel surveys also sought to examine the compensation issue in general. The answers to two of the employee questions are central to the findings. One result is that 78% of the respondents indicated that they would leave the hotel industry for better pay. The employees also indicated a number of other reasons, apart from better pay, for being on the constant look out for new job opportunities. Among these are the following: for personal development or career advancement opportunities, for example, to travel the world (42.3%); shorter working hours (18%); better working relationships (13%) and better working conditions (12.5%). Additionally, the responses indicated that the two main attractions that would encourage them to remain in the industry are the love of the hospitality industry (32.2%) and the pursuit of a career path (33.6%). Another significant result is that from the seven reasons offered (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886368712471591">Table 3</xref>), 40.2 % of respondents indicated that, in their opinion, the most significant factor toward improving productivity in their industry is better compensation and benefits.</p>

<p>These responses validate the arguments presented in the literature review about individuals’ strong feelings about their level of compensation. Concomitantly, in the interviews, several owners and members of management as well as tourism officials cited the constant departure of their trained workers as one of the major employment challenges facing them. The main sources of competition they reported are the overseas hotels and cruise lines.</p>
<p>In seeking to link the variables incentives, motivation and productivity, the employees’ responses to the question “In terms of work effort, having received an incentive how motivated were you to work harder?” is significant. The responses showed that 64.4% were very motivated, 30.9 % motivated and 4.7% were not motivated at all, from an overall 91.3% response rate. This would suggest that a prima facie case could be made that the hypothesis has been proven. Furthermore, 56.6% of the employees responded that they felt that the organization appreciates their accomplishments on the job. However, in seeking to incorporate the matter of reinforcement, an interesting result is that whereas 66.1% of the respondents receive regular feedback from their immediate supervisor, 57.5% responded that their supervisor’s rating of their performance did not in any way influence the incentive they received.</p>
<p>Additionally, 93% of the employees responded that they like their current job for a variety of reasons, while 95% indicated that they like their current employer. With regard to the latter, the respondents were given the reasons listed below to choose from in a close-ended question:</p>
<list id="list3-0886368712471591" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>The good reputation of the company</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The competitive wages paid</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The good management–worker relationship</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The opportunities for personal growth and development</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The good relationship among the workers</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The types of incentives paid</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The beauty and location of the property</p></list-item></list>
<p>The responses showed the good reputation of the company, the opportunities for personal growth and development and the good relationship among the workers as the main reasons for liking their place of employment. However, when asked about why the place of employment is not liked, of those who do not like it, 54.1% indicated that the cause is the poor worker–management relationship. This response could be linked with the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886368712471591">Table 3</xref>, which shows 16.5% and 17.5% (combined 34%) of employees citing better communication and labor/management relations, respectively, as key ingredients toward improving productivity levels.</p>
<p>Responses to the hotel survey were equally insightful. Of the respondents, 83.8% indicated that their organization uses incentive scheme(s) in an effort to increase employee output, with 88.9% indicating that the incentives are over and above basic wages or salaries. When asked to list the incentives offered, a plethora of incentives (mainly STIs), allowances and benefits were named, the latter indicating a lack of understanding by some hotels of the components of a compensation package. Their response to the categories of employees covered under the incentive schemes (in indicating that all levels of employees received incentive payments) corresponded with that of the employees.</p>
<p>The responses from both hoteliers and employees showed that the main incentive called “gratuity” (which is of course very short term), paid along with wages and salaries, is based on a government concession to the industry and is not tied to operational targets. For the other STIs, the hotels indicated the use of various payment intervals—daily, weekly, fortnightly, monthly, quarterly and annually. With regard to recognition programs, 52% of the hotels reported that they have an EOM program. From the list of schemes provided and some of the measurement methods used, it was evident that some of the STI schemes used measures that allowed the hotels to see the immediate impact on service quality.</p>
<p>The inadequate understanding of incentives, however, was also evident in the response to the question about the method(s) used to determine rewards, which included years of service, competence, qualifications and experience. In seeking to ascertain that appropriate measures are being used, in response to a closed survey question the hotels indicated that fewer guest complaints, higher rates of repeat guests, less breakage, pilferage, waste and less absenteeism are key productivity measures. Of note is the general views by hoteliers that they believed their employees were handsomely rewarded when incentives and benefits were added to the compensation package. However, some of the HR personnel lamented that they detected an entitlement and/or a “taken-for-granted” attitude by their workforce toward the incentives. There are therefore cases where some schemes were discontinued because it was felt that they were making no impact.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0886368712471591">61</xref></sup> In general, the hoteliers felt that their efforts should go a fair way in encouraging their staff to work harder and also remain with the organization. They were therefore bewildered about their staff choosing to leave at the first window of opportunity, as they often experienced. Noteworthy too, in the hotel survey, in response to an open-ended question about the most significant factor toward improving employee productivity in the industry, the highest percentage of responses (30.2%) pointed to better compensation, followed by good working environment and training (each at 13.2%).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0886368712471591">62</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section7-0886368712471591" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This section opens with a critical question in keeping with the title of the article: When does an organization adopt innovative HR practices that include strategic compensation? Is it to get out of a crisis, to keep pace with the competition, to get ahead of competition or just because it is in vogue? One proposition, which hopefully people are beginning to realize, is that pay in the current climate of organizational change, must be viewed as an investment that is closely linked to the success of the business, and therefore should play a much more significant role than in the past.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0886368712471591">63</xref></sup> Organization incentives are important because many tasks are “accomplished more effectively and quickly through the impetus generated by incentives.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0886368712471591">64</xref></sup> However, when the terms <italic>motivation</italic> and <italic>incentive</italic> are used synonymously (with the relationship between these two powerful compensation elements being undervalued), both terms are misconstrued. In that scenario, motivation is trivialized, and as a consequence the demands placed on incentives may be out of sync with organizational reality.</p>
<p>Incentives must be used to build on employees’ existing motivation, which drives them to stay employed and more so to succeed. Research results are yet to identify any motivational interventions that work better than performance-contingent pay for enticing people to achieve higher performance levels. Furthermore, Rynes et al. assert that the broad usefulness of money as well as its many symbolic meanings suggest that far from being a low-order motivator, pay can assist in obtaining virtually any level on Maslow’s motivational hierarchy, including social esteem and self-actualization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0886368712471591">65</xref></sup> Pay can be regarded as a proxy of self-worth, and therefore a force as powerful as pay should not be trivialized.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0886368712471591">66</xref></sup> The key is to strengthen the link between “performance and rewards which can lead to increased feelings of empowerment by reinforcing feelings of competence . . .”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0886368712471591">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>Lamentably, according to Zingheim and Schuster, the potential positive value from variable pay is only partially being realized.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0886368712471591">68</xref></sup> What is even worse is that variable pay is so common that it sometimes becomes an HR project, with only the technical aspects of the pay design being emphasized, rather than being a message from the leadership team about the business importance of variable pay and business-aligned goals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0886368712471591">69</xref></sup> Presumably, the underutilization or misuse of STIs has to do with wrong or inadequate compensation philosophies or policies that ignore the fact that STIs are not gifts but rather require re-earning and attention to the goals for the next performance cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0886368712471591">70</xref></sup> By its very nature, variable pay is not guaranteed, although organizations have allowed such programs to become entitlement, like base pay, as was lamented by some of the hotel executives in the survey.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0886368712471591">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>Key to the purposeful continuation of the incentive program is that communication does not stop with the rollout of the plan(s) but requires “on-going discussions about progress on variable pay goals and expands into education about the business . . . to stimulate everyone’s involvement in the business.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0886368712471591">72</xref></sup> Gebauer and Lowman assert that employees are more inclined to give discretionary effort when “purpose and meaning infuse their day-to-day activities and long-term agendas making them active participants in the mission, not just passive players following orders.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0886368712471591">73</xref></sup> If you fail as a company, they believe, “to understand what drives employees’ behavior, what makes people tick and what ticks them off, then you will fail to achieve the maximum return on investment in your people.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0886368712471591">74</xref></sup> The disconnect between traditional compensation practices and philosophies with what is required in this highly competitive globalized environment is perhaps best summed up by Kelly, who explained that in the past, “material demands and entrepreneurial instincts of workers have been ignored or suppressed with organizations expecting workers to subordinate individual self-interest to organizational goals.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0886368712471591">75</xref></sup> Companies must become adept at profiting “synergistically with the individual rather than at the worker’s expense.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0886368712471591">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>Short-term incentives or variable pay has been a feature of employee compensation for decades, but as shown in the Theories section, it has earned some justifiably harsh critics for the way these schemes have been executed. Wilson rightly blames company leadership for their schemes’ failings by concluding that “executives are attracted to incentive pay plans because they offer a method to reduce the fixed costs of compensation and make pay more variable.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0886368712471591">77</xref></sup> While this may serve the executives’ interest in managing costs and is often a benefit of such programs, the philosophy may inherently establish a win–lose framework for the plan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0886368712471591">78</xref></sup> As noted earlier in the article, the incentive plan needs to stimulate new actions by people in order to make the organization more competitive. This approach should yield a genuine win–win arrangement in which the company makes competitive gains and the employees not only benefit financially but also feel more appreciated. Organizations should seek to “create reinforcers by which people learn, continue to learn, and strengthen the capabilities of the organization to meet ever-changing and challenging external situations.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0886368712471591">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the matter of the types of rewards to use in order to ensure that they are motivational, Lawler cautions that a reward system that does not offer something of significant value is unlikely to be effective, even though measures are in place.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0886368712471591">80</xref></sup> This means the designers of these programs must be cognizant of both the intrinsic and extrinsic motivational elements because they are important to determining how important a reward will be. For example, research shows that rewards that are in the public domain tend to be valued much more than those that are not.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0886368712471591">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, generally speaking, according to expectancy theory, people value amounts of money in proportion to the amount that they and others receive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0886368712471591">82</xref></sup> Expectancy theory does not argue that individuals are motivated only by extrinsic rewards.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0886368712471591">83</xref></sup> To the contrary, it argues that individuals may reward themselves for certain kinds of performance because they feel they have accomplished something that is worthwhile, have achieved a personal goal, have learned a new skill or were intellectually stimulated and excited. Thus, in the framework of expectancy theory, individuals can be motivated both by organizationally given rewards and by intrinsic rewards they give to themselves. Importantly, it does not see a cancellation or interference effect between the two kinds of rewards. Rather, it argues that “the greatest amount of motivation is present when individuals are doing tasks that are intrinsically rewarding to them, when they perform them well, and which at the same time provide important financial and recognition rewards for their performance.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0886368712471591">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is therefore asserted that the views of Kohn and other opponents of incentive plans essentially highlight bad management practices (which include the poor design of STI schemes). Clearly, the forces of globalization plus the new type of knowledge worker require constant review of all processes used to drive employee performance, chief among them compensation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0886368712471591">85</xref></sup> However, research on the relationship between pay-for-performance programs, employee motivation and organizational productivity shows that pay-for-performance programs have little positive effect when there is little trust in the organization and/or organizational communication is inadequate, among other deficiencies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0886368712471591">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>Where problems such as inadequate communication, poor working relationships and absence of good values exist, incentive schemes cannot be used as a panacea for these organizational ills. Additionally, if a worker is incompetent or insufficiently trained or equipped, variable pay will only make a bad situation worse. In fact, those scenarios will almost guarantee that the goals will not be attained and the scheme will have a demotivating effect, giving fodder to the critics of these schemes.</p>
<p>Expectancy theory places great emphasis on the importance of goals. Furthermore, research shows that when individuals commit themselves to a goal, they become highly motivated to achieve it because their self-esteem and self-worth get tied to accomplishing that goal. Of course, it is expected that individuals may also be motivated to achieve a goal because a financial reward is tied to it. The connection between performance and reward is often called the “line of sight.” Lawler suggested that perhaps a better term would be <italic>line of influence</italic>, because it refers to the fact that in order to be motivated in an organizational setting, people must see how their behavior influences a performance measure, which in turn drives the allocation of a reward.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0886368712471591">87</xref></sup> Expectancy theory also argues that if valued rewards are clearly seen as being tied to a particular performance behavior, the organization is likely to get more of that behavior. Unsaid but also important to remember is that if a particular behavior is not rewarded, the organization will get less of that behavior.</p>
<p>Deming lamented that that whereas people are born with intrinsic motivation, self-esteem, dignity and an eagerness to learn, “lousy pay and performance management strategies, as well as bad supervision and bureaucratic administrative practices, crushes those traits by constantly judging people and replacing those traits with extrinsic motivation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0886368712471591">88</xref></sup> It is therefore advanced that a well-designed compensation program that is fully and properly aligned with an organization’s values and culture can do wonders for self-esteem and an eagerness to learn, not to mention performance.</p>
<p>STIs can be used effectively as motivators particularly in times of organization transformation to hasten acceptance of and commitment to change. However, the proviso is that STIs cannot define, drive or lead change. Neither can STIs establish values or replace effective leadership. It is therefore critical that those involved in the development of pay strategies also understand how work cultures are reengineered or transformed, and how compensation can effectively be linked to these change processes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0886368712471591">89</xref></sup></p>
<p>To conclude this section, the matter of empowerment that has been alluded to is reemphasized. “Strengthening the link between individual performance and rewards can lead to increased feelings of empowerment by reinforcing feelings of competence and providing individuals with incentives for participating in and affecting decision-making processes at work.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0886368712471591">90</xref></sup> This concept of empowerment has even provided some clarity on the difference between individual versus organization-based incentives. Lawler believes that “whereas group rewards are effective they do not always allow employees to clearly see the link between their actions, performance at higher levels and the subsequent reward,” hence the advantage of individual STIs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0886368712471591">91</xref></sup> The matter of empowerment is also strongly advocated by Gebauer and Lowman, who have identified the five essential steps for an employer to engage their employees as knowing, growing, inspiring, involving and rewarding them, without which true workforce engagement will not exist.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0886368712471591">92</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Having weighed the pros and cons of using STIs, the conclusion is that their use can be a robust organizational strategy for motivating or stimulating higher levels of employee productivity. This conclusion is hinged on the assumption that pay (money) is important to individuals even when they pretend that this may not be the case. Further extrinsic motivators are practical and meaningful and are just as important perhaps sometimes more important than intrinsic motivators. It is also evident that incentives may be used to accomplish a number of things simultaneously, such as reducing overall compensation costs, linking employees’ personal goals to organizational goals and strategies in a win–win partnership, communicating good values of profit and gain sharing and allowing organizations to link two critical organizational elements that impinge heavily on competitiveness—transformation and compensation. However, the use of STIs as an end in themselves will not be effective for a number of reasons if used as a stand-alone policy. Among the reasons is that intrinsic motivators must never be ignored. There must also be careful design, execution and ongoing evaluation of incentive plans by knowledgeable (competent), perceptive and forward-thinking persons to minimize the possible negative aspects of these plans, such as sabotage. Summarily, best described as “co-occurrence and reinforcement,” as explained earlier, it is clear that the incentive plans are most effective when adopted as an element of an integrated strategy of mutually reinforcing HR practices, buttressed by strong organization leadership and robust management practices. An essential ingredient that cannot be overemphasized is ongoing communication. Without the right support systems, the STI strategy will lack momentum and may even have a demotivating effect.</p>
