<abstract>
<p>This essay aims to shed light on the role of radio in state territorial conflicts during the interwar era, a topic that has hardly received serious attention from scholars. Its focus is on the use of radio in the German-Polish contest over the Upper Silesian borderland. State actors of both countries built radio stations at the border with the explicit aim of integrating the largely culturally-mixed and ‘nationally indifferent’ population of locals on both sides of the borderland into – and thereby to secure the whole region for – their nation. A ‘radio war’ thus erupted by 1927, as the two sides competed against one another in this effort, and it lasted to the very end of the interwar era. This essay focuses its analysis on the programmes of the Polish Radio Katowice as they were broadcast over and received in German Upper Silesia. It demonstrates that contrary to the views of Polish nationalists, the popularity of this radio station stemmed not so much from widespread Polish consciousness as the quality of the programmes and popularity of the performers.</p>

<p>On 15 November 1925 German local administrators and national ministers gathered for the ceremonial opening of the broadcast relay station in Gleiwitz, located about nine miles from the Polish border in the region of Upper Silesia. According to their statements, this contraption was to be a ‘fantastic means’ to help the eastern area of Upper Silesia ceded to Poland in 1922 ‘to integrate itself ever more with its [German] motherland’, since ‘Upper Silesia can only live as one whole with and through Germany’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0265691413478095">1</xref></sup> Because Gleiwitz would strengthen the broadcast signal of the main station of Silesia, Radio Breslau, and thus allow German irredentist propaganda to be heard all over a strongly Germanophile Polish Silesia, the Poles took to building their own radio station some six miles away from the border. In 1927, the Polish Radio Katowice (PRK) opened with a broadcasting signal that was eight times stronger than that of the Gleiwitz relay station. Surrounded by provincial government and clerical elites, during the inaugural celebration in December, the Silesian voivode (governor) Micha<italic>ł</italic> Grażyński ‘emphasized that the new and powerful station will be the best connector between Poland and the thousands of Poles, who, unfortunately, were left behind the border cordon’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0265691413478095">2</xref></sup> The German media regarded the opening of a radio station of such strength and so close to the contested border as a provocation and declared that the Poles had launched a ‘radio war’ against Germany.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0265691413478095">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this article, my aim is to shed light on the role of radio in the contestation of borderlands during the interwar era. Far from merely serving as just another means to echo the propaganda otherwise disseminated in print, this technological novelty shaped the nature of how nation-states contested and nationalized borderlands. As I intend to demonstrate, radio became a critical instrument through which political actors representing national interests exerted their cultural and political influence upon their neighbouring nation’s borderlands to which they had claims. As such, this media technology marked an important catalyst of what Rogers Brubaker referred to as ‘external homeland nationalism’, or the state policy of maintaining formal ties with communities of ‘ethnic kin’ residing in neighbouring nations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0265691413478095">4</xref></sup> At the same time, radio also shaped the character of this phenomenon in several ways. In one respect, it strengthened the influence and increased the role of political actors at the regional level in international affairs. In another, it gave the nation-state a powerful means to support the irredentist politics of its own ethnic minority organizations within the borders of the neighbouring nation, as well as to interfere with and impede the latter’s efforts to nationally integrate its own borderlands. Thus, all the more on account of this new media, the nationalizing work of the nation-state within its own borderlands was transformed from a ‘domestic affair’ into an inherently transnational contest. Ordinary borderland residents were not just bystanders but active agents in these nation-state contests over borderlands. In provinces such as Upper Silesia, where strong regional rootedness and relative indifference to the nation was widespread, the German-Polish ‘radio war’ to some extent helped locals resist each nation-state’s forceful policies of national homogenization and centralization. As I will demonstrate in the last section here, the Polish Radio Katowice’s programming aimed at countering Nazi ‘Germanization’ policies gave locals (native Upper Silesians) a seldom-found alternative discourse to the official one that the regime imposed on them.</p>
<p>In stark contrast to the sizeable research on interwar territorial strife in Central Europe, the role of radio in these heated international conflicts has been largely neglected in scholarship. Scholars of Polish-German relations have treated the role of this media only in brief overview, and with regard to their attention to the content of radio programmes, have not looked beyond lectures and readings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0265691413478095">5</xref></sup> One of my goals in this article is to shed light on the multifarious nature of irredentist radio propaganda. Borderland radio stations aimed not only to ‘awaken’ national spirits by regurgitating printed propaganda through another medium, but also strove to be entertaining. To lure audiences on the neighbouring nation’s side of the border, they offered music, theatre, comedy and performances by talented entertainers. As I demonstrate below, the main reason for the PRK’s popularity on the German side of the border was not the widespread appeal of Polish nationalism, but rather the wit, charm and popularity of one leading radio figure, Stanis<italic>ł</italic>aw Ligoń. Since the relevant radio stations left few records of the content of their programmes, I am forced to draw on the press, radio periodicals and the records left behind by the state agents (police, local government, consulates) of the observing competing nation. Even these records do not allow me to give equal attention to the work and impacts of both the German and Polish radio stations, but have forced me – after offering a broad overview in the first section of this essay – to focus on the role of the PRK in German Upper Silesia, first before 1933 and then during the Nazi era and the last years before World War II. For the sake of simplicity, I refer to the German part of the borderland as the Provinz (after Provinz Oberschlesien) and the Polish part as the Voivodeship (after Województwo Śląsk).</p>
<sec id="sec1-0265691413478095"><title>A Struggle for the Soul</title>
<p>‘The Germans were merely getting a taste of their own medicine.’ They had forged a ‘radio powder keg’ that only ‘naturally exploded for the first time in Poland’. Such was the response of one Polish newspaper in the Provinz to charges by the German media that Poland was responsible for beginning the ‘radio war’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0265691413478095">6</xref></sup> In actuality, a transnational culture of building radio stations at or near border areas, and often gearing them in a ‘struggle for the soul’ of the residents living on both sides of the border there, had developed by the late 1920s. In Germany, such stations were constructed in Aachen, Breslau (Wroc<italic>ł</italic>aw), Freiburg, Flensburg, Königsberg (Kaliningrad), Görlitz (Zgorzelec), and Kiel; in Poland they broadcast from Lwów (Lviv), Wilno (Vilnus), Cracow, Łuck (Lutsk) and Łódz.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0265691413478095">7</xref></sup> While also a part of this trend, Upper Silesian radio stations were lent even greater urgency due to the region’s economic value. Neither Germany nor Poland were satisfied with the Allied partition of the region in 1922 (with the Germans particularly vocal in rejecting their pre-war borderland), and calls for the return of the other part of the border were widespread in the government and society of both countries. The airwaves came to be a suitable forum for this irredentism.</p>
<p>The establishment of the two radio stations at the Upper Silesian border turned the bilateral territorial conflict into a fight over broadcasting air space. The PRK initiated the contest on the day it opened, transmitting its signal at 12 kilowatts, far greater than the 0.7 kw of the Gleiwitz relay station (and 10 kw of Radio Breslau). Pressured by official complaints that Poland had already ‘won the radio war’, in 1928 the <italic>Reich-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft</italic> increased the Gleiwitz station’s strength to one roughly matching that of its Polish contender.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0265691413478095">8</xref></sup> Soon after coming to power, the Nazis initiated their offensive in this contest, first raising the strength of Radio Breslau to 100 kw in 1934, and opening up a new and improved relay station in Gleiwitz the following year – the site of the infamous regime-staged ‘provocation’ four years later.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0265691413478095">9</xref></sup> The nationalist governor of the Voivodeship and main inspiration behind the PRK, Micha<italic>ł</italic> Grażyński, followed suit, opening a technologically revolutionary headquarters for Katowice’s station in 1936, and increasing its signal strength from 12 to 50 kw just two months before the outbreak of World War II.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0265691413478095">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In general, Germany had a significantly higher volume of radio owners than did Poland, and this was also the case for the Provinz in comparison to the Voivodeship. While there were over 16,600 individuals with radio sets in the German part of the borderland in the fall of 1927, there were only close to 1550 counterparts in the other part in early 1928. While the size of this group was close to 40 per cent of the population in the Provinz by July of 1939, it was only 9 per cent of that of the Voivodeship at the time. Nevertheless, Poles in the Voivodeship were far more likely to own radios than those in other parts of Poland, while in comparison to the rest of Germany, radio ownership in the Provinz was relatively sparse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0265691413478095">11</xref></sup> Such statistics nonetheless fail to accurately measure the number of actual listeners, which was likely to be much greater on each side, since listening to the radio was a group activity. State officials on each side were proud of the exponentially growing radio audiences, though of course in actuality they had no control over which national radio stations their citizens chose to listen to.</p>
<p>Certainly the major point of contention of the ‘radio war’ was the content aired in German and Polish programmes. Radio Breslau, the main broadcaster of the programmes delivered via the Gleiwitz relay station, and the PRK, which was its own broadcasting unit, occasionally served as venues of blatant irredentist and nationalist propaganda aimed against the neighbouring nation. For example, by 1928, these stations started to give coverage to the rallies commemorating the anniversary of the Upper Silesian plebiscite (21 March, observed mainly in Germany) and of the third Silesian uprising (3 May, commemorated mainly in Poland), which served as a major transnational forum for such provocative discourses. Otherwise, news reports and educational programmes on the historical, ethnographic and sociological character of Upper Silesia and larger ‘German East’ and ‘Polish Western Territories’ were often saturated with irredentist ideology. Such programmes promoted well-known malicious images of the ‘Germans/Poles’ – such as the German ‘carrier of culture’ (to the east) myth, and the Polish myth of centuries of struggle against German oppression. They also presented a variety of scholarly narratives of the contested borderland as inherently tied to Germany/Poland. The dissemination of irredentist propaganda by both radio stations drove the heads of the <italic>Reich-Rundfunkgesellschaft</italic> and the <italic>Polskie Radio</italic> to sign several agreements to limit such ‘politically sensitive’ programming. These were signed in October 1927, March of 1931, and as part of the German-Polish Nonaggression Pact on 10 November 1934.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0265691413478095">12</xref></sup> On the German side of the border, various irredentist borderland groups such as the United Societies of Upper Silesian Homeland (<italic>Heimat</italic>) Patriots (<italic>Die Vereinigte Verbände heimattreuer Oberschlesier</italic>, VVHO) likewise exerted their influence on radio programmes. Led by the eminent regional folklorist and nationalist, Karl Sczodrok, another group that collaborated with the first, the Union for Upper Silesian Heimat Studies (<italic>Vereinigung der oberschlesischen Heimatkunde</italic>) promoted the history and culture of this borderland in a Prussian and German, but not a Polish, guise. According to Adelheid von Saldern, Radio Breslau’s broadcasts of this official regionalism was part of a larger ‘Volk and Heimat’ tradition booming in the German media by the late 1920s, which advocated the cultivation of age-old regional, local and populist ways in reaction to commercialized pop-culture and ‘Americanization’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0265691413478095">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Upper Silesia the German ‘Volk und Heimat' tradition and its Polish equivalent of ‘<italic>regionalizm</italic>' (regionalism) served yet another critical common function: they competed against one another in an effort to nationalize a largely bilingual, culturally mixed, and ‘nationally indifferent’ – or rather, primarily regionally-oriented population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0265691413478095">14</xref></sup> Since each side shared this agenda, in this borderland even seemingly non-political content that was commonly broadcasted over the radio anywhere in the world, such as music, theatre, and literature readings, became an object of political contention. German and Polish state agents referred to high cultural and educational programming as ‘cultural propaganda’ and considered its purpose to be inherently irredentist: to persuade borderland residents to favour one nation at the cost of the other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0265691413478095">15</xref></sup> The PRK seemed to be enjoying rapid success in doing this to Poland’s advantage, as we shall see below.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0265691413478095"><title>Nationalizing with Humour</title>
<p>In December 1927 Stanis<italic>ł</italic>aw Ligoń (1879–1954) made his on-air debut at the Polskie Radio Katowice. He was already a well-known figure on account of his activism for the Polish national camp during the plebiscite struggle in Upper Silesia of 1920–1921. At that time, he edited the popular satirical, cartoon-filled newspaper, <italic>Kocynder</italic> (Lazy Bones) using the pen name, ‘Karlik’, and authored many of the pro-Polish propaganda posters, which remain perhaps the most popular remnant of the plebiscite struggle today.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0265691413478095">16</xref></sup> Born into a nationally-conscious Polish family in the city of Königshütte (Chorzów), which became part of the Voivodeship after 1922, he went on to study in Berlin, and was known for his talents as a painter, playwright, Polish nationalist activist, and politician, a role in which he represented the pro-Grażyński (Silesian Sanacja) party. But his fame arose from his career as a radio broadcaster.
<fig id="fig1-0265691413478095" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Stanisław ‘Karlik’ Ligoń (second from right in the front row) during a radio broadcast, 1938. Courtesy of Andrzej Sas-Jaworski.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0265691413478095-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Next to his personal talent as an entertainer, his particular appeal stemmed from his native Upper Silesian origins, which allowed him to appreciate the local mentality, the predominant Slavophone dialect (so-called <italic>Wasserpolnisch</italic>), and, most importantly, the regional humour. These attributes allowed Ligoń to tap into many of the cultural features that made Upper Silesia into a region-wide community, which transcended the arbitrarily-drawn German-Polish border. He was thereby able to attract listeners from east of Katowice in Poland all the way to the outskirts of Breslau in Germany.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0265691413478095">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Grażyński made good use of Ligoń and his multiple talents for his own irredentist agenda. In addition to the PRK, Ligoń was also active in other organizations and institutions of ‘<italic>regionalizm</italic>’, including the Silesian Museum, Silesian Institute (for the social sciences), and the Defense Union of the Western Borderlands (<italic>Związek Obrony Kresów Zachodnich</italic>, ZOKZ). On the radio, Ligoń served to promote this official Polish-Silesianism by often speaking in a ‘<italic>Wasserpolnisch</italic>’ dialect deliberately ‘cleansed’ of many of its German words and Germanisms so as to make it ‘of little difference from high-national Polish’. One of the gems of ‘<italic>regionalizm</italic>’, this standardized regional linguistic form was called the ‘<italic>gwara Śląska</italic>’, or Silesian dialect, and depicted as a mere regional variant of high Polish.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0265691413478095">18</xref></sup> Even as he spoke it with ‘Polonized’ inflections, Ligoń was widely understood across the region. Indeed, his use of the dialect marked one of the factors that gave him the kind of appeal across Upper Silesia that hardly any other radio speaker enjoyed.</p>
<p>Ligoń’s promotion of a distinct ‘Silesian humour’ in regularly aired radio programmes, including ‘Silesian Fairy Tales and Stories’ and ‘Jammin’ with Karlik’, was particularly well received by his audiences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0265691413478095">19</xref></sup> As ‘Karlik’, he cracked jokes, recited poetry, and sung the newsreel in numerous satirical and comical programmes. The line between politics and humour in his remarks was often a hazy one. Indeed, on most occasions he just wanted to give his audience cheap thrills. One joke provides an illustrative example. A German boasted to a Pole about Nazi Germany’s technological accomplishments, insisting that machines in Berlin could receive a cow in one end and issue a can of meat from the other. A Pole responded by describing an even more remarkable invention in Warsaw: a machine in which one places a can of meat in one end, and a cow turns out at the other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0265691413478095">20</xref></sup> Records from the police who listened to his programmes on the German side of the border demonstrate that occasionally ‘Karlik’ slipped into the forbidden realm of ‘political sensitivity’ and risked being accused of violating international radio conventions. In late March of 1928, Karlik told the following joke: a dog had taught a rooster to bark, then discovered that a barking rooster sounded like a Polish child who had learned German at a German minority school.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0265691413478095">21</xref></sup> It was his means of highlighting the nationalist ZOKZ’s propaganda that the German minority in the Voivodeship was using its League of Nations-sanctioned rights to establish its own schools to ‘Germanize’ the souls of ‘Polish’ local children. At other moments, he very clearly stood right within the ‘sensitive’ zone and made blatantly irredentist remarks, such as, ‘Oh, Piast folk [referring to Upper Silesians] planted by God all the way to the Oder River, defend this Polishness until one day Zygmunt’s Bell [from atop Wawe<italic>ł</italic> Castle in Cracow] calls for you’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0265691413478095">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the 1930s, Ligoń became a region-wide celebrity, whose popularity only increased as the clouds of intolerant German nationalism gathered over western Upper Silesia. According to reports from the Polish consulate, ‘Ligoń and his dialect … and humorous histories are listened to in Śląsk Opolski [or German Upper Silesia] without regard to political party membership – indeed, even by Nazis – and to such a degree that crowds of people gather around every radio’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0265691413478095">23</xref></sup> In the Provinz, ‘Karlik’ had his own fan club.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0265691413478095">24</xref></sup> And while on the air, he boasted of his transnational popularity by reading letters from fans on the German side of the border.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0265691413478095">25</xref></sup> At public gatherings in the Provinz, such as theatre performances, vendors sold ‘Karlik’ paraphernalia, including photographs and caricatures of Ligoń, publications of his joke books, plays, and art work to the public.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0265691413478095">26</xref></sup> Under the sway of Grażyński and the ZOKZ, the Upper Silesian section of the Union of Poles in Germany (<italic>Związek Polaków w Niemczech</italic>, ZPwN), the main Polish minority organization, worked hard to fan the flames of the radio comic’s popularity. According to its leaders, ‘Ligoń’s auditions in the <italic>gwara Śląska</italic> are a very important aspect of our propaganda in Śląsk Opolski [German Upper Silesia], and something that German propaganda does not possess, as out of standard operating principles, it is promoted exclusively in the German language’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0265691413478095">27</xref></sup> Indeed, here they had a point that distressed the German regional government, dominated by the centrist Catholic People’s Party (<italic>Katholische Volkspartei</italic>, KVP) during the Weimar era. Fearful of the influence of Ligoń’s ‘Upper Silesian chat fabricated in Polish’ – as the centrist press referred to it – the head of the KVP, Father Carl Ulitzka, called on Radio Breslau to air German programming in the ‘<italic>Wasserpolnisch</italic>’ dialect as a way of countering the PRK. His appeals fell on deaf ears, as Radio Breslau’s directors remained committed to promoting the German language in the borderlands.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0265691413478095">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>One assumption that Polish and German government officials shared – to the former’s pride and latter’s alarm – was that the widespread listening to ‘Karlik’ was turning ‘nationally indifferent’ Upper Silesians into Poles. This view was problematic in the light of official reports on listening patterns, which point out that the ordinary listeners were considerably less eager to tune in to the cultural or political programming from Warsaw that was also commonly broadcast over the PRK.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0265691413478095">29</xref></sup> If anything, their consumption of ‘Karlik’ demonstrates their identification with regional over Polish high-national ways. Locals also tuned in to the Upper Silesian comic for pure thrills and entertainment, rather than cultural or political enlightenment. According to one official German report, ‘Karlik’ was being listened to because his auditions ‘exhilarate and amuse the radio listener’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0265691413478095">30</xref></sup> Thus, rather than doing one of the things that Grażyński expected of the PRK, to ‘destroy’ what he called ‘the nightmare of provincialism’ – or in other words, ‘national indifference’ – Ligoń was actually only reinforcing this identity by uniting his listeners in a cross-border regional community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0265691413478095">31</xref></sup> While this regionalism aimed to make locals less Silesian and more national (e.g. Polish), it was possible for them to consume it in such a way as to remain more of the former and less of the latter. This they did as a means to safeguard their provincial ways against Nazi homogenization and centralization policies, without necessarily becoming Polish patriots, a topic I turn to next.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0265691413478095"><title>War on the Air</title>
<p>Rather than intensifying the ‘radio war’, the Nazi rise to power mollified it by way of the radio agreements signed as part of the German-Polish Nonaggression Pact. The two sides once again agreed not only to keep politically disturbing discourse off the airwaves, but also to engage in an exchange of broadcasting one another’s cultural programming.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0265691413478095">32</xref></sup> Only after the expiration of the Geneva Convention on 15 July 1937 did the propaganda war over the airwaves grow heated again – and particularly so in the last year before the war’s outbreak. This set of international measures had guaranteed rights of cultural self-determination to Upper Silesians on both sides of the border, protecting this population, including Jews, from forced assimilation and other forms of repression at the hands of the state. Its termination gave the Nazis and Grażyńskiites wider freedoms to carry out their ambitions of cultural, ethnic and political homogenization. The PRK took to rebutting and encouraging resilience to Hitler’s more radical politics of ‘Germanization’ (<italic>Eindeutschung</italic>) by way of propaganda and ‘ethnic cleansing’ in the Provinz. The ‘radio war’ had thus now entered a new phase in which this medium was used to interfere directly with the policies of the neighbouring state.</p>
<p>At the beginning of June of 1938, the PRK initiated a programme series specifically geared towards addressing the populace of western Upper Silesia, entitled ‘Behind the Border’ (<italic>Za Miedzą</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0265691413478095">33</xref></sup> It marked a venue through which pro-Polish activists could give locals of the Provinz an alternative source of information to the propaganda they were being fed by the Nazi regime and its own organization devoted to ‘guarding’ the ‘endangered’ eastern border provinces, the Union of the German East (<italic>Bund der Deutschen Osten</italic>, BDO). One of the programme’s aims was to encourage this population to resist using the new ‘German’ place names the BDO had introduced, to refuse to ‘Germanize’ their ‘Polish-sounding’ surnames at this organization’s behest, and to defy other measures of forced assimilation. Making a guest appearance on this programme, the Polish literartus and author of a Polono-centrist work on the folklore of western Upper Silesia, Stanis<italic>ł</italic>aw Wasylewski, commented on how the BDO was instructing locals to speak ‘only German’ and propagating that for millennia this region was inhabited by ‘German blood relatives of superior civilizational character’. ‘These Germans are quite strange if they have to be invited to speak German’, Wasylewski commented sarcastically, and ‘it is quite strange that one hardly shouts that Hannover or Brandenburg are German, but with regard to Upper Silesia, this message is repeated to death’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0265691413478095">34</xref></sup> During another broadcast aired in the summer of 1938, a less notable speaker told of how the BDO’s politics of ‘Germanization’ were having the opposite effect: locals in the Provinz were actually more conscious and proud in their use of the original names of places and their own native first and family names, even if these had been officially changed, and in speaking to one another in ‘Polish’. (In actuality, they more commonly spoke in an often significantly Germanized Slavophone ‘<italic>Wasserpolnisch</italic>’, but in a further attempt to nationally appropriate the latter, Polish nationalists commonly referred to it as ‘Polish’.) This speaker ended by telling the story of how Nazism had caused one Catholic priest from the Provinz, who had been an activist of the German KVP to abandon his sympathies with the latter and ‘return’ to being a conscious Pole.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0265691413478095">35</xref></sup> Exposing the rifts in the logic of Nazi propaganda and telling stories in which the moral was that ordinary individuals were defying ‘Germanization’ and turning themselves into Poles, the PRK was trying to encourage locals to follow its example. To facilitate this further, the programme also briefed the public of their rights under German law, which did not require them to replace their ‘Slavic-sounding’ with ‘German’ family names, and encouraged them to resist similar regime pressures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0265691413478095">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the most important episodes of PRK interference with ‘Germanization’ policy was the census contest in the Provinz in the first half of May of 1939. In this borderland where most of the populace was bilingual, and thus exhibited the core ‘objective’ characteristic of <italic>both</italic> German and Polish nationality, census-taking campaigns were highly political affairs. Data collections were often accompanied by terror and propaganda as political activists in both parts of the region worked to pressure and persuade locals to identify themselves only as nationals of the nation in which they lived and were citizens. The stakes in this effort were high for state actors on both sides of the border: if their own citizens had declared the nationality of the rival nation-state, it would have only strengthened the legitimacy of the latter’s claims to the borderland and weakened those of the opposite side. And so, throughout the interwar era, German and Polish state actors used all kinds of manipulation and chicanery to maximize the number of their nationals, and minimize those of their neighbour. The data collection campaign in the Voivodeship (and throughout Poland) in late 1931 marked one of the first major censuses in which government agents utilized heated propaganda, threats, and even violence, to intimidate locals into declaring the ‘correct’ mother tongue and nationality. These tactics and other manipulation allowed the official census statistics to reflect that Silesia was ‘the most Polish region in Poland’, when in actuality the opposite was more the case.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0265691413478095">37</xref></sup> The German census of 17 May 1939 was preceded by a crackdown on ‘Poles’ and ‘Polish behaviour’ and a propaganda barrage calling on all to declare German nationality. Opened in 1936, the new Gleiwitz relay tower played an important role in this effort to influence how individuals filled out their census questionnaires.</p>
<p>Stanis<italic>ł</italic>aw Ligoń mobilized the PRK to counter this propaganda head-on. ‘Behind the Border’ worked to expose the chicanery and manipulative motives inherent in this census count to the wider public. It declared that ‘there will be no doubt that the number of Poles will be extraordinarily low’ in the outcome since the aim here is to ‘give proof … that the number of Poles [in Germany] is too low to be called a minority’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0265691413478095">38</xref></sup> In an effort to prevent this from happening, Radio Katowice joined the Polish press and ZPwN grassroots agitators to encourage locals in the Provinz to defy this latest ‘Germanization’ policy by declaring ‘Polish’ as both their mother tongue and their ‘national belonging’ (<italic>Volkszugehörigkeit</italic>). Romantic nationalist mythology, including the belief that this was just another episode of the ‘Polish’ Upper Silesian people’s ‘seven century-long struggle against Germanization’, marked an important aspect of this propaganda.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0265691413478095">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>The German media was quick to respond to the PRK’s interference with its census-taking campaign by threatening locals with prison lock-ups if they ‘falsified’ their declarations by stating ‘Polish’ as mother tongue and nationality. This counter-attack also deployed an interesting tactic. In the days before the census, the Gleiwitz relay station declared that the people of Upper Silesia (Oberschlesien) spoke in ‘<italic>Oberschlesisch</italic>’, a dialect (<italic>Mundart</italic>) which they represented as closer to German than Polish, and barely comprehensible to Poles in general. This assertion was hardly new: German nationalists had a history of representing the Slavophone dialect that even they simultaneously referred to as ‘<italic>Wasserpolnisch</italic>’ (watered-down Polish) as inherently Germanic and non-Polish.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0265691413478095">40</xref></sup> Widely used in local private life in the Industrial District and countryside of the Provinz, this dialect was Polish in its syntax, but – particularly as it was spoken in the industrial areas – strongly mixed in Germanic and Slavic words, inflections and expressions. Since 1933, the Nazis had used threats and intimidation to try to stamp it out of existence, precisely because to them it sounded too ‘Polish’ for their comfort. Having largely failed in this effort, on the eve of the census-taking campaign of 1939 they sought to appropriate this dialect for German cultural heritage. Referring to it as ‘<italic>Oberschlesisch</italic>’ rather than ‘<italic>Wasserpolnisch</italic>’ marked one important step in this direction. Indeed, this effort was in large part meant as a counter-attack against the PRK, which represented this dialect as the ‘<italic>gwara Śląska</italic>’, a mere regional variant of high Polish. The Nazis were interested in legitimating the dialect only temporarily and strictly for census-taking purposes. Through the radio and by way of other media forms, the BDO urged locals who refused to declare ‘German’ as their mother tongue to report ‘<italic>Oberschlesisch</italic>’ instead, an option that likewise called for their declaration of German nationality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0265691413478095">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>The long-term consequences of the German-Polish struggle to influence the outcome of the census in the Provinz were not as significant as were the immediate ones. Indeed, by the time the final results of the count were known, the Nazi regime’s occupation of Poland and forceful liquidation of all Polish organizations in Upper Silesia made them practically insignificant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0265691413478095">42</xref></sup> According to reports by the Nazis’ underground opponents in Gleiwitz, locals also regarded the whole census-taking affair to be a politically orchestrated farce, and compared it to the equally bogus elections and referendums the regime had held in past years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0265691413478095">43</xref></sup> However, they certainly did not forget that the media had officially legitimated their local dialect, and, from then on and into the war years, reminded authorities of this whenever the latter made any attempts to compromise their linguistic rights. The census taking campaign was hardly over before regime officials again resumed their effort to stamp out what they continued to refer to as ‘<italic>Wasserpolnisch</italic>’. This caused conflicts in the coal mines, as managers tried to get reluctant workers to speak ‘only German’ as the BDO demanded. According to one eyewitness account:<disp-quote>
<p>[I]n the coal mines these discussions of ‘Polish-Oberschlesisch’ take place on an almost daily basis, and our buddies [and fellow workers] do not let [the authorities] prohibit their ‘Oberschlesisch’. Our friends say that ‘Oberschlesisch’ is now the ‘mother tongue’ of conversation. And so does the Union of German Oxen [<italic>Bund der Deutschen Ochsen</italic>, the popular derogatory term for the BDO], which had deemed ‘Oberschlesisch’ the equivalent of a German dialect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0265691413478095">44</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>To note an example of such a conflict, in early July in the Delbrück coal mines in Gleiwitz managers reproached a group of workers for speaking ‘Polish’ to one another. The men lashed back:<disp-quote>
<p>[W]hat do you want from us? It’s just Oberschlesisch, and it’s not forbidden. If you don’t believe us, then we’ll bring you fliers tomorrow, in case you haven’t already heard it on the radio. And get used to it, because we’re not going to let anyone forbid us from speaking Oberschlesisch.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0265691413478095">45</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>In the nearby coal mines of Guidogrube, a management trustee was even laughed out of the room by close to one hundred workers after they had made the same point to him.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0265691413478095">46</xref></sup> These efforts to counter the Nazis’ politics of ethnic cleansing serve as a prime example of how far from swallowing wholesale the discourse of one national radio station or the other, ordinary Upper Silesians exploited official propaganda to safeguard their own culture and identity.</p>
<p>While encouraging resistance to the Nazis marked one important goal of the PRK’s broadcasts over the Provinz, the ultimate aim here was to win the hearts and minds of the public for Poland. Radio Katowice had used a number of tactics to stir up sympathy with Poland, most notably promoting the Polish cause in Silesia as one which defended long-standing Catholic religious traditions against Nazi secularism, ‘neo-paganism’ and anti-clericalism. German and Polish official propaganda was largely in accord in its assertion that the worship of Catholic masses in the Polish language – which, according to BDO estimates, accounted for roughly half of such services held in the countryside even as late as 1938 – marked a gesture of Polish consciousness and patriotism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0265691413478095">47</xref></sup> This view, indeed all the more so since it was endorsed for irredentist propaganda by the eastern neighbour, legitimated the Nazis’ attitude to Catholic religiosity – much like their view of the Slavophone dialect – as a threat to German interests in the borderland. This strengthened the regime’s resolve to harass and persecute clerics and worshipers and to use terror and propaganda to discourage public religiosity. To defy the regime, particularly in its war against public worship in the Polish language, the PRK broadcast Sunday masses and pilgrimages from Poland.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0265691413478095">48</xref></sup> It also gave radio coverage to masses and rallies organized by the ZPwN on the top of Mount of St Anne (Annaberg/Góra świe¸tej Anny), the most important site of pilgrimage and worship in the Provinz, and at the same time the main Nazi nationalist <italic>lieu de mémoire</italic> in this region. Although locals defiantly resisted Nazi anti-Catholicism, they did not do so by joining the Polish minority, but rather by engaging in pilgrimages and processions on their own. As Jim Bjork and Robert Gerwarth pointed out, religiosity experienced a revival on the eve of the war in German Upper Silesia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0265691413478095">49</xref></sup> Contrary to the assumptions of German and Polish nationalists, widespread engagement in religious worship did not denote a rising pro-Polish spirit among locals, but rather only demonstrated the latter’s resolve to preserve age-old regional customs.</p>
<p>Another reason why the PRK had limited success in ‘Polonizing’ local consciousness was that Grażyński’s own nationalist politics inadvertently provided a centrifugal force to this effort. Largely in reaction to the Nazis, and in echo of the general right-wing turn in Poland after the death of Pi<italic>ł</italic>sudski, in the late 1930s, the voivode stepped up his already long-running persecution of the Volksbund and other German organizations, as well as ‘German behaviour’ among ordinary individuals. Word of firings from jobs, blacklistings, denial of border crossing rights and violence against the ruling faction’s ethnically and politically ‘unwanted’ – along with news of the unpopularity of Grażyński among locals and also of the non-Silesian Polish elite that he favoured – all easily got around across the border. According to reports by Nazi opponents in Gleiwitz, ‘everyone has relatives on the other side whom [Polish border guards] have refused a visit,' which `makes it hardly doubtful that in Poland terror is promoted against Germans.'<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0265691413478095">50</xref></sup> The German radio had a field day in helping to promote the reports of, and indeed, doing all it could to exaggerate, what Nazi propaganda referred to as Poland’s ‘war of destruction’ (<italic>Vernichtungskrieg</italic>) against ‘Germandom’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0265691413478095">51</xref></sup> While this propaganda may have helped to keep locals from flocking to Polish banners, it certainly hardly assuaged widespread resentment against the Nazis.</p>
<p>The one figure who unequivocally benefited from the tense political atmosphere was Stanis<italic>ł</italic>aw ‘Karlik’ Ligoń, the nationalist who spoke with a regionalist voice. Indeed, according to the sources of Nazi and anti-Nazi German agents, his popularity was only heightened as a result of the regime’s increasing intolerance towards regional ways. As the Landrat (district administrator) of Beuthen (Bytom) commented in the spring of 1939:<disp-quote>
<p>[I]n many apartments … one finds people gathered listening to these programmes together, and they do not just include known supporters of Poland but also members of the layer-in-between [<italic>Zwischenschicht</italic> or the ‘nationally indifferent’], who until recently have maintained their neutrality vis-à-vis matters concerning Poles. The broadcasts of the so-called ‘[Karlik from] Kocynder’ enjoy particularly strong popularity. People will be discussing these PRK broadcasts in constantly increasing frequency, [and] they are acquiring an ever greater resonance as more people tune into them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0265691413478095">52</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Indeed, Nazi officials were well aware that hardly any of their programmes could match the appeal of Ligoń’s dialect, talent and local sense of humour. According to the Landrat of Ratibor (Raciborz) the broadcasts of ‘Karlik’ constitute ‘an outright calamitous source of danger, since they are so nicely tailored to psychologically appeal to the border people … The tone and derisive laugh of Ligon [sic] are poison for the German in Upper Silesia who is not absolutely certain [of his/her nationality]’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0265691413478095">53</xref></sup> Quite powerless from keeping Ligoń’s broadcasts from coming over the border, regime officials used terror and propaganda to pressure locals not to listen to them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0265691413478095">54</xref></sup> Having encountered those who listen to the PRK even among their own ranks, BDO activists specifically instructed those who gathered at the organization’s propaganda assemblies not to listen to ‘Karlik’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0265691413478095">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ligoń played a central role in the PRK’s contestation of the borderland against the Nazis. Performing for the <italic>Behind the Border</italic> series, among other programmes, he criticized regime policy and disseminated Polish nationalist overtures, while still maintaining an aura of wit and entertainment. Taking to the air a week after the notorious Nazi-orchestrated ‘<italic>Kristallnacht</italic>’, he talked about how ‘just out of fun’ the municipal synagogue of the border city of Beuthen was burned down and the windows of Jewish businesses had been smashed, among other acts of vandalism and violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0265691413478095">56</xref></sup> Comparing these incidences to those that German nationalists had imposed on pro-Polish Upper Silesians during the plebiscite struggle, he claimed that ‘we [the Poles] do not laugh when injustice is done to someone else. Every injustice will avenge itself’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0265691413478095">57</xref></sup> However, as a Grażyńskiite – or follower of a camp that was known for its own anti-Jewish politics – Ligoń did not go further than using ‘Kristallnacht’ to merely ridicule and demonize Germans. Without making any other comment about the fate of the Jews under the Nazis, Karlik ended his brief discussion of this topic with the comment ‘but all of this is none of our business’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0265691413478095">58</xref></sup> Indeed, in accordance with Polish nationalism, only the ‘Poles’ – in this case, Catholic Upper Silesians – mattered. And so, ‘Karlik’ finished this broadcast by singing a summary of the current events in Germany, in which he referred to the Germans as `pagans' who will earn `God's punishment' and called on his ‘fellow countrymen [Upper Silesians]’ in the Provinz ‘not to let yourselves be done in’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0265691413478095">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the summer of 1939, the propaganda conflict over the air waves grew so heated that locals began to feel that war between the two nations was drawing near. By July, the PRK started to broadcast the news in German to make locals believe that they were listening to radio from the Third Reich, as well as in Czech to address the public in the Nazi-occupied ‘Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0265691413478095">60</xref></sup> This was an old trick that Radio Katowice had already employed in the early 1930s. While at the time they felt pressured to do the same, officials at Radio Breslau remained true to their ‘in German only’ broadcasting policy, fearful that otherwise they would only officialize the Polish language in Germany’s border provinces and thereby strengthen Poland’s cultural and political influence there. On the eve of the outbreak of war, Nazi propaganda officials reversed this policy and began to broadcast news reports in Polish and Ukrainian via radio stations in Breslau, Königsberg, Görlitz, Opava and Vienna.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0265691413478095">61</xref></sup> Having desired such an outcome since the early 1930s, the Polish minority used it as an occasion to promote rumours that these broadcasts were actually coming from a new radio station the Poles had opened up in Breslau, as all of Silesia would soon fall to Poland.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0265691413478095">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>In general, Third Reich propaganda towards Poland stressed that the Polish government had fallen under the hegemony of France and Great Britain, who were exploiting Poland’s economy to their own benefit. While this marked an important pillar of its message in Polish addressing the Poles, that in German addressing the publics of the eastern German provinces depicted the Polish minority in Germany – next to Jews – as agents of communism and western-allied Polish aggression against the Third Reich. In their heated propaganda on Danzig and other parts of the ‘bleeding border’, the Nazis depicted themselves as the camp of peace and Poland as that of forceful expansion and aggression. Indeed, the hysterical propaganda of Poland’s internal ‘war of destruction’ against everything German marked an important aspect of this effort to paint the eastern neighbour as an aggressor against Germany.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0265691413478095">63</xref></sup> According to reports on the mood in Gleiwitz by anti-Nazi observers, many ordinary locals were quite sceptical of this information, and believed that Hitler was merely seeking an excuse to attack Poland.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0265691413478095">64</xref></sup> Nevertheless, they were likewise disappointed with the similar exaggerated tone of Polish radio reports. As opponents of the Nazis in Gleiwitz observed, ‘no neutral reply is delivered by way of [Polish] radio broadcasts in German, which could serve to defend against the anti-Polish agitation’. Instead, the Polish media ‘is only repeating the mistakes of the German press, and exaggerating all incidents’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0265691413478095">65</xref></sup> Nevertheless, along with ‘Karlik’ and Polish-language church services, the PRK’s news reports in German were widely listened to, since they offered the populace a rare alternative source of information to, and critical perspective on, the hegemonic, omnipresent and monotone official discourse of the Nazis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0265691413478095">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>Using his wit, humour and regionalist appeal, ‘Karlik’ played his own role in fuelling the tense and belligerent atmosphere of the final summer of the interwar era. He tackled one of Nazi propaganda’s main efforts during this time: to promote the notion that life in Poland was unbearable for Upper Silesians due to chaos and state persecution. Encouraged by pro-Nazi minority organizations within the Voivodeship, such as the <italic>Jungdeutschepartei</italic> (JdP), during this time ordinary individuals crossed the border – at times by the hundreds per day and often at illegal crossing points – from Polish to German Upper Silesia. They did so largely in search of better-paid jobs, which they had often been promised by the Nazi agents in Poland. Although some fled to escape Polish nationalist terror, many men also did so in fear of being drafted into the army and having to fight a lost-cause war against Germany, that according to popular rumours, was about to break out. Once they made their crossing, Nazi officials placed them in ‘refugee camps’ (<italic>Flüchtlingslager</italic>) built for this purpose across the Provinz. There, a number of these ‘refugees’ were ideologically schooled for their new function of grassroots agitators for the regime, and then sent out to mines and industrial plants, and other public places, to promote anti-Polish propaganda as ‘eyewitnesses’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0265691413478095">67</xref></sup> In an attempt to dissuade the public in the Provinz from listening to these refugees, Ligoń told of how, although the Nazis referred to them as ‘victims of Polish [Germanophobic] chauvinism’, in actuality ‘most of them cry ‘Heil Hitler!’ but know no other word in German’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0265691413478095">68</xref></sup> He also attempted to stem the flight from Poland to Germany by warning the public on his side of the border not to be seduced by fantasies of a ‘brown paradise’ (Third Reich), for in actuality, the Nazis were incarcerating newcomers in conditions ‘that mirror those of our zoological gardens’, and thereafter putting them ‘to heavy labour for little pay’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0265691413478095">69</xref></sup> In further efforts to defy the campaigning of JdP agitators in Poland, Ligoń spoke of widespread poverty and austerity measures in the Third Reich, placing particular emphasis on how underfed German soldiers were as a way of persuading men that it was better to be in Polish uniform. According to one of his witty and exaggerated statements, ‘they [the Germans] come to our markets to eat themselves full, since at home they have nothing. They dream that by marching through Poland [in a military invasion] they’ll be able to just eat up everything at once’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0265691413478095">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>In an effort to stem the tide of popular defection to Germany, to counter the Nazi propaganda’s aims of demoralizing the public on the Polish side of the border, and also to deliver a response to German radio’s irredentist aggression, the PRK promoted its own muscle-flexing gestures. While claiming to be reading from a letter sent by a fan in occupied Czechoslovakia during one of his broadcasts, Ligoń announced that ‘it was better to fall in battle than to become a part of the Protectorate’, thus dismissing the option of also surrendering to Germany.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0265691413478095">71</xref></sup> His broadcasts did much to convey the message that war with the Third Reich was imminent, and that Poland should prepare for this. From informing the public that Nazi propaganda on Danzig is ‘already a war game’, to holding a fund-raiser for the Polish military forces during August of 1939, ‘Karlik’ made it quite clear that war was to come.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0265691413478095">72</xref></sup> And he did this in a confident and high-spirited manner, warning the Nazis to ‘get your behinds ready [for punishment]’, and that ‘they [the Germans] should just come and we will tear out their bloody and crusty claws’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0265691413478095">73</xref></sup> He even made gestures in the direction of Poland’s making the first move. Referring to the fortifications the Nazis were building on their side of the border during this time, Ligoń commented that this was ‘so that they will be able to hide their behinds when we come’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0265691413478095">74</xref></sup> When the Germans expressed their annoyance with such statements, Polish officials accused them of not being able to take a joke. According to the Grażyńskiite daily newspaper, <italic>Polska Zachodnia</italic>, ‘how tense must the nerves of the “fuehrers” [sic] be if they are bothered even by humour and laughs’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0265691413478095">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>If Ligoń could always excuse his statements as mere jokes, the actors of Grażyński’s highhanded militant ceremonies held at the border on the eve of the war certainly could not. Since coming into power, the voivode had been holding rallies of this nature usually several times a year to praise and commemorate both the second and third Polish Silesian insurgencies against Germany after World War I, and proudly display his paramilitary force, the ‘Insurgent Union’ (<italic>Związek Powstańców</italic>, ZP), largely made up of the veteran fighters of these uprisings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0265691413478095">76</xref></sup> During the first decade after the partition, the bombastic militant character of these stirred much uproar in the Provinz, and even raised fears among ordinary locals that the Poles were going to invade. Eventually, such rallies became a commonplace ‘tradition’ and hardly drew attention from the German media. This changed in the last year before the war, when the Nazi propaganda bureau was searching for any ‘evidence’ to support its propaganda of Polish aggression. Surely aware of this, in the summer of 1939, Grażyński, the ZP, local administrators, and units of regular soldiers nevertheless staged several of these official gestures of military aggression and open irredentism. In early June of 1939, the voivode himself presided over the unveiling of a statue of the insurgent in Ruda Śląska (Friedrichsdorf) about 220 yards from the border. As was common for these statues, a number of which been erected around the border area since the late 1920s, this one pointed to the German side of the border as a public reminder of Poland’s still unfulfilled irredentist mission. During this ceremony, which the PRK broadcast over the airwaves, and at which units of the ZP and also the Polish army surrounded Grażyński, the latter vowed that ‘what the heroes of the third insurgency did not complete will be finished by us’ – in other words, the seizure of western Upper Silesia by military force.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0265691413478095">77</xref></sup> Such statements of the voivode, had been repeated for years and had become quite banal by this time, as were other ‘invented traditions’ that were officially observed that summer, including the unveiling of another statue of the insurgent at the end of June in the border village of Boruszowice, a monument that was 33 feet high and clearly visible from the German side.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0265691413478095">78</xref></sup> In addition, in mid-August, the ZP staged their annual ‘March to the Oder’, a march from Poland’s border with Germany to that with Czechoslovakia (this time including the Teschen/Zaolzia area that the Polish state had annexed in October of 1938), to commemorate the second insurgency of August 1919 with warmongering militancy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0265691413478095">79</xref></sup> Indeed, the German media had a field day exposing these rallies under provocative headlines such as ‘the insurgents want to “take back” Silesia – the agitation has made Poland crazy’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0265691413478095">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>This Nazi propaganda on Poland’s intention to capture all of the German eastern provinces up to the Oder River inadvertently gave the well-known Gleiwitz ‘provocation’ on the last day before the war’s outbreak at least some foundation of logic. The attack on the newly built relay station, with its awe-aspiring 361-foot-high wooden broadcasting tower, had been orchestrated by the SS, which dressed up its agents and Polish-minority members, who were concentration camp prisoners, in Polish military uniforms. However, the German media’s account of the event strove to give it credibility by linking it to Grażyńskiite irredentism towards western Upper Silesia. And so, the official accounts reported that ‘bands of the “Insurgent Union” ’ accompanied by regular soldiers had performed the deed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0265691413478095">81</xref></sup> Having broadcast official rallies commemorating the Polish Silesian insurgencies of 1919–1921, along with other propaganda that lauded Poland’s taking of all of Upper Silesia by force, the PRK had helped to make a Polish attack on the Provinz at least conceivable. The heated military muscle-flexing that both German and Polish radios interactively promoted on the airwaves in the last months before the war likewise provided the Nazis with a suitable atmosphere to stage this final propaganda event to legitimate the invasion of Poland.</p>

<p>A zeal to integrate both their own and their national neighbour’s part of the contested Upper Silesian border province into their respective nation-state marked one of the major original intentions behind the building of the German relay station in Gleiwitz and the Polish Radio Katowice. By broadcasting political and cultural programming that promoted high national and nationally oriented regional traditions, state officials on both sides of the border aimed to gradually homogenize the mixed and multifarious culture of this borderland to the advantage of their own respective nation’s policies of borderland nationalization and irredentism. In reality, mostly the opposite occurred. The multifaceted contestation of Upper Silesia between the two nation-states and between each and the local level only encouraged the preservation of the local transnational diversity of this province. Focusing on the national contest over the western (German) part of the region, my intention in this study has been to address some of the highlights of this many-sided German-Polish ‘radio war’ of the interwar era, as well as the complex, and often unexpected, impacts it had on relations between the two nations, and on the disputed region and its local populace.</p>
<p>Radio facilitated the intrusion of one state into the ‘domestic’ affairs of the other, thus helping to make each national camp’s ventures to appropriate this borderland into inherently entangled cross-border affairs. My focus on the final years of the interwar era reveals how to varying degrees both radio stations used their programming to counter and undermine their neighbour’s policies of forceful homogenization. As a result, such politics (including Nazi policies of ethnic cleansing), should be examined not just as internal but inherently transnational affairs, in which the interactive roles of both states are accounted for. Serving as a precedent of sorts to the kinds of tactics that Radio Free Europe would employ against the Soviet regimes of the post-war era, Polish radio posed a barrier to the Nazi regime’s attempt to engineer an ideologically monotone, culturally and ethnically homogenous, and politically totalitarian society. Indeed, the interwar-period-long German-Polish bilateral engagement in a ‘radio war’, and the latter’s intensification towards the end of this epoch, forged a spirit of belligerent aggression over the ether. Not only did this discursive war on the air allow the local public to anticipate the actual war’s outbreak, but it provided the Nazis with a logical premise for their most well-known orchestrated excuse to attack Poland – the so-called Gleiwitz ‘provocation’.</p>
<p>Radio also helped make irredentist international politics into a popular culture of sorts. Aiming to turn the minds of locals on the German side of the border towards Poland, the programmes of the Polskie Radio Katowice did much more than just disseminate serious pro-Polish polemics in a monotonous voice. By using charm, wit and humour, its director and star speaker, Stanis<italic>ł</italic>aw ‘Karlik’ Ligoń, rapidly became a widely listened-to and popular regional celebrity – thereby giving the Polskie Radio Katowice a seemingly winning edge in its ‘radio war’ against the Germans. Rather than reading out of the press, official reports, and politicized academic lectures, ‘Karlik’ sang songs, cracked jokes, and told amusing stories – all in the name of extending Poland’s influence in its claimed territory. Popular humour and joy thus became a new way of attracting the attention of the masses in this interwar period when contesting national borders took on a mass-political character, which, particularly in borderlands, invaded everyday local life.</p>
<p>Even as they were caught up in this irredentist fervour, Upper Silesian locals still formed their own opinions and chose their own sides. What helped them to do so, ironically, were some of the irredentist radio programmes that were geared to nationalize their identity, and which nationalists endorsed in the hope of eventually stamping out ‘nationally indifferent’ regionalism. An open Polish nationalist, the Upper Silesian radio comic, Stanis<italic>ł</italic>aw ‘Karlik’ Ligoń, strove to capture the hearts and minds of locals for Poland not by imposing high Polish culture on them, but by enticing and amusing them using partially Polonized inflections of their own folk language and humour. He achieved at least one part of his agenda: his programmes helped to empower and encourage locals in their resistance against Nazis. While they did this, and eagerly tuned in to listen to ‘Karlik’, locals likewise remained sceptical towards Polish nationalist propaganda over the ether, and alienated from Warsaw radio programming. When to counteract the PRK’s ‘Polish’ regionalism, the Nazis instrumentally appropriated the local dialect as a (German) ‘Oberschlesisch’, locals likewise interpreted this as a legitimation of their regional language and an Upper Silesian triumph over ‘Germanization’. The ‘radio war’ may have done as its best to promote regional ways, principally to fuel the official myth that this borderland ‘belonged’ to Germany/Poland, but to locals, these ways remained part of the heritage of their enduring Upper Silesian identity.</p>
