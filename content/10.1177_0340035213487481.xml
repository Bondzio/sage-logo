<p>As IFLA members and others prepare for the 2013 World Library and Information Congress in Singapore, we present in this issue a further selection of papers from the Helsinki conference of 2012, together with the usual key paper on libraries in this year’s host country. A common theme to all the papers in this issue is that of change.</p>
<p>In ‘Singapore libraries: from bricks and mortar to information anytime anywhere’, editors Julie S Sabaratnam and Esther Ong, with contributions from many colleagues in that country, present a comprehensive look into the evolving landscape of libraries in Singapore. Since the first major libraries were founded in Singapore some 190 years ago, the country has seen a proliferation of libraries of all kinds that have become increasingly important in the lives of Singaporeans. They achieve this by adapting to technological developments as well as changes in user demands and behaviours with innovative digital products and services that include library management systems, e-resources, digital devices as well as the utilisation of social media to engage users. The programme of library visits during the Singapore conference promises to be an eye-opener for colleagues from other parts of the world.</p>
<p>International influences are the subject of the next paper, ‘Commonwealth of uncertainty: How British and American professional models of library practice have shaped LIS Education in selected former British Colonies and Dominions’, by Mary Carroll, Paulette Kerr, Abdullahi I. Musa and Waseem Afzal. This paper from the Helsinki conference examines how the convergence of the British and American influences on LIS education have left a complex legacy which has shaped the aspirations of the LIS profession and influenced the delivery and the educational model of librarianship in a number of Commonwealth countries.</p>
<p>How to cope with changes in the library environment is an issue which increasingly exercises members of the profession at all levels, and the next paper, ‘Leadership in libraries in times of change’, by Petra Düren, aims to provide an overview of the leadership competences needed to succeed with deliberate large-scale changes in libraries. Most of these competences can be imparted during undergraduate studies, and the paper describes recent studies concerning leadership in academic and public libraries, emphasizing the importance of a number of success factors, especially the communication competence of leaders in times of change. </p>
<p>Another aspect of the question of change is discussed in the next paper, ‘Welcoming, flexible, and state-of-the-art: Approaches to continuous facilities improvement’, by Charles Forrest and Sharon L. Bostick. As a generation of students enters university having embraced online, mobile, anytime, anywhere access to information, the 21st century academic library must continually recreate itself as a place that fosters curiosity, engagement, collaboration, and lifelong learning. This paper discusses efforts at two major academic institutions in the United States to develop innovative ways to evaluate library spaces, functions, services, operations and maintenance with the aim of continually refreshing and renewing library spaces that enhance learning, inspire scholarship, and foster community.</p>
<p>Major changes that are envisaged for the bibliographic standards environment provide the context for the next paper, ‘UNIMARC – Understanding the past to envision the future’, by Rosa Maria Galvão and Maria Inês Cordeiro. With the aim of reflecting on the nature and specification of MARC and its adequacy for the integration of bibliographic discovery systems into the larger world of networked information and systems, this paper provides an overview of the evolution of UNIMARC and the practices of its maintenance, collecting knowledge that may be useful as a first contribution to inform future steps in redesigning bibliographic data standards.</p>
<p>Change is again the theme of the next paper, ‘Techniques to understand the changing needs of library users’, by Susan Gibbons. The paper demonstrates a set of techniques developed at the University of Rochester (USA) aimed at a greater understanding of the academic work practices of a university or college community can reveal unintentional misalignments between a library's services and user needs, as well as overlooked opportunities for a library to provide new services. This has been achieved through the adoption and adaptation of methods from anthropological and ethnography, which are then applied to the study of segments of a university community. While the findings of these studies are unique to the academic community of the University of Rochester, the methods of study can and have been applied successfully to the study of library users on other campuses. </p>
<p>The final paper in this issue again focuses on the theme of change. In ‘Measuring the public library’s societal value: a methodological research program’, Frank Huysmans and Marjolein Oomes note that public libraries in the Netherlands face growing scepticism about their value to communities and society at large. There is thus a growing need for public libraries to show their worth – not only in an economic, but also in a more sociological sense. This paper describes a research project undertaken by the Netherlands Institute of Public Libraries to develop a measurement instrument geared at validly and reliably demonstrating the societal value of public libraries. The findings help to identify and five domains of possible impact: cognitive, social, cultural, affective and economic, which will guide the development of a measuring instrument.</p>
