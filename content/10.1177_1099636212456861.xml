<abstract>
<p>In this work, the problem of non-destructive testing on composite components with complex shapes for civil constructions and transport infrastructures is analyzed. In such applications at the state of the art main challenges are related with the inspection of thick sandwiches with low density cores (below 80 kg/m<sup>3</sup>) and curved panels. After a review of suitable non-destructive testing techniques, an original set-up for low frequency (100 kHz) ultrasonic inspection is proposed, which combines different solutions in through-transmission mode. The set-up is based on a hybrid configuration coupling a contact emitting probe with a non-contact air-coupled receiver. The use of a contact probe in emission is necessary to have enough energy to analyze thick components with low density core. The contact between probe and surface is made small (spot of 1 mm) and smooth using a spherical cap to increase lateral resolution at low frequency and to allow scan on irregular surfaces sometimes present in curved parts. To improve understanding this cap has been tested here also with a single probe in pulse echo mode. The non-contact probe in reception allows a better inspection flexibility on curved and thick components, where pulse echo is not feasible at all. The system is mainly developed for inspection after production in an industrialized production process, where through-transmission testing is possible. The analysis of results on two different samples (one thick sandwich with low density 40 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, 50 mm thick PUR core and one curved laminate panel) shows that the proposed methods can efficiently inspect construction composites of complex shape with satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio (usually SNR &gt; 15 dB) and lateral resolution (2–3 mm).</p>

<sec id="sec1-1099636212456861" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Several research (e.g. HP FUTURE-Bridge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1099636212456861">1</xref>], Safefloor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1099636212456861">2</xref>] and MEgawind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1099636212456861">3</xref>]) on polymer reinforced fibers for construction applications have demonstrated that the use of these components is very promising regarding requirements, quality, technical and economical feasibility and the favorable impact of using this kind of composite-based components in terms of sustainability, safety and quality of life.</p>
<p>Polymer composites, also known as fibre-reinforced polymers (FRPs), consist of two or more distinct constituent materials intentionally combined to a desired set of properties. These are commonly used for strengthening existing structures in concrete and steel in civil and building construction, but also new construction structural FRP components such as pultruded shapes and sandwiches are in high demand.</p>
<p>The increase of FRP applications, and the need to better meet economical and societal constraints, require today a new industrialized, flexible production process of composite infrastructures components covering the whole supply chain. An European Project denominated New Industrialised Construction Process for Transport Infrastructures based on Polymer Composite Components, 2009-2013 (TRANS-IND) is working on this topic. Industrialization will allow to overcome many of the limitations that in the last years limited the spread of such materials in the construction field (e.g. cost). The basic idea is to have an off-site industrial production of components, which will be then assembled in very short time in the construction site.</p>
<p>Within this project, attention is put also on how to detect defects in new composite structures with innovative flexible and efficient methods. FRP composite components can develop subsurface defects (e.g., cracks, voids, delaminations, disbonds) during the manufacturing process, transportation, construction and/or during the service life, therefore a reliable inspection method is necessary to guarantee a secure application. For in-service evaluation of structural integrity, the current trend is to use embedded sensors (e.g. Fiber Bragg Grating) for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1099636212456861">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1099636212456861">5</xref>], but for the inspections after production and on the assembly site a non-destructive testing (NDT) technique must be developed and used.</p>
<p>Different techniques have been developed and applied to inspect FRP components in the aeronautic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1099636212456861">6</xref>], automotive and wind turbine fields, as thermography, shearography, ultrasonic phased array, air-coupled ultrasonic etc. The next paragraph analyses advanced NDT solutions in this field. However, the application of many of these techniques on civil composite structures can be difficult, because of the relevant thicknesses and peculiar shapes. In this paper, the focus will be on the inspection of structural elements made of composites with complex shapes, e.g. sandwich panels with thick low-density (40 kg/m<sup>3</sup>) core or FRP-curved panels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1099636212456861"><title>Analysis of NDT advanced solutions for composites</title>
<p>Over the past 20 years, several techniques have been developed for NDT on composites. Optical methods gradually appeared and are now being applied more and more to NDT. Infrared thermography and shearography are widely applied, as they are fast in use and analysis (as they are full-field methods), non-contact and can be exploited with different excitation techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1099636212456861">6</xref>]. These methods have the potential of application on complex shapes, if the surface temperature or shear gradients due to the defects can be well distinguished from effects due to the complex sample shape like curvatures or edges (e.g. Reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1099636212456861">7</xref>]). However, an important limit of these techniques is the capability of investigating thick panels, as the surface effect of deep defects is no longer visible. For thermography, for example, this is connected to the effect of thermal penetration depth (that is function of the thermal conductivity, volumetric heat-capacity, density, thermal load) on the thermal contrast <italic>C</italic>, which is proportional to the temperature difference between defected and non-defected areas and has a trend inversely proportional to the cube of the depth <italic>z</italic>:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1099636212456861"><label>(1)</label><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="math1-1099636212456861"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math><graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula1-1099636212456861" xlink:href="10.1177_1099636212456861-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The thermal contrast is a complex parameter that is dependent on several variables. A full description of the measurement of <italic>C</italic> is given in Reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1099636212456861">8</xref>]. Several experiences (e.g. References [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1099636212456861">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1099636212456861"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1099636212456861">11</xref>]) showed that thermography and shearography are usually able to inspect monolithic composite panels up to a depth of about 7–8 mm. This is not enough for several civil structures.</p>
<p>Another promising optical technique for damage detection on composites is based on Laser Vibrometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1099636212456861">12</xref>], but also in this case the inspection depth is quite limited because of the required excitation energy, making this technique mostly suitable for regular panels of aeronautic or automotive use. Laser Ultrasonics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1099636212456861">13</xref>] have better performances and flexibility for industrial use, but available systems are extremely expensive.</p>
<p>Acoustic emission (AE) testing shows an attitude for real-time monitoring of complex structures particularly for precise damage location and assessment. There are studies that analyzed damage mechanisms in CFRP composites and also in pultruded materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1099636212456861">14</xref>]. This technique detects the stress waves generated in the materials due to deformation, crack initiation and growth, crack opening and closure, fiber breakage and delamination in composite materials. However, the structure can be inspected under working conditions or under an externally applied fatigue load, which is not the best solution for control in an industrial production cycle. In addition, damages must have features suitable to generate AEs (e.g. a limited delamination between skin and foam core could not be detected).</p>
<p>Ultrasonic techniques have a great potential to inspect very different materials and elements, using different configurations and frequencies. However, for CFRP-GFRP (panels with a mix of layers in carbon fiber reinforced polymer and layers with glass fiber reinforced polymer) or sandwich civil structures, thickness and shape complexity present problems also for these techniques.</p>
<p>To quickly and reliably inspect large areas and curved shapes of composite elements, ultrasonic phased arrays have been developed (e.g. References [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1099636212456861">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1099636212456861">16</xref>]). Usually, commercial phased arrays have a frequency over 400–500 kHz, as smaller frequencies require an extension of the size of each element of the array. The bigger size of the element implicates a decrease of the lateral resolution, a difficulty to realize particular shape of the probe and a difficulty to move on raw (not smooth and planar) surfaces, so the application of phased array on the considered civil structures is not easy.</p>
<p>In order to improve penetration at medium frequencies (as 400–500 kHz) the component should be inspected in a water tank, which is not convenient for these new industrialized production processes of large components. In fact, the inspection systems for large components (e.g. bridge beams) are technologically complex, expensive and usually not portable (need of big basin to submerge the element; robot to move the probes; hermetic probes, etc.). There are some very promising portable systems that work with light curved shapes (e.g. wheel probes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1099636212456861">17</xref>], probes coupled with a moving water container to inspect wind turbine blades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1099636212456861">18</xref>]), but low thickness layer are analyzed, so medium-high frequency (from 400 kHz to 10 MHz) are used. In addition, the scan is performed on slightly curved parts, so irregular surfaces or highly curved panels are difficult to be inspected.</p>
<p>Air-coupled ultrasonic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1099636212456861">19</xref>] is a very attractive method because it avoids the disadvantages of the coupling media and is suitable to inspect complex profiles for their easiness of movement and orientation, even though precise alignment and positioning are required by dedicated robotic manipulators (e.g. Reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1099636212456861">20</xref>]). Furthermore, the large gap of acoustic impedance between solid and air produces a very strong signal amplitude loss (which can be very critical for a thick sandwich, as it will be discussed in Paragraph 4). In most cases, air-coupled ultrasounds have been used in Pitch&amp;Catch mode for inspection of thin panels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1099636212456861">21</xref>] or honeycomb sandwiches often for aeronautic applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1099636212456861">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1099636212456861">23</xref>]. However, very interesting applications have been presented in literature also on foam structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1099636212456861">24</xref>] and concrete structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1099636212456861">25</xref>], thus showing potentials for investigation on thick porous construction materials. In References [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1099636212456861">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1099636212456861">27</xref>] sandwich structures with core thickness up to 60 mm (with 80 kg/m<sup>3</sup> density) and 120 mm (with 200 kg/m<sup>3</sup> density) are inspected using 50 kHz and 120 kHz air-coupled probes, but it is reported that due to high attenuation the technique has much lower accuracy for the 80 kg/m<sup>3</sup> core, which can be inspected only at lower thickness and at lower frequency with reduced lateral resolution. These non-contact applications are mostly feasible in through-transmission mode, so they can be difficult for on-site inspection (i.e. once the component is installed) but can be suitable for inspection at the production site.</p>
<p>Contact ultrasonic is potentially the better technique (pulse echo and trough transmission modes with liquid or gel coupling) for accurate inspections of high-thickness components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1099636212456861">28</xref>]. Low-frequency probes are usually employed to inspect such elements, thus providing a limited spatial lateral resolution (&gt;6–8 mm at 50 kHz): for small defects in complex panels the detection can be challenging and the damage extension reconstruction may not be accurate, so a compromise between penetration and resolution must be found to identify the proper frequency and set-up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1099636212456861"><title>The proposed method</title>
<p>In order to exploit the high penetration of a contact method and the inspection flexibility of a non-contact approach, an innovative combination between contact and non-contact probes (<italic>hybrid configuration</italic>) is here proposed, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1099636212456861">Figure 1</xref>. The emitter contact probe allows to have a high ultrasound energy injected through the material and the non-contact receiver probe allows to have more degrees of freedom to follow up the panel profile, usable with a low weight receive-side manipulator without the need for a squirter water supply, heavy pneumatics or rollers for the contact.
<fig id="fig1-1099636212456861" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Through-transmission mode set-up in the hybrid configuration with contact and non-contact probes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1099636212456861-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The basic idea was derived from the configuration proposed in Reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1099636212456861">29</xref>], where a dry coupled 250 kHz roller-probe transmitter (see also Reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1099636212456861">17</xref>]) was coupled with a non-contact 250 kHz air-coupled receiver to inspect a 25-mm thick graphite-epoxy composite section. However, there was the need to improve this set-up to be specifically applicable to sandwich structures with very thick low-density cores (as those produced in the Trans-Ind industrialized process) and curved shapes presenting sometimes irregular surfaces on the curve part.</p>
<p>The dedicated measurement chain here proposed is composed of the following equipment:

</list></p>
<p>The piezoelectric 100 kHz contact probe (38 mm active diameter) is an untuned transducer that provides heavily damped broadband (about 60 kHz) performance, so it is suitable for tests that require improved signal-to-noise in attenuating or scattering materials. The piezoelectric 100 kHz non-contact probe has a frequency of 100 kHz (25 mm active diameter) and, according to the manufacturer specifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1099636212456861">30</xref>], is characterized by a high transduction efficiency in air/gases in a band of resonance of about 40–50 kHz. It can also acquire very small signals (fluctuations in the order of few tenths of Pa in air [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1099636212456861">31</xref>]), however, to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) the application of pass-band filters for the received signal is here adopted. The probe was installed at about 25 mm from the sample surface.</p>
<p>The contact emitting probe has been modified to make a punctual contact with the surface of the inspected sample. In this way, it is possible to improve the contact between the transducer and the sample in curved areas and also to increase the spatial resolution. Starting from the analysis of state-of-the-art solutions for coupling devices with narrow contact area having cone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1099636212456861">32</xref>], ball shape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1099636212456861">33</xref>] or rubber dry-coupled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1099636212456861">34</xref>] for flexible and fast inspection, a simple and light dedicated set-up was here developed suitable for a continuous scan by applying a spherical cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1099636212456861">Figure 2</xref>) in front of the probe. In order to increase ultrasonic wave transmission, the empty space of the cap was filled with water, thus avoiding squirter water. For this preliminary prototype, a thin (about 1 mm) plastic element was used to realize the cap, the thin element allowing small interference on the transmitted wave. The contact between cap and surface can be dry or better coupled with an oil film.
<fig id="fig2-1099636212456861" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Contact emitting probe with spherical cap.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1099636212456861-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The proposed system, thanks to the simple equipment, is suitable for application both on the component production site and on the assembly site, if a proper robotic manipulator is used. On the production site, where the components are not installed, an inspection in through-transmission mode can be readily performed. Once the components are installed, pulse echo mode is generally easier, but not enough sensitive in this case. So the air-coupled probes allow a better flexibility for the through-transmission mode.</p>
<p>Concerning the scanning speed, pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is clearly reduced when air-coupled techniques are used due to the much lower ultrasonic speed in air (340 m/s) compared e.g. to water (1500 m/s). In this case, the PRF is 100 Hz, which allows to reach a scanning speed of 100 mm/s with 1 mm step (with no averages on the signal). This is relatively slow, but since it can be automated, it is still compatible with the production cycle.</p>
<p>The proposed hybrid method has been firstly tested on a calibration composite sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1099636212456861">Figure 3(b)</xref>). The sample material is representative of real construction components, it is realized with a mix of CFRP and GFRP with size 270 × 470 × 30 mm. Simulated defects at different depths have been designed and realized using 4 Teflon inserts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1099636212456861">Figure 3(a)</xref>), later extracted to create air voids. An area of 100 × 370 mm has been inspected (yellow dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1099636212456861">Figure 3(b)</xref>).

<p>The map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1099636212456861">Figure 3(c)</xref> shows that in pulse echo mode without spherical cap it is possible to inspect all defects, their size and depth, respectively, at 5, 10, 15 and 20 mm from the surface using time of flight (TOF) measurement. This map can be used as reference indication of the actual defects. The C-scan performed with the hybrid configuration and spherical cap of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1099636212456861">Figure 3(d)</xref> confirms the accurate detection of the defects and of their size in the calibration test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1099636212456861"><title>Test samples and measurement set-up</title>
<p>The investigated test samples are fully representative of real structural elements used in civil infrastructures. The tests performed on two of them are here reported, each of them having a specific inspection challenge.</p>
<p>The sample #1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1099636212456861">Figure 4</xref> is a sandwich element with a very low density (40 kg/m<sup>3</sup>) of PUR core 50 mm thick and two skins of CFRP and GFRP with about 8 mm of thickness each. The core thickness decreases until the two skins curve and join in a monolithic panel, with a rough and irregular surface at the internal side of the curvature. In this case, the attention is focused on the inspection of the sandwich element and the core at its maximum thickness, which is impossible with techniques as thermography or shearography. This element is very difficult to be inspected also with ultrasonic techniques (in particular to detect delaminations between skins and core) because of the very high thickness, attenuation at the interfaces and irregular surfaces (here surface oscillations can reach some millimeters). The sample #2 is a laminate curve element with a mix of CFRP and GFRP fibers, the thickness is about 24 mm. In practice, this sample is used to evaluate if the proposed hybrid set-up for sample #1 can be used for all parts of the same complex component.

As previously discussed in literature (e.g. Reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1099636212456861">25</xref>]), even at 50 kHz air-coupled probes have problems in measuring cores with 80 kg/m<sup>3</sup> density. This would be feasible with contact probes, but these probes do not guarantee applicability on the curved irregular surfaces of the analysed structures.</p>
<p>A simple finite element analysis based on Comsol Multiphysics software was performed to evaluate the signal amplitude reaching the air-coupled probe after passing through the whole sample #1, so as to evaluate the required sensitivity. The used material parameters are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1099636212456861">Table 1</xref>. The properties for the air domain were taken from literature, while those of the PUR core material were provided by the manufacturer. The values for the composite material were experimentally determined: the velocity values by means of lab ultrasound test with contact and the density by means of the buoyancy method. For the solution on the discrete FE grid 12 degrees of freedom are guaranteed on the critical wave (i.e. in air) for the propagation direction. Results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1099636212456861">Figure 5</xref>) show that very tiny % of the input pressure is able to reach the receiving air-coupled probe.

where <italic>P<sub>t</sub></italic>, <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>i</sub></italic> are sound pressures of the transmitted, reflected and incident waves, respectively. In the present case, the signal reaches the receiving air-coupled probe after three interfaces: skin-core, core-skin and skin-air. The transmitted amplitude pressure is highly attenuated between skin-core (about 1% passes through) and between skin-air (about 0.016% passes through), as a consequence only about 0.00034% of the input pressure reaches the receiving air-coupled probe. This model can be used to estimate, as a function of the material parameters, the needed sensitivity in reception or (once the receiving sensitivity and the desired SNR are defined) the necessary input pressure (or intensity). In the present case, the input pressure was estimated from velocity Laser Doppler Virbometry measurements on the emitting transducer membrane. Using this input, it was found that only a few tenths of Pascal of pressure fluctuation arrives at the non-contact probe, this posing severe constraints to the required sensitivity, which is 3 mV/Pa for the air-coupled probe here used in reception. Due to the low signal amplitude, an important role is also played by the hardware instrumentation for acquisition, as low noise and high gain are required. A quantitative analysis of the pressure field by the FE model is useful for determining in complex problems the real applicability of air-coupled probes (e.g. the non-contact probe in reception in the hybrid set-up) unpredictable by means of analytical formulas and also for the simulation of the entire inspection process.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1099636212456861"><title>Simulated defect in the sample</title>
<p>In the sample #1, two simulated defects have been produced by drilling, one defect on the skin (10 × 30 × 2.5 mm) and one defect on the core (10 × 30 × 3 mm), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1099636212456861">Figure 6</xref>. The skin defect starts at 6 mm depth from the planar surface and finish at 2 mm depth and the core defect is 22.5 mm depth from the planar surface.

<p>In sample #2, a defect with size 11 × 28 × 2 mm has been realized in the curved part of the panel at about 12 mm from the top surface, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1099636212456861">Figure 7</xref>.

<p>It is important to underline that the defects searched in composite civil structures are usually larger than the defects searched on aeronautic structures (from 1 mm down to irregular porosities). Civil structures are heavier and thicker and have to bear different loading cycles with different defect propagation histories. According to end-users specifications in the Trans-Ind project, minimum relevant dimension in the order of 10 mm have to be detected (also on the core), but the shape of such panels is often very difficult to be inspected. However, a lateral resolution of few millimeters is required to have a good description of the defect shape so as to allow local repair to be performed and checked. This makes difficult the use of probes at frequencies well below 100 kHz. The defects simulated on the samples here analyzed are coherent with these specifications.</p>

<p>Sandwich elements are frequently used for high-dimension components as they allow combining low weight, high strength and good dynamic properties. NDT inspection in these cases is very challenging but important to ensure continued structural integrity. The defects that are normally found on these elements are delamination, inclusion, crack in the skin, but also void in the core.</p>
<p>In this section, the results achieved on the composite sandwich #1, using the proposed configurations as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1099636212456861">Figure 8</xref>, will be discussed. The ultrasound inspection was realized with a custom-made linear scanning system. The Cartesian robot moves automatically the ultrasound probes on the samples with a velocity of 100 mm/s. The inspection area, on the samples #1, was 50 × 74 mm (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1099636212456861">Figure 9</xref>). Measurements are taken with 1 mm resolution.

<p>Tests with two 100 kHz air-coupled probes in transmission mode showed that the transmitted energy was not enough to inspect the component. Comparative tests were also performed with active pulse Infrared Thermography (S40 Flir Camera and four 1 kW Infrared lamp) and air-coupled Pitch &amp; Catch ultrasound configuration (100 kHz air-coupled probes, same scanning system as above). The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1099636212456861">Figure 10(b) and (c)</xref> show that only the skin defect until about 4 mm deep from the surface can be detected for this sample.

<sec id="sec9-1099636212456861"><title>Pulse echo mode</title>
<p>The C-scan maps obtained in pulse echo mode using the contact transducer with and without spherical cap applied on the upper skin are compared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1099636212456861">Figure 10</xref>. The maps report the root mean square (RMS) signal amplitude, which is thus proportional to attenuation. A gain of 70 dB is used for the acquisition with and without spherical cap.</p>
<p>In both the maps, the presence of the defect on the skin (white area) is easily detectable; in fact, the signal amplitude is maximum in the defected area. It is interesting to note how in the right map of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1099636212456861">Figure 11</xref> the defect is better defined with dimensions closer to real ones. This improvement is due to the addition of the spherical cap which allows to have narrow measurement area (&lt;1 mm) with increased spatial resolution.
<fig id="fig11-1099636212456861" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><p>C-scan map on the sandwich component in pulse echo mode; left, 100 kHz probe without spherical cap; right, 100 kHz probe with spherical cap.

<p>The artificial defects have been realized with a drill bit of 2.5 mm of diameter. Actually, an array of holes have been made (30 mm deep) to have a 10-mm size defect. The map with spherical cap allows to see that the direction of the holes is not the same. This shows that the achievable lateral resolution with spherical cap is at least in the order of 2.5 mm, as details of such extension can be described. The average SNR measured on the ultrasonic signal is about 20 dB without cap and 17 dB with the cap, this showing that with the cap, even if the lateral resolution is improved, some energy is lost and therefore the focusing device can be further improved.</p>
<p>However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1099636212456861">Figure 11</xref> shows that the defect in the skin is easily detectable, but the defect in the core is not visible at all.</p>

<sec id="sec10-1099636212456861"><title>Through-transmission mode</title>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1099636212456861">Figure 12</xref>, the maps obtained on the same panel with the hybrid contact/non-contact through-transmission configuration are compared for the set-ups with and without the spherical cap (gain 70 dB).
<fig id="fig12-1099636212456861" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><p>C-Scan map on the sandwich component in through-transmission mode; left, 100 kHz probe without spherical cap; right, 100 kHz probe with spherical cap.

<p>In this configuration, where the signal amplitude at the receiver is attenuated in correspondence to the defects, both damages (core defect and skin defect) have been found with a fast and flexible scan. The size of the two defects are very similar between the maps with and without spherical cap. There is however a clear improvement in the map with spherical cap, where the edge effects are much less evident and artefacts are reduced, thanks to the small contact area in the emitting probe. Also, in this case it is confirmed that the SNR decreases with the spherical cap (from 19 dB without cap to 13 dB with cap), but it is still good enough to detect defects both in the skin and the core.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1099636212456861"><title>Analysis of results on the laminate curved panel (Sample #2)</title>
<p>In this section, the results achieved on the laminate curved panel #2, using the proposed configuration as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1099636212456861">Figure 7</xref>, are shown. In new bridge construction, the FRP composite panels (laminate) may be used in the entire structure, or they could be used as structural or reinforcing components. It is possible to easily realize elements with different shapes combining different material and thicknesses to have the required properties. Comparative inspections by Infrared thermography and shearography were not able to detect the defects, as positioned too deep (about 12 mm) with respect to the surface.</p>
<p>The inspection was performed in through-transmission mode with a step resolution of 1 mm; the inspected area was 30 × 40 mm. This component could be easily inspected with roller dry-coupled or phased-array probes, but the aim is to assess suitability for application on curved components with the same approach used for the thick sandwich, so as to have a unique flexible inspection system.</p>
<p>The scans were performed in semiautomatic mode since the used system allows only two degrees of freedom in a plane (along x and y axis, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1099636212456861">Figures 10(e)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1099636212456861">13</xref>) so, after each scan line along the y axis, the transducer was manually moved along z and rotated to keep perpendicularity between the probe and the sample surface. A calibrated pre-loaded spring on the probe seat can be easily used to keep the contact pressure constant. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1099636212456861">Figure 14</xref> shows the plot of both RMS amplitude and TOF, where the defect is clearly well detected, with the TOF the defect seems even more definite with improved lateral resolution.

<p>In this work, the problem of inspecting structural integrity of composite components with complex shapes for civil construction and infrastructures has been analyzed. For complex shape it refers to sandwiches with very thick and low-density core (down to 40 kg/m<sup>3</sup>) and the curved panels. These elements are very challenging for NDT at the state of the art.</p>
<p>After a review of available techniques, an original set-up for low frequency (100 kHz) ultrasonic inspection is proposed, which is based on a through-transmission hybrid configuration coupling a contact emitting probe with a non-contact air-coupled receiver. The use of a contact probe in emission is necessary to have enough energy to analyze thick components. The contact between probe and surface has been reduced and made smooth using a spherical cap, which was here tested also with a single probe in pulse echo mode. The non-contact probe in reception allows a better inspection flexibility on curved components.</p>
<p>The analysis of results, summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1099636212456861">Table 2</xref>, shows that the proposed method can efficiently inspect construction composites of complex shape with satisfactory SNR and lateral resolution (2–3 mm).
