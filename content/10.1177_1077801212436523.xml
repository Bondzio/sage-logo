<abstract>
<p>Social support is related to mental health outcomes among battered women. It is unclear, however, whether researchers should measure social support as a unidimensional or multidimensional concept. Efforts to identify the latent dimensions underlying a common measure of social support, the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL), have yielded inconsistent results. This study used exploratory factor analytic procedures to determine the most appropriate factor structure for the ISEL. The ISEL was completed by two samples (one help seeking, one non–help seeking) of primarily African American, low-income battered women who had experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) within the previous year. Results indicated that social support in battered women is best conceptualized as unidimensional.</p>

<body>
<p>Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a stressor that severely challenges an individual’s health and functioning and leads to serious health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212436523">DeKeseredy, 1988</xref>) and decreased quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212436523">Laffaye, Kennedy, &amp; Stein, 2003</xref>). A telephone survey in a large U.S. health plan sample linked past-year IPV to significantly increased risk of substance use, depression, anxiety disorders, and a wide range of medical conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212436523">Bonomi et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, an international interview study found IPV survivors to be more likely to have attempted suicide and more likely to report emotional distress, physical pain, and poor overall health among other psychosocial and medical problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212436523">Ellsberg et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Social support theories may be relevant to understanding the sequelae of IPV. One theory, the buffering model, posits that social support produces an increase in well-being for persons experiencing stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212436523">DeKeseredy, 1988</xref>). Social support involves a variety of types of interpersonal interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212436523">DeKeseredy, 1988</xref>), and has been conceptualized as a complex transactional process between a person and the environment involving network resources, supportive behavior, and appraisals of support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077801212436523">Vaux, 1988</xref>). In other words, social support involves access to and direct contact with people or agencies whose assistance is perceived as supportive.</p>
<p>Recent research suggests that social support can relate to mental health outcomes for IPV survivors in different ways. In a longitudinal study, perceived social support was associated with higher quality of life and lower depression, as a main effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801212436523">Beeble, Bybee, Sullivan, &amp; Adams, 2009</xref>). Social support also acted as a moderator in buffering the effects of psychological abuse on quality of life. Finally, effects of physical abuse on quality of life and depression were mediated by satisfaction with social support, perhaps because physical abusers isolate survivors from friends and other sources of support, which in turn has a negative effect on mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801212436523">Beeble et al., 2009</xref>). Conversely, a cross-sectional study of a community sample found a main effect of social support on mental health but no mediating effect of social support in the link between psychological abuse and mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077801212436523">Canady &amp; Babcock, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a substantial variability among researchers in how they conceptualize and measure social support. Different types of social resources can serve different support functions. Investigators have sought to reliably differentiate among these support functions because (a) different social support functions may have different effects in varying circumstances, (b) effectiveness of support functions may vary depending on the personality of the recipient, and (c) effects of different stressors may be buffered by particular support functions and not others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212436523">Schonfeld, 1991</xref>). One popular categorization scheme for conceptualizing social support was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212436523">Cohen and Hoberman (1983)</xref>. They divide an individual’s perceived availability of social resources into four categories: tangible (instrumental) support, the availability of material aid such as employment, financial resources, help with child care, and transportation; appraisal (informational) support, the availability of someone to talk to about problems; esteem support, the availability of positive comparisons to others; and belonging support, the availability of people with whom to do things. The Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212436523">Cohen &amp; Hoberman, 1983</xref>), a 40-item self-report measure of the perceived availability of social support resources, measures support in accordance with this four-factor structure.</p>
<p>Research on the factor structure of the ISEL has yielded inconsistent results. In the initial development of the ISEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212436523">Cohen &amp; Hoberman, 1983</xref>), as well as in a subsequent replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212436523">Cohen, Mermelstein, Kamarck, &amp; Hoberman, 1985</xref>), data indicated that the measure’s subscales were reasonably independent of one another, despite the moderate correlation of the belonging subscale with the tangible and appraisal subscales. However, in an attempt to validate the four-factor structure of the ISEL, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212436523">Rogers, Anthony, and Lyass (2004)</xref> were only moderately successful. They agreed that the items comprising the appraisal support and tangible support subscales were conceptually different but failed to find that items related to self-esteem support and belonging support measured distinct entities. They therefore combined the latter two subscales and used a three-factor model. Another study with the same purpose found that the appraisal, tangible, and belonging scales were moderately correlated and, therefore, concluded that the ISEL was not a multidimensional measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212436523">Schonfeld, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Another study used the ISEL to investigate the relative contribution of each subtype of social support in buffering the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in childhood sexual abuse survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212436523">Hyman, Gold, &amp; Cott, 2003</xref>). The most parsimonious model, based on the percentage of how much each subtype contributed to outcome, contained only the self-esteem and appraisal subtypes while the remaining two subtypes, tangible and belonging support, added little to the prediction of PTSD symptoms. Likewise, in a confirmatory factor analysis of the ISEL, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801212436523">Brookings and Bolton (1988)</xref> found large correlations among the four subscales of the ISEL, indicating the value of using it as a measure of a general social support construct.</p>
<p>Studies thus far have examined the factor structure of the ISEL in undergraduate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801212436523">Brookings &amp; Bolton, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212436523">Cohen &amp; Hoberman, 1983</xref>) or graduate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212436523">Schonfeld, 1991</xref>) students, and individuals suffering from severe mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212436523">Rogers et al., 2004</xref>). It is possible that the results of factor analyses differ depending on the population at hand and, therefore, that targets of intervention using social support may differ for various samples. An examination of the ISEL in a population of IPV victims may reveal unique properties of the measure that can guide the development of interventions for battered women in particular.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077801212436523">
<title>Current Study</title>
<p>In sum, social support is relevant to explaining variability in health outcomes experienced by IPV survivors, but it is not known whether social support in this population is best measured as a unidimensional construct. It is therefore important to identify the particular forms of social support used by battered women so that future research can examine their efficacy and interventions can be developed that foster use of the types of social support that are most effective in predicting adaptive long-term outcomes. Given the inconsistent results regarding the factor structure of the ISEL in non-IPV samples, the current study used an exploratory factor analysis to determine the most appropriate factor structure to use in studying the role of social support in IPV. It was conducted as part of two larger longitudinal studies investigating the experiences of battered women over time. One of the samples was a help-seeking population of battered women recruited from domestic violence courts and shelters, and the other was a non-help-seeking population recruited from the health care system. Research on battered women is typically conducted on women who came forward and sought help or shelter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801212436523">Jones, Hughes, &amp; Unterstaller, 2001</xref>), and it was thought that the inclusion of women who were both proactive in dealing with IPV and those who were not would create a more representative sample of the general population of battered women.</p>

<p>The court/shelter sample was 81% African American, 13% White, and 6% mixed or other races (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801212436523">Table 1</xref>). A majority of the women earned less than US$25,000 per year (86%). Most participants reported experiencing the most recent episode of violence within the past 3 months (82%), with 68 % of participants reporting the most recent occurrence of violence within the past month.</p>
<p>Participants from a Centers for Disease Control (CDC)–funded study were 396 women recruited from the health care system in another, nearby mid-Atlantic city. For this sample, participants were eligible if they were at least 18 years of age, had experienced IPV in the past 12 months, spoke English, and had access to a telephone. The sample was 96% African American, 2% Latina, and 2% members of other races (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801212436523">Table 1</xref>). The average annual income was between US$14,000 and US$15,000. A majority of participants reported the most recent occurrence of violence within the past 3 months (64%), 47% within the past month.</p>
<p>Participants from both studies were excluded from the study if they appeared to have an impaired mental status or appeared to be intoxicated. Participants received compensation after the completion of each assessment session.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1077801212436523">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Recruitment procedures were similar in the NIJ-funded (IPV help seeking; court/shelter sample) and CDC-funded (health care sample) studies. Undergraduate and graduate students were trained as research assistants to recruit participants and administer baseline semistructured interviews. Potential adult female participants were approached at each of the three court/shelter recruitment sites in the NIJ-funded study, and during a health care visit to one of three urban hospital emergency departments and clinics in the CDC-funded study. Prospective participants were asked if they were interested in being in a longitudinal study in which they would be paid for a series of five interviews over the course of 1 year in the NIJ-funded study, and three interviews over the course of 1 year in the CDC-funded study. Individuals who expressed an interest were asked screening questions to determine eligibility according to the inclusion criteria. Once eligibility was established, prospective participants were invited to participate and asked to sign a written informed consent. Interviewers responded to any questions about the study. Women who agreed to participate and signed the informed consent were then administered the initial on-site interview. The overall refusal rate in the NIJ-funded (IPV help-seeking sample) study was 29%, the most common cited reason being time constraints. The refusal rate was not recorded in the CDC-funded health care sample study.</p>
<p>Following administration of the interview, participants were debriefed and asked about any adverse effects they experienced and were offered follow-up referral information for community resources, such as hotline numbers, temporary housing, and legal aid. They were then reminded about follow-up interview procedures and asked for phone number(s) where they could be reached and the names and phone numbers of individuals who would likely know how to contact the participant if the primary numbers were no longer correct. Safety and confidentiality procedures for contacting and tracking women were modeled after the work of Sullivan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801212436523">Rumptz, Sullivan, Davidson, &amp; Basta, 1991</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801212436523">Gondolf (2000)</xref>.</p>
<p>Female graduate students in psychology with an interest in domestic violence were trained as research assistants to administer comprehensive interviews to participants over the phone. Participants were contacted via cell phone at 3-month intervals to complete follow-up interviews. Each interview required approximately 45 min to 1 hr to complete. Interviewers read interview items to participants and recorded information during the interview on standardized interview forms. Participants were asked to provide yes/no responses and quantitative responses using a 1-to-5 Likert-type scale, as well as narrative responses to open-ended questions. Informed consent was obtained and safety was ensured prior to interview administration at each time period. Participants earned US$20 for completing the first four interviews and US$50 for completing the final interview in the NIJ-funded study. Participants earned US$20 for completing the first two interviews and US$50 for completing the third, final interview in the CDC-funded study. For the purposes of this study, data collected at baseline (initial interview, conducted upon recruitment into the study or as soon as possible thereafter, and within 12 months of the occurrence of violence) were examined.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section6-1077801212436523">
<title>Social support</title>
<p>The ISEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212436523">Cohen et al., 1985</xref>) is a 40-item true–false instrument. For descriptive purposes, we report a total score consisting of the proportion of items endorsed; thus, 0.00 would reflect a complete absence of perceived social support, and 1.00 would reflect endorsement of every social support item. The items are counterbalanced so that half are positive and half are negative statements about social relationships. Participants are asked to respond to statements about their relationships with people other than their abusive partner. The ISEL measures the perceived availability of social resources in four categories: tangible support (the availability of material aid such as help with transportation, child care, and finances), for example “there is <italic>no one</italic> I can trust to give me good financial advice” (reverse scored) and “if I got stranded 10 miles out of town, there is someone I could call to come get me”; appraisal support (the availability of someone to talk to about one’s problems), for example “there is <italic>at least one person</italic> I know whose advice I can really trust” and “I feel that there is <italic>no one</italic> with whom I can share my most private worries and fears” (reverse scored); esteem support (the availability of positive comparisons to others), for example “I am more satisfied with my life than most people are with theirs” and “most of my friends are more interesting than I am” (reverse scored); and belonging support (the availability of people to do things with), for example “I <italic>don’t</italic> often get invited to do things with others” (reverse scored) and “there are several different people with whom I enjoy spending time.” Each category is measured via a 10-item cluster of questions. In some cases, item wording was changed slightly to reflect more sensitively the low-income status of our participants. For example, the item that refers to “no one to go to the beach with” was reworded to “no one to go out of town with for the day.”</p>
<p>Test-retest reliability coefficients for the ISEL range from .70 in an unselected community sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212436523">Cohen et al., 1985</xref>) to .81 in a homeless sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212436523">Bates &amp; Toro, 1999</xref>).</p>

Given the lack of consensus among previous studies regarding the appropriate factor structure of the ISEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801212436523">Brookings &amp; Bolton, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212436523">Cohen &amp; Hoberman, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212436523">Rogers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212436523">Schonfeld, 1991</xref>), and as this is the first time the structure of the ISEL has been evaluated on a sample of female victims of IPV, it was not possible to justify an a priori model of the measure’s underlying factor structure. Therefore, data from both study samples were subjected to exploratory factor analytic techniques. Exploratory factor analysis examines the underlying patterns or relationships among a large set of variables to determine whether the information can be condensed into a smaller set of factors that account for the pattern of correlations among the measured variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212436523">Fabrigar, Wegener, MacCallum, &amp; Strahan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212436523">Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, &amp; Tatham, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>All exploratory factor analyses were carried out using principal factor analysis (also called principal axis factoring, or PAF) extraction and promax rotation to ensure interpretability. PAF was chosen because it does not require that the data meet the assumption of multivariate normality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212436523">Fabrigar et al., 1999</xref>); it often results in similar solutions to the more commonly used principal components analysis (PCA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212436523">Costello &amp; Osborne, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212436523">Fabrigar et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077801212436523">Field, 2000</xref>). We elected not to use PCA because it is a method of component analysis rather than common factor analysis and is not designed to identify unobservable factors from which observed behavioral variables can be derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801212436523">Jolliffe, 2004</xref>). PCA is appropriate when the goal of the analysis is data reduction, and there is prior knowledge suggesting that specific and error variances are only a small proportion of the total variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212436523">Bryant &amp; Yarnold, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212436523">Hair et al., 2006</xref>). As the goal of the current analysis was data structuring, or detecting latent dimensions (principal factors) represented in a set of original variables, and there was little preexisting knowledge about the amount of specific and error variances present, PAF was preferable.</p>
<p>Promax is an oblique method of rotation; oblique rotation was considered more appropriate than orthogonal rotation for the current purposes because there were empirical and theoretical grounds for supposing that any factors underlying the ISEL would correlate with one another. Prior research on the ISEL factor structure has demonstrated correlations among subscales when they have emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212436523">Cohen &amp; Hoberman, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212436523">Rogers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212436523">Schonfeld, 1991</xref>). Furthermore, like many psychological constructs, it was reasonable to assume that the underlying dimensions of social support would be related to one another. Therefore, oblique rotation would provide a better representation of reality than orthogonal rotation (which presupposes that emergent factors are uncorrelated), and would consequently produce a better simple structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801212436523">Conway &amp; Huffcutt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212436523">Fabrigar et al., 1999</xref>), meaning that each factor is comprised of a subset of variables with high factor loadings, and the rest with low factor loadings, and that each variable has high loadings on only some factors and low loadings on the rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212436523">Fabrigar et al., 1999</xref>). Promax rotation has been recommended as a good choice of oblique rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212436523">Stevens, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212436523">Thompson, 2004</xref>) and is suitable for large data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077801212436523">Field, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Initial factor analyses of the ISEL in both samples extracted factors using the default Kaiser criterion of retaining eigenvalues greater than 1.00. Although this cutoff criterion is the most widely used, it has been criticized for inaccurately identifying the correct number of factors in a data set, in that it consistently overestimates the number of factors to retain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077801212436523">Lance, Butts, &amp; Michels, 2006</xref>). It is also important to note that certain conditions must be met in order for the Kaiser rule to accurately determine the number of factors to retain. Specifically, retaining factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.00 will be most accurate for sample sizes greater than 250 when the mean communality is greater than or equal to .60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212436523">Stevens, 1986</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801212436523">Cattell’s (1966)</xref> scree test has been recommended as an alternative method of determining the optimal number of factors to retain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212436523">Costello &amp; Osborne, 2005</xref>). This test is unlikely to considerably distort results when the sample size is greater than 200 and there are reasonably large communalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212436523">Stevens, 1986</xref>). In the current study, if the mean communalities failed to meet the suggested .60 threshold in the initial factor analyses which extracted factors based on their eigenvalues, the scree test was subsequently used as a more reliable determinant of the optimal number of factors to retain. This procedure of using multiple methods to determine the number of factors is a common and recommended practice in the methodological literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212436523">Fabrigar et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Other important statistics to take note of after factor extraction are each variable’s extracted communality, or the amount of its variance that can be accounted for by the factors, and the percentage of variance in the measure accounted for by all extracted factors. In general, variables should have communalities greater than .50 to be retained in the analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212436523">Hair et al., 2006</xref>). Although there does not currently exist one general cutoff or threshold, it has been recommended that in the social sciences a factor solution that accounts for 60% of the total variance is considered satisfactory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212436523">Hair et al., 2006</xref>). These guidelines were taken into consideration in the determination of the number of distinct factors contained in the ISEL.</p>
<p>All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 15.0 for Windows XP.</p>

<title>Descriptive Data and Internal Consistency</title>
<p>In the court/shelter sample, the mean total ISEL score was 0.68 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.23, range = 0.05-1.00), meaning that participants endorsed about two thirds of the true/false ISEL items in a direction indicative of greater social support. The health care sample ISEL mean was 0.56 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.09, range = 0.18-0.85). Cronbach’s alpha was high in both the health care (α = .91) and court/shelter (.93) samples.</p>

<sec id="section11-1077801212436523">
<title>Factor Analyses</title>
<p>The initial factor analyses of the ISEL in the court/shelter and health care samples extracted 9 and 11 factors, respectively, using the Kaiser criterion of retaining eigenvalues greater than 1.00. Whereas the court/shelter and health care sample sizes exceeded the sample size threshold (406 and 396, respectively) for relying on eigenvalues to determine factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212436523">Stevens, 1986</xref>), the mean communalities did not (.458 and .463, respectively). Therefore, the scree test was used to determine the optimal number of factors to retain.</p>
<p>Visual examination of the scree plot in the court/shelter sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077801212436523">Figure 1</xref>) suggested one major point of inflection, or point at which the curve flattens out, which occurred between the first and second factors. This would suggest the presence of only one factor. This conclusion is supported by the fact that all of the extracted factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.00 cumulatively accounted for only 45.8% of the variance in the original variables, which is lower than the recommended minimum (60%) in social science research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212436523">Hair et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, only 14 of the 40 variables had communalities greater than .50, suggesting that a subthreshold amount of variance in most variables could be explained by the retained factors. Taken together, these statistics indicate that retaining additional factors, and thereby interpreting the ISEL as a multidimensional measure, would not reproduce sufficient information or variability to be noteworthy.</p>

<p>Visual examination of the scree plot in the health care sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077801212436523">Figure 2</xref>) also suggested one major point of inflection between the first and second factors, indicating the presence of only one factor. Like the results of the factor analysis in the court/shelter sample, this also implies that the ISEL is unidimensional in nature. Furthermore, the 11 extracted factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.00 cumulatively accounted for only 46.3% of the total variance in ISEL items, leaving a substantial proportion of variance (53.7%) unexplained. Again, only 14 of the 40 variables had communalities greater than .50, suggesting that the retained factors did not explain a sufficient amount of the variance in most variables.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study explored the factor structure of the ISEL, a commonly used social support measure, in female victims of IPV. Previous studies examining the dimensionality of the ISEL have endorsed a variety of factor structures, ranging from one- to four-factor models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801212436523">Brookings &amp; Bolton, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212436523">Rogers et al., 2004</xref>). Results of the current exploratory factor analysis in samples of low-income, primarily African American battered women indicated that the most parsimonious model of the ISEL contains a single underlying factor. In other words, the ISEL, when used to assess social support in battered women, is most appropriately conceptualized as having a unidimensional structure. Therefore, this study did not replicate previously differentiated subscales considered by other researchers to represent distinct entities that contribute sufficient additional information to be considered unique and interpretable. Specifically, the four categories of support function (tangible support, appraisal support, belonging support, and esteem support) intended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212436523">Cohen and Hoberman (1983)</xref> to comprise the ISEL in its initial development were not observed.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that the most informative use of the ISEL in samples of battered women is as a unidimensional measure that represents a unitary construct of social support. This implies that interventions for battered women should focus on the importance of the <italic>amount</italic> of social support available in battered women’s lives, rather than the <italic>type</italic> of social support. This coincides with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801212436523">Cohen and Wills’ (1985)</xref> assertion that “although support functions can be distinguished conceptually, in naturalistic settings they are not usually independent” (p. 313), and is consistent with prior research that has concluded that the ISEL does not measure independent support functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212436523">Schonfeld, 1991</xref>), as well as with research demonstrating significant correlations among factors when they have emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801212436523">Brookings &amp; Bolton, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212436523">Cohen &amp; Hoberman, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212436523">Schonfeld, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to note that the participants from both samples in the current study were primarily low-income, African American women. On one hand, this is a limitation in that the findings could be specific to this group of individuals and may not generalize to individuals from other ethnic and racial backgrounds (e.g., Whites). It would be worthwhile for future research to repeat this study in different populations of battered women to explore the similarities and differences regarding the nature of social support across diverse samples. On the other hand, our focus on low-income, minority women can be seen as a methodological strength of the study. Low-income, minority women are a subset of battered women at particular risk for adverse outcomes associated with IPV. They are more likely to experience negative mental health outcomes and less social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077801212436523">Thompson et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, results of the factor analyses indicate that in the samples of female victims of IPV, it is most appropriate to conceptualize the ISEL as having a single underlying construct, and therefore research would benefit from examining how the level, rather than type, of social support relates to outcomes in battered women.</p>
