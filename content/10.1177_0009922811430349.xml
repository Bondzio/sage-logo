<title>Case Presentation</title>
<p>An 11-year-old African American female with no significant past medical history presented to the clinic for evaluation of edema for 1 week. She had an afebrile upper respiratory infection 2 weeks prior to admission. Rapid strep test was negative and no specific treatment was required. A few days later she developed progressive facial and lower extremity edema, abdominal distension, and a mild decrease in urine output for the last 2 days. Patient denied any respiratory distress, abdominal pain, or fever. There was no history of gross hematuria or dysuria. No history of arthralgia, rash, or oral ulcers. She denied taking any medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Family history was unremarkable. On physical exam, she was an obese female with anasarca. She weighed 86 kg (&gt;95%) and her blood pressure was 110/67 without an orthostatic component. She had moderate facial and periorbital edema, pitting edema in her lower extremities and abdominal distension. No lymphadenopathy was appreciated. Laboratory evaluation showed that her creatinine was 0.9 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 5 mg/dL, albumin 1.1 g/dL with normal liver function tests. White blood cell count was 5.000/µL with normal differential, and hemoglobin of 12.5 g/dL. Urine analysis showed +3 protein, with protein/creatinine ratio of 12.3, and no red blood cells. Urine pregnancy test was negative. Lipid panel showed triglycerides 245 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein 46 mg/dL, and low-density lipoprotein 340 mg/dL. The C3 level was 185 mg/dL (normal range 82-180 mg/dL) and C4 was 44 mg/dL (range 18-45 mg/dL). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 103 mm/h, and C-reactive protein was 0.4 mg/dL. Her ANA, HIV Elisa and hepatitis B/C panel were all negative. Lupus panel came back negative for lupus antibodies (anti ds-DNA, anti-SSA, anti-SSB, anti-smith, anti-cardiolipin, JO-1 antibodies, and lupus inhibitor antibodies). Serum immunoglobulin titers showed IgG 394 mg/dL (range 595-1275), IgM 140 mg/dL (range 28-184), and IgA 142 mg/dL (range 43-207). Renal ultrasound showed a horseshoe kidney, with normal echogenicity of renal parenchyma and no hydronephrosis. Patient underwent a kidney biopsy, which showed diffused and marked increase in mesangial cellularity with segmental endothelial proliferation and capillary basement membrane thickening with occasional wire loops. There were no glomerular crescents. Interstitium showed mild to moderate increase in connective tissue, along with a patchy infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922811430349">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0009922811430349">2</xref>). Immunofluorescence studies showed deposition of IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, and C1q.</p>

<title>Final Diagnosis</title>
<p>Based on kidney biopsy findings, the patient is diagnosed with diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis (World Health Organization class IV).</p>

<sec id="section4-0009922811430349">
<title>Hospital Course</title>
<p>She was started on an immunosuppressive course of pulse methylprednisolone for 3 doses, oral mycophenolate mofetil (cellcept), and prednisone. She was also treated with a few days of furosemide to improve her edema. Patient improved clinically during her hospital stay, maintaining stable kidney function and blood pressure.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a constellation of findings that consists of significant proteinuria (protein/creatinine ratio &gt;2, or &gt;1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d), hypoalbuminemia (&lt;2.5 g/dL), dyslipidemia, and generalized edema. The glomerular diseases that cause NS can be divided into primary and secondary causes. Primary causes include minimal change disease (MCNS), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy (MN), and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). Secondary causes include lupus nephritis, Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP), infections (HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis), and malignancy. MCNS is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children, but it usually presents at an earlier age (2-8 years) and has normal pathology under light microscopy. FSGS is more common in African American patients with pathognomonic segmental scarring of the glomerulus. MN, although uncommon in children, has been reported in the literature as one of the etiologies of NS patients with horseshoe kidney.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811430349">1</xref></sup> MPGN is another uncommon cause of NS during childhood and is associated with low complement levels. For our patient, the presence of diffuse segmental proliferative glomerulonephritis with a “full house” immunoglobulin deposition is compatible with lupus nephritis, despite the fact that she had no serologic evidence of systemic lupus erythematous (SLE). Lupus nephritis patients may not fulfill SLE criteria at presentation but they tend to develop other symptoms of lupus in the following months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811430349">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although only 20% of SLE cases occur during childhood, the disease is usually more severe with high risk of tissue damage, and requires aggressive immunosuppressive treatment to control its activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811430349">3</xref></sup> Lupus nephritis occurs in about 50% of SLE patients and can present with a picture of acute glomerulonephritis, proteinuria, severe hypertension, and acute renal failure. The World Health Organization has divided lupus nephritis into 6 classes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922811430349">Table 1</xref>) based on renal pathology findings, and it is well known that the class of nephritis can change during the course of the disease. In children, the most common variant is class IV (diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis), which carries the worst prognosis. Despite the recent advances in immunosuppressive therapy, its success is limited by the increased risk of infections, ovarian toxicity, and residual lupus nephritis activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811430349">4</xref></sup> About 20% of SLE patients fail to respond immunosuppressive protocols and progress to end-stage renal disease, requiring dialysis and kidney transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811430349">5</xref></sup></p>

<p>Treatment of lupus nephritis requires intense immunosuppressive therapy with close monitoring for possible complications related to SLE or its treatment, with a multidisciplinary team approach. The choice of immunosuppressive medication is based on the severity of renal injury (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922811430349">Table 1</xref>). Inflammatory markers and autoantibody titers are followed during treatment to monitor response and possible flares.</p>

<sec id="section6-0009922811430349">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Lupus nephritis should be included in the differential diagnosis of NS, especially in African American females. On the other hand, patients can present with isolated lupus nephritis without systemic disease. Pediatric SLE is often aggressive and requires intensive immunosuppressive therapy to control activity and to decrease its morbidity and mortality.</p>
