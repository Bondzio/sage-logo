<abstract>
<p>The pre-Civil War leaders of Princeton Seminary desired social reform and progress, but these had to come gradually and non-disruptively. Thus while Charles Hodge and his colleagues looked for an end to slavery at some indefinite time in the future, they supported in the meantime the colonization of free blacks in Africa and fought immediate emancipation. They likewise opposed full equality for women. A properly ordered society, they believed, involved “social subordination”—of humanity to God, woman to man, children to parents, slaves to masters, and the morally unfit and uneducated to the best and brightest.</p>

<p>The bicentennial of Princeton Seminary’s founding in 1812 offers opportunity for the school to celebrate its heritage, and this is entirely appropriate. A rich legacy of theological scholarship, a commitment to joining learning and piety, the influence of the school upon thousands of graduates who have gone forth from Princeton to serve around the world—these and many other aspects of the seminary’s past deserve remembrance and honor. But the bicentennial must be more than a time of institutional self-congratulation; it should also provide occasion for sober reflection upon aspects of the seminary’s history from which those of us who love the school may be tempted to avert our eyes. Among these are the response of the seminary’s leaders to questions of slavery, race, and gender in pre-Civil War America.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0040573612453162"><title>Presbyterians, Princeton Seminary, and the Problem of Slavery</title>
<p>In 1818, six years after the founding of the seminary, the Presbyterian General Assembly had a serious moral issue thrown into its lap. It was asked to rule whether a church member, selling a slave who happened to be a fellow believer, should be brought to discipline if the slave did not wish to be sold. The General Assembly referred the issue to a committee chaired by Ashbel Green, President of the College of New Jersey (Princeton) and also president of the seminary’s Board of Directors. The often-cited introduction to the report, passed unanimously by the assembly, asserted,<disp-quote>
<p>We consider the voluntary enslaving of one part of the human race by another, as a gross violation of the most precious and sacred rights of human nature; as utterly inconsistent with the law of God, which requires us to love our neighbour as ourselves, and as totally irreconcilable with the spirit and principles of the gospel of Christ, which enjoin that “all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.”</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The report then declared that it was the clear<disp-quote>
<p>duty of all Christians … to use their honest, earnest, and unwearied endeavours, to correct the errors of former times, and as speedily as possible to efface this blot on our holy religion, and to obtain the complete abolition of slavery throughout Christendom, and if possible throughout the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573612453162">1</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The level of antislavery commitment behind these stirring words should not be overestimated, for the report made clear that “as speedily as possible” did not mean any time soon. “The number of slaves, their ignorance, and their vicious habits generally,” said the assembly, “render an immediate and universal emancipation inconsistent alike with the safety and happiness of the master and the slave.” Moreover, the Green committee’s report expressed sympathy with the plight of those “portions of the church and our country where the evil of slavery has been entailed upon them,” and it warned “others to forbear harsh censures, and uncharitable reflections on their brethren, who unhappily live among slaves, whom they cannot immediately set free.” In other words, the assembly saw slaveholders as themselves slaves of a sort caught in a system they did not create, their predicament calling for compassion not condemnation. The judicatory recommended several tangible steps to ameliorate the suffering of black Americans. Presbyterians might “patronize and encourage the society lately formed, for colonizing in Africa, the land of their ancestors, the free people of colour in our country.” Masters were also encouraged to instruct their slaves in Christianity and to keep their families intact.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040573612453162">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The General Assembly’s statement represented a transitional moment when antislavery sentiment was turning from optimism to caution. “Everywhere in the country,” historian Gordon Wood has written of the 1780s, “most of the Revolutionary leaders assumed that slavery was on its last legs and headed for destruction.” Between 1777 and 1804, northern states outlawed slavery or provided for the gradual emancipation of those in bondage. Even in the South, particularly the Upper South, many felt the institution to be waning. In some places the strict slave codes passed at the beginning of the eighteenth century were laxly enforced. Virginia, Delaware, and Maryland passed laws making it easier for masters to free slaves, and there was often talk in the South of the eventual demise of the institution. Then in 1807, largely with southern acquiescence, Congress outlawed the foreign slave trade. But as early as the 1790s, there were also signs of growing wariness about antislavery rhetoric. The slave rebellion in the French colony Saint-Domingue (Haiti) and later in 1800 the revolt in Henrico County, Virginia, led by the artisan slave Gabriel made many Southerners uneasy with loose talk about freedom or ameliorating the condition of slaves. Laws now obliged free blacks to carry papers or wear patches proving their freedom, and Virginia in 1806 passed a statute requiring that freed slaves depart the state. Also with the invention of the cotton gin and the opening of new territories east of the Mississippi River, the use of slave labor spread rapidly and became more—not less—entrenched in southern economy and society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040573612453162">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>One organization addressing this issue was the American Colonization Society, formally launched in January 1817. It was the ACS that the General Assembly endorsed a year later in its pronouncement on slavery because of the group’s goal to colonize “in Africa, the land of their ancestors, the free people of colour in our country.” One of those who played a role in the founding of the ACS was Robert Finley, a Presbyterian minister in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, a graduate of Princeton College, and a director of Princeton Seminary. Archibald Alexander, the seminary’s initial professor, later claimed that Finley called the “first public meeting which ever took place to consider the subject of African colonization in this country,” that it occurred in the Presbyterian Church in Princeton, and that “most of the professors of the college and theological seminary” attended. Contemporary scholarship has played down the role of Finley and has seen the religious impulse as less central to the society’s founding than the desire to rid the country of a potentially dangerous underclass of freed blacks. In fact, the widespread appeal of colonization in the early nineteenth century was its ability to blend together a variety of purposes and motives. The movement drew some who genuinely wished to improve the condition of blacks, others who were eager to purge the nation of its free black population, and many who no doubt wished to do both. Since the society did not challenge the property rights of slaveholders or brand them as sinners, it attracted less controversy than did the later abolitionist movement of the 1830s which demanded the immediate, uncompensated emancipation of slaves. Many prominent figures from Henry Clay to Millard Fillmore and Harriet Beecher Stowe endorsed the colonization cause, and even in the midst of the Civil War President Lincoln initially toyed with the idea.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040573612453162">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The depth of commitment within the seminary faculty to the colonization scheme was attested by the huge tome that Archibald Alexander wrote tracing the origins and progress of the movement. At more than six hundred pages, <italic>A History of Colonization on the Western Coast of Africa</italic> (1846) was by far his largest book. Various passages in the work hint at the appeal of colonization to Alexander. His bedrock conviction was the impossibility of blacks and whites living together on an egalitarian basis.<disp-quote>
<p>Two races of men, nearly equal in numbers, but differing as much as the whites and blacks, cannot form one harmonious society in any other way than by amalgamation; but the whites and blacks, in this country, by no human efforts, could be amalgamated into one homogeneous mass in a thousand years; and during this long period, the state of society would be perpetually disturbed by many contending factions. Either the whites must remove and give up the country to the coloured people, or the coloured people must be removed; otherwise the latter must remain in subjection to the former.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Unable to envision an egalitarian biracial society in the United States, Alexander concluded that “we can confer a real benefit on the African race in no other way than by separating them from the whites, and removing them to the country of their fathers.” Alexander did not ponder the (in)justice of racial prejudice, considered any struggle to overcome it futile, and in the end turned to a long view of history to construct a theodicy of slavery in which the sufferings borne by blacks were rationalized by God’s ultimate purpose. “Why many of this unhappy race were ever permitted to be brought to America,” he explains, “begins now to appear. They were sent here by a benignant Providence overruling the wicked passions of avaricious men, that they might be christianized and civilized, and might carry back to their benighted countrymen, the principles of religion, freedom, and representative government.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040573612453162">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>How strong the hold of colonization was in Princeton may be judged by the fact that as late as 1877—12 years after the close of the Civil War—Professor Alexander T. McGill of the seminary preached to the Colonization Society meeting in Washington, DC, and lauded the fact that it continued its work. In that year when the remaining northern troops were withdrawing from the South and the last of the Reconstruction governments fell to “Redeemers” determined to restore white supremacy, McGill asserted that politics, constitutional amendments, and a federal army of occupation could do no more on behalf of the African American. “No remedy here [within the United States] can advance him another step,” McGill suggested, “no mechanism of party can put on him the true habiliment of manhood. We must send him home [to Africa], when he is willing to go, and see that his home is attractive and safe, as it was not when he was torn from it and sold from bondage to bondage.” Whatever one’s assessment of the intentions of Archibald Alexander, A.T. McGill, and others, colonization ultimately functioned as a way of defusing or evading protest against slavery, racial prejudice, and discrimination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040573612453162">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The seminary’s approach to matters of slavery and race also derived from its geographic location and its institutional connections. During the school’s first half century, slavery in New Jersey was not yet dead. In 1804, a law decreed that all persons born to slaves after July 4 of that year would be free people; however, they remained bound to serve their mother’s owner until adulthood—men until 25 years of age, women until 21. Those already in bondage in 1804 remained so until their deaths. When the state decided in 1846 to abolish slavery in name, those still in bondage remained permanent “apprentices.” As late as 1860, the federal census still recorded a handful of slaves in New Jersey. Moreover, both the college and the seminary had significant numbers of students from slaveholding states. The numbers fluctuated from year to year, but from the 1820s through the 1840s the seminary usually drew between 20 and 30 percent of its student body from these areas. The bond with the South was more, however, than a matter of having to accommodate the views of a student constituency from below the Mason–Dixon Line. It was also an issue of accountability, for as the seminary of the entire Presbyterian Church, Princeton was ultimately controlled by a General Assembly containing numerous representatives from the South.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040573612453162">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The seminary’s involvement with slavery was also personal. Archibald Alexander had served a Virginia church which owned slaves, possibly during his pastorate; and when he and his wife Janetta moved to a Philadelphia church some years before he became the seminary’s first professor, they brought a slave who later returned to Virginia. Samuel Miller, the seminary’s second professor, grew up in a slaveholding family in Delaware. As a pastor in New York city before coming to Princeton, he had spoken against slavery as an evil, but he espoused the gradualist philosophy of emancipation and did not consider it a violation of his principles when he later used slave labor in Princeton. As his son wrote, “during the earlier part of his residence in New Jersey, [Miller] at several times held slaves under the laws providing for the gradual abolition of human bondage.” In these instances, he had them “only for a term of years” except for one instance in which the seller lied about the status of a slave whose age made him liable to service for life. Without such labor, noted the son, “it was difficult otherwise to secure domestics.” Because of the same difficulty, Charles Hodge also resorted to slave labor. In 1828, to provide assistance to his wife with household chores, he purchased a 16-year-old female who had five years to labor before being set free; and he may also have rented from the owner a slave named Cato, perhaps to help Hodge with the fields that he farmed near his house.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0040573612453162">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0040573612453162"><title>In What Sense Was Princeton Seminary Antislavery?</title>
<p>Despite their personal and ecclesiastical entanglements, Alexander, Miller, and Hodge continued to endorse a <italic>mildly</italic> antislavery view. They looked toward the gradual and eventual demise of human bondage, regarded the repatriation of freed blacks to Africa as a valuable step in the right direction, and believed that in the meantime the holding of slaves was not a sinful act. While this outlook was in sync with what many Protestants then believed, a more strident kind of antislavery came to the fore in the late 1820s and early 1830s. Among urban African Americans in the North opposition to colonization mounted, typified by works such as Presbyterian minister Samuel Cornish’s <italic>Freedom’s Journal</italic> and David Walker’s <italic>Appeal</italic>. In large measure because of stiffening resistance in the black community, a few white opponents of slavery began rethinking their own positions. The American Antislavery Society, formed in 1833, unequivocally condemned slaveholding as a sin and rejected colonization as a bogus reform; it distracted from the true moral imperative: <italic>immediate</italic> emancipation of the enslaved. Although some in the AAS and its leader William Lloyd Garrison eventually turned to heterodox religious views and attacked the churches for their reticence to be forthrightly antislavery, much of the initial inspiration for abolitionism came from the spiritual energy generated by the revivals of the Second Great Awakening. Within the Presbyterian Church, this new outlook resulted in demands for a statement against human bondage more vigorous than the 1818 deliverance. For example, in 1835 the Presbytery of Chilicothe (Ohio) asked the General Assembly to declare that “buying, selling, or holding slaves, for the sake of gain, is a heinous sin and scandal,” that trying to capture a runaway slave is “a scandalous sin,” and that bequeathing slaves as property in one’s will “is a great sin.” With this sort of antislavery, the majority in the assembly—as well as the faculty at Princeton Seminary—were distinctly ill at ease.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0040573612453162">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1836 Charles Hodge took up his pen to write for the <italic>Biblical Repertory</italic> a lengthy essay detailing what he believed to be the proper attitude toward the question of slavery. On the basis of this piece and several others, contemporary historian Larry Tise includes Hodge in a gallery of those whom he calls “early Northern proslavery ideologists.” The classification is at once accurate and seriously misleading. The description is correct insofar as Hodge insisted that slavery was nowhere in the Bible condemned as sinful in itself. According to the Gospel accounts, Jesus never censured slaveholding, though he lived in a world where the institution abounded, and elsewhere New Testament authors enjoined slaves to obey their masters. The Old Testament recognized and regulated the institution. “If God allowed slavery to exist,” Hodge observed, “if he directed how slaves might be lawfully acquired, and how they were to be treated, it is in vain to contend that slaveholding is a sin, and yet profess reverence for the scriptures.” Nor would the Princeton professor allow that slavery was wrong because it “interferes with the natural rights of a portion of the community.” Every society “from the freest democracy to the most absolute despotism” curtailed natural rights to a greater or lesser degree.<disp-quote>
<p>In England one man is born a peer, another a commoner; in Russia one is born a noble, another a serf; here one is born a free citizen, another a disenfranchised out-cast (the free coloured man), and a third a slave. These forms of society … are not necessarily just or unjust; but become the one or the other according to circumstances.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In short, natural rights—whether of slaves, women, children, or certain people deemed unfit to vote—could be legitimately curtailed based upon what a society felt was consistent with its interest at a given point of development. At bottom, Hodge suggested that the fundamental error of abolitionism was to confuse abuses of the slave system—for example, cruel treatment of those in bondage—with the institution itself. One should no more attack slavery as sinful in itself because some masters failed to practice the system in a humane way than one should reject parenthood as immoral because some men were bad fathers. Thus far Hodge had said nothing inconsistent with what the most ardent “proslavery ideologists” of the South themselves had said.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0040573612453162">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>But the argument took an unexpected turn. Near the close of his article he declared that he trusted no one would take the essay to mean “that we regard slavery as a desirable institution or that we approve of the slave laws of the southern states.” In fact, he professed to wish “the extinction of slavery” as much as any abolitionist. His difference with the abolitionists concerned means. The “true method of Christians” in addressing the subject was “to enforce as moral duties the great principles of justice and mercy, and all the specific commands and precepts of the scriptures.” “If it be asked,” Hodge continued, “what would be the consequence of thus acting on the principles of the gospel, of following the example and obeying the precepts of Christ? We answer, the gradual elevation of the slaves in intelligence, virtue and wealth; the peaceful and speedy extinction of slavery.” The South’s choice lay “between emancipation by the silent and holy influence of the gospel, securing the elevation of the slaves to the stature and character of freemen, or to abide the issue of a long continued conflict against the laws of God.” If the latter option were taken, Hodge had no doubt the result would be “disastrous,” possibly “a desolating servile insurrection.” Here Hodge touched a nerve, for memories remained vivid of Saint-Domingue and more recently of the 1831 uprising led by slave preacher Nat Turner in southside Virginia. If someone objected that the elevation of slaves to the status of freemen might also entail their full citizenship, Hodge answered succinctly: “We admit that it is so.” This conclusion to an essay, most of which was given to demolishing the case for abolitionism, would indeed seem to merit Allen Guelzo’s assessment: “That Hodge could move almost at once from marshalling together Christ and the apostles to defend slavery, to a moment of apparently sober entertainment of emancipation and civil rights presents a double somersault of dizzying proportions.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0040573612453162">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>From Hodge’s perspective, however, he was not doing somersaults. To change the metaphor, he was pointing to a sane, conservative middle road to social improvement. Unlike proslavery apologists who argued that the institution was a positive good for society and should be maintained indefinitely, Hodge believed that it was far from ideal and would someday end. But it would not terminate by denouncing slaveholders as moral criminals; abolitionists had actually impeded progress toward emancipation by producing “a state of alarming exasperation at the south, injurious to the slave and dangerous to the country.” In their eagerness to end human bondage, they forgot that Christianity “was never designed to tear up the institutions of society by the roots.” Christianity uplifted society by the gradual, almost imperceptible suffusion of its values. With some alterations about specifics, Hodge continued to argue for what he deemed a common-sense middle path that would lead to the end of slavery without conflict. In 1844 he again expressed a belief that slavery could not last forever. “The only question is, how is it to end?” If slaves were deliberately kept “degraded,” this policy would be “only to treasure up wrath for the day of wrath.” But if Americans chose instead “to instruct, to civilize, to evangelize the slaves, to make them as good as we can, intelligent, moral, and religious,” then the result “must be peace, a good conscience, and the blessing of God”—not to mention a gradual elevation of slaves to freedom in a way that did not rend the fabric of society. In 1849 he reasserted that “gradual improvement must lead to gradual emancipation,” but by then he was no longer hinting at full citizenship for freed slaves. With warnings that the amalgamation of blacks and whites “must inevitably lead to the deterioration of both and fill the country with a feeble and degraded population,” he reaffirmed the supposed panacea of colonization in Africa.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0040573612453162">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>To those of a later era, the limits of the approach of Hodge and his colleagues to the question of slavery are all too painfully apparent. When they viewed the problem of slavery, they wanted a gradual non-disruptive end to slavery—an end that would not tear apart the church, the seminary, or the nation. Looking for ways toward this increasingly elusive goal, they arguably exhibited a measure of genuine concern about the welfare of African Americans and desired a better future for them. And it is noteworthy that Princeton Seminary admitted its first African American student in 1825 in the person of Theodore Sedgwick Wright—at a time before other theological schools were prepared to do so. Yet the presence of Wright notwithstanding, the Princeton theologians were engaged chiefly in conversations within a <italic>white</italic> community of discourse; black Christians were not included as partners in the conversation. They were the objects of decisions which others—white others—would make about them. The voices of the increasingly vibrant black communities of the 1820s and 1830s were not heard. Hodge saw in his 1836 article a brief glimmer of blacks as full participants in civic life and decisions, but that status was one for which he thought the black community unready at present. For the moment, the voice of society at large—that is, white society—had to make all the choices. In his 1849 article touching on emancipation and colonization, Hodge went to the heart of what he understood to be the relationship between the white and black communities:<disp-quote>
<p>The slaves in this country are in a state of pupillage. They are minors. They stand in that relation of dependence and inferiority in which a state of minority essentially consists. They may therefore be rightfully treated as minors and disposed of without their consent in any way consistent with benevolence and justice. If a great good to them as well as to those they leave behind be designed in their removal, there is no principle of right violated in their expatriation.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>At least at that moment and by his own description, Hodge’s approach to African Americans rested on undiluted paternalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0040573612453162">13</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0040573612453162"><title>Princeton on the Role of Women in Church and Society</title>
<p>Even as slavery and African Americans presented a challenge to Princeton’s vision of an orderly America moving forward judiciously, so too did questions about the proper role of women. From the considerable research that has been done on women’s history (and, more recently, on men’s history) perhaps the one nearly universal conclusion is that gender is an historical construct. That is, except for basic physical differences, most of what people take to be the natures of men and women and their proper social functions are not determined by biology but are the product of particular cultures in specific times and places. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, definitions of gender were in flux. The older notion of the male as patriarch of the family continued in virtually all quarters, but the idea was compromised and softened in significant ways, especially in middle- and upper-class communities. The romantic love and companionship uniting husband and wife—as well as woman’s role as mother—assumed heightened importance. In the Revolutionary era, writers argued that republican motherhood required women to train their children in the virtues essential to the new political order. By the middle of the nineteenth century this ideal had transmuted into a Victorian cult of domesticity in which the wife and mother re-created in the home a little bit of Eden before the fall, a place of calm in the midst of the hurly-burly of the competitive (male) world. Increasingly regarded as naturally more attuned to religious matters than men, women would find their calling in the spiritual nurture of their families and in the promotion of benevolent causes. These changes in perceptions of the role of women contributed to important transformations in the learning available to them. In the eighteenth century, women were often schooled somewhat haphazardly, but in the early nineteenth they had greater opportunity to acquire a liberal education comparable to what men might attain in academies or even colleges. If women were to be genuine companions to their husbands, to fulfill the imperatives of republican motherhood, or to exercise spiritual influence upon society, did they not also need an education of wider scope?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0040573612453162">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although these views have sometimes been interpreted to mean that women were being excluded from a public role and confined to the private realm, the reality was far more complex. For example, republican mothers may have invested themselves chiefly in childrearing but ultimately that activity had public significance. Likewise the religious and benevolent concerns believed to lie within the special province of women pointed outward into the world as well as into the home. Virtually everyone agreed that women could form voluntary societies to help with the relief of the poor, to support home or foreign mission, or to educate the young. But some women carried religious influence into more controversial areas as they formed organizations to combat prostitution, support abolitionism, or promote temperance. Were they simply following the logic that women were called to exert moral influence or were they transgressing into forbidden territory? It was not always easy to tell when the line had been crossed, and debates over such questions frequently occurred.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0040573612453162">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Conservative visions of domesticity seemed to fade the further one went from the center of cultural and religious prestige to the periphery. As Catherine Brekus has documented, upstart religious groups of the early 1800s—for example, the Christian Connection, the Freewill Baptists, the Methodists, the African Methodists, and the Millerite movement which looked for the return of Christ in the early 1840s—produced more than a hundred women preachers. Likewise, one could point to the women’s rights activists, including Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who gathered at Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848 and issued <italic>The Declaration of Sentiments</italic> in which they affirmed that “woman is man’s equal,” that man “has usurped the prerogative of Jehovah himself, claiming it as his right to assign to her a sphere of action, when that belongs to her conscience and her God.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0040573612453162">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Where did Princeton stand on these issues? Samuel Miller’s <italic>Brief Retrospect of the Eighteenth Century</italic> (1801) provides the starting place for an answer. Noting that “it is much less than a hundred years since female education was lamentably, and upon principle, neglected,” he rejoiced that in his own lifetime the problem had begun to find remedy. Now women’s educational opportunities had improved dramatically, and “female talents [were] more justly appreciated”—a fact which “perhaps … better [than any other] establishes the claim of the eighteenth century to much progress in knowledge and refinement.” Miller’s endorsement of the change was not, however, without fear that sometimes the transformation in attitude toward women had run into “certain extravagant and mischievous doctrines.” As a case in point, he named Mary Wollstonecraft whose <italic>Vindication of the Rights of Woman</italic> (1792) championed an end to hierarchical relationships between men and women and called for an age of genuine equality. In her Miller saw arguments that would destroy all intellectual differences between men and women and open all “the duties and offices of life” to men and women alike. Miller was prepared to concede that women, “if it were practicable or proper to give them, in all respects, the same education as that bestowed on men, would probably discover nearly equal talents, and exhibit little difference in their intellectual structure and energies.” He wanted, he insisted, “to see females receive the best education which their circumstances will afford,” especially in view of their duty “of enlightening and informing the minds of the young.” In some instances it was even appropriate to have women study topics such as mathematics and metaphysics, often restricted to men. What Miller could not tolerate was any education of women premised on the breaking down of distinct gender roles. He offered a lurid description of where such confusion would lead:<disp-quote>
<p>Let us suppose the various stations of civil trust to be filled indifferently by men and women; the places destined for the instruction of lawyers, physicians, and surgeons, to be occupied by a jumbled crowd of male and female students …. What would be the consequence of these arrangements? It would convert society into hordes of seducers and prostitutes.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Miller was turning to a ploy used not only by men but also by conservative women in the nineteenth century whenever they opposed women participating in a particular reform: to go beyond a certain point was to descend into gender confusion and immorality. What is easily forgotten in the midst of Miller’s overheated and melodramatic rhetoric is that he <italic>was</italic> championing a broader education for women and a broader sphere of usefulness for them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0040573612453162">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>One gets a sense of what that broader but still limited sphere might be by looking at the activities of his wife, Sarah Sergeant Miller, after the couple moved to Princeton. In 1816 she helped to form the Female Benevolent Society which aimed to relieve the poor, provide care for the sick, and to educate indigent children. As president of the society she lobbied the First Presbyterian Church to provide the land on which to erect a school building. She was also involved in the creation of the Mount Lucas Orphan and Guardian Institute near Princeton and helped secure a financial endowment for it. When the Mount Lucas organization later closed, she arranged for the endowment to be transferred to the Ashmun Institute, founded in 1854 in Chester County, Pennsylvania, and subsequently renamed Lincoln University. Ashmun was created to provide higher education for African Americans. In addition to these activities Sarah Miller supported—and often taught in—Sunday Schools that educated Princeton’s black and white children.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0040573612453162">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>From a brief account of the seminary published in 1822, one also learns of another acceptable outlet for women’s benevolence: raising money to help the seminary. “The greater part … of the support which has been hitherto furnished to indigent students, in this institution,” said the report, “has been derived from the contributions of female cent societies, in different parts of the church.” In fact, “the liberality of pious females” had played an important role in supporting 16 students, and the account went on to plead for the organization of still other societies of this sort. Thus long before women were students or faculty at Princeton Seminary, they were helping to sustain it by their financial support.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0040573612453162">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Speaking in late August 1825 to a Princeton women’s organization supporting a female mission school in India, Ashbel Green emphasized both the imperative—and the limits—of women’s engagement in benevolent activity. Green believed that women’s participation in so many different kinds of societies augured “a better age approaching” and proceeded to note the role women had played in supporting missions and other benevolent causes. But one thing was abundantly clear: women “are in no case to be public preachers and teachers, in assemblies promiscuously composed of the two sexes.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0040573612453162">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>For the leaders of old Princeton, the Pauline injunction against women speaking in the church was decisive in determining the status of women. But why these texts and not others that spoke of women prophesying or speaking in tongues in front of what, in nineteenth-century parlance, were called promiscuous assemblies? Princeton certainly believed that the Lord had caused women to do these things, but they had done so in the days of revelation and miracles when God sometimes suspended the usual rules of nature. The era of supernatural wonders, however, had ceased, and now on “ordinary occasions,” said Ashbel Green, women “are absolutely required not to speak, but to keep silence in the churches.” Also in this interpretation was the belief that common-sense observations from nature and history supported the subordination of women. Charles Hodge, for example, said of the command that women should be subject to their husbands,<disp-quote>
<p>The ground of the obligation, therefore, as it exists in nature, is the eminency of the husband; his superiority in those attributes which enable and entitle him to command. He is larger, stronger, bolder; has more of those mental and moral qualities which are required in a leader. This is just as plain from history as that iron is heavier than water …. This superiority of the man … cannot be denied or disregarded without destroying society and degrading both men and women; making the one effeminate and the other masculine.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Hodge also insisted that, even as the woman was subject to her husband, she was also exalted “to be the companion and ministering angel” to him. The way in which Hodge elided these nineteenth-century assumptions about gender with biblical passages about women and men—and thereby reified them as eternal verities—would seem to illustrate the dictum of Clifford Geertz: “Common sense is not what the mind cleared of cant spontaneously apprehends; it is what the mind filled with presuppositions … concludes.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0040573612453162">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>What the Princeton professors believed about the role of women and what they believed about slavery were at the end of the day of a piece. In an 1844 article Charles Hodge identified the connection when he uttered one of his most savage condemnations of the abolitionist movement. “They seem to consider themselves above the scriptures, and when they put themselves above the law of God, it is not wonderful that they should disregard the laws of men.” That rejection of the law of God manifested itself in “anarchical opinions about human governments, civil and ecclesiastical, and on the rights of women.” “Let these principles be carried out,” he thundered,<disp-quote>
<p>and there is an end to all social subordination, to all security for life or property, to all guarantee for public or domestic virtue. If our women are to be emancipated from subjection to the law which God has imposed upon them, if they are to quit the retirement of domestic life, where they preside in stillness over the character and destiny of society, if they are to come forth in the liberty of men, to be our agents, our public lecturers, our committeemen, our rulers; if, in studied insult to the authority of God, we are to renounce the marriage contract, all claim to obedience, we shall soon have a country over which the genius of Mary Wolstoncraft [<italic>sic</italic>] would delight to preside, but from which all order and all virtue would speedily be banished.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0040573612453162">22</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The thread running through this attack was Hodge’s fear of “an end to all social subordination.” A properly ordered society consisted of a series of such relationships—of humanity to God, woman to man, children to parents, slaves to masters, the morally unfit and uneducated to the best and brightest. He perceived abolitionism as the symptom of a disordered egalitarianism. By 1838, William Lloyd Garrison and his supporters had taken control of the American Antislavery Society and were pushing a sweeping platform of reform: abolitionism, nonresistance (i.e. pacifism), women’s rights, religious heterodoxy, attacks on all churches that failed to sever their involvement with slaveholders, and attacks upon the moral legitimacy of the federal constitution because the US constitution recognized slavery. There was in abolitionism a tendency toward anarchism, but Garrison and others like him did not interpret this stand as a repudiation of legitimate authority. Rather they saw themselves tearing down all the intermediate and illegitimate forms of coercion standing between the individual and God. For the Princeton Seminary leadership, it was, of course, quite otherwise. They believed in the possibility of genuine reform and progress, but it had to come step by step <italic>through</italic> not around or over the existing relationships of society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0040573612453162">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>In viewing these aspects of Princeton Seminary’s past and depending upon our own theological views, we in the twenty-first century will have differing responses to our nineteenth-century forebears. Those sympathetic to the Old Princeton theology may be tempted either to ignore its notions about race, slavery, and gender or to offer extenuations for them. Others, already inclined to dislike Hodge and company, will probably find additional reason to dismiss them as theological mossbacks unworthy of contemporary attention. Neither response allows the history of Old Princeton to teach us about the complicated ways in which cultural assumptions, the structures of society, and the place we occupy in society inevitably shape the ways in which we hear the gospel and perceive its imperatives. If we learn those lessons, perhaps we shall also learn one of humility. If well-meaning people in a previous age adhered to views that many of us now find patently wrong, we well may ask, What deficiencies and injustices will posterity find in our theologies and in our ethics?</p>
