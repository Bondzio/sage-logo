<abstract>
<p>Enrico Norelli argued in 2003 that the references to martyrdom in the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> are symbolic rather than actual. This article challenges his reliance on the Mishnah in support of the assertion that Isaiah dies as a martyr in the contest between true and false prophecy in the second-century church. It argues that the progress of thought in chs. 1–5 suggests that martyrdom is more obviously an actual and recent feature of the authors’ experience than a merely symbolic entity. The martyrdom of Ignatius is further considered in this context. This result is the insistence that the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> has a strong ‘political’ dimension in both of its halves. Such evidence must be inserted into the evaluation of the emerging Christian movement, not least in its response to both Jews and the Romans as factors external to, yet bearing on, the church, at the time of writing.</p>

<body>
<p>The beginning and the end of the last century both witnessed important initiatives in the study of the early Christian apocalypse known as the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic>. In 1900 R.H. Charles published a critical edition and partial commentary, based on a revision of the critical theories advanced by the earlier scholars F. Lücke and H. Ewald.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0142064X13481411">1</xref></sup> In 1995 a new critical edition appeared in the CCSA series, together with a substantial <italic>Commentarius</italic> by Enrico Norelli.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0142064X13481411">2</xref></sup> Much of the intervening period, by contrast, marked a lull in <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> studies, in which the theory of a Qumran provenance appeared and then disappeared, and various suggestions were made about the Jewish, Christian, Gnostic and other alleged provenances of the text.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0142064X13481411">3</xref></sup> This hiatus for nearly a century is to be explained by the observation that New Testament scholarship undoubtedly moves in fads, and that much of the pseudepigraphal literature has received less attention than it deserves; and also by the internal difﬁculties of this apocalypse, which by common consent was written in Greek, but which has survived only in a number of translations, posing difﬁcult textual problems, especially in the second half of the work (chs. 6–11).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0142064X13481411">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Norelli has thus done the world of scholarship a great service by drawing attention to neglected literature, and by attempting to set this text in the context both of a satisfying literary theory and then against an early Christianity which had already developed a variegated self-understanding, not least in Antioch. My own published dissertation was written largely in ignorance of Norelli’s work, which I regret but which reflects the time-gap involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0142064X13481411">Knight 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0142064X13481411">1996</xref>). In an article published in 2003, Norelli did me the honour of reviewing my thesis and of ﬁnding some issues with it which prompted a response that he devoted to what he called the ‘political issue’ of the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic>. Norelli acknowledged that he had not himself considered this aspect of interpretation in his earlier publications. Since the political outlook of earliest Christianity is increasingly recognized as an important one,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0142064X13481411">5</xref></sup> and since Norelli makes a number of points on which debate might proﬁtably be conducted, I would like to offer this reply which I hope will be a further step towards reaching a consensus on the outlook and interpretation of this neglected apocalypse. This discussion can then be factored into the wider discussion surrounding early Christianity, where it is certain that the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> has its own distinctive contribution to make.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0142064X13481411">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>This article has four sections, corresponding in part to the order of engagement that Norelli proposes in his article. I shall examine Norelli’s theory of composition, then the content of chs. 1–5, next the identiﬁcation of what I shall choose to call ‘opponents’ in the apocalypse; and ﬁnally, the neglected function of the work’s ideology, discussion of which, I shall argue, must reflect the process of composition in which the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> was possibly written. I should start by saying that I believe that much of what Norelli says is correct, particularly his theory of a ‘two-stage’ composition for the work. However, I think that clariﬁcation is required in more than one area, and that his rejection of a martyrdom setting—actual or potential—for the apocalypse does less than justice to the flow of thought in chs. 1–5, and to what appears to be the orientation of the ﬁnal apocalypse. I also think that the work’s status as <italic>political ideology</italic>, of whatever kind, has been almost entirely neglected in research in a way which I hope will make the present contribution helpful and which of itself corrects a deﬁciency in research to date. Accordingly, I begin with an assessment of Norelli’s theory of composition, including a discussion of the degree of certainty with which this approach to the text can be sustained.</p>
<sec id="section1-0142064X13481411">
<title>A Satisfying Theory of Literary Composition</title>
<p>Norelli has done much to establish a consensus in his approach to the apocalypse. Writing in criticism of me, he observes that the ﬁrst step in interpretation post Charles, and then again post the 1981 conference on the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic>, is to develop what he calls ‘a satisfying theory of its literary composition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142064X13481411">Norelli 2003</xref>: 268). Norelli himself has tried to do this in his various publications, resulting in the ‘two-stage’ theory of composition mentioned above.</p>
<p>Such a theory is needed because it helps to explain the terms in which the apocalypse should be read; in particular, the enigmatic relationship between its two halves (chs. 1–5 and 6–11) and the implied dominance of chs. 1–5 which, though chronologically later (1.1; cf. 6.1), are set ﬁrst and to that degree determine the progress of thought in the apocalypse. I hold such ‘progress of thought’ to be an important factor in all interpretation of the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic>.</p>
<p>It is now universally agreed that the views of R.H. Charles, which determined the scholarly approach to the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> for nearly a century, cannot be accepted today. Charles drew on an earlier attitude both to the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> and to the apocalyptic literature in general to assert that our text represents the soldering together of three earlier documents: the <italic>Martyrdom of Isaiah</italic>, the <italic>Testament of Hezekiah</italic> and the <italic>Vision of Isaiah</italic>. This view was comprehensively criticized at the 1981 conference.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0142064X13481411">7</xref></sup> Mauro Pesce observed that the Isaiah traditions in the apocalypse combine elements from the <italic>two</italic> forms in which these circulated in Jewish tradition, making it much more likely that the authors drew on oral tradition than on any written document as such.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0142064X13481411">8</xref></sup> This conclusion is upheld in further publications by Norelli and A. Acerbi,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0142064X13481411">9</xref></sup> while my own research has drawn attention to the intertextual elements in ch. 5, which show that this section has a Christian and clearly not a Jewish origin with its allusions to the death of Jesus as well as Isaiah (not to mention the reference to Peter’s martyrdom in 4.3). The <italic>Martyrdom of Isaiah</italic> theory has now quite certainly made its departure from scholarly research on the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic>.</p>
<p>The theory of the <italic>Testament of Hezekiah</italic> can be cogently criticized by observing, very simply, that this material is neither testamentary in form nor attributed to Hezekiah as subject. It is a Christian eschatological prophecy which sits quite neatly in the present context of the Isaiah traditions. Although the sources for chs. 6–11 have proved to be more contentious, and indeed the construction of this section is open to debate, again there is an emerging view that the theory of Jewish <italic>Urtext</italic> for these chapters is wrong-headed, and that this material is better explained as a new composition based on a variety of oral sources as well as knowledge of the Hebrew scriptures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0142064X13481411">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>This brings us to the present generation of scholarship, where there is a dispute about authorship between Enrico Norelli and Richard Bauckham.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0142064X13481411">11</xref></sup> Bauckham believes that the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> was written all of a piece, citing the example of the book of Daniel as evidence for this type of composition. Norelli, by contrast, prefers the theory of a two-stage composition in which chs. 6–11 were written ﬁrst, in the late ﬁrst century <sc>ce</sc>, and chs. 1–5 later than this, in the early second century <sc>ce</sc>; although in response to Bauckham’s essay, Norelli acknowledges that the latter’s date for the apocalypse in the decade 70–80 <sc>ce</sc> is not impossibly wrong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142064X13481411">Norelli 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Among the others who have worked on the apocalypse, both Bob Hall and myself are content with a ‘two-stage’ theory of composition, not least because of the really quite obvious differences between the two halves and the different situation which these seem to attest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0142064X13481411">12</xref></sup> I remain happy with the outlines of Norelli’s theory, although disputing certain essentials, and especially with a date for the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> in the early second century <sc>ce</sc>. The generally accepted provenance is Syria, and so presumably Antioch—the city of Ignatius.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0142064X13481411">13</xref></sup> Norelli’s view, which is an important one, is that chs. 6–11 form ‘une sorte d’appendice’ to the ﬁnal work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0142064X13481411">Norelli 1993a</xref>: 9). On this hypothesis, a well-known mystical narrative was taken up and reused in the early second century. It follows that we must look to chs. 1–5 to determine the actual <italic>Sitz im Leben</italic> of the apocalypse, which chs. 6–11 are now made to support despite a possibly quite different setting originally. I therefore turn to the ﬁrst half of the text to see what it tells us about the circumstances that prompted the apocalypse.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0142064X13481411">
<title>The Setting of Chapters 1–5</title>
<p>Once Charles’s view of chs. 1–5 is called into question, it becomes possible to see this material coherently and to attempt a holistic exegesis of it. It will be helpful to read through this section and to follow the narrative signs.</p>
<p>The work opens with a meeting between Hezekiah and Manasseh, in the presence of Isaiah and Josab, in which the reigning king warns his son about his future behaviour. <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> 1.3-4 in many ways sets the scene for everything that follows. Hezekiah speaks to Manasseh about ‘(the words concerning) the judgements of this world and the torments of Gehenna, which is the place of punishment for (the ruler) of this world, his angels, dominions and powers; and the words describing faith in the Beloved One which he himself had seen in the ﬁfteenth year of his reign during his illness; and the words describing faith in the Beloved One which he himself had seen in the ﬁfteenth year of his reign during his illness’.</p>
<p>This summary—attributed to Hezekiah, not to Isaiah—anticipates <italic>both</italic> halves of the apocalypse. It clearly could not have derived from a Jewish <italic>Martyrdom of Isaiah</italic>. The ‘words describing faith in the Beloved One’ refer to chs. 6–11. The words ‘the judgements of this world and the torments of Gehenna, which is the place of punishment for (the ruler) of this world, his angels, dominions and powers’, by contrast, anticipate chs. 1–5. They warn the reader that what follows will be dominated by eschatology, and that the punishment of the ‘ruler of this world’ and his cohorts is the principal feature of interest in this section. This outlook is conﬁrmed by the summary of Isaiah’s prophecy in 1.5, which is said to concern ‘the judgement of the angels, the destruction of this world, the robes of the saints and their exit and transformation’. We should note that this summary superﬁcially coheres with the outlook of chs. 6–11, where the Most High instructs the Beloved One to ‘judge and destroy the princes, angels and gods of that world and the world which is controlled by them’ (10.12), besides also anticipating the eschatology of 4.14-18. The apocalypse has been carefully constructed to relate its two different halves at least to some degree.</p>
<p>Isaiah warns Hezekiah that his words will have no effect on Manasseh. The prophet predicts his own martyrdom in that context: ‘Sammael Malkira will serve in Manasseh and will do everything he wants, and he will be a follower of Beliar rather than of me. He will cause many in Jerusalem and Judah to desert the true faith; Beliar will settle on Manasseh and I will be sawn asunder at his hands’ (1.8-9).</p>
<p>While the demonology of the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> is not systematic, ch. 1 nonetheless outlines a coherent picture of action which determines what will follow in the apocalypse. This is that the work concerns the opposition to the faithful Christians (those who retain ‘faith in the Beloved One’) at the hands of Manasseh, a ruler, under demonic inspiration. That will lead to Isaiah’s own martyrdom which is predicted in 1.9 and is said to be accomplished following Beliar’s incarnation (4.2-4) in ch. 5. The statement of 1.9 is indubitably clear: ‘He will cause many in Jerusalem and Judah to desert the true faith’. <italic>Ab initio</italic>, the apocalypse is said to describe the assault on the religion of Hezekiah and Isaiah, which centres on faith in the Beloved One (as described supremely in chs. 6–11), by more powerful human beings (a king, 2.1; cf. 4.2-4) who are inspired by low-ranking cosmic beings (cf. 7.9-12). The narrator introduces both a dualistic anthropology and a spatially oriented cosmology in this context whereby, as will be reported later in 3.13-18 and again on the basis of chs. 6–11, the Beloved One comes from the seventh heaven to accomplish his unique and community-deﬁning revelation on the earth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0142064X13481411">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>What is predicted in ch. 1 turns out exactly in ch. 2. Manasseh becomes king: ‘Manasseh turned his heart to serve Beliar; for Beliar is the wicked angel, the prince of this world, whose name is Matanbekus. He rejoiced in Jerusalem because of Manasseh, strengthening Manasseh in the apostasy and the wickedness that was widespread in Jerusalem’ (2.4). The result is that the prophets become marginalized and they retreat to the desert (2.7-11), where they found an alternative community characterized by belief in ‘the ascension into heaven’ (2.9).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0142064X13481411">15</xref></sup> Following harassment there by a false prophet called Belchira, and despite textual unclarity in the second half of ch. 3, Isaiah is arrested and brought before Manasseh to answer the charge of treason (3.6, 10) and of falsely claiming mystical prowess beyond what Moses had allowed in the Torah (3.8-10). The charge of treason is mentioned twice, conﬁrming that it is important in this context in the apocalypse. Isaiah is held to have predicted the destruction of Jerusalem and the capture of the king, in a criticism of the prophet which again is said speciﬁcally to have been inspired by Beliar (3.11).</p>
<p>It is worth briefly observing that the authors here twist Moses to assert the actuality of Isaiah’s mysticism. The evidence of Exod. 24.10 that Moses and the elders ‘saw the God of Israel’ is ignored in favour of the assertion of Exod. 33.20b (‘no man shall see my face and live’), which in its original context is incomplete without the earlier passage. The upshot is that Moses’ authority is challenged, in what would seem to be a rejection of the truth-claims of contemporary Judaism (cf. 4.21-22).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0142064X13481411">16</xref></sup> More than one opponent is thus identiﬁed in the apocalypse; our interpretation must be sufﬁciently broad to accommodate this diversity, whatever else is said on the basis of 3.21-31 about the problems of conflict within the Christian community.</p>
<p>The Christian eschatological prophecy begins in 3.13 and continues until 4.22. Norelli appropriately raises the questions of what lies behind this material, and where in this scheme the authors think that they are standing. In answer to the ﬁrst question, he asserts:<disp-quote>
<p>[The author] probably shared with his community a pattern of the last times embracing three stages: ﬁrst, an increase in lawlessness (<italic>anomia</italic>), false prophecy, corruption, and mutual hate; then the coming and the domination of the Antichrist with an extreme reduction in the number of believers; and ﬁnally, the coming of the Lord. Such a structure is perfectly clear in <italic>Didache</italic> 16. A comparison between the <italic>Didache</italic> and the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> shows that both of them go back to the same apocalyptic pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142064X13481411">Norelli 2003</xref>: 274-75).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I have no cause to dispute this analysis, but I hold it important to draw attention to the <italic>form</italic> in which this eschatology is set as well as to the traditional nature of the eschatological material itself. The form of 3.13–4.18 is that of a ‘four-membered’ review of history in which a time of increasing decline leads directly to supernatural intervention, which is expected in 4.14. We ﬁnd the origins of this type of belief in Judaism in the book of Daniel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0142064X13481411">17</xref></sup> Thus Dan. 2 divides history from the exile to the time of writing into four periods, Dan. 7 picks up this scheme of four empires, while there is a similar (though more complex) presentation in Dan. 10–12. Daniel is speciﬁcally mentioned in <italic>Asc. Isa</italic>. 4.22, encouraging the conclusion that it was an important text for the authors of our apocalypse. I think that Norelli has possibly underestimated the influence of this four-membered scheme in the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic>, where it determines the flow of thought in the middle part of chs. 1–5. In the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> these four periods are: (1) the time of Jesus, 3.13-18; (2) the apostolic age, 3.19-20; (3) the sub-apostolic age, 3.121-31; and (4) the eschatological future, with flashback, 4.1-13. The last of these four periods is expected to be followed by the <italic>parousia</italic> and Beliar’s removal to Gehenna (4.14-18).</p>
<p>The force of this scheme is that it allows the authors to describe both present and future history according to more than one type of traditional influence. There is the impact of the three-stage view which is held in common with the <italic>Didache</italic> and to some degree also with Mt. 24.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0142064X13481411">18</xref></sup> However, there is also the impact of the four-membered scheme which was derived from the book of Daniel, and which determines the form rather than directly the content of this section. In terms of the presentation of material in this part of the apocalypse, it is the second of these and not the ﬁrst which determines the flow of thought in 3.13–4.18. The upshot is that the authors have committed themselves to a particular kind of historical review: one in which there is a progress of decline as history moves away from the Golden Age and towards the eschatological climax. The essentially Christian scheme of Antichrist and apostasy has been expressed in terms of the originally Jewish scheme of progressive decline which allows for supernatural intervention as the only possible remedy.</p>
<p>In asking why this scheme was adopted, we should note my earlier comment about the broadly based nature of the opposition and the generally world-negating nature of the eschatology, not least through comparison with the setting of Daniel. I shall have more to say about this in the next section of this article. The apocalypse represents the literature, I suggest, of a ‘cognitive minority’ who were learning to deﬁne their place in the world by identifying and distancing a variety of other people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0142064X13481411">19</xref></sup> The Danielic scheme of interpretation allowed the delineation of a pious group who believed that both co-religionists and their external influencers had erred or were in danger of erring—possibly both—from what the authors regarded as the correct path of Christian discipleship inherited from Jesus and the apostles (cf. 3.13-20; 4.3). In the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic>, this view is related to the phenomenon of martyrdom which runs like a crimson thread through the apocalypse. For this reason, we need to study the progress of thought in chs. 1–5 very carefully.</p>
<p>Norelli’s second question—that of where in this scheme the authors believe they are standing—is answered by himself and most commentators with reference to the third member, 3.21-31. This describes life in the sub-apostolic age when, as is acknowledged, the apostles had passed from the scene. This period is described as the turning-away from the apostolic example, and one where the repression of prophecy features prominently (3.31). In the ﬁrst half of ch. 4, Norelli holds that the authors peer into mythological future, which describes the activity of the Antichrist. Of this period, he asserts:<disp-quote>
<p>[T]he passage about Beliar/the Antichrist, far from bringing in a second theme, viz. the criticism of the Roman Empire and its politics against Christians, is quite consistent with the theme of the destiny of prophecy. It functions to reassure the author’s prophetic group that, although they are opposed by church leaders, they are on the side of right like Isaiah, who was persecuted and killed by the king of Israel and his false prophets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142064X13481411">Norelli 2003</xref>: 276).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I would like to put six points to Norelli in response to this exegesis. The ﬁrst concerns his interpretation of 3.21-31, where I agree (as previously) that it describes the authors’ own time. The actual content of this section is given by its beginning and end: by the reference to ‘the prophecy (teaching E) of the twelve apostles and their faith, their love and their purity’ (3.21), and then by the statement that ‘they will make of no effect the prophecies of the prophets who were before me; and my visions too they will set aside to say whatever pours out from their heart’ (3.31). In both cases, we have a reference to other parts of the apocalypse. The apostolic teaching is described in 3.19-20 and, we should say on the basis of 3.18, in 3.13-18; the apostles’ perseverance is described supremely in the martyrdom reference of 4.3. The ‘prophecies of the prophets who were before me; and my visions too’ looks back to the two summaries of ch. 1, and also to the content of Isaiah’s vision as described in chs. 6–11, not to mention the list of inspired writings in 4.21-22. In both cases, teaching about the Beloved One, his martyrdom and his victory over the angels forms the heart of the material concerned.</p>
<p>This is something more substantial than the complaint that people in the church were suppressing prophecy alone. It concerns the entire content and interpretation of the Christian faith and the fact that people were preferring to speak a variety of things, suggesting disunity, the form of which is summarized in 3.25 in the complaint: ‘there will be much person-pleasing in those days, and those who love the glory of this world’. <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> 3.25 has an external face which directs the criticism outwards rather than narrowly inwards. It suggests accommodation to the realm of Beliar <italic>in toto</italic>, not the mere bickering about different understandings of prophecy. This observation must be factored into exegesis of 3.21-31 where, I suggest, it represents a signiﬁcant statement.</p>
<p>A second point is that, undeniably, there is a difference in the understanding of prophecy between the two halves of the work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0142064X13481411">20</xref></sup> In chs. 6–11 we ﬁnd a description of mystical ascension to the seventh heaven through which authoritative revelation is secured. While it is not certain that this section describes anything other than a unique and unrepeatable experience of revelation, the belief that this had once been possible is the dominant feature of this section. The problem is that this experience is reported on several occasions in chs. 1–5 (ch. 1; 3.13; 5.1), but that it is never described there as a matter of contemporary experience. The allusion to Isaiah’s vision is always in the past, much as Hezekiah has passed from the scene (2.1) like the apostles themselves (3.21; cf. 4.3). The understanding of prophecy in chs. 1–5 is given by the allusion to ‘the ascension into heaven’ (2.9) and by the list of inspired writings in 4.21-22, from which the Torah is signiﬁcantly omitted. ‘Prophecy’ is now understood as exegesis of the sacred writings with a distinct Christological emphasis; the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> foreshadows Justin Martyr in this.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0142064X13481411">21</xref></sup> Thus we should speak not so much of a dispute between rival prophetic groups in 3.21-31 as of a broader shift in the understanding of prophecy between the two halves of the apocalypse which the authors themselves acknowledge in their writing. The rejection of prophecy of which 3.21-31 speaks is related to this Christological emphasis; it anticipates the description of Antichrist which follows. People reject such teaching by failing to do what Isaiah, Jesus and the apostles had done; this is the central message of the apocalypse. The importance of single, identiﬁable ﬁgures as foci of unity is an important feature of this section.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Beliar, though undeniably a mythological ﬁgure, never acts independently of human characters in chs. 1–5. We can be more speciﬁc than this: Beliar is always said to operate through individual <italic>kings</italic> or rulers. Thus he is the real cause of trouble in chs. 2 and 3 (cf. 5.1), operating through <italic>king</italic> Manasseh to effect the demise of Isaiah. He is also the real cause of trouble in 4.2 and 4.4: ‘He will descend from his ﬁrmament in the form of a man, a <italic>king</italic> of iniquity … This prince will come in the form of that <italic>king</italic>. All the powers of this world will come with him. They will obey him in all his demands.’ The notion that Beliar is a demon who motivates wicked <italic>kings</italic> is thereby foregrounded in the apocalypse. These kings, whether Judaean or Roman, persecute the followers of the Beloved One, killing Isaiah, Jesus and an apostle within the grand cosmic struggle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0142064X13481411">22</xref></sup> The reference to Jesus (3.13-18) and the apostles (4.3) shows that this martyrological emphasis is not conﬁned to prophets—whether mystical visionaries or scriptural exegetes—as such. Martyrdom happens to <italic>all</italic> the signiﬁcant ﬁgures in the apocalypse, because they are representative ﬁgures of authority. This is bound up with the promulgation of the Christian faith as such, suggesting an external cause <italic>inter alia</italic> for the apostasy that is described in 3.21-31.</p>
<p>Fourthly, Beliar’s activity in ch. 4 is <italic>not</italic> exclusively future, for 4.2 looks back to the Neronian persecution of 64 <sc>ce</sc> as a notorious event from the past when Beliar had moved against the Christians. It is thus not true to say that the entirety of 4.1-13 describes the mythological future; this is true only of 4.4 onwards. Beliar’s activity in ch. 4 is both past <italic>and</italic> future, much as by implication it is also present in 3.21-31 (cf. 3.13; 5.1). So as far as ch. 4 is concerned, this activity involves his operation through speciﬁc Roman emperors, much as in ch. 2 he had operated through the Judaean king. On the face of it, this is a clear political statement in which rulers (foreign or otherwise) are presented as demonically inspired at the point where they oppose the Christian religion. Such opposition is not conﬁned to the mythological future; it is a feature of the past and the present as well.</p>
<p>Fifthly, the entirety of 3.21–4.13—the second couplet of the historical review—represents a mix of traditional influence, rhetorical denunciation and mythological elements which have been blended together in the authors’ unique synthesis. Given that 3.21-31 can hardly be taken as unbiased history, and possibly represents a rhetorical challenge to the church in Antioch, there seems to be no <italic>a priori</italic> reason for supposing that mythology is necessarily absent from 3.21-31 or that contemporary knowledge is necessarily absent from 4.1-13. It is possible—even likely—that mythology and history undergird <italic>both</italic> sections of this second couplet. We must make due allowance for the authors’ creativity and for the wider context of what they are trying to say. This casts doubt on the attempt to remove all knowledge of contemporary events from 4.1-13, although I accept that the parallels for this section are broader than I acknowledged in my dissertation. There is no <italic>precise</italic> separation of mythology and history anywhere at all in the apocalypse.</p>
<p>Finally, just as in ch. 1, precious little is said in ch. 4 about the repression or the demise of prophecy as such. We would expect this to have been mentioned had the theme been important. Thus 4.4 anticipates Beliar’s future appearance to behave just as he had done in Nero, which involved the martyrdom of earlier Christians (4.2-3). While we do not read of martyrdom speciﬁcally in 4.4-13, we do read of universal domination, blasphemous claims to divinity and the apostasy of most of the Christian community, while the flow of thought in chs. 1–5 is more broadly towards the experience of martyrdom. The authors have shaped traditional language to describe the eschatological future in this particular direction. The (repeated) <italic>incarnation of Beliar in the Roman emperor</italic> is the event that leads directly to the <italic>parousia</italic> in 4.14; the behaviour described in 3.21-31 is preparatory to this. In the mythological future, Beliar is expected to do what he had done in Manasseh (2.1-6) and Nero (4.2-3): to persecute the Christians, while those who did him obeisance would be spared (4.13). This is a more dominant motif than a dispute about prophecy alone.</p>

<title>Opposition in the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic></title>
<p>I now want to examine whom the authors identify as their ‘opponents’ in the apocalypse. Norelli’s understanding of this matter is clear:<disp-quote>
<p>I consider it quite obvious that this picture of the decline of the church [sc. 3.21-31] reflects the author’s judgement on the situation of the prophetic group to which he himself belongs … One ﬁnds in the ﬁrst part of the Ascension a tradition that only a false prophet approves and supports an apostate king. And so we are brought back to the dominant theme of the ﬁrst section of the Ascension: the conflict between true and false prophecy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142064X13481411">Norelli 2003</xref>: 271, 277).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The thesis that a dispute about prophecy is the dominant feature of the apocalypse is found also in the work of Bob Hall.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0142064X13481411">23</xref></sup> Hall, like Norelli, draws attention to the signiﬁcance of 3.21-31 in the text. In evaluating this view, it is in my opinion necessary to show, as intimated previously, that the authors are ﬁghting on a number of fronts, and that the view of internal conflict alone does less than justice to the total content of the text. It is clear that some kind of conflict internal to the church is criticized in 3.21-31, although we should note that this section has a strong rhetorical dimension. The thesis that the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> constitutes ideological resistance to Roman rule will occupy the next part of my article. In the meantime, it is important to show that the authors are warding off the influence of contemporary Judaism as a <italic>tertium genus</italic> besides these other ‘opponents’. This can be done on the basis of several passages in the apocalypse.</p>
<p>The opening narrative (1.1–3.12) contrasts two types of Judaean king, represented by the father and son, Hezekiah and Manasseh. The former is a good king because he adheres to ‘the words describing faith in the Beloved One’ (1.4). Manasseh, by contrast, ‘turned his back on the service of his father’s God and served Satan, his angels and his powers’ (2.2). While it is clear that the ‘king’ motif is linked to the Beliar myth, especially in the ﬁrst half of ch. 4, the two kings mentioned in the early chapters are nonetheless Judaean. This contrast between bad Jewish kings and good (Christian) prophets sets the tone for later passages in the apocalypse.</p>
<p>Belchira’s second charge against Isaiah (3.8-10) involves a fascinating scriptural comparison which flies directly in the face of early rabbinic exegesis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0142064X13481411">24</xref></sup> In this context, Isaiah’s claim to have seen the deity (Isa. 6.1) is reported, accurately. It is then said (as it happens, only with partial accuracy) that Moses had proscribed such experience, Exod. 33.20b being cited to support this assertion (and Exod. 24.10 being overlooked). Belchira assumes that Moses is right, so that Isaiah must be wrong. The readers know the opposite is true: Isaiah really did see God, implying the conclusion that Moses himself is quite wrong in his alleged proscription of the theophany, and therefore by implication devoid of authentic religious knowledge.</p>
<p>The signiﬁcance of this exchange becomes clear in the list of inspired writings which is provided by 4.21-22. Many of the Hebrew prophets and Writings are mentioned; Moses signiﬁcantly is omitted, despite the Torah being for contemporary Judaism the most important division of the tripartite Hebrew Bible. The most obvious conclusion to be drawn from this passage, in the wake of 3.8-10, is that the authors did <italic>not</italic> regard Moses as helpful at all. This again looks like a criticism of those who appealed primarily to Moses—contemporary Judaism—and the assertion that the Torah is not binding on the Christians. The latter alone are said to know the true meaning of the Prophets and the Writings because they interpret these scriptures Christologically. Both the Torah and its contemporary interpretation ﬁnd no place in these authors’ view of reality.</p>
<p>The cosmology of chs. 7–11 further looks like a critique, or at least a theological revision, of contemporary Jewish apocalypticism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0142064X13481411">25</xref></sup> While the authors have borrowed the motif of the seven heavens and the mystical ascension from Judaism, they have reworked it in a Christian direction by the location of three thrones in the lower heavens, which matches the scene that Isaiah sees in the seventh heaven; they insist that Isaiah is transformed in the course of his ascension (7.25; 9.1-5), so that his ascension becomes the foretaste of eschatological salvation—clearly Christian—for the readers. They have also substantially reduced the information that Isaiah sees in the course of his heavenly ascension, drawing attention to the vision of the three divine beings which stands at the heart of the apocalypse by ignoring items that interested most of the Jewish apocalyptic writers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0142064X13481411">26</xref></sup> On another occasion I would like to explore the possibility that the tripartite structure of the lower heavens in ch. 7, matched by that of the seventh heaven in ch. 9, is related to the threefold order of ministry of the kind that features in the letters of Ignatius.</p>
<p>For these reasons, we should add contemporary Judaism to the list of those who are criticized in the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic>. This conﬁrms that there are three different kinds of opponents in the apocalypse: fellow Christians (3.21-31), the Romans (4.1-13) and the Jews on the basis of the information presented here. Yet only one form of anthropological dualism is found throughout chs. 1–5. This evidence indicates that any attempt to describe the social locale of the apocalypse must be broadly, rather than narrowly, focused. There is a sense in which the text is erecting ideological barriers against a <italic>variety</italic> of opponents, or even a totality of them, and not just against one group in particular. One of its purposes was evidently to inculcate what was regarded as an authentic self-understanding of the Christian faith at a time when relations with the Romans were proving difﬁcult, when the breach with Judaism was recognized as having become complete (despite some shared scriptures), and when the problem of the lapsed or disputing in the church was becoming more evident at a time of transition and change. It follows that ideological resistance towards other social groups, and not just towards fellow Christians in particular, is an important though neglected feature of this apocalypse. This must be factored into the discussion of what I hold to be the strong political dimension of the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic>.</p>

<sec id="section4-0142064X13481411">
<title>The Setting of the Apocalypse</title>
<p>With these comments to hand, I turn to examine the setting of the apocalypse against the scholarly dispute that I have described between myself and Norelli and Hall. In approaching this topic, we should recognize, and honestly admit, that many aspects of <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> interpretation are likely to remain less than fully certain, due not least to the work’s pseudonymous setting which implies a form of ‘code’. Each individual scholar should therefore feel conﬁdent about admitting the relative ‘degree of probability’ with which he or she holds a particular point. However, such uncertainty must not be allowed to deter attempts to search for answers despite the sometimes theoretical nature of the published conclusions. In my opinion, this forms part of the great excitement of working on this early Christian text in particular.</p>
<p>I want to say straight away that Norelli is right to take me to task for certain aspects of my comparison between the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> and the correspondence between Pliny and Trajan in my published dissertation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0142064X13481411">Knight 1996</xref>). I did tend to draw very heavily on Pliny and to read the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> in the light of that material. I now accept that some of what I said was one-sided, or at least geographically imprecise. However, I continue to believe that the theory of a martyrological setting for the apocalypse—whether generalized or potentially more precise—is a plausible one. In this penultimate section of my article, I would like to articulate further and defend this view in the light of Norelli’s criticisms.</p>
<p>Many of the arguments have been touched on already, but they bear repetition in perhaps a more systematic order. The ﬁrst is that we must take seriously the progress of thought in chs. 1–5, whereby Isaiah predicts his own martyrdom in the context of a wider apostasy in ch. 1 (cf. 3.21-31) and where this is said to occur in ch. 5. This structure means that the intervening material, including the eschatological prophecy, is governed by the emphasis on martyrdom. I do not think that this point can be denied. This theme sets the entire apocalypse in perspective: it contrasts abiding faith in the Beloved One with the tempting deceptions of Beliar. Isaiah is martyred because he exposes Beliar (3.13; 5.1), the crucial feature of this portrait being Beliar’s association with a variety of martyring <italic>kings</italic>. The latter is an indelible feature of this portrait and makes it, I think, very difﬁcult to displace the martyrdom theme from the centre of the apocalypse.</p>
<p>Put very simply, this is the argument that the authors might theoretically have chosen a number of other narratives to describe a dispute about prophecy. The fact that they focus on a single and celebrated martyrdom (5.13), while also describing a number of other martyrdoms (3.13-18; 4.3), seems to me important for determining the outlook of the apocalypse, and to suggest a different conclusion from that advocated by Norelli.</p>
<p>Norelli explains this emphasis on martyrdom by appealing to the Mishnah, where it is said that ‘he that suppresses his prophecy … or the prophet that transgresses his own words, his death is at the hand of Heaven’ (<italic>m. Sanh.</italic> 11.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142064X13481411">Norelli 2003</xref>: 276-77). The problem with this citation is that it is very remote from the present context; moreover, it hardly explains it at all. The mishnaic passage consists of a list of people who should be strangled. It ordains that the false prophet’s death is by strangulation, not dissection. Even if Isaiah is to be regarded as a special kind of prophet, his death is <italic>not</italic> (as the parallel would imply) by the hand of heaven but from the ﬁrmament; it is only indirectly permitted by heaven (1.13). There is no reference to Isaiah in <italic>m. Sanh.</italic> 11; in any event, Beliar is not trying to make Isaiah into a false prophet as such, but to make him give up belief in the Beloved One, which is something much broader in the context of the apocalypse. The <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> embodies a dualistic agenda in which one form of religion is contrasted with another quite literally on pain of death. Both this and the progress of thought in chs. 1–5 must be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Norelli argues, furthermore, that there is no trial at all in the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142064X13481411">Norelli 2003</xref>: 276). This, however, is not entirely the case, for ch. 5 contains clear intertextual allusions to the contest between Jesus and Satan, which the Gospels describe in forensic terms, and possibly to the martyrdom of Stephen, who was absorbed in a vision at the moment of his death following at least some investigation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0142064X13481411">27</xref></sup> While this is not a formal trial, it does represent a trial of sorts. Although I now accept that ch. 4 probably reflects a broader background than the Pliny–Trajan correspondence (Pliny, <italic>Ep</italic>. 10.96-97), I still hold this sense of contest in ch. 5 to be indicative of the setting of the apocalypse, not least in view of Isaiah’s advice to his disciples to go to Tyre and Sidon in 5.13,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0142064X13481411">28</xref></sup> and with a possible eye to the ‘cosmic lawsuit’ theme in Isa. 40–55.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0142064X13481411">29</xref></sup> The situation is thus one where readers are asked to ponder a clear choice between the Beloved One and Beliar, put to them in 4.1-13 and 5.1-16. This is indeed reminiscent of the martyrdom experience of some in early second-century Christianity, not least in the offer to recant, mentioned by Pliny, and the fate of those who refused to succumb to this request.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0142064X13481411">30</xref></sup> Some Christians known to Pliny and of course Ignatius are obvious examples of such obduracy. It does appear that numbers were martyred in Bithynia, while Ignatius’s martyrdom was a celebrated case in the province of Syria.</p>
<p>As a result, I continue to hold ch. 5 to be quite signiﬁcant within the work’s overall outlook and setting. I read this chapter in sequence with the eschatological prophecy and as the conclusion of the flow of thought in the broader section, chs. 1–5. My exegesis of the apocalypse runs as follows. The introduction encourages the reader to believe that a grand cosmic contest is in play, according to whose terms Beliar is active in an earthly king and represses the disciples of the Beloved One. The backdrop for chs. 1–5 is provided by chs. 6–11, from which the readers already know the relative place of the cosmic protagonists and the prior defeat of Beliar by the Beloved One in his ascension (11.22-33). Following the demise of the Golden Age, 3.21-31 describes problems in the church in which it is argued that some if not many have ceased to be authentic Christians. <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> 4.1-13 posits a greater reduction in the number of believers, linked to Beliar’s further appearance in the Roman emperor (4.4). Chapter 5 adds to this the statement that Beliar (associated with the king) put ‘Isaiah’ to death in a notable experience of martyrdom.</p>
<p>My view is that 4.1-13 permits a retrospective understanding of 3.21-31 and that the problem of the lapsed or disputatious in the church is related <italic>inter alia</italic> to problems with the Roman administration. This really does seem to cohere with the information provided by Pliny, particularly his comment (<italic>Ep</italic>. 10.96) that no genuine Christian could be induced to revile the name of Christ, which is effectively what Isaiah is asked to do by Beliar in 5.8: ‘Say what I tell you and I will change their heart. I will make Manasseh, the princes of Judah, the people and all Jerusalem worship you.’ This should be compared with his earlier statement, echoed in 10.12-13, that ‘I am the Lord and there was none before me’ (4.6).</p>
<p>While I would no longer want to argue that the Pliny–Trajan correspondence <italic>determines</italic> the outlook of the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic>, more than one argument comes together here. If the apocalypse originated in the early second century, <italic>contra</italic> Bauckham, this was the time when we know from both Pliny and especially from Ignatius that martyrdom had become a feature of Christian experience for the ﬁrst time evidently since the Neronian persecution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0142064X13481411">31</xref></sup> The chronology makes it more rather than less likely that this particular background is reflected in the apocalypse. The progress of thought in chs. 1–5 supports that conclusion, together with the anthropological dualism and the association of Beliar with a succession of <italic>kings</italic>. There are hints of a forensic process in the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic>, not to mention the temptation of apostasy (5.4-5) and the acknowledgement of problems of allegiance with at least some in the church (3.21-31). The identiﬁcation of a number of opponents works against the view of internal conflict alone, while the evidence of <italic>m. Sanh.</italic> 11.5 does not explain the reasons for Isaiah’s death convincingly.</p>
<p>I <italic>do</italic> believe that there is a contrast between true and false prophecy in the apocalypse, but I think this is related to the broader setting and that it is not a complete theme in itself. I continue to believe that the apocalypse was addressed to a situation which knew the phenomenon of martyrdom, but that only a sufﬁciently broad analysis will adequately explain the actual collocation of themes in the apocalypse. This means that I have adapted the thrust of my dissertation, shifting the focus away from Bithynian evidence and towards the more likely, and clearly fascinating, evidence of Ignatius of Antioch. I think that 5.13, which describes a single and celebrated martyrdom, advocates a prudent caution for readers not to come to ofﬁcial attention too readily as had happened in the past. I hold it possible, and deserving further reflection, that there is a veiled allusion to the death of Ignatius himself in 5.13 (‘for me alone God has mixed the cup’), although I do not develop this suggestion here. The setting of the apocalypse is within a church, probably the church of Antioch, which had known divisions and where, in these authors’ view, issues of self-deﬁnition had come to be important in the wake of the experience of martyrdom.</p>

<sec id="section5-0142064X13481411">
<title>The <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> as Ideological Resistance</title>
<p>This brings me to the ﬁnal section of my article, where I examine the status of the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> as ideological resistance in the face of the various issues I have identiﬁed. The most obvious feature of the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic>, which is all too easily ignored, is that it is a written text. While it is likely that the material in chs. 7–11 originally circulated orally, on Norelli’s thesis—which I think is plausible—it was committed to writing in the late ﬁrst century <sc>ce</sc> and then reused in the present apocalypse in the early second century <sc>ce</sc>. The very careful and indeed the obviously creative composition of this material indicates, I would say beyond doubt, that it was authored by Christian scribes, despite the fact that it was probably written for peasants and artisans who lived in and around the city of Antioch at the time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0142064X13481411">32</xref></sup> This is the work of people who had the intellectual resources to identify and to criticize the behaviour documented in 3.21-31, and who on the basis of 4.21-22 knew the scriptures and were developing the habit of interpreting them Christologically. The intellectual outcome of this process, albeit in a different genre, would be the slightly later <italic>Dialogue with Trypho</italic> written by Justin Martyr c. 135 <sc>ce</sc>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0142064X13481411">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>In evaluating the apocalypse, and especially its political signiﬁcance, we must consider the two different phases through which it passed. This means that I shall consider the second half ﬁrst, drawing particular attention to the way in which it addresses, whether unconsciously or directly, the issue of living in a broader pagan environment which again seems to me a neglected feature of the work’s interpretation.</p>
<p>The ﬁrst point to make is that there is no evidence of conflict as such in the present chs. 6–11 once these are detached from the later chs. 1–5. The impression gained, if anything, is of an eirenicism if not a utopianism in which the authors encourage the readers to see the decisive events of salvation as having been accomplished, and to persist in their Christian faith as the means of securing the eschatological hope (ch. 9). This material offers an important window on the self-understanding of Christian people in the late ﬁrst century, around the time, we should say, that the pseudonymous Ephesians was written. This was before the onset of persecution in the second century, and at a distance from the Neronian persecution (64 <sc>ce</sc>) despite its recollection in the book of Revelation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0142064X13481411">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this original context, there is a modest and indeed a rather oblique critique of the status quo. The principal emphasis is on the formation of a distinctive Christian identity as people who are encouraged to believe they have a heavenly destiny, and to whom this hope is presented as an apocalyptic revelation which distinguishes them from all other people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0142064X13481411">35</xref></sup> The authors regard the Christians as citizens of the seventh heaven, from where the Beloved One had made his revelation; the use of spatial categories is a dominant feature of the eschatology. In the visionary’s passage through the ﬁrmament (7.9-12), he sees the angels there quarrelling, and the following comment is made: ‘And as it is above, so on the earth; for the likeness of what is in the ﬁrmament is here on earth’ (7.10). The implication of this statement—and it <italic>is</italic> only an implication—is that people on earth strive for position, including no doubt for social and economic dominance, because this way of the world is inspired by the aerial powers. The one exception is the Christians, whom the text presents as people of unique religious and social (and presumably also economic) insight. It is claimed that their apocalyptic revelation allows the Christians to set this dominant behaviour in perspective; and, on the terms which chs. 6–11 disclose, to criticize and to counter it by adopting, if only in secret, different norms of behaviour because they know that they are no longer shackled to the aerial powers but have a higher allegiance (cf. 10.12-13).</p>
<p>The emphasis on revealed knowledge as a social demarcator is a marked feature of this section. Such knowledge indicates the erection of ideological barriers against other people, whereby a longed-for situation which fails to correspond with earthly and experienced reality—namely power and dominance—is projected onto the heavenly realm as the norms of surrounding life are criticized through the higher wisdom gained by revelation. This is not obviously disruptive or subversive literature. Its perspective is much better described as ‘alternative’ or ‘quietist’. That is to say: the original chs. 6–11 were written to instruct Christians in the nature of their beliefs—I think there is a strong creedal element here—and to recommend an outlook of insightful acceptance of the circumstances in which they lived out their lives.</p>
<p>The utopian aspect of this material lies in its creation of an ideal world which transcends the realities of human existence, standing at variance with that reality, and simultaneously the recognition that this ideal world lies in the heavens and not on earth so that it can presently be enjoyed in worship but not in actuality—though it will be so enjoyed after death. This represents a fascinating fusion of the spatial and temporal categories in eschatology and apocalypticism. That explains the prominence of the eschatological hope in chs. 6–11, as if to acknowledge that power and dominance could not be achieved in the colonial orbit of second-century Syria, except through otherworldly fantasy in which existing situations of power were reversed. It is important to recognize that this was done, in the original chs. 6–11, without the articulated or evidently even the perceived call for social rebellion of any kind. The latter simply does not feature in this material.</p>
<p>The political aspect of the original chs. 6–11 lies in this broad acceptance of the status quo, combined with the attempt to persuade people to <italic>think differently</italic> about their lives, even to engage in fantasy of a kind. This involved, in terms of the public reading of the material, the attempt to bring the seventh heaven to earth (and vice versa) whenever they gathered in worship, so that the latter becomes a particularly important social as well as a religious phenomenon. The authors fall back on the device of alternative understanding, albeit with realistic outlook, to persuade acceptance of the status quo; but also transformation of it through the individual and the corporate imagination.</p>
<p>The very odd thing about chs. 6–11 is the absence there of any substantial reference to a traditional future eschatology. There is a hint of this in 10.12-13, where the Beloved is instructed by the Most High to ‘judge and destroy the princes, angels and gods of that world and the world which is controlled by them’. However, even if this passage stood in the original version of the material, the hope for such future intervention is not said to be fulﬁlled in ch. 11. In asking why this should be so, we should observe that a move away from a <italic>parousia</italic>-dominated eschatology is a feature of some of the later New Testament writings, Ephesians and Colossians prominent among them. However, <italic>Asc. Isa.</italic> 6–11 is so different in many respects from both these texts that our answer to this question must focus initially on internal concerns.</p>
<p>The answer lies in the authors’ recognition that the eschatological future for the readers lies in the hope for heavenly transformation (ch. 9). This represents a realistic acceptance of the likelihood of human death as much as of the status quo. It is presumably more a question of liturgical emphasis than a fundamental change of heart, given the appearance of the <italic>parousia</italic> hope in the later 4.14. Chapters 6–11 were written to create and sustain hope. They do so by distinguishing between earth and the seventh heaven in a spatial view of eschatology which has all but displaced the temporal aspect in this original and liturgical context. This interesting observation must be factored back into exegesis of more than one of the later New Testament writings, not to mention the social function of early Christian worship as such.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0142064X13481411">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>The authors’ silence about the <italic>parousia</italic> also has a political dimension—implied or otherwise—which has not often, if ever, been noted in research. While notions of a descending-ascending redeemer were common in Mediterranean antiquity, as Charles H. Talbert has shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0142064X13481411">Talbert 1972</xref>), notions of a vengeful deity who returned to deliver his people (let alone a Messiah) were associated with Jewish eschatology, and as such may well have seemed quite suspect to the Romans. In view of the quietist outlook of chs. 6–11, part of the purpose of mainly omitting a <italic>parousia</italic>-centred eschatology may have been to avoid causing offence to outsiders by alerting the Romans to unrest among the Christians, and so of effectively distinguishing the Christians from the Jews by implying that the advent of the Messiah was a past event alone. At a time when the Christians recognized the need to settle down in the world, subtle changes were made to the liturgy in which the original <italic>maranatha</italic> developed into something more akin to the language of <italic>Asc. Isa.</italic> 6–11.</p>
<p>The liturgical function of this material is analogous to the later creeds, inasmuch as the regular describing of the mystical journey reminded the Christians of what they believed, helped them to stay faithful in that belief, reasserted their heavenly destiny and warned them of what they would lose if they apostasized (cf. 3.21-31). This introverted political outlook is analogous also to the spirituals of the Negro slaves whose ‘home in gloryland’ acknowledged their bleak circumstances and their lack of emancipation in the present, while offering an ‘alternative’ hope which made life bearable through compensatory fantasy. This is a rare glimpse into a world of worship which has all but eluded us in the writings of the New Testament itself. I have no doubt that we should relate it to the likely social situation of the majority of Antiochene Christians as artisans and peasants who lacked the ability to determine their own destiny directly.</p>
<p>That said, we now know chs. 6–11 only through the present form of the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic>. We can only speculate on what changes, if any, were made to the original material in its transition from the ﬁrst to the second century <sc>ce</sc>. The ﬁnished apocalypse now contains chs. 1–5, representing a very different outlook. It is in my view helpful to speak, with Norelli, of the addition of chs. 6–11 ‘comme une sorte d’appendice’ to the ﬁnal work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0142064X13481411">Norelli 1993a</xref>: 9). This inevitably sets a new light on that material, one which very likely was not anticipated in its ﬁrst assembly and usage. The result is an apocalypse in which eirenicism has been displaced by a sharper situation, complete with dualistic anthropology and a historical review which leads directly to the <italic>parousia</italic> hope in 4.14-18.</p>
<p>Appearances, however, can be deceptive. We should not rush to conclude that the ﬁnished apocalypse is more ‘revolutionary’ in its outlook, despite this new perspective. The crucial element is the way in which the circumstances before the <italic>parousia</italic> are described. These are expressed in the historical review derived from Daniel, to which the traditional Christian scheme of eschatology has been subordinated. The review acknowledges that things will become worse before they become better, and that only the <italic>parousia</italic>—not human intervention of any kind—will deliver the Christians from the perils and indeed the dominance of Beliar. This in effect means that the <italic>practical</italic> outlook of the ﬁnished apocalypse is not signiﬁcantly different from that of the original chs. 6–11, despite the reintroduction of the <italic>parousia</italic> hope and the portrayal of Rome in demonic terms, replete with further animadversion. If martyrdom is indeed the dominant feature of the apocalypse, that corroborates this conclusion: a situation where a Christian can be killed is one where the Christians have no effective power. This sense of hopelessness is emphasized also in the world domination that is projected on Beliar in 4.4-13.</p>
<p>The difference between the ﬁnal apocalypse and the original second half is that the authors have felt the need, and indeed felt able, to construct a portrait of the Romans in demonic terms as the representation of a God-opposing power who makes blasphemous demands on the world. If there is eirenicism in the original substratum, this would appear to be a development of that perspective. However, once again, there is no necessary or even an implied connection between such virulent ideology and actual, let alone formal, resistance to the status quo. The purpose of the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> was to <italic>persuade</italic> readers to adopt the position recommended to them by the authors. The requested change lies predominantly in the areas of perception and ideological resistance. Readers are encouraged to see the world in different terms, aided by the earlier narrative and guided by the new form of commentary which chs. 1–5 represent.</p>
<p>This recommended position involved viewing Rome, as indeed other groups, in a different and polarized way. The dualistic anthropology of chs. 1–5 (which was lacking in the original chs. 6–11) furthers this aim. It encourages the readers to believe they must be one thing or another, with no median position. This is true especially of 3.21-31, where Christians who conflict are held not to be Christians at all. While we do not know the precise circumstances to which this was addressed, P.N. Harrison has advanced the theory that church disunity in Antioch had spilled over into civic unrest, prompting intervention from the Romans. <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> 3.21-31 looks like a deliberate caricature designed to coerce readers into unity by showing what life would be like if Beliar is allowed to prevail in the church. What is needed is unity among the Christians, a good public face and high social boundaries in respect of surrounding groups.</p>
<p>While I have detected the influence of martyrdom on the apocalypse, I think it worth observing that the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> is not robbed of a political dimension even if this setting were to be denied to the text. The <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> deﬁnitely embodies ideological resistance because it criticizes the status quo and advocates an alternative perspective. In both halves, although in different language, the authors call upon the readers to maintain high boundaries that will distinguish them from outsiders, and, I think, to be aware of the potential cost that is involved in maintaining the Christian position, which ch. 5 amply demonstrates. The ﬁnal text represents a development of the perspective of 7.9-12 and 10.12-13 to the effect that, in a world which constitutes Beliar’s domain, great care is needed by those who maintain a different allegiance. The political aspect of the apocalypse lies in the creation of an alternative perspective which advocates unity and a resigned acceptance of reality in view of the Christian position. The apocalyptic element in chs. 6–11, and the pseudonymous setting of chs. 1–5, both work towards an internal understanding in which awareness of potential opponents is preferred to the public provoking of conflict.</p>
<p>In closing this article, I am grateful to Norelli for his review of my thesis, as well as for undertaking the decisive literary-critical work which has enabled research on this apocalypse to move forward since the 1990s. However, I suggest that an interest in the political dimension of the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic> is an important one, not least because this aspect has scarcely been examined in the past.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0142064X13481411">37</xref></sup> The text shows us something of the earliest developments in Christian social and political thinking in its two halves, and especially in its willingness (like Rev. 13) to portray Rome in demonic terms within an essentially quietist agenda. I hope that future research will explore the martyrdom aspect of the apocalypse, and relate the ‘political issue of the <italic>Ascension of Isaiah</italic>’ to the political issues of the better-known earliest Christian writings—the writings of Ignatius included.</p>
