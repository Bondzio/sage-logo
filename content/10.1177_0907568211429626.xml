<abstract>
<p>This article reports the results of a study which aimed to examine the development of children’s ability to depict loneliness in their drawings. Seventy-eight children and 20 adults took part in the study. Participants were first asked a series of questions assessing their conceptions of loneliness, and were then invited to draw a picture that conveys loneliness. The resulting drawings were coded and scored for the presence of the two dimensions of loneliness: cognitive and emotional. First, the authors examined the use by participants of graphic indicators denoting deficiencies in one’s social relations resulting to loneliness (cognitive dimension); second, they assessed the expressive strategies participants employed to convey the negative affect that typically accompanies loneliness in their drawings (emotional dimension). Finally, the authors tested the relationship between children’s definitions of loneliness with their drawings of the construct. The results show a clear developmental progression in children’s pictorial representations of loneliness. Whereas the majority of young children represented loneliness as the absence of a social network, older children used graphic indicators to convey both the absence of a social network and the sadness that accompanies loneliness. In contrast to children, adults consistently included symbolic or metaphoric graphic indicators in their drawings to convey the negative affect accompanying the experience of loneliness.</p>

<p>The construct of loneliness has been defined in a variety of ways by psychologists (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0907568211429626">Margalit, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0907568211429626">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0907568211429626">Peplau and Perlman, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0907568211429626">Rook, 1984</xref>). However, most conceptualizations of loneliness converge on the notion that loneliness is a multidimensional construct that has both cognitive and emotional aspects (for a selective review of definitions of loneliness, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0907568211429626">Asher and Gazelle, 1999</xref>). The cognitive dimension of loneliness corresponds to the individual’s awareness of a discrepancy between the desired and the actual state of her/his social relationships. This discrepancy can be either quantitative (e.g. lack of a social network) or qualitative (e.g. lack of an intimate affective relationship with another person) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0907568211429626">Peplau and Perlman, 1982</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0907568211429626">Weiss, 1973</xref>). The emotional dimension reflects the negative mood or affect which is typically associated with loneliness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0907568211429626">Asher and Paquette, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although a great deal of research has examined the experience of loneliness in childhood (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0907568211429626">Hoza et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0907568211429626">Qualter and Munn, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0907568211429626">2005</xref>), considerably fewer studies have investigated the development of children’s concepts of loneliness (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0907568211429626">Cassidy and Asher, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0907568211429626">Chipuer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0907568211429626">Galanaki, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0907568211429626">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0907568211429626">Kirova, 2003</xref>). The most popular method for studying children’s ideas about loneliness is the interview. In some studies children have been asked to give definitions of loneliness (e.g. ‘What is loneliness?’) and talk about events that give rise to loneliness (e.g. ‘Why do you think people feel lonely?’) (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0907568211429626">Cassidy and Asher, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0907568211429626">Chipuer, 2004</xref>). In other studies, children were asked to narrate an incident of loneliness that happened to themselves or a friend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0907568211429626">Bauminger and Kasari, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0907568211429626">Hayden et al., 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>The developmental evidence that has emerged from these studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0907568211429626">Cassidy and Asher, 1992</xref>) suggests that from a young age children appreciate the cognitive and emotional dimensions of loneliness; they associate loneliness with undesired deficiencies in one’s social relations as well as with feelings of sadness or some other type of negative affect. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0907568211429626">Cassidy and Asher (1992)</xref> examined preschool and first-grade children’s understanding of loneliness. They reported that young children describe loneliness in terms of being literally alone and/or feeling sad. Older children and early adolescents are more articulate and give more rich definitions of the construct of loneliness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0907568211429626">Bauminger and Kasari, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0907568211429626">Chipuer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0907568211429626">Galanaki, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0907568211429626">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0907568211429626">Hayden et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0907568211429626">Hymel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0907568211429626">Kirova, 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, their definitions parallel those of younger children, containing references both to deficiencies in one’s social relations and negative affect. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0907568211429626">Hayden et al. (1988)</xref> interviewed children from third- through eighth-grade about loneliness. They asked children to define loneliness and to indicate what the term meant to them. Children’s definitions of loneliness included talk about the relational provisions lacking when one is in a state of loneliness (e.g. ‘not being able to play with or talk to anyone’, ‘feeling left out’, or ‘not being part of the group’; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0907568211429626">Hymel et al., 1999</xref>: 87–88). Children also described the emotional dimension of loneliness through the use of: (a) emotional terms (e.g. ‘it means being sad’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0907568211429626">1999</xref>: 85) and (b) metaphorical terms or expressions denoting the negative affect accompanying loneliness (e.g. ‘to be left alone, kept in a cage or something’ and ‘like you’re the only one on the moon’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0907568211429626">1999</xref>: 85).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the validity of verbal techniques (interviews) as a tool to access children’s ideas about loneliness has been challenged by a number of scholars (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0907568211429626">Kagan et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0907568211429626">Kirova, 2006</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0907568211429626">Kagan et al. (1982)</xref> put forward that children may be reluctant to talk about feelings of loneliness, and debated the need for more indirect indicators of this experience. Moreover, it is important to stress that, although verbal reports may be an effective tool for measuring older children’s and adults’ representations of loneliness, they may be less effective with young children. The reason is that it is possible to misinterpret developmental changes in children’s emotional and verbal ability as changes in their conceptualization of loneliness. For example, young children are less competent in relation to their older peers at understanding the emotional states of self and others, and are less able to use language to describe emotional experiences (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0907568211429626">Denham, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0907568211429626">Harris, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0907568211429626">Saarni, 1999</xref>). This means that young children may be at a disadvantage in verbally describing the negative affect accompanying loneliness.</p>
<p>One approach that holds considerable promise as an additional tool for the assessment of the concept of loneliness in childhood is drawings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0907568211429626">Kirova (2006)</xref> suggested that indirect activities, such as drawings, are particularly useful with young children in helping them to disclose their thoughts about topics that are abstract or not immediately salient in their lives, including the topic of loneliness. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0907568211429626">Bombi et al. (2007</xref>: 3) put forward that drawings are an ideal methodological tool ‘to capture children’s ideas about social relationships, because they require different representational abilities from language, and yet they are sufficiently conventional to be used as a means of communication’. Elsewhere the same authors commented that drawings ‘reduce the risk of an overlap between conceptual and expressive limitations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0907568211429626">Pinto and Bombi, 2008</xref>: 124).</p>
<p>Thus, although drawings could not be considered as interchangeable with verbal questioning techniques (e.g. interviews), they could serve as a complementary method, providing valuable information about children’s appraisal of loneliness. The present study aimed to examine whether drawings could be used as an additional method for assessing children’s conceptualizations of loneliness.</p>

<title>Use of drawings in the assessment of children’s representations of relationships</title>
<p>Drawings have previously been used to collect data concerning children’s representations of relationships, including their representations of attachment relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0907568211429626">Fury et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0907568211429626">Pianta et al., 1999</xref>), relationships with siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0907568211429626">Lecce and Pinto, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0907568211429626">Pinto and Bombi, 2008</xref>) and friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0907568211429626">Bombi and Pinto, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0907568211429626">Gramel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0907568211429626">Pinto et al., 1997</xref>), as well as relationships with teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0907568211429626">Aronsson and Anderson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0907568211429626">Bonoti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0907568211429626">Cugmas, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of the aforementioned studies was to examine whether particular features of children’s drawings are correlated with specific dimensions of their social relationships. In this context, an effort was made to avoid the drawbacks (e.g. lack of objectivity) attributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0907568211429626">Thomas and Jolley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0907568211429626">Thomas and Silk, 1990</xref>) to the earlier psychodynamically oriented research,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0907568211429626">1</xref></sup> and focus instead on specific graphic indicators denoting the nature of social relationships. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0907568211429626">Bombi et al. (2007)</xref> assessed children’s interpersonal relationships with friends and siblings using a detailed coding system, named ‘Pictorial Assessment of Interpersonal Relationships’ (PAIR), which takes into consideration specific graphic indicators, including distancing and interdependence between the figures, similarity of figures in terms of height, colour, expression of emotions, etc. Other investigators (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0907568211429626">Aronsson and Anderson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0907568211429626">Bonoti et al., 2003</xref>) examined children’s representations of relationships with their teachers by assessing student–teacher height ratios, figure details, as well as the distance between figures. In spite of differences between the drawing tasks used and differences in the scoring criteria applied, the majority of these investigators concluded that children’s pictorial representations of the salient relationships in their lives could be a helpful method for tapping into children’s conceptualizations of them (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0907568211429626">Aronsson and Anderson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0907568211429626">Bombi and Pinto, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0907568211429626">Bonoti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0907568211429626">Fury et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0907568211429626">Pinto and Bombi, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Although children’s drawings have been extensively used to explore children’s representations of relationships, to our knowledge, no study has yet investigated children’s ability to represent the deficiencies in, or absence of, social relationships through their drawings. That is, no study, to date, has attempted to examine the usefulness of children’s drawings as a complementary method to obtain data on children’s conceptualization of loneliness.</p>

<sec id="section2-0907568211429626">
<title>Aims of the study</title>
<p>The aim of the present study was to examine the development of children’s ability to represent loneliness in their drawings. More specifically, we investigated the drawing strategies and graphic indicators children aged 7, 9 and 11 years use to depict loneliness. In particular, we were interested to examine whether children’s drawings of loneliness convey: (a) an appreciation of the deficiencies in one’s social relations resulting to loneliness (cognitive dimension) and (b) the negative mood or affect that is typically associated with loneliness (emotional dimension). Furthermore, we asked children to provide definitions of loneliness in an attempt to examine whether their verbal descriptions of the construct correspond to their pictorial representations of it. A group of adults was also included in the study for comparison purposes, that is in an attempt to investigate whether there are any differences in children’s and adults’ pictorial representations of loneliness.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we designed our study to address five questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0907568211429626" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Do children include in their drawings of loneliness graphic indicators conveying the cognitive and the emotional dimensions of loneliness?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Does chronological age have an effect on the graphic indicators children employ to convey the emotional and the cognitive dimension of loneliness in their drawings?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Are the drawing strategies and graphic indicators that children employ to convey loneliness in their drawings similar to or different from those used by adults?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do children and adults refer to the cognitive and emotional dimensions of loneliness in their definitions of the construct?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Are children’s and adults’ definitions of loneliness related to their pictorial representations of the construct?</p></list-item>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 78 children (<italic>M</italic> = 8;10,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0907568211429626">2</xref></sup> SD = 1;7): 26 7-year-olds (<italic>n</italic> = 26, <italic>M</italic> = 6;9, SD = 0;3, 13 boys and 13 girls), 26 9-year-olds (<italic>n</italic> = 26, <italic>M</italic> = 9;1, SD = 0;6, 13 boys and 13 girls) and 26 11-year-olds (<italic>n</italic> = 26, <italic>M</italic> = 11;1, SD = 0;3, 13 boys and 13 girls). Twenty adults (<italic>M</italic> = 27;8, SD = 4;1, 10 men and 10 women) also took part in the study. The children were recruited from three primary schools that were randomly chosen from a list of all public schools in Ioannina, a medium-sized city in Greece. Parents were informed by the investigators about the purposes of the study and parental written permission was obtained for participation. Adults were all postgraduate university students and were recruited from a medium-sized university in Greece. Adult participants also gave their written informed consent prior to participation in the study. All participants were Caucasian and the majority came from middle-class backgrounds. All children were normally developing.</p>

<sec id="section5-0907568211429626">
<title>Tasks and procedure</title>
<p>The children were all tested individually in a quiet room at their school. Adult participants were assessed individually in an empty laboratory at their university. At the beginning of the experimental procedure, all participants were informed that they could withdraw from the study at any point. Before the drawing task began, participants were asked to define loneliness. The experimenter asked: ‘Do you know what loneliness is?’ This question served as a measure to assess participants’ understanding of the cognitive and emotional dimensions of ‘loneliness’. Next, each participant was supplied with a plain white sheet of A4 size paper (29.5 × 21 cm), a pencil and an eraser, and was invited to draw a picture conveying loneliness. The instructions were as follows: ‘Here you have a sheet of paper and a pencil. I want you to draw a picture that shows loneliness.’ There were no time constraints for completing the drawing.</p>

<title>Depiction of the cognitive dimension of loneliness</title>
<p>Participants’ ability to depict the social deficiencies giving rise to loneliness (e.g. lack of a social network) was assessed by examining the absence or inclusion of human figures in their drawings. Besides assessing the depiction or absence of human figures, it was thought appropriate to also examine their spatial arrangement in the picture. Accordingly, a score of 0 was given when the drawing did not include any human figure; a score of 1 was given when a figure was depicted alone; a score of 2 was assigned when one figure was represented apart from the other(s); and a score of 3 was given when one figure was separated from the other(s) human figure(s) drawn either by segregating activities or by a graphic element (e.g. by drawing a line or a wall between the human figures). We should note here that the scoring criteria in the last two instances (2, 3) were based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0907568211429626">Bombi et al.’s (2007)</xref> PAIR coding system. More precisely, we adapted with some modifications the criteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0907568211429626">Bombi et al. (2007)</xref> used to assess ‘Distancing’, that is the degree of autonomy of the human figure from the rest of the drawn figures.</p>

<title>Depiction of the emotional dimension of loneliness</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0907568211429626">Picard et al.’s (2007)</xref> scoring system served as the basis for coding the expression of negative affect in participants’ drawings. According to this system, emotion or mood can be conveyed in a drawing with the use of two types of expressive strategies or their combination: literal strategies (hereafter abbreviated as L) and non-literal/metaphoric strategies (hereafter abbreviated as NL). More specifically, L-strategies aiming to convey a sad mood (which is the mood state that typically accompanies loneliness), include the <italic>alteration of facial features</italic> (e.g. tears and/or a downward mouth), whereas NL-strategies aiming to express this mood include: <italic>depiction of objects conveying sadness</italic> (e.g. broken objects, empty rooms), <italic>depiction of weather that reflects a sad mood state</italic> (e.g. clouds and/or rain), <italic>use of lines in a way that conveys a negative emotion</italic> (e.g. rough or zig-zag lines) and <italic>body position of the human figure reflecting sadness</italic> (e.g. human figure’s hands drawn close to the body or downwards). In the present study, a score of 0 was given when the picture did not convey a negative affect; a score of 1 was credited when L strategies were used to denote a negative affect; a score of 2 was given when NL strategies were used to convey a negative affect; and a score of 3 was assigned when a combination of L and NL strategies was used to convey negative affect in the drawing.</p>

<p>Two independent judges coded each drawing in terms of the graphic indicators and strategies participants used to convey the cognitive and emotional dimensions of loneliness. The judges were unaware of the age of the drawers. They evaluated the drawings separately, one by one and in a random order. Drawings were scored twice by the same raters, once to examine the strategies and graphic indicators participants used for the depiction of the cognitive dimension of loneliness and a second time to assess the strategies and graphic indicators employed to convey the emotional dimension of loneliness. Inter-rater agreement was found to be satisfactory, 94% for the cognitive and 90% for the emotional dimension of loneliness. Disagreements were resolved by a third judge.</p>

<title>Scoring of participants’ definitions of loneliness</title>
<p>Participants’ responses to the question assessing their understanding of loneliness (‘Do you know what loneliness is?’) were tape-recorded and were coded from verbatim transcripts. In accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0907568211429626">Cassidy and Asher’s (1992</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0907568211429626">Bauminger and Kasari, 2000</xref>) coding procedure, participants’ definitions of loneliness were coded in terms of the two dimensions of loneliness: (a) the <italic>‘cognitive dimension’</italic> assessed whether the participant indicated an appreciation that loneliness involves deficiencies in one’s social relationships, such as social isolation/exclusion or other deficiencies in social contacts; (b) the <italic>‘emotional dimension’</italic> examined whether the participant indicated that loneliness included some form of negative affect, such as being sad or depressed. Participants obtained a score of 1 if they indicated that loneliness involves social deficiencies of some form and a score of 0 if they did not make any reference to social deficiencies. Similarly, participants received a score of 1 if they suggested that loneliness involves sadness or some other form of negative affect and a score of 0 if the emotional dimension was not stated. Two independent raters coded all transcripts. Intercoder agreement was 95% for the cognitive and 97% for the emotional dimension of loneliness. Disagreements were resolved by a third rater.</p>

<title>Depiction of the cognitive dimension of loneliness</title>
<p>First, the analysis examined the strategies and graphic indicators conveying an appreciation that loneliness involves social isolation, exclusion, or other deficiencies in social contacts. Half of the adult participants (50%) drew pictures which did not include any human figure in them. In contrast, children preferred to draw either a single human figure (39.74%) or the figure separated and segregated from the rest of the drawn human figure(s) (26.92%), χ<sup>2</sup>(3, <italic>N</italic> = 98) = 9.02, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Few children (19.23%) drew pictures without human figures included.</p>
<p>In addition, the analysis examined age changes with regard to the strategies children used to depict the cognitive dimension of loneliness. The analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between the graphic indicators employed by children in the three age-groups in order to convey deficiencies in social contacts, χ<sup>2</sup>(2, <italic>N</italic> = 78) = 25.11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0907568211429626">Table 2</xref> reveals, the 7-year-old group did not use a specific graphic indicator to convey the absence of a social network or other social deficiencies in their pictures, whereas 61.5% of the 9-year-old children drew a single human figure, and 53.8% of the 11-year-old group depicted the human figure segregated from the rest of the drawn human figures.</p>

<p>Subsequently, the analysis examined the expressive strategies (L, NL) participants used to convey the negative affect that typically accompanies loneliness in their drawings. The majority of adults (70%) employed NL-strategies to convey loneliness (representative adult drawings are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0907568211429626">Figure 3</xref>). That is, adults preferred metaphoric and abstract means to express the emotional dimension of loneliness in their pictures. In contrast to adults, children, in all age groups, preferred either L-strategies (28.20%) or a combination of L- and NL-strategies (30.77%), χ<sup>2</sup>(3, <italic>N</italic> = 98) = 30.64, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Children’s rare use of NL-strategies (11.53%) is interesting, if one considers that this type of strategy was the dominant approach in adult drawings. Adults’ metaphoric representations of loneliness included: a desert, a dark room, a solitary flower and so forth.</p>

<p>Next, the analysis examined the effect of age on the expressive strategies and graphic indicators children used to convey the negative affect accompanying loneliness. Testing of significance with the χ<sup>2</sup> test showed a statistically significant difference between the three age-groups, χ<sup>2</sup>(3, <italic>N</italic> = 78) = 30.64, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Inspection of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0907568211429626">Table 3</xref> shows that 50% of the 7-year-old children did not use any expressive strategy, 50% of the 9-year-olds used L-strategies, whereas the majority of the 11-year-olds (61.5%) used a combination of L- and NL-strategies. These results suggest a developmental trend with older children (11-year-olds) using more often a combination of NL- and L-strategies to convey negative affect in their pictorial representations of loneliness compared to their younger peers.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In recent years, a growing number of investigators have begun to explore the emotional expressiveness of children’s drawings (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0907568211429626">Bonoti and Misailidi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0907568211429626">Jolley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0907568211429626">Picard et al., 2007</xref>) and their potentiality to tap into children’s perceptions of their social world (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0907568211429626">Aronsson and Anderson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0907568211429626">Pinto and Bombi, 2008</xref>). Following this research approach, the present study attempted to investigate whether children’s drawings can be used as a complementary non-verbal means for assessing children’s conceptualizations of loneliness.</p>
<p>The results of our study indicate that children aged 7, 9 and 11 years use different strategies and graphic indicators to depict the cognitive and emotional dimensions of loneliness in their drawings. As regards the cognitive dimension, the findings showed that until the age of 9 years, children choose to convey the social deficiencies giving rise to loneliness by drawing one figure alone. Older children tend to include more than one human figure in their drawings and to segregate the lonely figure from the rest (e.g. by drawing lines between the figures), probably in an attempt to convey the social distance characterizing loneliness. This strategy, to some extent, reflects an understanding that one can be lonely in the presence of others.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this developmental pattern concerning children’s drawing representations of the cognitive dimension of loneliness is consistent with findings from studies investigating children’s appreciation of the distinction between loneliness and aloneness. These studies have shown that young children usually confuse loneliness with aloneness (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0907568211429626">Demos, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0907568211429626">Galanaki, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0907568211429626">Hymel et al., 1999</xref>). They tend to define loneliness as the experience of being alone, isolated and cut off from others. In contrast, older children differentiate loneliness from aloneness; from the age of 9 years onwards children understand that loneliness and aloneness are not synonymous, by stating, for example, that ‘being alone does not necessarily mean feeling lonely too, . . . and that one may feel lonely even when other people are around’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0907568211429626">Galanaki, 2004</xref>: 439).</p>
<p>The results concerning children’s appreciation of the emotional dimension of loneliness showed similarly an interesting developmental trend. Young children (7- and 9-year-olds) used almost exclusively literal expressive strategies (e.g. they altered the facial features of the figure) to represent the negative affect accompanying loneliness. In contrast, older children (11-year-olds) began in addition to introduce non-literal expressive elements in their pictures to convey the negative affect associated with loneliness. This finding is consistent with developmental data reporting children’s tendency with age to move from literal expressive strategies to non-literal ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0907568211429626">Jolley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0907568211429626">Picard et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In our view, the developmental trend evidenced in children’s ability to convey the emotional dimension of loneliness in their drawings may be to some extent associated with developments in children’s ability to comprehend and, in effect, use pictorial metaphors. Past studies investigating the relationship between expressive drawing and pictorial metaphor have shown (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0907568211429626">Winston et al., 1995</xref>) that young children find pictorial metaphors difficult to comprehend. Moreover, these studies have shown that understanding of pictorial metaphors was significantly and positively correlated with children’s expressive skill. Based on this evidence, it would be informative for future research to examine whether young children’s difficulties with the comprehension of pictorial metaphors is also extended in their ability to metaphorically depict emotions in their drawings.</p>
<p>Adults produced drawings that were qualitatively different from those produced by children. More specifically, whereas the majority of adult participants produced metaphoric and abstract drawings to signify the emotional dimension of loneliness, only a few children used such NL- (or a combination of NL- and L-) strategies to convey this aspect of loneliness in their pictures.</p>
<p>Another difference between the child and adult sample was that although children’s definitions of the emotional dimension of loneliness correlated with their pictorial representations of it, the same was not true for the cognitive dimension of loneliness. Probably, this result could be attributed to the criteria employed in the present study to assess the cognitive dimension of loneliness in participants’ drawings. The cognitive dimension of loneliness was expected to be conveyed through the use of strategies such as: drawing one human figure alone and/or by drawing the figure away and/or separated/segregated from the other human figure(s). However, as said earlier, 50% of adults did not include any human figures in their pictures. Instead, they chose to convey loneliness in an abstract-metaphorical manner. This may be the reason for the lack of a significant relationship between their references to the cognitive dimension of loneliness in their definitions (which were almost as frequent as those of children) and their representations of it in their drawings. This result points to the need for further research into the differences between children’s and adults’ drawing representations of the cognitive dimension of loneliness.</p>
<p>As stated in the introduction, previous researchers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0907568211429626">Cassidy and Asher, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0907568211429626">Hymel et al., 1999</xref>) examining the development of children’s understanding of loneliness have heavily relied on verbal methods. This research has not been completely effective in capturing young children’s appreciation of the cognitive and emotional dimensions of loneliness and one could argue that the reliance on verbal questioning techniques may not be the most appropriate method to examine young children’s knowledge of the loneliness construct.</p>
<p>The present study set out to assess whether drawings could be used as a complementary method to assess children’s ideas about loneliness. The results showed a significant concordance between children’s definitions of the loneliness construct and their ability to convey the social and emotional dimensions of loneliness in their drawings. In other words, it was found that similarly to their verbal definitions of loneliness, children’s drawings convey an understanding that loneliness results from social isolation, exclusion, or other deficiencies in social contacts, as well as an understanding of the negative affect that typically accompanies loneliness. Our results, thus, support the use of children’s drawings as a potentially robust measure for tapping into children’s representations of loneliness.</p>
<p>An important task for future research will be to further examine the validity of drawing-based measures as indices of children’s understanding of loneliness. Our suggestion is that the use of drawings in combination with verbal methods could be a more appropriate methodology for younger children in comparison to verbal questioning alone, and is consequently likely to yield more valid data for these children’s developing understanding of the multidimensional nature of loneliness. Furthermore, as regards older children, drawings could prove especially useful in accessing the subjective and possibly unconscious aspects of their representations of the self in relationships.</p>
<p>Finally, this was the first study, as far as we know, to examine children’s drawings of loneliness. Although informative, our results are based on a rather homogeneous sample with respect to ethnicity and cultural background. All children were Greek in origin. However, as Kim maintains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0907568211429626">2009</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0907568211429626">Kim and Kim, 2006</xref>) ‘children’s knowledge about the socio-cultural meaning and function of emotional expressions in their society may impact their decision on how to depict negative emotional themes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0907568211429626">Kim, 2009</xref>: 35). Thus, we can speculate that sociocultural factors may have an impact on the specific expressive strategies and graphic indicators children select to represent loneliness in their pictures. Future studies comparing children from different cultural backgrounds would be valuable in specifying the effect of sociocultural background on children’s drawings of loneliness.</p>
