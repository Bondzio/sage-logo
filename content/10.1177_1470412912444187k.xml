<p>From 1965 to 1971, John Berger was writing <italic>G.</italic>, a novel about the adventures of a European Don Juan; on finishing, he was put in touch with Mike Dibb at the BBC, and began work on <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>, a series of TV films with supporting articles in <italic>The Listener</italic>, and, later, a book. Both works were published in 1972, and won various prizes. Later that year, Berger also made a TV film about Zola’s <italic>Germinal</italic> (1885) for the Open University, placing the novel’s fierce, often sexual, account of the realities of coal mining in the context of the Miners’ Strike, which had broken out the day after the first episode of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> was first screened.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470412912444187">1</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>G.</italic>, though, is amongst other things a story about Modernism, written at the historical moment of Postmodernism. In it, we see the revolutionary upheaval of the early 20th century kill off both the eponymous ‘hero’, and, for the author, any means of conscionably writing as baldly and linearly as I have just done: ‘Never again will a single story be told as though it were the only one’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470412912444187">Berger, 1972a</xref>: 133).</p>
<p>In the novel, this line comes from the author himself as he counterpoints two scenes: it separates a paragraph in which the pioneering airman Geo Chavez’s plane falls ‘like a dead plaice dropped’ from the sky over the Alps, and one that considers the disastrous consequences extramarital sex will have for Leonie, the Swiss, peasant-born waitress whom G. is seducing. In 2012, Google finds this line in all sorts of previously unimaginable contexts, from being isolated and flanked by adverts on web compendia of quotations, to its use as the epigraph to books by Michael Ondaatje and Arundhati Roy: the process is analogous to the Stanley-Knifing of Botticelli’s <italic>Venus and Mars</italic> in <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>’<italic>s</italic> opening sequence.</p>
<p>The traffic between <italic>G.</italic> and <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> is much more complex in nature than my first paragraph suggests, both in terms of how it originally flowed, and how I understand it 40 years down the line, cataloguing the archival material Berger donated to the British Library in 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470412912444187">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470412912444187">Geoff Dyer (1986</xref>: 96) pointed out in the 80s, many ‘of the ideas of the series had already appeared in articles and essays by Berger’; these include ‘Art and Property Now’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470412912444187">1969[1967]</xref>), from which my PhD thesis takes its title – and furthermore, paraphrasing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470412912444187">John A. Walker (1983</xref>: 72) ‘the different versions of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> illustrate Berger’s central thesis, that, in an age of mass reproduction, the same material makes itself available in diverse forms’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470412912444187">Dyer, 1986</xref>: 97).</p>
<p>One example is that ‘many passages in <italic>G.</italic> are identical to those in <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470412912444187">Dyer, 1986</xref>: 108); notably the discussion of the female nude in Episode 2, which had appeared virtually unchanged as an essay titled ‘A SITUATION OF WOMEN’ in <italic>G.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470412912444187">Berger, 1972a</xref>: 148). In the novel it serves, together with a short reflection of the author receiving a 10-page letter from a friend, as a narrative pause between G.’s seductions of Leonie, and of the wealthy Camille Hennequin. Berger seems to be making the same point with both uses of the passage, rather than having them changed by context, as happens with various re-usages in the TV series. In part, as Walker and Dyer suggest, this is a riff on Walter Benjamin’s ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction’ (1936).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1470412912444187">3</xref></sup> But another more interesting instance of this traffic of ‘reproduction’ comes with ‘On the Nature of Mass Demonstrations’. This essay was published in <italic>New Society</italic> on 23 May 1968, not simply because of the revolutionary temper of that year – rather than Paris, Berger was in the Vaucluse; in May, he picked cherries took them to striking rail workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470412912444187">Jones, 2001</xref>) – but because, as he writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have been trying to understand certain aspects of the demonstration in the Corso Venezia [central Milan] on 6 May [1898] because of a story I am writing. In the process I came to a few conclusions about demonstrations which may perhaps be more widely applicable.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Four years later, these were borne out by the <italic>Battleship Potemkin-</italic>style treatment the young, conspicuously bourgeois G. sees visited upon the ‘ill-taught, badly-fed, poorly-dressed, overworked’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470412912444187">Berger, 1972a</xref>: 68) protestors by General Beccaris’s troops. The Italian King Umberto I, who decorated his General for this massacre, was later assassinated by Gaetano Brescia in response and, even later, apparently gave his name to G.’s father, with his instinctive hatred and distrust of the crowd. Reading the scene in front of the news in 2011 and 2012 suggests the durability of the conclusions Berger came to:
<disp-quote>
<p>The barricades are between their defenders and the violence done to them throughout their lives. There is nothing now to regret because it is the quintessence of their past which is now advancing against them. On their side of the barricades it is already the future. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470412912444187">Berger, 1972a</xref>: 72)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>There is a dialectical process of sorts going on here; the revolutionary artist moving forwards by questioning and involving his reader in the process of his work, just as the book <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> finally addresses itself ‘To be continued by the reader …’. It would be naive, or dishonest, not to reflexively apply Berger’s own materialist critique: he acknowledges an Art Council grant for <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> but had, partly, to support himself through journalism. The sorts of figures required are given in a fascinating book pitch from the archive: ‘I need serious financial backing: that is to say a minimum guarantee of approximately £1,500 a year (net) from all publishers involved …’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470412912444187">Berger, 1965–71</xref>).</p>
<p>Amongst other things, this way of working allows the writer to charge twice for his work; and then again when the essays are periodically harvested for a ‘Selected’ – ‘On the Nature of Mass Demonstrations’ appeared, alongside ‘Walter Benjamin’, in <italic>The Look of Things</italic> in 1972 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470412912444187">Berger, 1972c</xref>). This is not to unfairly single Berger out over what has long been a fact of the non-academic (I doubt I’ll be paid for this) life of letters, but rather to point out the tension with his declaration in ‘Art and Property Now’: the truth is that a painting or a sculpture is a significant form of property – in a sense in which a story, a song, a poem is not’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470412912444187">Berger, 1967</xref>: 50).</p>
<p>These essays and books certainly are. This is the point at which my thesis takes a turn into the legal, capitalist structure that provides the concept of copyright which, until recently, provided writers such as Berger with their livings; at far more length than is possible here. Suffice, for the moment, to say that like much of Berger’s work, this structure has an epistolary origin,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1470412912444187">4</xref></sup> and in <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>’s discussion of Gainsborough’s <italic>Mr and Mrs Andrews</italic>,the Lord Hardwicke whose desire for ‘a picture of his park’ (Berger et al., 1972:106) Berger questions is in fact the author of the English law that can be seen to have established the idea of intellectual as distinct from material property.</p>
<p>In a radio interview with Frank Kermode on 15 July 1972 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470412912444187">Berger, 1972b</xref>), a discussion of the relationship between sexuality and creativity in <italic>G.</italic> flows into one about concentrating on the ‘Ikon of the moment’, and then to a subject Berger had touched upon in ‘Art and Property Now’: the ‘anti-art movement’, which seems to him ‘to be absolutely necessary and understandable’. From this point, Kermode asks what the price of a novel means to a writer of Berger’s political complexion; he responds that this is: ‘one of the reasons that I’m very doubtful about the writing of any book until I’m sure it can be available as a paperback’.</p>
<p>Berger explored this aspect of Art and Property in his acceptance speech for the Booker Prize for <italic>G.</italic> on 23 November 1972 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470412912444187">Berger, 2001[1972]</xref>: 253–55), explaining that he was ‘sharing’ half of the £5000 winnings with the Black Panthers, and using the other half to finance the project on migrant workers that would become <italic>A Seventh Man</italic> (1975). Partly, this was a recognition of the sponsor’s role in the European exploitation of the Caribbean, and the subsequent poverty and mass migration: straightforwardly accepted, the ‘book about migrant workers would be financed from the profits made directly out of them or their relatives or ancestors.’ But rather than ‘a question of guilt or bad conscience’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470412912444187">Berger (1972c</xref>: 254) called this ‘a question of my continuing development as a writer: the issue is between me and the culture that formed me’.</p>
<p>These strands – High European art, the affluence it represents, and the human misery from which this derived – are most eloquently expressed by what the speech describes as ‘the most important single image’ in <italic>G. –</italic> ‘the statue of the four chained moors’ (p. 254). By this, Berger means Pietro Tacca’s brass casts of black slaves, made to flank the marble statue of Ferdinand I de’ Medici – a hereditary symbol of the relationship of Art and Property if ever there was one – which Giovanni Bandini carved and set in the Piazza Darsena, Livorno, the city in which Berger decided G. should be born.</p>
<p>In a gesture that seems to me entirely consistent with 1972, Berger donated his archive to the British Library in 2009 with the explanation:
<disp-quote>
<p>I somewhere am perhaps deeply unmercantile, and it is market forces as they are now called who at the moment are ruling – both materially and socially, and politically – the planet. Therefore if one can take decisions and do things which have nothing to do with the values behind those market forces, then so much the better. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470412912444187">Berger, 2010</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It spans his career from 1948 up until shortly before the donation, with the frequent punctuation of silences that reflect papers lost in the author’s travels, losses and disposals. Most of what we have we owe to the care and organization of his wife, Beverly. My current favourite survivor – as art, and as our collective property – is an envelope from the drafts for <italic>G.</italic>,on which Berger pencilled the inscription from the base of Bandini and Tacca’s monument statue as the novel formed in his mind, and on paper. This has been an essay towards telling its story in my thesis.</p>
