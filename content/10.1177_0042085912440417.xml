<p>As the number of first-generation and other historically underserved students on college campuses continues to rise, a growing body of evidence depicts the diverse and unique challenges facing this growing population. For example, researchers have found that first-generation students have more problematic transitions to college (Terenzini et al., 1996) and are nearly four times more likely to leave higher education after the 1st year than non-first-generation students (Engle &amp; Tinto, 2008). In addition, Engle and Tinto (2008) found that after 6 years only 11% of low-income, first-generation students had earned bachelor degrees compared with their peers. If left unchecked, the mass exodus of first-generation students from higher education will have serious ramifications on the future of the nation.</p>
<p>Several scholars have framed the experiences of first-generation students as living in two cultures while not belonging to either, suggesting that cultural transitions frequently force these students to resolve conflicting roles within past, present, and future relationships (London, 1992; Lubrano, 2004). Pike and Kuh (2005), for example, found that first-generation students tended to be less engaged and gained less from college than non-first-generation students. The challenges faced by first-generation college students are systematic and run deep. According to Lohfink and Paulsen (2005), first-generation students “inhabit intersecting sites of oppression that uniquely position them within this broader context of educational stratification” (p. 409).</p>
<p>In Higher Education and First-Generation Students: Cultivating Community, Voice, and Place for the New Majority, Jehangir emphasizes the heterogeneity of first-generation students, noting their</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>complex identities, making them hard to pigeonhole. They are more often than not students of color, immigrants, and they come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. They are also parents, employees, and caretakers of their extended families and communities. They all do not have the same story, but aspects of their narratives weave together to form a pattern reflecting both the richness they bring to campuses and the obstacles they encounter in academia. (p. 2)</p>

<p>This volume reports on a qualitative analysis of 1st-year, low-income, first-generation students enrolled in multicultural learning communities at a predominately White public research university. This study draws on two data sources from these learning communities—semistructured interviews with 24 students (2001-2005) and a document analysis of 130 students’ weekly written reflections and final reflective papers (2001-2007). By including first-generation students’ voices in her analysis, Jehangir demonstrates the heightened sense of isolation and marginalization they experience in college and their multiple identities as racially and ethnically diverse students. As a result, this research is also pertinent to the experiences of urban educators who may work with other underrepresented and underserved populations.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 explores the various definitions of the term <italic>first-generation</italic> and the extent to which these systems of categorization themselves are positioned in power, politics, and resources, such as how a less “generous” (p. 14) definition of first-generation students would affect students, schools, and communities who benefit from federal TRIO programs. This chapter includes data related to the confluence of factors affecting first-generation students, including race, age, gender, financial independence, and other factors, offering a lengthier discussion of race, social class, and socioeconomic status—demographics that “manifest themselves into systems of racism and classism within and outside of their educational environments” (p. 16). Jehangir prefaces each section with a direct quote from a first-generation student to signify the larger trends in the research—affordability, academic underpreparedness, educational access and opportunity, educational aspirations and life goals, and the roles of familial obligations and support—and demonstrates connections between these trends and the lived experiences of first-generation students. The resulting themes and conversations are extended throughout the text and connect the typically detached, dry data to a richer contextual meaning that resonates with the actual experiences of first-generation college students.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 examines first-generation students’ sense of isolation and marginalization on college campuses, a critical concern that often shapes their decisions to persist or withdraw from the educational environment. The author analyzes this topic in some depth, describing how the social milieu, curriculum, and pedagogy contribute to the manifestation of anxiety and disengagement and reinforce the “second-class status” of first-generation students on campus (p. 32). She also provides evidence of the larger cultural forces in higher education that reinforce first-generation students’ sense of marginalization, expanding on the idea that the patterns of communication in academia require students to feel as though they have to “learn a different language” just to belong in college and adjust to a new academic and social life by “deconstructing certain images and narratives that they might have come to believe about college life in order to come face-to-face with the realities and demands of being a student” (p. 36). This reinforces the notion that the academic journey for first-generation students means “redefining oneself in the context of this new world” (p. 41) and that these students “walk a tightrope between their home and school worlds, feeling apart from both” (p. 42).</p>
<p>Chapter 3 draws on multicultural education scholarship and critical pedagogy as theoretical frameworks to “explore and deconstruct the ways in which underserved students are isolated and marginalized in higher education” (p. 48). Student narratives demonstrate how students’ learning experiences illustrate the value of critical pedagogy and multicultural education approaches. Chapter 4 investigates learning communities as vehicles for engaging faculty and students in critical multicultural pedagogy. Jehangir argues that curriculum and pedagogy that invites students to connect their lived experiences with their learning capitalizes on their cultural capital, builds a sense of trust and belonging to the classroom, and breaks down “barriers of race, class, ethnicity, nationality, and other differences and can allow students to move from superficial discussions of topics to a place of deeper engagement” (p. 57). Jehangir also notes the value of classrooms that “seek to embody the tenets of multicultural education and critical pedagogy [and] draw attention to social inequities and power differentials by relating conceptual ideas to lived experience in order to help students practice democracy” (p. 61). These learning communities provide the</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>opportunity to develop relationships with faculty and peers . . . which cultivates a sense of belonging. [ . . . ] This type of curricular space can serve to draw students from the margins to the center, particularly when social integration extends into academic discourse allowing for deeper cross-disciplinary inquiry that builds bridges between the classroom and the personal experiences of students. (p. 80)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These chapters are especially relevant to a broad array of urban educators seeking to engage students through the use of critical multicultural pedagogical practices that enable students to reflect on their experiences and find their voice. As Jehangir notes, “these approaches are not limited to FG students; all students benefit from the experience of dissonance, which prompts a deeper understanding of the self in the context of the world” (p. 72). Higher education administrators and faculty wishing to develop multicultural learning communities on their own campuses will find this text a rich resource to inform and frame their practices.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 demonstrates key components in the multicultural learning community that serves as the foundation for the analysis. Drawing on the extended experiences of students, the following chapters use students’ narratives to demonstrate how the multicultural learning community enacted principles of critical multicultural pedagogy to cultivate a sense of place and belonging, empower students to find voice and agency, and contributed to their awareness of self in the academy. Jehangir discusses additional partnerships between faculty and staff that also contributed to students’ sense of belonging, helped to ease their transition into college, and served as a general support structure for students, arguing that “what sustained these relationships was the degree of interdependence that developed among faculty, students, and staff as co-learners in the community” (p. 126). A deeper discussion of how these partnerships worked, however, might have been useful for practitioners seeking to emulate the multicultural learning community model. Illustrated by several key narrative examples from first-generation students, it is apparent that students’ sense of belonging to the learning community and the larger university was fostered and sustained by peers, faculty, and advisor networks.</p>
<p>Through the unique voices of first-generation students, the final chapter of the book demonstrates the tensions universities face in supporting students beyond the critical 1st year. One student noted the impersonal feel of the ubiquitous large lecture classes at public universities, remarking that “you come in as an individual; you leave out as an individual” and that “there is really no interaction, like, ‘What’s your name?’ ‘Who are you?’ ‘Where are you from?’ ‘And how were you raised, what do you think about life?’” (p. 169). Students also expressed their frustration connecting and developing meaningful interactions with faculty and staff, noting that they felt “discounted or invisible” to them (p. 171). Perhaps one limitation of this book is that students’ perspectives regarding what educators could do to curtail these challenges was not included; such information would have served to connect students’ experiences in their own words with critical analysis and solutions.</p>
<p>Educators and administrators across all levels seeking to learn more about critical pedagogical practices will find that the examples of interdisciplinary academic activities and social integration, along with students’ reflections on these experiences, provide meaningful glimpses into the powerful potential of critical multicultural pedagogy in action. Although multicultural learning communities are one important way in which universities can support first-generation students’ transition into college, it is evident that first-generation students need support beyond their 1st year and that large public universities in particular remain ill-equipped to meet the needs of this growing population. Jehangir acknowledges this as the core dilemma of the book—although multicultural learning communities represent a powerful means of engaging first-generation students, they are one small satellite of a university’s overall larger functions. Students acknowledged that leaving the learning communities was like “starting all over again, only with the knowledge that what they had come to value as learners was unlikely to be experienced again in the ‘traditional curriculum’” (p. 177). This dichotomy suggests that universities should do more than offer a scattershot of meaningful engagement activities for a few, but instead work systematically to build “meaningful coalitions between faculty and student-affairs professionals” and “webs of support” as students learn to navigate the academy.</p>
<p><italic>Higher Education and First-Generation Students: Cultivating Community, Voice, and Place for the</italic> New <italic>Majority</italic> is a welcome entry into the canon of research on first-generation college students that examines the potential of critical multicultural pedagogy to engage these underserved students in the higher education community. By allowing students’ voices to shape the framework of the analysis, this book pushes higher education faculty, staff, and administrators to focus more intently on developing programmatic changes to better meet the needs of first-generation students.</p>
