<abstract>
<p>The objective of the present study was to compare cardiovascular and autonomic responses to a mental stress test and to a maximal isometric exercise test between offspring of normotensive (ON, <italic>n</italic> = 10) and hypertensive parents (OH, <italic>n</italic> = 10). Subjects underwent a 3-min Stroop Color Word Test and a maximal isometric exercise test performed in an isokinetic dynamometer with continuous RR interval monitoring. At rest, arterial pressure and heart rate were similar between groups, but there was a significant reduction in total RR interval variance (ON: 5933 ± 493 <italic>vs.</italic> OH: 2967 ± 390 ms<sup>2</sup>) and an increase in low-high frequency components ratio of heart rate variability (ON: 2.3 ± 0.4 <italic>vs</italic>. OH: 4.6 ± 0.8) in OH group. In the first minute of the mental stress test and after both tests, the OH group presented increased heart rate as compared with the ON group. After both tests, only the ON group presented an increase in sympathetic component, thus reaching resting values similar to those of the OH group. Our data demonstrated increased resting cardiac sympathetic modulation in offspring of hypertensive parents at similar levels to that observed in offspring of normotensive parents after a mental stress test or a maximal isometric exercise test. Additionally, the exacerbated heart rate responses to these physiological tests in OH subjects may be associated with resting autonomic dysfunction, thus reinforcing these evaluations as important tools for detecting early dysfunctions in this genetically predisposed population.</p>

<sec id="sec1-2047487312452502" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Studies have shown that several anomalies in autonomic nervous system markers, such as reduced heart rate variability (HRV), decreased baroreflex sensitivity and increased sympathetic activity, are among the potential candidates for affecting differential risk of hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2047487312452502">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2047487312452502">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given that offspring of hypertensive parents were more susceptible to develop hypertension, studies have demonstrated that mental stress tests and handgrip resistance exercise (30–50%) can induce exacerbated cardiovascular responses in normotensive offspring of hypertensive parents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2047487312452502">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2047487312452502"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2047487312452502"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2047487312452502"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2047487312452502"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2047487312452502"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2047487312452502">7</xref></sup> However, the role of cardiac autonomic modulation in responses to sympathetic stimulation tests, such as mental stress (MST) and maximal exercise test involving large muscular groups, has not been clearly defined for this population. Thus, the objective of the present study was to compare cardiovascular and autonomic responses to both a MST and to a maximal isometric exercise test (MIET), involving large muscular groups, between offspring of normotensive and hypertensive parents.</p>

<sec id="sec2-2047487312452502" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-2047487312452502"><title>Subjects and groups</title>
<p>Twenty male offspring of normotensive (ON; <italic>n</italic> = 10: 22 ± 0.6 years, 79 ± 5 kg, 179 ± 2 cm, body mass index (BMI): 24.8 ± 1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and hypertensive parents (OH; <italic>n</italic> = 10: 22 ± 0.7 years, 76 ± 5 kg; 175 ± 1 cm, BMI: 25.6 ± 1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were included in this study. Those who presented office arterial pressure (AP) lower than 140/90 mmHg on three different occasions were considered healthy normotensive, following the guidelines of the British Society of Hypertension. A positive history of hypertension was considered to be present when at least one of the parents was hypertensive. Subjects with concomitant diseases, under pharmacological treatment or reporting cigarette smoking, heavy drinking or food addiction were also excluded. The protocol of the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Sao Judas Tadeu University, and all subjects signed an informed consent form.</p>
<p>During the period of the study evaluation, subjects were instructed to avoid alcohol and caffeinated beverages for the preceding 12 hours and were invited to come to the laboratory between 08.30 and 12.30.</p>
<p>After a 15-minute resting period, the MST (Stroop Color Word Test) was applied. Heart rate (HR), systolic AP (SAP) and diastolic AP (DAP) were measured before (15 minutes), during (first and third minutes) and after the MST (15 minutes).</p>
<p>Two days after MST, the subjects were submitted to a MIET. The experimental sequence consisted of: 15-minute rest period; MIET performed in an isokinetic dynamometer (one series of five maximal contractions, and a 15-second rest period between contractions) involving the lower extremities extensor muscles group (knee angle at 80°) (LMG) and the upper extremities muscles group (elbow angle at 90°) (UMG); and15 minutes of recovery. The sequence of muscle groups was randomized. AP and HR were measured at rest, immediately after exercise and again 15 minutes into recovery. The RR interval, consecutive heart beats between each cardiac cycle, was continuously recorded during the whole procedure using a Polar® S-810i.</p>
<p>The spectrum resulting from the Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) modeling is derived from all the data present in the recorded signal; it includes the entire signal variance, regardless of whether its frequency components appear as specific spectral peaks or as non-peak broadband powers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2047487312452502">8</xref></sup> RR interval (RR) variability was evaluated in the time and frequency domains. Spectral power for low (LF; 0.03–0.15 Hz) and high (HF; 0.15–0.4 Hz) frequency bands was calculated by means of power spectrum density integration within each frequency bandwidth, using a customized routine (MATLAB 6.0).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2047487312452502">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2047487312452502">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Data are presented as means ± SEM. Statistical tests included Student’s <italic>t</italic> test, two-way ANOVA for repeated measurements, followed by the post hoc Student–Newmann–Keuls test. Paired Student’s <italic>t</italic> test and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used to analyze the reproducibility of the resting evaluations (pre-MST and pre-MIET) with a confidence interval of 95%. The ICC was characterized as follows: high reliability: 0.80 and 0.99; moderate reliability: 0.60 to 0.79, low reliability &lt;0.60. ICC is considered clinically accepted when their values are above 0.80. A <italic>p</italic> value &lt;0.05 was considered significant.</p>

<sec id="sec4-2047487312452502" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>SAP (ON: 113 ± 4 <italic>vs</italic>. OH: 110 ± 2 mmHg), DAP (ON: 77 ± 4 <italic>vs</italic>. OH: 76 ± 2 mmHg) and HR (ON: 75 ± 2 <italic>vs</italic>. OH: 78 ± 2 beats per minute (bpm)) were similar between groups at rest. HRV analysis showed that both RR variance and HF component (absolute and normalized) of the RR interval were reduced, and the LF component of the RR interval (absolute and normalized) was increased in the OH group as compared with the ON group at rest. In addition, the OH group presented increased LF/HF ratio as compared with the ON group at rest (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2047487312452502">Table 1</xref>). As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2047487312452502">Table 2</xref>, no significant difference was observed between resting HRV evaluations of MST and MIET when compared by paired <italic>t</italic> test. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2047487312452502">Table 2</xref> also presents the ICC results (resting pre MST and resting pre MIET), thus showing reproducibility of the resting evaluations (ICC &gt; 0.87 for all parameters), with <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for all variables.

<p>OH subjects showed an increase in HR in the first minute of MST when compared with ON subjects and with resting HR values of both groups. Tachycardia was observed in ON individuals in the third minute of MST when compared with their respective resting values; however, no differences in HR were observed between the studied groups at this point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2047487312452502">Figure 1</xref>). HR was also higher in the OH group than in the ON group in the post-MST recovery period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2047487312452502">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2047487312452502">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, only the ON subjects presented a reduction in HR in the recovery period when compared with HR values observed in both groups during MST.

<p>After MST (recovery) both groups presented similar values of RR variance, HF and LF components and LF/HF ratio of RR interval. However, after the MST, the ON group presented an increase in the LF component (absolute and normalized) and LF/HF ratio of the RR interval, as well as a reduction in the HF component of RR interval (absolute and normalized), as compared with its resting values.

<p>Immediately after the UMG or LMG MIET, SAP, DAP and the maximum HR were similar between groups. However, the maximum HR response to MIET using the LMG was exacerbated in the OH group in relation to the ON group (ON: 111 ± 5 <italic>vs</italic>. OH: 127 ± 5 bpm).</p>
<p>MIET, using either the LMG or the UMG, induced an increase in HR in both groups as compared with HR values at rest. Increased SAP after MIET using the LMG (126 ± 2 mmHg) was observed only in the OH group as compared with its values at rest (111 ± 2 mmHg). In the MIET recovery period (15 minutes), SAP, DAP and HR were similar between groups and when compared with resting values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2047487312452502">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The ON group presented a decrease in the RR variance and in the HF component of HRV (absolute and normalized), as well as an increase in the normalized LF component and in the LF/HF ratio of RR interval after MIET as compared with its values at rest. These changes were not observed in the OH group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2047487312452502">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Given that heritability is an important contributing factor to hypertension, in the present study we demonstrated for the first time that young normotensive adult offspring of hypertensive parents presented: 1) increased resting cardiac sympathetic modulation at similar levels to those observed in offspring of normotensive parents after a mental or a maximal resistance exercise test; 2) exacerbated AP and HR responses to a maximal exercise test in an isokinetic dynamometer involving large muscle groups.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that several anomalies in autonomic markers, such as reduced HRV, decreased baroreflex sensitivity and increased sympathetic activity, are among the potential candidates for affecting differential risk of hypertension. In addition, altered autonomic responsiveness in arterial hypertension supports a mechanistic role of excitatory sympathetic circuits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2047487312452502">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2047487312452502"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2047487312452502"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2047487312452502">13</xref></sup> In fact, previous studies have demonstrated a progressive AP increase in spontaneous hypertensive rats, showing an increase in the adrenaline ‘turnover’ in these animals within only 1–2 months (when they are still normotensive) as compared with control rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2047487312452502">14</xref></sup> Furthermore, increased or unaltered SAP and DAP were observed in young offspring of malignant hypertensive parents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2047487312452502">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2047487312452502">3</xref></sup> Unlike the unchanged AP or HR resting values found in previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2047487312452502">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2047487312452502">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2047487312452502">15</xref></sup> our research findings indicate that young sedentary adults with a family history of hypertension show early alterations in cardiac autonomic control (reduced RR variance and increased LF/HF ratio) with sympathetic modulation predominance as previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2047487312452502">10</xref></sup> These alterations are now well-established as major contributors to the development of hypertension.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that these unfavorable changes in cardiac autonomic modulation observed in offspring of hypertensive parents were confirmed in two different resting evaluations (pre MST and pre MIET) in the present study. In fact, the variability between the two days of measurements showed a value of ICC &gt; 0.87 for the RR interval and for all HRV parameters, demonstrating the reproducibility of our findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2047487312452502">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, a number of experimental and epidemiological studies have demonstrated that hypertension is also related to environmental conditions which require continuous behavioral and physiological adjustments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2047487312452502">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2047487312452502">17</xref></sup> It is important to bear in mind that adrenergic influences on heart and on peripheral circulation have been shown to control both HR and AP, at rest and during physiological stimuli such as physical exercise and emotional, thermal and orthostatic stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2047487312452502">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2047487312452502">18</xref></sup> Under controlled conditions in the laboratory, studies have confirmed that exposure to difficult cognitive and psychomotor tasks or emotionally arousing events can lead to substantial transitory increases in AP and HR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2047487312452502">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2047487312452502">17</xref></sup> Furthermore, a study using an animal model has provided direct confirmation that stress exposure plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2047487312452502">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>We observed increased HR in the first minute and after MST in relation to the HR at rest only in the OH group. Previous studies have also demonstrated that offspring of hypertensive parents submitted to an Arithmetic Test or to an Cold Pressor Test presented increased cardiovascular responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2047487312452502">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2047487312452502">15</xref></sup> Moreover, attenuated recovery of HR was also observed after brisk walking in obese women with type 2 diabetes, and this dysfunction was related to the reduced post exercise responses to cardiovascular autonomic control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2047487312452502">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hamer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2047487312452502">15</xref></sup> have demonstrated that the increased SAP to MST was correlated with the chronotropic and total peripheral resistance responses in these offspring. In line with these findings, the exacerbated HR responses during the MST may be an indication of exacerbated cardiovascular responses to this test in normotensive subjects with hypertensive parents. These exacerbated HR responses during the MST may also be an indication of exacerbated sympathetic stimulation, as previously reported in offspring of hypertensive parents during this stress test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2047487312452502">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other studies have shown that offspring of hypertensive undergoing a small group muscle isometric exercise using a handgrip dynamometer (30–50% of the maximal voluntary contraction) did not present significant changes in AP responses as compared with offspring of normotensive parents. However, they did present increased levels of norepinephrine and endotelin-1 or muscle sympathetic activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2047487312452502">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2047487312452502">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2047487312452502">6</xref></sup> In the present study we observed that MIET in an isokinetic dynamometer induced increase in AP and HR in both groups. However, HR response to MIET using the LMG was exacerbated in the OH group. Davrath et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2047487312452502">6</xref></sup> have observed a reduced vagal reactivation in the recovery period from handgrip isometric exercise (30%) in offspring of hypertensive parents. Additionally, although AP measurements in the present study were carried out immediately after the MIET (probably lacking the AP peak), SAP values were increased only in the OH group after MIET involving LMG when compared with resting SAP values. This response demonstrated for the first time the exacerbated pressoric responses in offspring of hypertensive parents after isometric exercise involving large muscle groups, as usually performed during exercise sessions.</p>
<p>Heffernan et al. have observed that the total power of HRV was significantly reduced after resistance exercise but not after endurance exercise, and the LF/HF ratio was significantly increased after both resistance and endurance exercise in male healthy subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2047487312452502">20</xref></sup> Interestingly, in our study we observed a reduction in both the RR variance and the HF component of RR interval 15 minutes after MIET, as well as an increase in both the LF component and the LF/HF of the RR interval only in the ON group. However, we did not detect these autonomic alterations in the OH group. In fact, after performing both sympathetic stimulation tests (MST and MIET), cardiac autonomic modulation during recovery in the OH group remained unchanged, as opposed to the ON group; that is, in the ON subjects, during test recovery all HRV indexes remained reduced as compared with baseline, although the RR interval was normalized. This seems to confirm a slow decreasing of sympathetic outflow which cannot be observed in the OH subjects already activated at baseline. Since the OH group presented autonomic dysfunction at rest, it might be hypothesized that these sympathetic alterations before the tests may be masked by autonomic responses to these maneuvers. It is also worth noting that we demonstrated for the first time that the cardiac autonomic modulation was similar between the studied groups after both tests, showing that the offspring of hypertensive parents presented a cardiac sympathetic modulation at rest similar to that observed in the offspring of normotensive parents after sympathetic stimulation maneuvers (MST and MIET) despite normal resting AP and HR values. In this respect, it is worth stressing that increased SAP variability and the LF component of the RR interval, as well as reduced HRV and HF components of HRV seem to be closely associated with increased cardiovascular risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2047487312452502">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, we have to point out that our findings may be limited first by the use of a relatively small convenience sample and second by the lack of evaluation of hematological parameters, which could change HR and HRV.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our data demonstrated increased resting cardiac sympathetic modulation in offspring of hypertensive parents at similar levels to those observed in offspring of normotensive parents after a mental or a maximal resistance exercise test. Our research also demonstrated exacerbated AP and HR responses to a maximal exercise test involving large muscle groups which may be associated with early cardiac autonomic dysfunction observed in offspring of hypertensive parents.</p>
