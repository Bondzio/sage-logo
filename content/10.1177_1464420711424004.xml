<abstract>
<p>This study investigates the effects of incinerator bottom ash (IBA) fineness and the cooling process of molten IBA on the durability of concrete and the corrosion of rebar. Two finenesses of an original IBA, i.e. pulverized incinerator bottom ash (PIBA) powder with maximum particle sizes of 0.6 and 0.074 mm, were used to partially replace Portland cement at 20 per cent by weight. In addition, the powder was also obtained by melting the PIBA (&lt;0.6 mm) in an electric-furnace at 1450 °C for 1 h and chilling it by quenching in water (WIBA, water-cooled melted incinerator bottom ash) and air (AIBA, air-cooled melted incinerator bottom ash). The powder was then ground in a ball mill until the particle size reached less than 0.074 mm. This study also presents the experimental results on the compressive strength, mercury intrusion porosimetry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction of concrete samples containing different types of IBA. This study uses the initial surface absorption test and rapid chloride penetration test to measure the absorption and the ability of different concrete samples to resist chloride ions. Cylindrical specimens were cast and exposed to 3.5 per cent NaCl solution under a direct current density (0.5 m A/cm<sup>2</sup>) to accelerate the corrosion process. The open circuit potential and direct current polarization resistance were obtained to evaluate the rebar corrosion. Results indicate that WIBA concrete achieved a compressive strength similar to reference specimens after 28 days of curing; WIBA and AIBA exhibited an increase in unit weight and workability when used as a replacement for cement. However, IBA can be processed by melting to regain reactive pozzolanic activity, which may be used to partially replace cement. The incorporation of WIBA and AIBA decreased the total capillary pore porosity of the mortars compared to ordinary PIBA. The large particle size of PIBA produced lower hydraulic properties than finer particles. The improved properties of WIBA and AIBA resulted from the dense structure achieved by the filling effect of the pozzolanic product. Strength activity index results, SEM, X-ray analysis, and the rate of ISA observations confirm these findings. Utilizing a proper amount of WIBA and AIBA significantly improved the chloride and corrosion resistance of rebar in concrete in this study. Therefore, WIBA and AIBA can act as cementitious materials in cement-based composites.</p>

<p>Incinerator bottom ash (IBA) is a by-product of the combustion of municipal solid waste. The volume of municipal solid waste has increased drastically in the several past decades. Proper industrial waste material disposal or treatment has recently become an important social and environmental issue in Republic of China. Municipal solid waste is treated in incineration plants to reduce its volume and toxicity. A number of countries have studied the applications of various waste incineration ash materials in the construction through a reuse or recycle procedure. Recent studies highlight the possibilities of incorporating municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) bottom ash into building materials or structures. MSWI bottom ash is now widely used in road construction as a gravel material in compacted based layer [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464420711424004">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464420711424004">2</xref></bold>]. Other studies investigate the use of MSWI ash as a replacement for raw material in cement production [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464420711424004">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464420711424004">4</xref></bold>]. Previous studies show that [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464420711424004">5</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464420711424004">7</xref></bold>] MSWI ash can be disposed harmlessly by cement hydration, replacement of sand and aggregate, or mineral addition in cement-based materials. Using a cement kiln for waste treatment offers certain advantages. The high temperature (above 1450 °C) in the kiln can capture most heavy metals in the clinker, while the ash can be used because its major constituents are similar to those of cement raw materials [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464420711424004">8</xref></bold>]. Therefore, the melting treatment and rapid cooling of IBA form a glassy, sandlike granulated material [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464420711424004">9</xref></bold>]. Incorporating pozzolanic materials as a partial replacement for cement is a well-recognized method of refining the porosity and pore size distribution of the paste. However, durability and corrosion behaviour of rebar due to differences in the molten slag cooled process are not well established. Recycling IBA in the concrete industry may be the most feasible way to dispose IBA. The treatment method proposed in this study is suitable from both technological and economical viewpoints. This study evaluates the durability of concrete and corrosion behaviour properties of rebar in concrete containing different types and particle sizes of IBA. Using these recycled materials as a substitute for natural raw materials may help to preserve natural resources of cement manufacturing. Therefore, this study presents a series of laboratory tests on concrete containing various amounts of IBA, pulverized incinerator bottom ash (PIBA), water-cooled melted incinerator bottom ash (WIBA), and air-cooled melted incinerator bottom ash (AIBA). This study reports the freshconcrete properties, compressive strength activity index (SAI), initial surface absorption (ISA), microstructure and corrosion behaviour, chloride penetration test, and pore structure of the tested mortars.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1464420711424004"><title>2 EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS</title>
<sec id="sec3-1464420711424004"><title>2.1 Material properties</title>
<p>Type I Portland cement conforming to ASTM C150 [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464420711424004">10</xref></bold>] was used for all mixtures. The fineness modulus of the fine aggregates was 2.69. The IBA used in this study was collected from the Ilan MSWI located at western Republic of China. The grain sizes of pulverizing IBA powder passing through sieve #30 (0.6 mm) and sieve #200 (0.074 mm) were labelled as P30 and P200, respectively. The AIBA was prepared by melting the above PIBA (&lt;0.6 mm) in an electric-furnace at 1450 °C for 1 h. The melt was air-cooled to obtain lumps of AIBA slag, which was then ground in a ball mill until fine enough to pass through a #200 sieve (labelled as A200). The WIBA was prepared by melting the PIBA (&lt;0.6 mm) in an electric-heated melt at 1450 °C for 1 h. The melts were water-quenched to obtain WIBA slag, which was then ground in a ball mill until fine enough to pass through a #200 sieve (labelled as W200). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1464420711424004">Table 1</xref> presents the chemical composition of cement and different types of IBA as determined by X-ray fluorescence. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464420711424004">Table 2</xref> lists the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464420711424004">11</xref></bold>] data of the IBA. These results indicate that various types of IBAs are environment-friendly because they contain relatively few toxic substances.

<sec id="sec5-1464420711424004"><title>2.3 Preparation and testing procedure</title>
<p>The SW846-1311 extraction procedure required preliminary evaluation of the pH characteristic of the sample to determine the proper extraction fluid necessary for the experiment. Upon testing, extraction fluid #B (pH 2.88 ± 0.05) was used for the TCLP analysis. This fluid was prepared by adding 5.7 mL of acetic acid to 500 mL of double distilled water, to dilute to a volume of 1 L. A 25-g sample was placed in a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask and 500 mL of extraction fluid added to each Erlenmeyer flask. The samples were agitated for 18 h using an electric vibrator. The slurry was filtered using 6–8-µm pore size Millipore filter paper. The leachates were preserved in 2 per cent HNO<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p>Concrete workability was evaluated by a slump test, following ASTM C143 [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464420711424004">13</xref></bold>]. The specimens of the chloride concentration test were collected from paste powder. The chloride concentration was measured by a Metrohm 792 ion chromatograph in accordance with AASHTO T260 [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464420711424004">14</xref></bold>]. Compressive strength tests were conducted in accordance with ASTM C 39 [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464420711424004">15</xref></bold>]. These tests evaluated the strength development of mortars containing various IBA contents over time. Twenty ϕ 100 × 200 mm<sup>2</sup> cylinder specimens were cast for each batch following the specifications of ASTM C 39. After 24-h curing, the specimens were demoulded and placed in a water tank at room temperature until tested. The SAI was calculated as follows
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1464420711424004"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420711424004-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>T</italic> is the average compressive strength of test mix cylinders at various curing ages and <italic>C</italic> the average compressive strength of reference mix cylinders at the same curing ages.</p>
<p>The distribution of pore size and pore volume weremeasured using a Micromeritics Autopore 9500 porosimeter. Two cubic centimetre samples were oven-dried for 24 h at 105 °C and then analysed. Two mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) measurements were made per sample. By modelling the pores as cylindrical channels, the test pressure (<italic>p</italic>) can be connected to the radius of these cylinders by the Washburn–Laplace law
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-1464420711424004"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420711424004-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>p</italic> defines the mercury intrusion pressure (Pa), <italic>σ</italic> the surface tension of mercury (N/m), <italic>θ</italic> the contact angle between mercury and pore walls (rad), and <italic>d</italic> the equivalent diameter of the intrude pore (m).</p>
<p>A Hitachi Model S-510 scanning electron microscope was used for observation of microstructures. Specimens measuring 5 × 5 × 5 mm<sup>3</sup> were prepared by cutting a 30 mm plate that was placed at a distance of 5 cm from the surface of the cylindrical specimens and oven-dried for 24 h, pressure vacuumed up to 0.1 torr, and Au-ion spotted for 2–3 min.</p>
<p>X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on the specimens for 56 days to determine the chemical compounds of their matrices. XRD patterns of the compounds were taken with Cu-Kα radiation using a Siemens D5000 diffractometer, conducted between 10 ° and 80 ° with a scanning speed of 1 °/min.</p>
<p>The initial surface absorption test (ISAT) was carried out according to BS1881 [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464420711424004">16</xref></bold>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1464420711424004">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the ISAT set-up. The test specimen was a cylinder measuring 100 mm in diameter and 50 mm in length. The tests determined the rate of surface zone water absorption of the mortar samples during a prescribed period under a head of 200 mm of water. This figure expresses the rate of ISA in mL/m<sup>2</sup>s.

<p>The concrete cylinder dimension was 10 cm in diameter and 20 cm in height. A 12.7-mm diameter rebar was embedded in the centre of the cylindrical specimen. To ensure a consistent failure mode, theexperiment maintained an embedded length 100 mm. To accelerate the corrosion process, the specimens were immersed in 3.5 per cent NaCl solution and an impressed current was applied. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1464420711424004">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the corrosion measurement set-up. The rebar served as a working electrode. Saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and titanium mesh were used as reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. A current density of 0.5 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> was applied to the rebar. The impressed current was turned off every 24 h, and open circuit potential (OCP) and linear polarization resistance were measured using a Nichia model NP-G100/ED potentiostat.

<p>The penetrating test of chloride ion in concrete was carried out by following ASTM C1202 [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464420711424004">17</xref></bold>]. For each mixture, six cylindrical specimens (<italic>ϕ</italic> 100 × 200 mm<sup>2</sup>) were cast and moist-cured for 56 days. Three 50-mm thick samples were cut from each cylinder. The ring surface of the sample was coated with epoxy and then placed in a vacuum desiccator at a pressure less than 133 Pa. After turning the pump off, the samples were soaked in de-aerated water for 18 h. Sodium hydroxide solution (0.3 N NaOH) and sodium chloride solution (3 per cent NaCl by mass) were poured in the chambers on both sides of the concrete sample, with NaOH as the anode and NaCl as the cathode.

<p>The slumps for the reference mixtures were 162 mm, and increased with increasing amounts of IBA powder replacement for cement. The melted IBA powder replacement for cement increased the slump significantly. This is due to a reduction in organic content and the round particles after melting and pulverizing. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1464420711424004">Table 4</xref> shows that the addition of melted IBA increased the unit weight and lowers the chloride content.

<sec id="sec8-1464420711424004"><title>3.2 Compressive strength</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1464420711424004">Figure 3</xref> shows the compressive strength developments of PIBA-blended cement concrete. The compressive strength increased over time. For all blends, the reference mixture (no PIBA) generally produced the highest compressive strength after 7, 28, and 56 days. The compressive strength decreased with replacement of cement by IBA at all ages. The compressive strength of W200 was close to that of the reference mixture. This increase in strength may be due to pozzolanic reactions, as reported by previous researchers [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464420711424004">19</xref></bold>]. The amount of WIBA replacement for cement, up to 20 per cent, did not seem to have a significant adverse effect on strength. The SAI values of PIBA and the melted IBA powder of blended concrete were determined using the normalization method. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1464420711424004">Figure 4</xref> shows the SAI test results of WIBA, AIBA, and PIBA at 3, 7, 28, and 56 days. These test results indicate that the SAI increases slightly with age in PIBA mixtures. After melting, the SAI test results at 3, 7, 28, and 56 days for WIBA and AIBA are 62.7 per cent, 79.1 per cent, 99.2 per cent, 98.3 per cent, and 52.3 per cent, 65.7 per cent, 82.1 per cent, and 86.0 per cent, respectively. The SAI shows that the WIBA power-modified mixtures developed strength at a rate similar to that of OPC after 28 days. The pozzolanic reaction activity of WIBA concrete was higher than AIBA concrete. The addition of PIBA decreased the compressive strength. Particularly, P30 showed very low compressive strength values of 11.5, 19.7, 27.0, and 31.7 MPa at 3, 7, 28, and 56 days, respectively. This may be due to the partial replacement of cement by PIBA. At 20 per cent PIBA replacement to cement, it could be only few PIBA acted as pozzolanic materials and the others PIBA acted as fillers. In addition, PIBA presents physicochemical properties appropriate for mineral admixture, and its reactivity depended mainly on particle size and fineness. P30 had a lower specific surface area than that of P200. Thus, the replacement of cement by P30 produced the lower compressive strengths.

<sec id="sec9-1464420711424004"><title>3.3 Porosity measurements</title>
<p>Most properties of hardened concrete are related to the quantity and characteristics of concrete pores [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464420711424004">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464420711424004">21</xref></bold>]. The traditional classification of pores in concrete considers two classes: gel pores (10 nm), which are associated with the formation of hydration products, and capillary pores (10–10 000 nm). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1464420711424004">Figure 5</xref> presents the MIP curves for mortar samples. The total and capillary porosities decreased with ages. Otherwise, the gel porosity increased with age. These test results indicate that mortars have dense pore structure hydration; the largest difference of total porosity between 56 and 28 days appeared in W200 specimens. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1464420711424004">Figure 5</xref> shows that P30 replacement for cement leads to the highest proportion of total pores, while the reference mix exhibited the lowest number of pores at 7 and 56 days. The volume of gel pores increased as PIBA was added to the mixtures, while PIBA replacement for cement produced higher gel porosity. This implies that PIBA can function as filler for pores in the mortar. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1464420711424004">Figure 5</xref> shows the pore structures for melted IBA. There results clearly show a decrease in total and capillary pores when using WIBA and AIBA replacements for cement compared with PIBA specimens. The pore system modified by melted IBA due to the pozzolanic reaction and filling effects of the WIBA and AIBA, forms more cementitious material with a dense structure. After 56 days, the pore structure of P200 was similar to that of reference specimens, agreeing with compressive strength result.

Because PIBA has lower pozzolanic reaction than melted IBA powder, observations show quartz in the P200 pastes.

<sec id="sec12-1464420711424004"><title>3.6 Permeability</title>
<p>The ISAT results demonstrate that water absorption by the paste, expressed in mL/m<sup>2</sup>s, decreased with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1464420711424004">Fig. 8</xref>). Water absorption in the IBA powder concrete was less than that of concrete without IBA powder. Water absorption of the specimens with smaller particle powder was less than that of larger particle powder specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1464420711424004">Fig. 8</xref>). According to Kumar and Bhattacharjee [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464420711424004">22</xref></bold>], ISAT results show that concrete durability can be classified in terms of low, average, or high permeability/absorption based on the value of the permeation-measuring index. An ISA rate higher than 0.2 mL/m<sup>2</sup>s at 60 min indicates high concrete permeation. An ISA rate between 0.1 and 0.2 mL/m<sup>2</sup>s at 60 min indicates medium concrete permeation. An ISA lower than 0.1 mL/m<sup>2</sup>s at 60 min indicates low concrete permeation. The ISA rate for all mixes in this study was higher than 0.3 mL/m<sup>2</sup>s at 60 min, implying high liquid penetration of all mixtures. However, when the melted IBA powder is replaced for cement, the absorption decreased as powder was added to the mixture. Water absorption is mainly influenced by the paste phase; the absorption decrease may be attributed to a dense pore structure within the mix due to pozzolanic reaction.

<sec id="sec13-1464420711424004"><title>3.7 Corrosion resistance</title>
<p>According to ASTM C876 [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464420711424004">23</xref></bold>], when OCP is higher than −127 mV (SCE), the probability is less than 10per cent that reinforcing steel may corrode. If the potential is from −127 to −276 mV (SCE), corrosion probability is uncertain. Corrosion probability maybe higher than 90 per cent for OCP between −276 and −427 mV (SCE). The corrosion test results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1464420711424004">Fig. 9</xref> indicate that mixtures with melted IBA powder, i.e. mixes W200 and A200 significantly increase the exposure time span to severe corrosion compared with mixes P200 and P30. The melted IBA powder replacement for cement refines the pore structure and reduces the corrosion probability of reinforcing steel, consistent with comparative results of rapid chloride penetration test (RCPT) and permeability tests. Cement incorporated with melted IBA powder bed ash has no prominent negative effect on corrosion behaviour due to alkalinity changing in the pore solution. The N, P30, and P200 specimens exhibited severe corrosion conditions after 1- to 2-day exposure, which reveals that cracks play a paramount role in the corrosion process of reinforcing steel in concrete. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1464420711424004">Figure 9</xref> also shows that the potential drops above −427 mV (SCE) in the specimens (W200 and A200) even after a 3–4-day accelerated corrosion process, and melted IBA powder concretes with no cracks have better corrosion resistance. After 7 days of accelerated corrosion, the corrosion OCP of rebar in the reference mixture is about −470 mV (SCE). The value is similar to W200 and A200 specimens. Within 10 days after 7 days of accelerated corrosion, the OCP of A200 decreases distinctly from −470 mV (SCE) to −550 mV (SCE) abruptly, causing cracks that can be observed visually. This may be because within 6 days of accelerated corrosion, the amount of chloride ions has not reached critical value; therefore, only a part of the passive protective film on the rebar has been damaged. Thereafter, the amount of chloride ions has reached critical value. This means that the passive protective film on the rebar has been totally spoiled, and thus the OCP rebar increases abruptly. After 10 days of accelerated corrosion test, the OCP of the specimens with WIBA was higher than reference specimens. At the same time, the OCP of specimens with IBA was lower than reference specimens (except WIBA). This means that WIBA neither improved the pore structure of concrete nor decreased the chloride diffusion coefficient. The cement blended with WIBA improved the pore structure and decreased the chloride diffusion coefficient and reduced the corrosion probability of the rebar.

<sec id="sec14-1464420711424004"><title>3.8 Chloride permeability</title>
<p>This study measures the chloride permeability of the specimens by current passing of the concrete specimens versus time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1464420711424004">Figure 10</xref> presents the Coulomb charges over time. During the test, the cell specimens without melted IBA reached a temperature of 90 °C before the standard duration of 6 h. Only specimens with melted IBA were tested for 6 h. In addition, the RCPT may give misleadingly low reading for pozzolanic materials because the pozzolanic reaction depletes the charge carriers [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464420711424004">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464420711424004">25</xref></bold>]. Therefore, the RCPT may not be the appropriate method for highly porous medium and pozzolanic materials. The total charges passing the specimens were 7421 and 8652 C for mixes W200 and A200, respectively. The phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the degree of hydration of cementitious materials improves with addition of melted IBA. Smaller size capillary pores of the melted IBA concrete restricted chloride ion penetration through the concrete.
