<p>62.7899 AĞIR, Bülent Sarper — <bold>Romanya'nin Avrupa Birliği bütünleşme sürecinde Romen milliyetçilii ve etnik Macar azinliğin konumu (Romanian nationalism and the position of the ethnic Hungarian minority in the process of Romania's EU integration)</bold>. <italic>Uluslararasi Hukuk ve Politika (Review of International Law and Politics)</italic> 30, 2012: 125–148.</p>
<p>Central and Eastern European countries in transition to democracy and a market economy faced significant problems preserving and improving minority group rights. Difficulties realizing necessary reforms contributed to strengthening radical nationalist parties. [However,] the ethnic Hungarian minority in Romania [participated in] coalition governments, and made demands without violence. Romanian radical nationalist political parties tend to use discourses such as opposition to globalization, supporting the concept of welfare state and centralization of the state apparatus rather than xenophobia and exclusion of ethnic minorities. This article addresses the relations of ethnic Hungarian minority with the Romanian political system with reference to the EU integration process and analyzes the rising of Romanian radical nationalism in a critical perspective.

<p>62.7900 AKTAR, Cengiz — <bold>The positive agenda and beyond: a new beginning for the EU-Turkey relations?</bold> <italic>Insight Turkey</italic> 14(3), Summer 2012: 35–43.</p>
<p>What do Turkey's democratic transformation, its future EU membership and its growing position in the Middle East signify for a Europe which is experiencing severe difficulties in its relations with Islam? Answers to these questions will determine the EU's future policy towards Turkey both as a candidate for membership and as a full partner of the EU. Only after such a soul-searching can a new era of genuine partnership start between Turkey and its future European partners. Recently the European Commission, in consultation with Turkish authorities, the European Council, as well as members of Turkish civil society, has launched a new initiative, the Positive Agenda. The objective is to revive the stalled relationship between the EU and Turkey by rebuilding confidence and normalizing the process. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.7901 AMBROSETTI, David — <bold>The diplomatic lead in the United Nations Security Council and local actors' violence: the changing terms of a social position</bold>. <italic>African Security</italic> 5(2), Apr.-June 2012: 63–87.</p>
<p>Inspired by interactionist and constructivist sociology, this paper focuses on the UN Security Council as an arena with its own social rules and bureaucratic routines. It presents the informal position that Security Council diplomats delegate to specific members of the Council, the position of “leader”, when dealing with specific dossiers. Indeed, a change occurred during the 1990s and the early 2000s in how Council diplomats considered the task of leading a United Nations peace operation, notably in regard to the use of offensive military. The analysis of this change is documented with empirical material concerning the French leading position in the African Great Lakes region, from Rwanda in 1993 to Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2003. The new “leadership” role calls on UN diplomatic leaders to better protect the credibility of “their” peace operations. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.7902 ANGELOVA, Mariyana; DANNWOLF, Tanja; KÖNIG, Thomas — <bold>How robust are compliance [with EU directives] findings? A research synthesis</bold>. <italic>Journal of European Public Policy</italic> 19(8), 2012: 1269–1291.</p>
<p>This study presents a synthesis of quantitative and qualitative research on compliance with EU directives. We identify and code 12 theoretical arguments tested in 37 published compliance studies and evaluate the robustness and representativeness of their findings. Our synthesis reveals robust findings for the “goodness-of-fit” and “institutional decision-making” arguments, while results on ‘actors’ policy preferences” and “administrative efficiency” remain ambiguous. A closer examination of the studies' research design suggests policy and country selection effects. Specifically, most studies focus on environmental and social policies and rarely include complying Scandinavian states and non-complying Southern states. We therefore recommend a cautious interpretation of existing compliance findings and, for future compliance research, a more careful selection of countries and policy fields. [R]</p>

<p>According to one scenario, by 2020 the creation of a free trade zone will be possible in the region, yet for the moment none of the East Asian countries aspires to such a goal. States within the region might, however, aggravate prospects for regional cooperation by creating a multiplicity of two-sided and three-sided agreements with a limited number of participants. Yet, perspectives for economic integration in the region depend not only on the degree of interrelatedness of local states, but also on the interests of countries like China, Japan, and South Korea, which dominate the region, as well as by US interests, which are capable of exercising a serious influence on the course of integration processes in East Asia.</p>

<p>This article examines the competences of the UN Security Council under the UN “constitution”, focusing in particular on its recent innovations in legislation. Certain critics decry Council legislation as unconstitutional, null and void. Apologists retort that the Charter delegates broad power to the Council, and the impugned legislative resolutions fall well within the broad textual limitations on its competence. I propose an approach to constitutional analysis to help cut through this debate, based on distinguishing between two perspectives on the “constitution” of an international organization: the juridical perspective emphasizing the transmission of validity in the creation, interpretation, and application of legal norms; and the political perspective from which the ordering of power among the constituted bodies may be assessed in terms of legitimacy and justice.

[Résumé en français]</p>
<p>EU is similar to a doll made of one thousand parts. But also, on a very large scale, Europe is neither a country nor a continent or a federation, or union of states, but the application on a geopolitical map of the Matryoshka principle. Why? Because it is related to the stratification of several goals. And we should ask ourselves not which is the need for a Matryoshka-Europe, but for what Europe is NOT useful. Let us think of the [Eastern] Partnership and of the Neighborhood Policy which mean more cooperation or a mutual commitment to common values. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article outlines and explores some of the conditions necessary for International Organizations (IOs) to perform in a public interest fashion through a case study of the Principles of corporate governance formulated by the OECD. Rather than the more commonly documented pathological and dysfunctional behavioral forms of IOs, the case of the Principles, both in their formulation by the OECD, and in their assessment by the World Bank through the ROSC process, represent an episode of IO agency protecting and promoting a wider public interest. In exercising their agency, IO staff, have made the Principles more agreeable to a wider range of interested parties, giving them a general interest orientation, in accordance with a proceduralist definition of public interest.

<p>In the context of increasing fragmentation and functional differentiation in international governance, new environmental regionalism represents a recent trend involving initiatives that seek to territorialize environmental governance at the level of transboundary ecoregions, such as mountain ranges or river basins. This article examines the implications of this trend for sustainable development, defined as a procedural norm for reconciling the tradeoffs between environmental, economic, and social dimensions of wellbeing. This article (1) traces arguments concerning the origins of functional differentiation to research on European state-making; (2) offers two complementary perspectives that generate insights into sustainable development at the transboundary level; and (3) illustrates the significance of these perspectives in the case of the European Alps.

<p>Recent scholarship and practice raise a number of questions about the continued feasibility of negotiating and implementing an ever-larger set of global environmental agreements. In the search for alternative conceptual models and normative orders, regional environmental governance (REG) is (re)emerging as a significant phenomenon in theory and practice. Although environmental cooperation has historically been more prevalent at the regional than at the global level, and has informed much of what we know today about international environmental cooperation, REG has been a neglected topic in the scholarly literature on international relations and international environmental politics. This introduction to the special issue situates theoretical arguments linked to REG in the broader literature, including the nature of regions, the location of regions in multilevel governance, and the normative arguments advanced for and against regional orders. [R, abr.] [Introduction to a thematic issue of the same title, edited by the authors. See also <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7908, 7926, 7937, 7945, 7991, 8007, 8035]</p>

<p>The ongoing transformation toward multilevel governance seems to empower international organizations and thus shines a new spotlight on international civil servants. We know little, however, about what motivates this growing class of bureaucratic elite. Against this background, this article explores the question as to how officials of the European Commission relate to the recent management modernization within their institution (Kinnock reform). Competing explanatory approaches (opportunity, socialization, and governance views) are used to develop hypotheses about the relationship between Commission officials and their acceptance of or opposition to administrative reform. The main finding is that the individual attitudes of Commission officials toward administrative change can best be explained by the opportunity model, which emphasizes the rational calculation of individual costs and benefits.

<p>At the onset of 2011, an unprecedented wave of social unrest and political upheaval began to sweep across the Middle East and North Africa. Following the first demonstrations in Tunisia, and the flight of its President Ben Ali to Saudi Arabia, the wave has engulfed much of the Arab-speaking world, from Morocco to Bahrain. While some rulers have abdicated peacefully, violence has been a constant. In the majority of cases, the ruling regimes met the spontaneous, massive, and peaceful demonstrations with brutal police repression; some even called in the regular army to strike down unarmed civilians with heavy conventional weapons.

<p>By presenting a proposal for the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), in June 2011, the European Commission started negotiations on the EU's budget policy and financial programming. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the MFF negotiations will be extremely difficult because a settlement can be achieved only by consensus. That means that all 27 member states and the EP will have to agree. Two principles might be taken as guidelines to facilitate a compromise: the principle of European solidarity and the principle of European added value. The task will be to define a concept that combines both principles so that it can become the main argument and narrative for explaining the complex budget negotiations, enabling the EU to avoid a stalemate.

<p>In 2001, Tokyo and Brussels had ambitious plans — the EU-Japan Action Plan for Co-operation — for international economic, political and security co-operation. However, few of the envisioned international policies in the areas of global and regional politics and security have actually been implemented. The EU Commission has repeatedly referred to the outcome of envisioned EU-Japan policies as being “disappointing”, acknowledging that the Action Plan suffered from a lack of focus and sought to tackle too many issues and areas without sufficient resources and adequate instruments. Much more could have been done in international conflict-prevention, peace-building and other areas of non-military security cooperation given the resources, instruments and capabilities available in both Europe and Japan. This article analyzes why this did not take place, and is unlikely to take place in the near future. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.8040]</p>

<p><italic>The CAP by 2020</italic> is the Commission's communication preparing the debate on the future of the Common Agricultural Policy. That policy continues to change, reform after reform, with a view to achieving ever-changing goals. I describe, after a quick reminder of the changes and achievements in the past fifty years of agricultural policy, the various contexts in which the CAP will play a role. After going over the procedural novelties of the Lisbon Treaty which combine with the 2003 CAP reform, I [consider] how the current single payment system can justify Europe's support to farmers in the context of the current global recession and over the background of the dead-end of multilateral negotiations.

<p>This article [examines] the COREU network's functioning and its role, taking into account the creation of the European External Action Service. The network has [improved] cooperation on EU foreign policy, by creating a “thick virtual soup” of information [to assist] officials based both in capitals and in Brussels in EU foreign-policy cooperation. The article describes the organization of the circulation of messages and traces the [flow] of COREU messages through EPC/CFSP. It then analyzes how COREU messages contribute to the policy cycle of EU foreign policy and go beyond the remit of CFSP to include national foreign policies. Finally, it shows how the system pre-dates the more recent surge in Brussels-based actors and has been a necessary condition for it, by tracing the development of the Political Committee/Political and Security Committee.

<p>62.7916 BOGDANDY, Armin von — <bold>The European lesson for international democracy: the significance of Articles 9 to 12 EU Treaty for international organizations</bold>. <italic>European Journal of International Law</italic> 23(2), May 2012: 315–334.</p>
<p>This article argues that Articles 9 to 12 of the EU Treaty provide a promising way to conceptualize and develop the democratic legitimation of international organizations. To be sure, the current EU is not a democratic showcase. However, an innovative concept of democracy, neither utopian nor apologetic, has found its way into its founding treaty. It can point the way in conceiving and developing the democratic credentials not just of the EU, but of public authority beyond the state in general. Since comparison is a main avenue to insight, this article presents those Articles and show what lessons can be learned for international organizations.

[Résumé en français]</p>
<p>The democratic and political process underway in the Mediterranean since early 2011 [has] significant consequences for Europe, due to the geostrategic situation of the countries in transition. The relationship between the Union and the Mediterranean states has deeply changed in the past years, both in terms of objectives and action methods. Its main leverage means were the Barcelona process and the Union for the Mediterranean, this [latter] being more [like] the European Neighborhood Policy, set up in 2003–2004 to redefine and supervise the relationships between the Union and adjacent countries. In the aftermath of the Arab revolutions, the ENP now has to find a booster, and be revised in its approach to the many transitions that Arab countries are going through. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Although the Strasbourg Court is primarily a mechanism for the protection of individual human rights, many leading cases on violation of Art. 3 have a collective or a structural dimension. This [matters] for the Convention Against Torture (CAT) definition of torture, which is that torture must have a purpose. Many Kurdish and Chechen complaints against Turkey and Russia respectively relate to the consequences of self-determination struggles and repressive state responses. In many of the Russian cases concerning Art. 3, they relate to the structural problems of the Russian penitentiary system, in which the officers, mostly ex-military, see the prisoners as the enemy.

<p>62.7919 BROMLEY, Mark; COOPER, Neil; HOLTOM, Paul — <bold>The UN Arms Trade Treaty: arms export controls, the human security agenda and the lessons of history</bold>. <italic>International Affairs</italic> 88(5), Sept. 2012: 1029–1048.</p>
<p>The [unsuccessful] UN conference to negotiate an Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) marks the latest in a series of attempts to insert human security concerns into arms-export controls. The setback raises questions about the current level of international support for the human security agenda, as well as the relative power of different actors to shape global governance structures. This article locates the ATT negotiations in the broader history of multilateral efforts to regulate the international arms trade, from the 1890 Brussels Act to post-Cold War initiatives. The draft ATT included human security provisions, but China, Russia, the US and a number of emerging powers ensured that state security considerations remained paramount in decision-making on arms exports. The article considers the options available to supporters of the ATT process. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.7920 BUCHAN, Russell — <bold>Cyber attacks: unlawful uses of force or prohibited interventions?</bold> <italic>Journal of Conflict and Security Law</italic> 17(2), Summer 2012: 211–227.</p>
<p>The legality of cyber attacks is generally approached from the use-of-force prohibition in Article 2(4) UN Charter. In order to constitute an unlawful use of force, it is widely accepted that an intervention must produce physical damage. Of course, a cyber attack can cause physical damage and therefore violate Article 2(4). Upon the available evidence, I submit that the deployment of the Stuxnet virus against Iran in 2010 is such an example. However, the issue is that many cyber attacks do not manifest physical damage and are thus not captured by Article 2(4). Contrary to claims in existing cyber-war literature, this does not mean that such attacks are lawful. Instead, I argue that where such attacks are coercive in nature they will nevertheless violate the non-intervention principle that is embedded in customary international law.

<p>The original creators of cyberspace hoped for freedom from state regulation, but their hopes were dashed by the quickly growing importance the internet assumed in economic, socio-cultural and political affairs. Since nations thus continue to play an important regulatory role in this area, the regulation of cross-border data flows requires their cooperation which, however, is fraught with difficulties. This contribution analyzes three case studies about negotiations between the US and the EU, namely the “safe harbor” agreement, the dispute about the transfer of flight passenger name records and the question of access to financial transfers data.

<p>The subsidiarity control mechanisms of the Lisbon Treaty have received much attention with their promise to redress the position of national and regional parliaments, seen as losers in the integration process. Two years later, the question remains as to whether these novelties have actually succeeded. Given the greater scrutiny capacity of national parliaments, the variety of member state adaptations is assessed, such as using binding mandates, the role of the second chambers, and the concepts of the subsidiarity principle. While there is significant activism by legislative actors, actual change has been so far very limited. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Since 1989, questions of citizenship and statelessness in Europe are once again dynamic. On the one hand, exclusionary forces have become reinvigorated, including as a result of ethno-nationalism. In addition, new forms of status have been created, severely limiting participation and inclusion rights. Minorities have been particularly subject to exclusion, with Roma [Gypsies] and Russians affected in particular. On the other hand, regional and international lawmaking has endeavored to counteract these forces. This article summarizes these developments, with a particular focus on EU and Council of Europe law.

<p>Humanitarian interventions under the authorization of the UN Security Council that infringe on a state's sovereignty have recently become the subject of increased debate. This stems from the evocation of the responsibility to protect doctrine for the first time in Libya last year and from attempts to take similar action in relation to Syria. Critics of the doctrine maintain that it is an attempt to facilitate the geo-political interest of states in the Security Council, whereas supporters point to its role in preventing genocide and mass atrocities within states' boundaries. The accepted middle-path could be to strengthen existing international institutions by enabling the UN Peace Keeping Force to take the mantle of implementing the council's resolutions aimed at promoting international peace and security.

<p>The EU's discourse of “partnership” in the Global Approach to Migration and Mobility and the widely expressed critique of this discourse as a process of “externalization' of EU policy both depend on unitary accounts of the main policy actors involved. Two separate literatures contest such unitary accounts. Within political science and IR, institutional approaches identify a range of strategic actors involved in policy development; in anthropology, there is a well-established interest in the strategic behavior of disempowered actors. I link these two approaches with an examination of undocumented migrants as strategic actors. I use a case study of events at the borders between Morocco and the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla in late 2005 to identify the ways in which even highly marginalized migrants were able to develop transnational social organizations.

<p>This essay examines some of the reasons for the upsurge in interest in regional approaches to global environmental challenges. One reason is a growing sense of obstruction and drift at the global level. With the rate of formation of new global environmental agreements lagging, with many existing agreements seemingly stalled, and with the momentum of global summitry having faded, regions may seem a more pragmatic scale at which to promote the diffusion of ideas, the development of institutions, and social mobilization for change. Beyond political pragmatism, there are also conceptually interesting arguments that regions hold promise for strengthening global environmental governance. The regional scale may offer superior conditions to the global for common-property resource-management — although the historical track record seems mixed at best, and formidable barriers to collective action remain.

<p>European integration features a clash of capitalisms for the normative governance of the European political economy between two loose coalitions: liberal and regulated capitalism. This article focuses on the impact of the 2004 EU enlargement upon the EU's clash of capitalisms. It analyzes two EU policy negotiations which relate to the European Social Model (ESM): the revision of the Working Time Directive and Services Directive. The two case-studies reveal that the 2004 new member states consistently joined the liberal coalition. The 2004 enlargement has therefore strengthened the liberal coalition within the EU's clash of capitalisms. Within the ESM this has resulted in a political stalemate and is likely to prevent future policy initiatives in the social policy field. [R]</p>

<p>This article analyzes the nature and significance of the recent EU poverty and social exclusion target, which has become part of the EU's new 10-year strategy, “Europe 2020”. It situates this analysis in the politics of social policy, at both transnational and national levels. The agreement on the target proved to be momentous and also contentious for the key actors involved — the Member States, the European Commission, the EP — all of which were forced to change their position at some stage of the negotiations. The agreed target — to lift at least 20 million people out of poverty and social exclusion by 2020 — is ambitious and novel in an EU context. The analysis undertaken here underlines its specificity and some weaknesses. [R, abr.]</p>

The second image reversed of intellectual property rights</bold>. <italic>Politische Vierteljahresschrift</italic> Sonderheft 46, 2012: 465–499.</p>
<p>Our paper addresses the relationship between the EU and the new changing global intellectual property rights (IPR) regime. By exploring the existence and workings of “second image reversed processes”, we regard the EU as a political subject participating in the negotiations on international IPR regimes, [and] ask whether the “downloading” of the new global IPR regime also changes EU policies. We assume that the emerging international IPR regimes influence the EU by altering its domestic balance, changing actors' objectives as well as by modifying domestic power balances and perceptions of legitimacy. The impact of IPR regimes depends critically on whether the norms derived from an international regime can be dealt with technocratically, in order to facilitate the formation of a winning coalition and to prevent member states' resistance.

<p>Many Americans are overwhelmed when confronted with questions relating to the EU. And sociologists who are not working directly on related themes, as well as social theorists concerned with incarnations of modern society, have long ignored the peculiar character and historical implications of the developing EU. But now a growing number of European theorists have begun to focus on the significance of European integration for the very discipline of sociology. To situate and evaluate some of this recent work, I deploy B. Gregg's distinction between “thick norms” and “thin politics”. That distinction helps us see that developments in the EU point toward the formation of a new kind of modern society. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.6980]</p>

<p>The question that presents itself is whether the EU's policy instruments have been able to deliver upon their promises.

<p>Since the introduction of the co-decision procedure by way of the Maastricht Treaty, the procedure has been transformed considerably. One of the most striking innovations is the possibility to adopt a legislative act in first reading. This article [considers] whether the increasing use of this fast-track procedure is in line with Treaty provisions and/or intra/inter-institutional rules, and what are the effects of these stipulations. The empirical findings indicate that two reasons for taking the fast track gain dominance in the practical political process, i.e., the political priorities of the Council and EP and whether these actors consider a legislative file as urgent.

<p>The current political climate in the EU — the “constraining dissensus” — may place negotiations on the multiannual EU budget center-stage. Media-framing of EU budget negotiations as conflict between member states may reinforce the constraining dissensus by resonating with exclusive national identity. In contrast, media emphasis on conflict within or across member states may alleviate the constraining dissensus by strengthening cross-cutting cleavages. This study tests hypotheses about patterns in politicization of the EU budget in three budgets (Delors II, Agenda 2000, Financial Perspectives 2007–2013), three countries (the Netherlands, Denmark and Ireland) and two forums (media and national parliaments). It finds predominant international conflict-framing, especially in media. Thus, media coverage of EU budget negotiations likely reinforces the constraining dissensus. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This contribution analyzes the conflicts of justice that are increasingly visible in Europe. It argues that while EU law can be understood as an instrument for the incorporation of the demands of justice and the articulation of “the good” beyond the nation-state, it also potentially skews the distributive criteria and assumptions of justice that underlie the national welfare state. In light of the absence of a transnational political system that can bound such conflicts of justice, this article suggests that the capacity of the EU to contribute to, rather than detract from, the attainment of justice depends on the careful articulation and institutionalisation of the different types of transnational solidarity that exist in Europe.

<p>62.7937 DEBARBIEUX, Bernard — <bold>How regional is regional environmental governance?</bold> <italic>Global Environmental Politics</italic> 12(3), Aug. 2012: 119–126.</p>
<p>One of the most striking features of the work of scientists specialized in regional environmental governance is the huge diversity of ways they refer to the notion of region. In this academic subfield, “regionality” refers to different orders of reality (ontology), and regions have a heterogeneous status in the production of knowledge (epistemology). While such a diversity of uses and meanings illustrates the rich potential of a regional scope in environmental governance analysis, scholars' ontological and epistemological stances must be made more explicit. This commentary elaborates this suggestion and illustrates it on the basis of the articles published in this special issue. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7909]</p>

<p>This article first gives a brief description of the role (or lack thereof) of popular sovereignty in the construction of the EU. It argues that the basic premise of European integration — that it slowly marches forward, driven by elite consensus and not popular will — became an obstacle rather than a resource in addressing some of the major problems in the EU.

<p>This article examines the development and particular nature of the rule of law in the EU against the background of the wider legal and political theoretical debate on the principle.

It argues that the principle has developed greatly since its first mention in the case law of the Court and contends that the principle has a particular focus in the EU on judicial protection in light of human rights. Nonetheless, it is hard to apply the dichotomies running through the debates in legal and political theory to the development of the principle in the EU; an idiosyncratic mix of features seems to emerge.

<p>Few issues are more important to scholars of Europe's emergence as a foreign policy actor than whether the EU can forge a common defense-industrial policy out of 27 states' procurement policies and defense industries. Overlooked in most scholarly analyses of European defense-industrial cooperation, the story of Europe's international armaments organizations stretches back more than six decades. In this article, we examine the impact of past institutional outcomes on the defense-industrial field by applying the concepts and analytic tools of historic institutionalism to European armaments organizations. Because past institutional dynamics have channeled the subsequent development of armaments cooperation, what has emerged is a polycentric governance architecture wherein organizations with transatlantic, pan-European and restrictive-European memberships dominate distinct components of the cooperative process.

<p>This article reviews the European Council's CFSP performance since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. The yardstick used is the degree to which the European Council has managed to foster a common approach to the international foreign and security problems confronting the EU. While the European Council has, in the past, been reasonably successful in shaping and establishing the basic structures for the CFSP and the CSDP, analysis shows that its intergovernmental nature and the sporadic character of its meetings make it entirely unsuited for the role of CFSP “executive” in crisis moments. Through its institutional shortcomings as crisis manager, the European Council is itself a contributing factor fostering twenty-seven unilateral or sub-EU initiatives by Member States with a greater diplomatic tradition and capacity.

<p>EU foreign policy has long been considered the <italic>domaine réservé</italic> of the member states. This article challenges such conventional state-centered wisdom by analyzing the influence of the Brussels-based EU officials in the CSDP. Using four case studies and data from 105 semi-structured interviews, it shows that EU officials are most influential in the agenda-setting phase and more influential in civilian than in military operations. Their prominence in agenda-setting can be explained by their central position in the policy process. This allows them to get early involved in the operations. The absence of strong control mechanisms and doctrine in civilian crisis management gives them opportunities to affect civilian missions. Finally, EU officials direct civilian operations from Brussels, whereas the command of military operations is with the member states and NATO. [R]</p>

<p>Despite pervasive downward pressure on government policy from exogenous forces, the author argues that partisanship still exerts an effect on privatization in Latin America. When a country is indebted to the IMF, and a government of the right is in power, scholars can expect increased levels of privatization. However, when a country is indebted to the IMF and a government of the left is in power, electoral incentives will prompt these governments to ignore IMF pressure and reduce levels of privatization. The author tests this argument on a data-set of eighteen Latin American countries, between the years 1984 and 1998. [R]</p>

<p>Public evaluations of EU performance are not only critical indicators of the EU's output legitimacy, but also shape future support for European integration. For citizens to monitor the political performance of the EU they need relevant facts, yet it is anything but clear that gains in information about EU performance cause change in judgments about such performance. Drawing on two-wave panel data, this article examines whether acquiring information following a real-world EU decision-making event alters citizens' judgments about the utilitarian and democratic performance of the EU. It also examines how this effect differs for people with different levels of general political information. It is found that citizens who acquired performance-relevant information became more approving of the EU's utilitarian performance but did not change their judgments about its democratic performance.

<p>This article examines the ways in which governments “govern” environmental issues at a regional scale under the auspices of ASEAN, against the backdrop of debates about the political topography of Southeast Asian regionalism. The framework brings together analyses of the public space of formal regional governance arrangements, the inter-subjective space of regional identity-building, and the private space of regional social practices. Underpinning this is the question of whether moves to supposedly “flatter” forms of regional governance have been accompanied by far more democratic or participatory forms of regionalism. I conclude that regional environmental structures under ASEAN are more akin to “invited spaces” and have generally failed to offer effective channels of communication for, or democratic representation of, a wider range of stakeholders, including civil society groups and local communities.

<p>The authors argue that the main pattern of democratization in Europe has unfolded on the plane EU organized as a multilevel system of representative parliamentary government and that it has developed a structure of representation that is theoretically challenging: it not only falls short of, but clearly differs from the two-channel structure characteristic of federal systems. To address this difficulty, they present an institutional variant of deliberative theory that conceives of democracy as both a higher-order legitimization principle that prescribes the requisite conditions for justification and as an organizational form for handling common affairs.

Composed of [mostly] Latin American troops, MINUSTAH has been exposed to pressures that range from the UN “liberal peace model”, French colonial heritage and previous US interference, to post-colonial world-views and local demands. Although MINUSTAH was framed inside a specific UN mission pattern, grounded in a supposedly dominant francophone culture and located on the “outskirts” of the US, it has been subjected to a plurality of other pressures and opened to multiple rearticulations of its original mandate.

<p>Far from using the scheme of an (incomplete) federal state, the fundamental legal structure of the EU is of a cosmopolitical union as sketched by Kant in “Perpetual Peace” — with three “levels of relationship to public law” (<italic>ius civitatis, ius gentium, ius cosmopoliticum</italic>). However, the process of European integration brings out confusing distinctions: between citizenship and nationality, people and nation, authority and sovereignty, negative and positive sovereignty, international and transnational law, state and Constitution. As regards the (cosmo) political Europa, the Union must face internal difficulties of political responsibility, authority, and representativeness — i.e. about the political legitimacy of the European project itself. It is imperative to reconsider its purposes. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7193]</p>

The limited provisions in the Rome Statute which afford a degree of oversight on prosecutorial discretion were never properly activated by the Court, with the result that the evidence which emerged during trial that exceeded the charges was never considered.

<p>The Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) exemplifies interconnections and contradictions between geopolitical and geo-economic agendas, including security, democracy, and resource-marketing. Central American sovereignty is selectively weakened as states are increasingly dependent on the US and must synchronize governance with the expectations of their most important trade partner or risk becoming defendants in international tribunals. Salvadoran and Costa Rican governments have been accused of upholding environmental regulations that impede the profit-earning of multinational corporations, while the Guatemalan state was charged with violating domestic labor laws. Five years after CAFTA's implementation, there is evidence of the erosion of democracy, repression of civil society, and uneven distribution of trade costs and benefits. Some analysts conclude CAFTA must be renegotiated, while others recommend human and labor rights protocols accompany free trade agreements. [R, abr.]</p>

The EU must not only modify its system and improve expensive policies which are in permanent crisis anyway. The Union needs a well-prepared and consistently implemented modernization, which does not repeat M. Gorbachev's and V. Putin's errors. Modernization must not end up with the EU's erosion and destruction for the consequences would be terrifying not only for Europe, but also for the rest of the world.</p>

<p>A review of the UN Security Council and its permanent members regarding international criminal law shows that while the Council has been consistently “seized” with this subject matter, narrow conceptions of national interest often negatively impact the quest for a humane rule of law in world affairs. Agreement among the P-5 often proves difficult, contributing to a wide array of adopted measures on this subject without great consistency. The Council's toolbox is large and varied, but a dependable and consistent pattern of policy-making has proven elusive. Particularly for the “Big Three” — China, Russia, and the US — double standards are blatant, as they often demand of others what they are unwilling to accept themselves. Nevertheless, the Security Council has paid much more attention to international criminal law than many observers forecast. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>With the creation of the African Peace and Security Architecture in 2004, African states were aiming to assume the primary responsibility for peace and security on the continent and establish a structure to assemble the necessary financial and military means. However, despite the constant evocation of “African ownership”, it is non-African actors that call the tune and can define and drive African security. Based on a detailed juxtaposition of rhetoric and empirical evidence, this paper argues that significant conceptual and practical problems constrain the “Africanization” of African security and that it appears increasingly unlikely that the continent's states will be able to achieve the desired primacy in security affairs in the foreseeable future.

This paper transcends this debate, identifying in the goals a logic of ambitious social, cultural and spatial engineering. Inspired by Foucaultian development anthropology, the paper highlights three themes implicit in MDG texts, requiring biopolitical interventions on bodies, societies and spaces, namely risk, sex, gender and family; Homo Economicus; and the city.

<p>UN Peace Operations and UN-mandated Peace Enforcement Operations, which are usually conducted by regional organizations or ad hoc coalitions of States, are wholly dependent upon the voluntary contribution of troops by Member States. This involves transferring parts of command authority to the UN or to the regional organization which has undertaken the mission under UN mandate, while other aspects of authority over the troops remain under the control of the State which is contributing its troops. This partial transfer of authority results in complex multilayered command structures, raising questions [about authority] in relation to allegations of violations of international law and the appropriate remedies. This article [examines] the types of command structures most often used in both UN and UN-mandated operations and explores the questions resulting from these in relation to attribution of conduct.

Based on its analysis of the adoption processes within the UN as well as the debates in the General Assembly on the implementation of RtoP, it concludes that there is an acceptance in the international community of a moral responsibility to act in cases of grave violations of human rights. Nevertheless, in the near future, RtoP is not likely to obtain the status of an international political or legal norm due to the inherent political constraints of the UN. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Literary critic and essayist K. H. Bohrer offers a Eurosceptic perspective on the German commitment to a united Europe. This article is a reconstruction of Bohrer's argument. It identifies two distinct critiques. The first is a somewhat prosaic observation that the differences between the national traditions of Europe are simply too great for a united Europe to be viable. The other is a more complex reflection on “European decadence”: Europeans lack the will that is required to project power, and power is a precondition for cultural achievements. Protestantism — the “Protestant mind” — plays a central role in this second critique. The two critiques are connected through Bohrer's conception of the nation-state as an entity that integrates in an agonistic way legal and cultural power. [R]</p>

<p>EU healthcare services policy has been largely driven by the ECJ applying the law of the internal market to the previously separate area of healthcare systems. We argue that it opened up two major risks: that health-service planning would be disrupted by cross-border flows of patients and professionals, including ostensibly interchangeable professionals or procedures that actually vary in quality; and that health systems would be disrupted by the application of liberalizing EU regulatory frameworks. The threats have largely been managed by four developments. Cross-border flows have largely appeared as spot markets rather than broad competition. States, meanwhile, have managed both regulatory and planning risks by debating and then legislating, which increases legal certainty, and the ECJ has taken the hint and become more cautious in its rulings.

<p>Numerous studies and theoretical analyses have examined and explained the role of law in the progress of European integration. The ECJ draws much attention in this context. However, the inflexible, mechanistic and universalistic notion of rationality that these works employ leads to serious misinterpretations and unjustified criticism regarding the role of the ECJ. Within the frameworks of contemporary approaches, the Court is perceived as just one more political player among other actors and institutions, able to shape the EU in the pursuit of its own rational interests. By outlining the theoretical concept of context rationality, this article shows that the logics of law and judicial lawmaking are based on a non-trivial and non-political rationality and cannot be understood appropriately without paying attention to the context of European law.

Posavec simultaneously reflects on representative democracy as the form of democracy on which the EU is predominantly founded. Beside a valorization of Posavec's works on democracy in the EU, this paper deals with the problem of the democratic deficit in the EU which is manifest in the lack of democratic legitimacy of EU institutions, with the sole exception of the EP.

[Résumé en français]</p>
<p>While proponents of the new institutionalism are engaged in a conceptual bidding war, this article sets out to reintegrate empirical data into debates often disconnected from facts. It tests a part of this analytical framework on an in-depth case study of the “Working Time Directive” review. In this case, policymakers face many obstacles blocking the revision of the directive, even though they unanimously want to reconsider this text that has taken an unexpected direction as a result of several decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union. This article shows that both the tools of rational choice institutionalism and those of historical institutionalism — often conceptually opposed in the literature — are helpful to analyze this situation. Therefore, it emphasizes the heuristic interest of using the new institutionalism framework in a pragmatic and not dogmatic way. [R]</p>

<p>A thematic examination of the IMF and the World Bank's recent crisis programs finds strong evidence of prescriptive continuity with the pre-crisis repertoire of these organizations, contradicting their legacy of policy adaptation during times of systemic turbulence. How are we to account for this anomaly? The current specialist literature on the Fund and Bank stresses principal–agent relations and intra-organizational dynamics. Yet these approaches need to be complemented by focusing on the Fund and Bank's borrowers. Of particular relevance is the growing diversification of development trajectories in the South, which creates strong disincentives against paradigm recalibration. The article highlights the analytic potential of one vital dimension of this diversification: the shrinking common ground of macroeconomic failure in large emerging economies, illustrated here in a brief comparison of Mexico, Thailand and Turkey.

<p>Every year Europe faces the arrival of thousands of stateless migrants in search of a more dignified life. Most of them are in need of protection. In most EU member states, statelessness is predominantly a migratory phenomenon and often linked to forced migration. Yet, statelessness has to-date not been part of mainstream European policy discussions on international protection. Consequently, statelessness frequently remains a hidden phenomenon in the EU, making persons without a nationality invisible and living on the margins of society. This article examines the EU framework for international protection and the forms of protection stateless forced migrants can currently count on in the Union.

<p>UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's first term of office was not an easy one considering the long shadow that his charismatic predecessor Kofi Annan had cast (and for many still casts). However, reviewing Ban's work from 2007 through 2011 shows that he was by no means without success. Some of his achievements include, for example, a leading role in calling for a transition in the Middle east during the Arab Spring, and a move towards greater bureaucratic transparency and accountability. However, his leadership style, described by some as an “iron fist in a velvet glove” or “Asian style”, has been found to be too hesitant and too reserved to meet the expectations for a UN Secretary-General in the 21st c.

<p>Recovering the regulatory power of politics by way of increased supranational organization frequently arouses fears about the fate of national democracy and of the democratic sovereign threatened to be dispossessed by executive powers operating independently at the global level. Against such political defeatism, this contribution takes the example of the EU to refute the underlying claim that a transnationalization of popular sovereignty cannot be achieved without lowering the level of democratic legitimation. It focuses on three components of every democratic polity — the association of free and equal legal persons, a bureaucratic organization for collective action, and civic solidarity as a medium of political integration — to argue that the new configuration they take at the European level, when compared with the context of the nation-state, does not in principle diminish the democratic legitimacy of the new transnational polity.

<p>This article examines the EU's post-1967 conflict-resolution policies pertaining to the dispute over sovereignty over Jerusalem. Analytically, it provides the first in-depth, genealogical analysis of the evolution of the EU policies, distilling four “generations” of them, while normatively, it offers a critique of the consistency, coherence and legal cogency of such policies and their compatibility with international law. Yet the importance of this article lies beyond the particular case-study of Jerusalem, as it establishes that EU conflict-resolution policies may be contextualized within the conceptual in the EU's self-perceived role, from “what it is” to “what it does”, from passively representing “power of attraction” to adopting the proactive role of an “ethical power”.

<p>Current conflicts about the governance of knowledge and information are not simply conflicts about the merits or shortcomings of specific regulations, but they are also conflicts about what kind of knowledge should be conceptualized as intellectual property.

I explain why in the first case a group of actors that traditional interest group research would qualify as weak in almost every aspect, was successful, while a similar coalition was without any chance in the second case.

<p>This article investigates the consequences of fast-track legislation in the EU. It focuses on the EP's intra-organizational response. It first describes how the early adoption of EU legislation has informalized legislative decision-making, transformed inter-organizational relations, and induced power shifts. It then discusses the political response, showing that actors seek to redress power shifts, that reform attempts center on the control of negotiation authority and information flows, and that reform is highly contested. Based on qualitative document-analysis and semi-structured elite interviews, an analysis is made of how Parliament's rules of colegislation have been contested, negotiated and reformed from the formal introduction of fast-track legislation in 1999 to the adoption of the Code of Conduct for Negotiating in the Context of Co-decision Procedures in 2009.

<p>This article illustrates how organizational learning can explain the shift in UN peacekeeping exit strategies from the election-based approach of the 1990s to peace-building. Conceptualizing learning as an ideal-type, three-step process, of knowledge acquisition, interpretation and institutionalization, the analysis reveals the impact of new knowledge on institutional change. It demonstrates how knowledge acquisition became systematized within the UN Secretariat especially after 2000, with the active promotion of boundary-spanning activities. The analysis then shows how a shared understanding of the role of peace-building for exit strategies was developed by the organization's bureaucracy and intergovernmental bodies in the interpretation step. Finally, it highlights how the establishment of the Peace-building Commission institutionalized the transition to peace-building as the new exit strategy and how new learning capacities were created.

<p>Cohesion policy accounts for the largest area of expenditure in the EU budget. Because of its scope and redistributive nature, evaluation is particularly important.

It illustrates how political science theories can provide scholars with useful insights into the way EU policy evaluation is carried out. It develops a toolkit for analyzing real-world approaches to evaluation and then applies it to three separate cohesion policy programs. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article argues that the advent of a unipolar world following the end of the Cold War changed Canada's relation to and participation in NATO. It demonstrates how Canada's engagement in NATO combat operations since 1992 has been motivated primarily by a need to please the US. It explores Canada's role through NATO in the Balkans, Afghanistan, Iraq, the Horn of Africa, and Libya. The desire to be a strong ally to the US is the major driver of Canada's shift from the role of peace-keeper to peace-supporter. It explores the reasons why Canada did not join the US-led coalition to overthrow the regime of Saddam Hussein in 2003, a decision that is an anomaly in post-Cold War Canadian foreign policy.

<p>The Hague Declaration of 1991 between Japan and the European Community was originally intended to enhance the bilateral relationship, but the reality was little more than a reluctant promotion of several insignificant programs. Meanwhile, although the EU has significantly developed its partnership with China, it has become ambivalent about the future of EU-Asia relations. While endeavoring to expand its economic ties with China, the EU also attempts to be a “normative power”, but, because of the limited nature of the EU's influence in East Asia, it needs normative partners in this region. This article argues that the EU-Japan relationship is becoming more vital because of the increasing importance of norms due to the rise of China. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.8040]</p>

<p>In the context of EU-ACP trade relations, the EU has now drawn up a special kind of FTA, the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs). Designed for developing countries, EPAs include a range of non-mercantilist goals. In accordance with this, EPAs were announced as the dawn of a new era in trade relations with developing countries. This article takes the controversial field of intellectual property [IP] enforcement as an example for scrutinizing that new approach. A comparison of their rules on IP-enforcement to standard IP-enforcement provisions of a purely economic character, prominently the EU's domestic legislation, Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement [ACTA] and general FTAs, sadly hints that any enthusiasm over EPAs in terms of development-friendliness may be premature.

The article [examines] the case study of the UNTAES peacekeeping mission carried out from January 1996 to January 1998 in Eastern Slavonia, Sirmium and Baranja, one of the very rare examples of successful application of the second generation of UN peacekeeping missions, but also of peacekeeping missions in general.

<p>Public sector unions push for unmerited wage increases, exacerbating inflation and deficits. Despite this conventional wisdom, governments in several European countries successfully limited public sector wage growth during the 1980s and 1990s. This article argues that the recent rise in public sector wage inflation in the Eurozone is an unintended consequence of the shift towards EMU. I argue that monetary union's predecessors, the European Monetary System and Maastricht, imposed an institutional constraint on governments, which enhanced their ability to impose moderation: national-level, inflation-averse central banks that could punish rent-seeking sectoral wage-setters via monetary contraction. Monetary union's alteration of this constraint weakened governments' capabilities to deny inflationary settlements. [R]</p>

<p>If there is a road towards safeguarding effective EU climate leadership in the post-Kyoto era, it would lie in the gaining of long-term possession of three characteristics: “actorness” (rooted in internal cohesion and autonomy), “power” (potential to influence the external context), and “integrity” (credible self-commitment to ecological sustainability). However, we should be skeptical about the capability of the EU to follow this path and achieve leadership in future global climate-change politics. Three arguments are developed in defense of this thesis, each addressing one of the characteristics mentioned. To various extents, these arguments draw on the concept of, and research findings about, “policy transfer”. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7296]</p>

<p>In a globalized world in which different cultures and religions intermingle and live in close proximity to one another, there are hardly any truly mono-religious states any more. At the same time, mainstream politics has become significantly secularized in most of Europe. This has implications for the way the role of religiously motivated values are perceived in the context of making and interpreting legal rules. Seen from a specifically Catholic perspective, this article investigates whether it is morally licit to import (religiously motivated moral) values into law. Looking at the moral fundament of the European Convention of Human Rights and at the issue of the right to life of unborn children, the relationship between justice and faith is investigated.

<p>Over the last two decades, transboundary regional environmental governance has witnessed some institutional change through an increasing shift from intergovernmentally constituted political institutions to new complex structures of decision-making where policy-making has begun to adapt to a new, more active role of societal actors at multiple levels of political authority. In addressing this issue, the article raises the following questions: How can new structures and processes of public deliberation and participation in transboundary regional environmental governance be designed, and which opportunities and risks emerge? To address these questions, the article develops a normative-analytical design for regional environmental governance in ecoregions; this design defines the conditions under which public deliberation and participation conveying discourse, argument, and persuasion can help to democratize collective decision-making.

<p>The discourse on EU-Russia relations amongst practitioners, think-tank experts, journalists and academics has congealed around a postmodern-modern binary.

This article argues that the EU's supposed postmodern geopolitics remains enmeshed in a very modern temporality — a consciousness of time that valorizes the present over the past. It also detects a problematic disillusion with the postmodern and questions its implicit normativity. [R]</p>

<p>Does lobbying success in the EU vary systematically across interest group type? Interest groups lobby the European institutions in order to achieve policy decisions in line with their own preferences. While some argue that different types of interest groups are equally able to shape European policy-making, others contend that lobbying success is systematically biased towards some powerful interest groups. The empirical evidence is contradictory, as previous studies focused either on a specific interest group type or on a specific policy area so that it is difficult to draw general conclusions. This study therefore presents an extensive empirical analysis of lobbying success across a wide variety of interest groups and policy issues by combining a quantitative text analysis of Commission consultations with an online survey among interest groups.

<p>Even though the EU and China are different types of political units, this article explains why they can be compared in a meaningful way as internal migration areas. National citizenship of an EU member state is compared to <italic>hukou</italic> status in China, as both constitute relevant affiliations to geopolitical units with decisive implications for social citizenship. The development of social citizenship with regard to these affiliations is described. A periodization of developments in relation to legal affiliation and social rights since the 1950s is suggested, showing that there are converging trends between the EU and China. Nowadays, the EU and China are areas of virtually free movement. However, the EU is far ahead concerning the social rights of internal migrants, while China has only recently started putting efforts in this direction. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>According to its seven member states, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, founded in 2002, is to provide for security in the post-Soviet realm. But it does not. There are structural reasons for this dysfunction: the primary objective of the authoritarian regimes from Minsk to Moscow and Dushanbe is the preservation and expansion of their power. Regional cooperation that goes beyond lip service contradicts the regimes' comprehensive claim to internal and external sovereignty. [R]</p>

<p>“Normative power” acknowledges the normative foundations of the European project, examines how Europe acts to (re)shape internationally accepted norms, and claims that Europe “ought” to influence external partners' conception of “normal” behavior in pursuit of a just global order. This article, however, argues that a “moral economy perspective” is central to a critical reorientation of the concept of normative power towards appraisal of discrepancies between nominal EU norms and material EU policy outcomes. Examining Europe's “normative power” in its relations with the African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries, it demonstrates how a moral economy of ACP-EU ties has been instituted in negotiation with European ethical norms as to solidarity with “the poor”.

<p>62.7998 LAW, John — <bold>Sense on [EU] federalism</bold>. <italic>Political Quarterly</italic> 83(3), July-Sept. 2012: 541–550.</p>
<p>Debate on the relevance of federalism to the development of the EU is often characterized by mutual incomprehension on either side. Close inspection, however, reveals that the precise meaning of the federal concept in political science remains unsettled. This article looks back to the earliest origins of federalism, in order to establish a firm basis for suggesting improvements. The idea of divided sovereignty, “invented” in America and now thought to lie at the heart of the federal concept, is identified to be a false construction. On these grounds, it is proposed that the definition of federalism be clarified today as not “a division of sovereignty between two levels of government”, but instead “a division of the powers flowing from sovereignty between two levels of government of equal status”.

<p>Recent years have seen a rapid rise of European right-wing parties, many of which have won national elections and taken over political power in their countries. Throughout Europe, they have benefited from current social and political problems. Even where they have not triumphed electorally, far-right parties have forced mainstream politicians to reverberate their Euroskeptic rhetoric. Right-wing parties from various countries and with various political backgrounds — right-wing populists, rightist extremists or conservatives — have consolidated over the past decades and are now well-established in the EP. I analyze the rise of those parties in Southeastern Europe and ask whether the accession of the so-called western Balkan countries will strengthen the group of xenophobic and Euroskeptic parties in the EP and hence affect the European integration project.

<p>The OSCE and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) represent competing sets of international norms in Central Asia. The contestation between these sets of norms has not led to a complete polarization between members of the two organizations, however. Instead, the OSCE has used a range of discursive tactics to reduce political contestation, downplaying some contested issues and seeking shared discourses on security threats. This article explores these tactics and suggests that these discursive shifts may eventually threaten the normative identity of the OSCE and lead to the acceptance of a more hybrid set of security-related norms in the region.

<p>The current debates about Coalitions of Developing Countries in the GATT/WTO stimulated, largely, in Narlikarś book (2003) have neglected the importance of domestic policies for the result of the negotiations in trade institutions. We argue that understanding of domestic policies is the required, but not sufficient, to explain the results of the political bargains between rich countries and coalitions between developing countries. In this way, there are two conditions, not mutually exclusive, influencing the performances of Internationals Coalitions: (1) One or more powerful countries that are against these alliances search disintegrate the domestics interests from the participators nations from these unions; (2) Alliance from developing countries seeking to influence the domestic policy from country or from more countries that are against it. To support our argument, we will analyze two cases of international coalitions: The Access to Medicines Campaign against to HIV/Aids and The Group 20 (G-20). [R]</p>

<p>Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC) were expected to benefit substantially from EU membership. However, these positive expectations, which are underpinned by rational institutional and normative theories of enlargement, have become challenged by the effects of the 2004 and 2007 enlargement rounds. Therefore, drawing on the liberal intergovernmental approach (LIG), the article tests an alternative explanation. First, it is proposed that EU decision-making powers are constrained by other powers possessed by the national governments. Second, the distributional issues are determined by individual interests and relative power (dependence). Third, economic convergence depends on the ability of individual governments to influence economic processes. The meta-study of post-accession Council decision-making, as well as case studies of some of the central distributional issues from the pre- and post-accession periods, and macroeconomic trends support the proposed LIG-based explanation.

<p>The year 2011 was marked by unprecedented activity, culminating in a ministerial-level conference organized by UNHCR, which proved to be a watershed for international efforts on statelessness. Fifty years after the adoption of the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, statelessness remains a significant problem in Europe and around the world. This article takes stock of statelessness [among] the countries which belong to the Council of Europe, by looking at the four key components of UNHCR's mandate: identification, prevention and reduction of statelessness and the protection of stateless persons. It looks at some of the key activities undertaken with regard to each of these areas in turn, and briefly analyzes where things stand following the anniversary of 1961 Convention.

<p>This article describes the role of legal advice and legal advisers in the policy-making process toward the 2003 invasion of Iraq, on the basis of the report of the Davids Committee in the Netherlands and the documents declassified in the course of the UK's Chilcot Inquiry. The controversial nature and seemingly weak legal basis for the 2003 invasion of Iraq prompted much public and academic discussion, even leading to the leaking of otherwise confidential legal memoranda from government lawyers to the media. Unprecedented and (semi)public inquiries were carried out into the policy-making processes and motives for resorting to the use of armed force, including the role of legal advice and legal advisers. This description and analysis reveal common and familiar themes regarding the role, responsibilities, and perceptions of legal advice in foreign policy.

<p>This article asks whether institutions and processes for regional environmental governance can be introduced or, where they already exist, be strengthened to be more effective along three key dimensions: managing environmental stressors, coordinating the adaptation and mitigation strategies required at various scales of social organization, and establishing better early warning, response and recovery systems. These dimensions are analyzed through an examination of the challenges facing the Hindu Kush-Himalaya region that affect all of the region of South Asia. In terms of both human and national security, regional environmental governance holds great promise, but effective governance institutions and processes (either hegemonic or democratic) would be extremely difficult to create.

<p>The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009 fundamentally changed the rules regarding the EU's external representation. In order to establish the Union as a cohesive force in international relations, the responsibility of representing the EU in international organizations shifted from the Presidency of the European Council, formerly a rotating position, to the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. The existing observer status of the EU in the General Assembly was upgraded by a General Assembly resolution in May 2011.

<p>This article argues that the EU has a potentially important and unique role to play as a security partner for Japan. This article tests this hypothesis in two potentially promising areas of security cooperation: post-conflict reconstruction operations and counter-piracy deployments off the coast of Somalia. The EU has great potential to help Japan expand its overseas security role precisely because the EU is not controversial or polarizing in Japan, unlike some aspects of the US alliance, especially those related to overseas SDF deployments. Cooperation with the EU can help Japan re-legitimize overseas deployments, disassociate these from the use of force, the controversial “normal nation” discourse in Japan, and expand them into more ambitious, but non-combat areas.

<p>Palestine's ability to become a member of international organizations such as the UN, the WHO or UNESCO has often been called into question because its quality as a state is still contested. However, regardless of whether Palestine is a state or not, it has an observer status at the UN and therefore benefits from special observer rights which are not granted to other observers within the UN. In 2011, UNESCO admitted Palestine as a member. While there is currently an on-going debate about Palestine's statehood both at the UN as well as in legal scholarship, it can be argued that the question of statehood is not as essential for Palestine's effective participation in international organizations as one may presume.

<p>This article [examines] the roles that NGOs play in international trade governance at the WTO via their international campaign activities. Utilizing examples of two NGO campaigns directed at the WTO (in the areas of intellectual property and multilateral investment rules), it demonstrates that NGOs play entrepreneurial roles in broadening the trade agenda by publicizing neglected trade-related issues, building coalitions and boosting the negotiating resources of developing member countries. By examining their attempts to articulate an expanded conception of the global public interest, the article concludes that NGOs should be viewed as important actors within global public policy networks, even when they are formally excluded from the decision-making tables of international organizations.

<p>The article examines the creation of an internal market in Europe and Southeast Asia from the perspective of constitutional economics.

It [examines] the analytical instruments of constitutional economics in order to evaluate the success of a regional agreement on the basis of the “quality” of its economic constitution. It then examines internal market creation in the EU and ASEAN. It is the commitment to the implementation of a social contract that determines the successful establishment of a single market.

<p>The Lisbon Treaty signaled that the EP had become a central actor in the EU-Japan economic and trade partnership. In 2007, the “Global Europe” strategy formalized the EU's process of expanding trade relationships via free trade agreements (FTAs). Should Japan and the EU move forward with their own bilateral economic agreement despite a number of pending economic and trade issues ranging from mutual recognition or harmonization in clinical trials to the expansion of foreign direct investment to regulatory transparency? There are two main stumbling blocks to an agreement: linkage of issues and non-tariff measures (NTMs), i.e. local rules and standards that hinder trade. Three case studies in aerospace, telecommunications and food safety show that linkage has not been successful and highlights specific NTMs. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.8040]</p>

<p>This chapter introduces the fundamental question addressed by the authors in this Agora: what does the 2003 Iraq intervention teach us about the relation between international law and politics? This chapter briefly discusses the relevance of the work by M. Koskenniemi to that question and it treats the different points of view put forward in the contributions. One possible position on the intervention in Iraq — that an intervention would be legal but illegitimate — could serve discussion about the political preferences which sometimes explain the choice of international legal arguments. A complex image emerges of the relation between international law and politics: beyond the relative indeterminacy of the law and beyond the collapse of the separation between international law and politics, an international rule of law re-emerges as a specific way of doing politics.

<p>The question whether external actors have a right of intervention within a sovereign state which is committing grave violations of human rights assumed particular significance in the case of the civil conflict that began in Libya in February 2011. Within the international response to the Libyan regime's attacks on its population, the Arab League, the UN and NATO favored the use of military force, whereas the African Union favored a political solution to the crisis. This article considers the question of African Union intervention within the framework of the concept of “responsibility to protect”. It argues that the reason why the African Union did not act militarily in Libya was that it lacks the will to confront incumbent leaders, something which undermines the organization's ability to provide effective solutions to African crises.

But China cannot afford to rest on its diplomatic laurels. Open to opportunities to protect its stakes in Asia, China is very likely contemplating, albeit cautiously, an expanded role for the SCO that will include membership for India, its archrival. To Beijing, expanding the SCO beyond Central Asia is a political statement, exploring and helping to define a constituency to which it can appeal for diplomatic support in a range of regional projects that restrict US participation.

<p>The article discusses the projection of EU power under conditions of contested statehood in its “near abroad”. Using the EU's mission in Kosovo (EULEX) as a case study, the article unpacks the various levers of external EU influence and explores the conditions under which European policy-makers become entangled in the “existential discourse” of highly polarized societies with competing statehood claims. The contestation of these claims (both domestically and internationally) produces significant challenges for EU actorness, affecting both self-ascribed (internal to the EU) and external (among the EU's interlocutors) aspects of EU presence, which, in turn, shapes the EU's ability to deploy and coordinate its capabilities on the ground. It is by reference to this “presence-capabilities” nexus that this article conceptualizes the limitations of the planning and early deployment of EULEX in Kosovo. [R]</p>

<p>Since EU membership negotiations began in 2005, Turkey has faced a range of obstacles, which have led to an impasse in the talks. As a consequence, domestic reforms have slowed, support in the country has dropped as Turks have become increasingly disillusioned with the process, and trust between the two partners has been eroded. Moreover, all this has happened at a time when Turkey has become increasingly self-confident and the EU is suffering from an economic and political malaise. With an economy much stronger than a number of EU member states, and with Ankara playing an increasingly important role on the global stage, many Turks believe that Turkey is better off staying outside the EU.

<p>The substantive equality provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) provide theoretical and normative tools to contend with the growing challenges of traditionalist cultural and religious patriarchy and neoliberal exploitation of women. This holds out promise but a large gap exists between normative policy and social practice. It remains to translate the formulation and commitment into political, economic, and social action, which will secure women's capacity to participate as equal actors in the public sphere, to have equal opportunity in the economy, and to live in a state of equal autonomy to that of men in the family. This is the meaning of democratic citizenship for women and it is a condition precedent for a viable democracy for men and women alike. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7134]</p>

<p>A formal model of treaty-making identifies nation-states as pivotal parties to transactions. A formal model of equality rejects distinctions treating women and men differently.

The sudden nature of the “Arab Spring” raises questions about the legitimacy and coherence of the EU's policy towards its southern neighbors. EU policies have in fact given a marginal place to the promotion of the democratic reform agenda, despite repeated calls from human rights organizations to promote that “essential element”?

<p>62.8028 SAATÇIOĞLU, Beken — <bold>The EU's “rhetorical entrapment” in enlargement reconsidered: why hasn't it worked for Turkey?</bold> <italic>Insight Turkey</italic> 14(3), Summer 2012: 159–176.</p>
<p>This article analyzes the EU's December 2004 Brussels decision regarding membership talks with Turkey. While the Brussels Council launched accession negotiations with Turkey, the adopted Framework for Negotiations formulated exceptionally stringent membership terms. This is a puzzle for normative institutionalism because prior to Brussels, Turkey had sufficiently complied with the EU's liberal democratic membership criteria and systematically engaged in “rhetorical action” to “entrap” the EU in its liberal, inclusionary enlargement discourse. It is argued that the puzzle is explained by how the EU member states' enlargement preferences played out in an intergovernmental bargaining context when it came to the inclusion of Turkey. [R]</p>

<p>This study argues that EU citizenship, [on] which the EU banks for a common identity, could not have fulfilled such a mission in the last twenty years. Free movement and settlement within the territory of the Union, possessing some electoral rights in the country of residence and petition and complain to some EU institutions are among the rights of the EU citizenship introduced by the Maastricht Treaty. This study, moving from the level of utilization of these rights, analyzes the EU citizenship's extent of functionality and of its acceptance practically by the EU community since its formal implementation. The low level of utilization for all these rights shows that the functionality and internalization of the Union citizenship is weak. [R]</p>

<p>Whether for its internal construction process or its relations with external environment, the EU always emphasizes that it gives priority to the democratic-liberal political and economic values and tries to disseminate the idealist discourse enhanced around these values. Within the foreign policy pillar of this emphasis, one of the most important test areas to show the degree of EU's success is the Union's policies towards the Central Asia. Moving from such a linkage, this study reveals the position and impact of idealist discourse within the context of EU's Central Asia policy. A new strategy since 2007 could not have generated any serious change in the region because of the insufficient instruments and of some other reasons resulting from the attitude of the EU and remains just a discourse.

<p>This article examines a vexing evidentiary question with which the ICJ has struggle in several cases, namely: what should the Court do when one of the parties has exclusive access to critical evidence and refuses to produce it for security or other reasons? In its first case, <italic>Corfu Channel</italic>, the Court decided to apply liberal inferences of fact against the non-producing party, but in the more recent <italic>Crime of Genocide</italic> case, the Court declined to do so [in] seemingly similar circumstances? By carefully examining the treatment of evidence exclusively accessible by one party in these and other international cases, this articles first illuminates the nuances in the Court's approach to circumstantial evidence and adverse inferences and, second, recommends a more coherent approach for the future.

<p>The euro crisis poses a fundamental challenge to the EU but also to the theories of European integration. Whereas intergovernmentalism provides the best explanation of the original design of EMU, it is losing explanatory power in the crisis. The intergovernmental logic of integration based on exogenous preferences and state bargaining power gives way to the neofunctionalist logic. Transnational interdependences, autonomous supranational organizations, endogenous preferences, path dependency, and spillover drive the process and have produced more integration in fiscal policy? As expected by post-functionalism, however, the crisis politicizes European integration and increases Euro-skeptic mobilization at the same time, thus putting into danger the further integration and cohesion of the Eurozone. So far, however, the neofunctionalist logic has prevailed. [R]</p>

<p>“Normative Power Europe”, a concept introduced by I. Manners in 2002 in order to describe the international identity of the EU, remains a lasting point of reference for academic as well as political debates. However, many contributions to this discussion tend to essentialize notions of a collective identity where normative self-depictions are uncritically used as an explanation for the EU's external actions. The main challenge, thus, is to reconstruct how a self is invented in the conduct of foreign and security policies as a discourse of locating others and articulating insecurities. The results of a reconstruction of EU discourse on the ESDP missions in the Democratic Republic of Congo [Kinshasa] lead to the preliminary conclusion that the EU might increasingly be imagined as a “civilizing power”, partly re-activating its imperial legacies of the 19th c.

<p>The Lisbon Treaty was supposed to mark the end of an almost-decade-long period of treaty reform. After the tumult of the failed Constitutional Treaty, the settlement it imposed struck a sustainable balance between the competing forces of centralization and the diffusion that characterize European integration. Yet this constitutional settlement is now threatened by the Eurozone debt crisis and official responses to it, most notably the proposed fiscal compact. A prevalent view regards the crisis as an opportunity to complete the process of political and economic union that the Maastricht Treaty began. However, this article cautions against such a view, which would jettison the post-Lisbon Treaty constitutional settlement in favor a peculiar kind of German-led, intergovernmental centralization.

<p>As global environmental governance evolves, the parties to the 1989 Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal and to the 2001 Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants have established regional centers working on capacity-building and technology-transfer. This article empirically explores the following questions: Why did the parties to the Basel and Stockholm Conventions establish these regional centers? What roles do the regional centers play in treaty implementation and multilevel governance? The article argues that the parties have set up regional centers in response to three partially overlapping sets of developing- and industrialized-country interests: expanding regional cooperation (both developing and industrialized countries); attracting more resources for treaty implementation (mainly developing countries); and supporting implementation projects across smaller groups of countries (mainly industrialized countries).

<p>This essay deals with the creation and the evolution of the European External Action Service (EEAS), by replacing them in the simplification process of European treaties, which led to the Lisbon Treaty and the apparition of three novelties reinforcing EU governance: the President of the European Council, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, helped with an important EEAS and the legal personality of the EU. The text [then] identifies potential strategies for Europe within the current political conjuncture and indicates main topics for analysts and European decision-makers within the framework of an incoming multipolar system.

<p>This article looks at the interdependences between the democratization processes in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh and the management of the Karabakh conflict, focusing on the EU's democracy promotion policies. The article argues that the EU's normative foreign policy in the South Caucasus has been limited by the permanence of the protracted conflicts, in two interrelated ways: (1) by not addressing the conflicts the EU focused on long-term goals but failed to provide short-term incentives towards peace; (2) by allowing only a limited involvement in the protracted conflicts, especially inside Karabakh, the EU was perceived as a reluctant partner, undermining its normative credentials.

<p>The EU's emphasis on external crisis-management was strategically sound given the geopolitical context of the 1990s. CSDP's quiet drift towards a “softer” kind of crisis-management from the mid-2000s was also instrumental in highlighting the EU's differences from post-11 September [2001] US unilateralism. That said, (soft) crisis-management has become progressively obsolete in the light of a rapidly changing geopolitical environment characterized by an overall retreat of Western power globally, a weakening of America's commitment to European security, an increasingly tumultuous European neighborhood, and Europe's financial troubles. In order to meet the demands of a changing geopolitical environment, CSDP must break away from its distinctively reactive approach to security to include all the functions normally associated with the military including, chiefly, deterrence and prevention.

<p>This introduction outlines the EU-Japan relationship and where it stands at present. At the last summit meeting the two sides decided to start parallel negotiations for (1) a deep and comprehensive free-trade agreement or economic partnership agreement; and (2) a binding agreement covering political, security and other areas of global cooperation. Here the factors that have led both the EU and Japan to abandon the former policy of defining the overall relationship with ten-year plans, such as the 1991 Hague Declaration and the 2001 Action Plan, are analyzed, [as are] the present negotiations and what is new and unique this time. These EU-Japan agreements are placed in a comparative global perspective relative to other major agreements. Finally, this introduction also introduces the other articles in this special issue.

<p>The EU's eastward enlargement cannot be explained by functionalism and liberal intergovernmentalism, the dominant rational choice theories about the developmental dynamics and governance of the EU as a novel polity. These theories fail to explain how a process, supposedly characterized from its early stages by states bargaining to maximize their benefits, ends up with actual enlargement (in 2004 and 2007). Indeed, the high uncertainty and complexity that surrounded the EU negotiations made it difficult for the governments to define their preferences and narrow down the uncertainty. Precisely because of this, agenda-setting and problem-framing played a substantial role in the pre-negotiation phase where the use of competing frames influenced the negotiation outcome. Therefore, we explore social constructivist alternative theoretical approaches: does a theory based on identity-formation, narrativity and problem-structuring fare any better?

<p>The scholarship has argued that ASEAN security-management, outweighing democracy and economic interdependence, is the main force constituting Southeast Asian peace. However, although neither democracy nor economic interdependence significantly contributes to peacefulness in Southeast Asia, this study posits and finds that prior literature overlooks the possible conflict-constraining effect of a ruling group's desire and resolve to pursue economic development with liberal capitalist economic policy, which causes that the pacifying effect of ASEAN security management to be exaggerated. This study distinguishes the conflict-constraining effect of liberal capitalist economic development policy from the outcome effects of economic interdependence and the ASEAN security management and argues that the common interests and preferences of adopting economic liberalization policy for economic development exert a more significant effect in preventing conflicts in Southeast Asia.

<p>This article explores the organizational development of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization and its contributions to the globalization of the Black Sea region as well as the regional cooperation among its members since its establishment in 1992. It also evaluates the performance of this regional organization in terms of its strengths and weaknesses. Given the difficulty of promoting regional cooperation in a region divided by the Cold War heritage and mentality, the Organization has been relatively successful not only in bringing the regional countries together, but also in embracing the benefits of globalization. This organization has played a crucial role in stabilizing the relatively unstable parts of wider Europe: the Balkans and the Caucasus. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Although the determinants of territorial mobilization at the level of the EU have been examined since the 1990s, the analysis of the interaction between regional and state interest representation has been rather neglected. This article focuses on a single policy area — environmental affairs — in order to evaluate the impact of policy-specific preference intensity (salience) on state-region relationships in Brussels. Using original survey data, I demonstrate that greater salience tends to increase cooperative interest representation and to decrease state-bypassing interest representation. This finding shows how important salience configurations are in the strategic interactions between state and non-state players in the EU arena. [R]</p>

<p>Many theorists contend that for the EU to become a viable democratic polity its citizens must develop an overarching communal identity. I take issue with this claim, arguing that the norms, motivations and perceptions that make supranational democracy possible can also emerge through processes that do not presuppose shared communal identifications. These include the gradual externalization of domestic democratic norms and practices to the EU level, the incorporation of the resulting supranational democratic attachments back into existing national identifications and the build-up of transnational political trust propelled by the practice of supranational democracy itself. Such an outcome is not inevitable, but it is conceivable in that it is theoretically coherent and has limited empirical analogies and precedents. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The domain of cyber warfare being relatively new, it is not yet matched by any comparatively novel international legal paradigm; the cyber conflicts of the present and (probably) the future therefore fall to be regulated under the existing <italic>lex lata</italic>. This article, assuming a scenario of international armed conflict, seeks as a specific example to apply the notion of direct participation in hostilities from Additional Protocol I (1977) to cyber war. This aspect of the topic is likely to assume particular importance in light of the contemporary tendency in many developed, Western armed forces to outsource technical specialist work (like information technology) to civilians.

<p>Can a conditional commitment by a major actor (for example, the EU) induce other major actors (such as the US, China, India, or Japan) to do more to mitigate global climate change? We analyze this question by first estimating the impact of emission-reductions by one of these actors on the mitigation costs of the others and, second, by exploring how domestic politics influence the willingness of the EU and the US to contribute. We find that an emission cut by any actor will reduce mitigation costs for all the others and thereby expand the settlement range. These cost reductions seem, however, insufficient to induce significant unilateral policy change. Emissions trading can cut aggregate costs further, but also redistribute wealth. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The principle of <italic>non-refoulement</italic> is the cornerstone of the international refugee law. Several international law instruments, including the 1951 Refugee Convention, contain the principle. In the literature of international law, there are some controversies on the status of the principle. Some writers defend the idea that the principle is a rule of international customary law while others reject this idea. Besides authors claiming the international customary law status of the principle with exclusions, there are claims about the <italic>jus cogens</italic> nature of the principle. The article defends the international customary law status of the principle, but concludes that the meaning of the rule should not go beyond the 1951 Refugee Convention. [R]</p>

<p>The establishment of European Regulatory Networks (ERNs) has been presented as a way to promote the uniform implementation of EU law in a range of issue areas. This article argues that the level of co-ordination achieved in ERNs crucially depends on the level of interdependence between Member State authorities in a given issue area. Drawing on a survey among national representatives in two ERNs and a set of in-depth interviews, it shows that both the uniformity of implementation and the use of common purpose as a way to reach co-ordination are strongly associated with the perceived level of interdependence.

<p>The European Convention on Nationality opens with an articulation of the general principles upon which the instrument rests, summarized: (1) states are free to determine who are their nationals, within the limits set by international law; (2) statelessness shall be avoided; and (3) rules relating to nationality may not be discriminatory. Here, the second and third statements give content to the first. Thus, the most significant limits imposed by international law with regard to the regulation of nationality are standards relating to the avoidance of statelessness and to the principle of non-discrimination. This article explores the development of these two sets of standards in the European context through an analysis of the further provisions of the European Convention on Nationality as well as an investigation of emerging regional jurisprudence.

<p>Theories of IR take various positions regarding the role of international law in international politics. This article identifies four different perspectives on that role by distinguishing, first, between approaches that assume that states act on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis and approaches that assume that states act upon shared ideas; second, between theories that assume that sovereign states are the only relevant players in international politics and theories that allow for the possibility that domestic and transnational players may affect international politics as well. Subsequently, the article investigates the choices made by France, Italy, the Netherlands, the UK and the US prior to the 2003 war against Iraq. The four perspectives on the role of international law provide different interpretations of the weight these states attached to international law when considering the use of violence against Iraq.

<p>Drastic differences in the distribution of the world income have caused intensification of old problems such as illegal immigration, smuggling weapons, drugs, organized crime and terrorism as well as the emergence of new challenges related to the rapid development of the so-called “falling or failed states” in some parts of the world. Are EU's aid and activities effective with respect to the future of those countries or is it only an ad hoc attempt trying to control the situation? A definition of the phenomenon of the “falling or failed states”, illustrated by the case of Somalia as a collapsed state, the history of modern piracy in the Somali region and the ATALANTA operation, help answer this question.</p>

<p>The Lisbon Treaty [2007] is rather ambiguous regarding its overall effect on the democratic control by the member states and their citizens. Thus, we re-emphasize the importance of the introduction of optional referenda and (real) citizens' initiatives on the level of the EU based, however, on an approach which usually is not applied to the market for politics, i.e., the so-called contestable-markets hypothesis. We argue that the introduction of optional referenda changes the interaction of policy-makers without that referenda may in fact be used. In addition, the necessary adjustments could easily be implemented as an amendment to the Lisbon Treaty which would allow people in the member states to safeguard their national sovereignty in critical areas.

<p>This article follows the recent trend of bringing the OAS back into the debate on regional security, previously dominated by the accomplishments of European institutions and the shortcomings of their Asian and African counterparts. The study of the OAS is advanced here through application of an analytical framework derived from institutionalist theory. A security organization may change its form during its lifetime and pursue different kinds of tasks. The oldest regional security institution, the OAS was designed for collective security. This yielded to collective defense during the Cold War, and to cooperative security in the 1990s. After 11 September [2001], it returned to collective defense, but the contradictory reassertion of US leadership and the emergence of South American regional power made hemispheric cooperation more difficult again.

<p>Communication links are a key dimension for implementation of EU policies in non-member states because EU influence abroad is otherwise severely hindered. Exploring project implementation of external migration policy in Morocco and Ukraine highlights the role of the UN High Commission for Refugees and particularly the International Organization for Migration for bridging and exploiting communication gaps between administrations in Brussels and “the field”. Linking the Europeanization literature with insights on implementation, organizational sociology and social networks raises attention to the “grapevine” of interorganizational communication structures that mediates EU influence and reveals manifold actor influence in Europeanization processes and on policy output beyond EU control.

<p>62.8059 AALBERTS, Tanja E. — <bold>Forging international order: inquiring the Dutch support of the Iraq invasion</bold>. <italic>Netherlands Yearbook of International Law</italic> 2011: 139–175.</p>
<p>This article analyzes the Iraq inquiry in The Netherlands as presented by the Davids Committee (2010). It discusses the so-called corpus theory that informed the Dutch position that the invasion in Iraq was in accordance with international law, and its deconstruction by the Davids Committee. However, the corpus theory was only part of the story. The theory interacted with two other claims for legitimacy put forward by the Dutch government. These alternative strands of legitimacy moved beyond positive law to include extra-Charter values on the one hand, and to circumvent the politics within the Security Council, on the other. The analysis discloses how any legal argumentation and bids for legitimacy are based on a particular vision of the international society and how to safeguard law, peace, and freedom in the contemporary international order.

<p>62.8060 AHMAR, Moonis — <bold>What went wrong with Obama's Af-Pak policy?</bold> <italic>Regional Studies</italic> 30(3), Summer 2012: 47–67.</p>
<p>Ever since US President B Obama unveiled his “Af-Pak policy” on 27 March 2009 much has changed in the realm of the US-led war on terror in Afghanistan and Pakistan. More than three years after the proclamation of Af-Pak policy which outlined a proactive approach to deal with the threat of AI-Qaeda and other terrorist outfits perceived to be located in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the situation on the ground remains volatile. The massive terrorist attacks in Kabul and other parts of the country on 15 April this year proves the failure of the US-backed Karzai regime to stabilize the situation before the deadline of US military withdrawal from Afghanistan.

<p>62.8061 AHMED, Ali — <bold>Political decision-making and [Indian] nuclear retaliation</bold>. <italic>Strategic Analysis</italic> 36(4), July-Aug. 2012: 511–526.</p>
<p>Currently, India's nuclear doctrine is one of inflicting “unacceptable damage” in case of nuclear first use against it or its forces anywhere. The problem with this is that at current levels of vertical proliferation it is liable to face a counter-strike of equal proportions. This may not be in India's interests when viewed in relation to the inevitable setback to its trajectory of progress. Therefore, there is a case for terminating nuclear exchanges at the lowest possible level in case of nuclear first use of low opprobrium quotient or violence. This article recommends a shift to flexible nuclear retaliation with “deterrence by denial” informing lower-order first use and “deterrence by punishment” continuing for higher-order attacks.

<p>The transatlantic tensions of the G.W. Bush years are behind us but the future of transatlantic relations remains uncertain at the closing of the B. Obama term. Policy alignment has been found on a host of issues but “existential” questions have resurfaced, casting shadows on Western unity and relevance in the coming years. So far the crisis has failed to focus attention on the need for a common vision for the 21st c. Key strategic issues, from the future of the European order to transatlantic engagement in the Middle East, should figure prominently on the next transatlantic agenda, shifting the debate from the notion of a “Pacific century” to how the West can address ongoing power transitions.

<p>While conventional wisdom holds that reintegrating ex-combatants into society is a post-conflict activity, ISAF's commander sees removing fighters from the battlefield through reintegration and the resolution of local grievances as a means of “decomposing” the insurgency in Afghanistan. He argues that the combination of the Afghan-led Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Program with ISAF and Afghan military pressure, as well as divisions within the Taliban over peace talks, provides the ingredients for accelerating reintegration in Afghanistan.

<p>The security architecture which the US helped establish in the Eastern Mediterranean is finally crumbling.

<p>62.8066 ANDORNINO, Giovanni — <bold>The political economy of Italy's relations with China</bold>. <italic>International Spectator</italic> 47(2), June 2012: 87–101.</p>
<p>Sino-Italian bilateral relations are eminently economic in their focus, with trade and investments working as the main drivers of engagement. Two distinctive features have marked the economic interaction in recent years: a pattern of asymmetrical competition, and an asynchrony of opportunities in bilateral trade and investment flows. Between 2009 and 2011, however, Sino-Italian relations underwent important changes. Against the background of the global financial crisis, China might become a key source of foreign investments for Italy. In addition, China's efforts to promote domestic demand under the Twelfth Five-Year Plan might create unprecedented opportunities for Italian exports. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.8340]</p>
<p>62.8067 ATLI, Altay — <bold>China and the global financial crisis</bold>. <italic>USAK Yearbook of Politics and International Relations</italic> 2012: 175–194.</p>
<p>This paper examines the effects of the global financial crisis of 2008–09 from a Chinese standpoint. Through a mixture of monetary and fiscal measures supported by a stimulus program, China has weathered its adverse effects relatively well. However, before the crisis, China's economy was already nearing crossroads: its growth model based on export-oriented low-cost manufacturing and investment in heavy industry and infrastructure was giving signs of exhaustion. This paper utilizes macroeconomic analysis to elucidate the vulnerabilities of the Chinese growth model and outline China's crisis-response measures, which provided a remedy in the short term, and also, and more importantly, opened an opportunity window to address its structural shortcomings in the long term and to embark on a new and sustainable path of economic growth, which requires greater emphasis on domestic consumption.

<p>This article examines the recent evolution of the idea of a North American security perimeter, and its implications for Canadian foreign economic policy in an era characterized by a shifting global distribution of power. The current global order is characterized by a rapidly shifting distribution of power away from the US and toward not only other states (the BRICs) but also other actors — including networks, multinational corporations, and NGOs. Drawing upon the “new regionalisms” school, we argue that Canada's instinctive approach to the “North American game” — emphasizing the historic Canada-US special bilateral relationship is an insufficient and excessively narrow approach for adapting to the global and regional challenges provoked by the rapid onset of nonpolarity.

<p>Why does Lithuania support Turkey's accession to the EU? The article analyzes some of the key domestic factors and the strategic thinking behind Lithuania's continuous support. Domestically, the political culture of the foreign policy elite and the permissiveness of public opinion allow treating Turkey's accession as a foreign policy issue, subject to cost-benefit calculations. Short-term calculations involve mutually advantageous deals between Turkey and Lithuania. Long-term assessments focus on how Turkey's membership would affect global, regional, and intra-European dynamics of power relations. The article suggests that, in the context of lasting foreign policy objectives and concerns, Turkey is attractive to Lithuania primarily due to its geopolitical roles. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Although the “special relationship” between US and British officials is a fixture of the international scene, recent events have raised concerns about the nature and strength of the partnership. This article explores the issues that animate the dialogue between Washington and London and describes insights gathered from a recent Anglo-American forum held in the UK. Both countries have shared interests in Afghanistan, Libya, and in the nuclear and intelligence fields more generally. Nevertheless, a changing geopolitical setting, especially increasing US preoccupation with China and the declining British defense budget, suggests that sustaining the special relationship will become more difficult.

<p>In Europe, a lively scientific debate has emerged about the role of norms in the European foreign policy. One aspect is norms related to human rights, labor rights and environmental standards in European trade policy. The normative dimension of EU's trade policy is analyzed in comparison with the US by using the concept of normative power. By classifying the trade approaches of the EU and the US, we question the hypothesis of Europe's normative power and ask whether the EU is a unique normative actor in world politics. [Then], normative power is defined in demarcation to concepts of great power, empire and hegemon. [Last], this theoretical differentiation is used for the empirical classification of the European and American trade approaches. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>A permanent seat on the UN Security Council is a long-term goal of Brazil's foreign policy. Political engagement in the international arena and a demonstrable contribution to international peace and security are part of the requirements Brazil needs to fulfill if this goal is to be attained. The South American power's increasing engagement in the Middle East in the post-Cold War era is to be understood as part of the Brazilian bid to strengthen its credentials as a global player.

<p>The author considers the discrepancy between ambition and cost-tolerance that has led the US to use force too often but also too indecisively since the Cold War. He argues that Washington should use American primacy not to attempt dominance on the cheap but to manage a transition to a global balance of power. [R]</p>
<p>62.8074 BETZ, Joachim — <bold>India and the redistribution of power and resources</bold>. <italic>Global Society</italic> 26(3), July 2012: 387–405.</p>
<p>India's spectacular growth and its increasing integration into the world economy should have influenced the country's foreign policy goals away from the isolationist stance of former times. The government should also have become more interested in the distributional effects of global integration, become more assertive in demanding influence within global governance institutions and more sensitive to the demands of domestic interest groups affected by the actions of other countries. [Although] this is the case, the government is still insulated to a certain but declining degree against the influence of specific interest groups on foreign policy strategies, however. Redistribution at the domestic, regional and international levels is a concern of the political elite, but activities at the domestic level target those important as voter groups more than those affected by globalization.

<p>The 2005 US-India nuclear pact created ripples of controversy and debates within in a short period of time. In the US, the nuclear agreement was weighed vis-à-vis the non-proliferation regime — does it strengthen or weaken the regime? On the contrary, in India concerns were raised regarding the implications for India's strategic as well as civilian nuclear programs. This article highlights the disjuncture in the concerns raised in the US and India. Using D. Mutimer's constructivist analysis, it argues that this divergence is due to their contrasting perspectives on nuclear technology as regards “proliferation” and “disarmament-development”. [R]</p>

<p>Besides systemic changes that lead to the re-prioritization of foreign policy objectives, foreign policy change is also a result of domestic policy entrepreneurs' pursuit of a political return. Their potential to orchestrate change depends on the existing entry barriers that emanate from the political and institutional features of the domestic policy-making process. It is accentuated by system-wide developments and security crises that illustrate old policy failure. This article discusses the role of policy entrepreneurs in foreign policy change by reference to the Greek-Turkish rapprochement in the late 1990s that resulted in Turkey receiving the status of EU candidate country in 1999.

<p>62.8077 BROWN, Kerry — <bold>Chinese overseas investment in the European Union</bold>. <italic>International Spectator</italic> 47(2), June 2012: 74–86.</p>
<p>Chinese overseas investment is a new, and growing phenomenon, [with] exponential increases in how much direct investment is flowing from China, particularly into the resource sector. As the Eurozone crisis has deepened since 2008, there has been continuing talk by political and business leaders of investment in Europe being a key target for Chinese companies. And yet, the amounts invested so far come to less than 5 percent of China's global overseas FDI total. In the crucial determinants of Chinese FDI, the EU ranks low. There is therefore a good structural reason why, despite the ambitious talk of the Chinese coming to invest more in vital sectors in the EU, this is not happening at the moment and is not likely to happen until China develops into a middle income, more developed economy.

<p>In 1999, Germany participated in NATO's air campaign “Operation Allied Force” against Yugoslavia. It was the country's first offensive combat mission. Most of the theoretically informed literature discusses the decision from a structural perspective. In contrast, the personalities and idiosyncrasies of the individual decision-makers [who] took the decision have received little attention. This article applies one cognitive and one psychological agency-based approach of foreign policy decision-making to the case: analogical reasoning and prospect theory. The discussion suggests that particularly prospect theory has strong explanatory leverage to account for Germany's decision to go to war. On a more general level, the article lends support to the claim that not only structure but also agency matters in foreign policy decision-making. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article contributes both to the scholarly debate on Japan's territorial dispute with USSR/Russia and to the broader body of academic literature devoted to the ideational factor in foreign policy. By focusing on the formative years of the dispute and examining the variety of symbolic meanings attached to the Soviet-occupied islands by the domestic actors, this article examines the process of the emergence of the idea of the “Northern Territories” as a national mission. It argues that the formation and institutionalization of the idea of the “Northern Territories” in its present form can be traced to a complex web of power relations among the domestic actors, none of which perceived the return of the territory as its ultimate goal.

<p>The Korean War erupted on 25 June 1950 and has not yet formally ended. The Armistice Treaty signed by combatant parties contained provisions regarding cessation of military operations, liberation and repartition of prisoners of war and people displaced. The Military Armistice Commission, Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission were created to monitor any violations of the agreement and to ensure execution of its provisions. Still, warships continue. A realistic analysis of the situation demonstrates that the sides of a future peace treaty replacing the Armistice Agreement should be the two Korean states, the US and China. Since Russia and Japan were not combatant nations, their participation in the negotiations and the signing of the treaty should almost certainly be ruled out.</p>

<p>Brazil has consistently been seeking a more influential place at global decision-making tables in order to preserve its sovereignty and protect its national policy autonomy. The challenge for Brazilian diplomats is that their country lacks the economic or military muscle to force a way onto these tables. Subtler avenues for inclusion are thus needed. Seven of the main tactics employed in Brazilian foreign policy are outlined here, and range from the defensive/passive (avoiding mindless opposition, collectivization) through the neutral (consensus-creation, technocratic speak) to the assertive (building new organizations, propagating new thinking) and finally to the aggressive (principled presidential righteousness).

<p>Although New Zealand is a small state in the South Pacific, it has a great interest in the stability of Southeast Asia, the safety of sea lanes which pass through it and the centrality of ASEAN in the regional security architecture. However, New Zealand has limited hard-power capabilities: the country's military expenditure is extremely modest and its population and GDP are dwarfed by ASEAN as a region and by some Southeast Asian countries. What New Zealand potentially offers Southeast Asia, however, is its soft power. This article identifies five of New Zealand's soft-power assets — students, soldiers, sports, sheep and the silver-screen — and critically examines whether these constitute sufficient resources for New Zealand to engage with Southeast Asia adequately, and make a contribution to regional stability.

<p>The foreign policies of Central European countries cannot be summarized simply through a systematic Atlanticism, a fact that could be explained by the fear of a threat coming from Russia. The countries' diverse policies have grown out of national differences and evolve in response to domestic political contexts and the international situation.

<p>This essay examines how China's “harmonious world” foreign policy has unintentionally created opportunities for citizens to challenge elite discussions of foreign policy.

<p>The lack of democratization in Armenia and Azerbaijan is by many observers argued to constitute a key obstacle to the Nagorno-Karabakh peace process, but other observers contend that the problem is that the respective leaderships are not sufficiently secure to agree to a difficult compromise. This article, however, finds that the relationship between regime types and conflicts is a lot more complex than often argued in the literature, and that the Karabakh peace process has been undermined by the worst of two worlds: intense elite competition, but without the restraint and widened participation that democratization could provide.

<p>Pre-publicity for the final volume of H. Macmillan's memoirs, <italic>At the End of the Day</italic> [London, 1973], stressed that it would provide the British side of the Cuban missile crisis for the first time. The Churchillian model chosen, changes required by the Cabinet Office and Macmillan's desire to rebuke opponents who claimed that the crisis demonstrated a lack of British influence in Washington, however, ensured a focus on his personal relationship with President J. Kennedy. Contemporary observations from his diaries also skewed Macmillan's account and underplayed the significance of British moves at the UN in New York to secure a credible UN inspection regime and a US guarantee of the inviolability of Cuba. Careful reconstruction of Macmillan's real-time experience of the Cuban missile crisis demonstrates the limitations of his own account of this event.

<p>A closer look at the history of the question of Western Sahara's autonomy allows for the evaluation of the various participants' involvement (US, France, Morocco, the EU and Russia) and Spain's position in particular. Western Sahara remains a conflict territory, divided between Morocco and the Polisario Front, which represents local people's interests and fights for its independence. While Morocco strictly follows a plan for Western Sahara's “Morocconization”, Spain does not merely fulfill its obligations for conflict prevention and regulation, but is also guided by the national security interests. These interests concern the Mediterranean and the Maghreb complex, which in many respects determines the geographic limits of Spain's peacemaking.</p>

<p>Information Warfare (IW), especially in the digital ether of cyberspace, has become a realm that defies borders, challenges state boundaries, and most significantly, provides the military of a nation to realize certain political goals, allowing for a more precise form of propaganda. With the world heavily slipping into, and relying upon, the age of information, a future conflict within Asia, more specifically East Asia, could witness tactics of cyber war becoming a key component and feature. Potential future conflicts of the 21st c. will not simply be restricted to the traditional military sphere, and growing reliance on cyberspace has made issues pertaining to national security even more susceptible.

<p>This introductory article presents the history of Francophone spaces to critically assess their specificity, and to situate them in academic debates on peace operations. It argues that the specificity is the inescapable <italic>a priori</italic> context of peace missions, even if this context is rapidly evolving and in interaction with non-francophone spaces. The specificity is nevertheless increasingly difficult to identify, as new practices and conditions emerge and as the lines between different francophone spaces and between francophone and non-francophone spaces are increasingly fluid. The article explores the range of possibilities that emerge from such interrogations, and emphasizes that to add the experiences of “francophone spaces” to analyses of peace operations is to confront the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion already expressed by the terms “francophone” and <italic>francophonie</italic>.

<p>This article explores the Arctic policies of three littoral states of the Arctic Ocean (Russia, the US and Canada), with special attention to that of the Russian Federation to confirm its status as the Arctic regional power. The fact that Russia — not the US — is the hegemon suggests particular courses of action. Using structural theory as the lens, Canada has two choices: it can either bandwagon with the US against a (supposedly) aggressive Russia or balance with a group of periphery states against Russia. Neither is the preferred choice. Rather, a Canadian Arctic policy grounded in liberal realism would continue to ensure that Canada had the capabilities to monitor the Arctic, while recognizing that Russia will try to dominate Arctic discussions.

<p>This article reviews the Sino-Israel relationship from the Chinese perspective. It argues that the relationship is at a crossroad because China is increasingly more proactively involved in the international arena, which will inevitably lead to China's more assertive role in trying to facilitate solving the Israel-Palestinian conflicts. China has been inclined to be more supportive to the Palestinian side based on Chinese cultural values, traditionally stronger ties with Arab countries, and also since Palestine is generally considered as the weaker side of the conflict. A strong Israel-US relationship will help balance Israel's relationship with China. China is more concerned with its relationship with the US, the only other world economy comparable in size to China's, in order to protect the peaceful world order for further development.

<p>Will China's development of a new generation of nuclear weapons impact US-China security relations in important ways? One's answer depends on how one views the following: whether or not Chinese leaders believe that they are only now acquiring a secure second strike capability; the scope of coercive power that secure second strike capability provides to conventionally inferior actors; the meaning of China's “No First Use” Doctrine; and the prospects for escalation control in future crises. Applying Cold War theories and tapping Chinese doctrinal writings this article concludes that China's nuclear modernization program might prove more consequential than is commonly believed. [R]</p>

<p>Although realist perspectives seem challenged to explain European choices and preferences, realism retains great utility with its stress on states and states' concern for their national interests. Traditional realist analysis of European security policy err, rather, by focusing on balancing and related concepts such as soft balancing and balancing for autonomy. These accounts are theoretically and empirically flawed. While balancing perspectives shed some light on European security policy predispositions, bandwagoning better explains trans-Atlantic contemporary security cooperation and increases the explanatory power of realist theories. The case for European bandwagoning is illustrated here by the empirical experience of prominent EU military initiatives and the French defense reforms in the post-Cold War period. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Through the application of an identity-based constructivist theoretical framework, this article argues that a gradual embrace of Persian conceptions of state identity by Iranian political elites and wider society has taken place over the last decade. The embrace of “Persian identity” has deeply affected how Iran externally “portrays itself” and pursues its foreign policy interests. This has become increasingly apparent in the context of its trilateral relations with Tajikistan and Afghanistan during the Ahmadinejad presidency (2005-present). Increasingly Iran in this context has shifted its identity, interests and actions from that of an Islamic revolutionary “Other”, to a so-called Persian “Brother” and a friendly, pragmatic and constructive political partner.

<p>62.8097 CONNOR, Wing Commander R. A. — <bold>Does UK development aid in Afghanistan contribute to stability in a positive way or does it facilitate corruption?</bold> <italic>Defence Studies</italic> 12(2), June 2012: 179–217.</p>
<p>Since 2001, Afghanistan has received over $50 billion in development aid, yet there is scant evidence to suggest that it has been effective in delivering stabilization or security objectives, and the perceptions of aid are overwhelmingly negative. The unprecedentedly large influx of development aid is also one of the recognized sources of corruption in Afghanistan which itself undercuts Afghan institutions and has seriously damaged the credibility of the Afghan government with its own people. This paper draws on academic and government literature and asserts that while development aid is contributing positively to stability at the tactical level, the unintended consequences of the large flows of financial aid into Afghanistan are undermining its strategic potential to connect the Afghan people to their government.

<p>This article explains how flawed intelligence assessments of Iraq's aluminum tubes became “Exhibit A” in the G.W. Bush administration's case for the Iraq War. In early 2001, the neoconservatives wanted intelligence that would help them argue for regime-change. A WINPAC “Red Team” analyst concluded the tubes were for a nuclear program thus countering assessments that they had a non-nuclear purpose. After the attacks of 11 September [2001] and President Bush's embrace of regime-change, the Red Team tubes assessment became the official position of the Intelligence Community. In September 2002, the President cited the assessment publicly, forcing the Intelligence Community to adopt it as the majority position in the Iraq NIE. “Exhibit A” in the case for war was thus the product of a Red Team and, as such, was essentially propaganda masquerading as intelligence.

<p>Officially adopted by the 17th Communist Party Congress in 2007, China's soft power strategy both intensely promotes the country (both culturally and diplomatically) and asserts its power.

The different Chinese interpretations of soft power are analyzed, as well as the related strategies and their implications for the nation's position internationally. [R]</p>

<p>S. Sagan's analysis of the Cuban missile crisis in <italic>The Limits of Safety</italic> [Princeton, 1993] shows how accidents almost triggered a nuclear exchange during that conflict and how they are likely to cause an actual nuclear war at some point in the future. This article examines how Sagan's crucially important study affects our understanding of the salience of deterrence and non-proliferation in the post-Cold War order and the prospects of nuclear peace. The conclusion contends that Sagan's advocacy of nuclear arsenal modernization and active non-proliferation efforts aimed at aspiring nuclear powers may well increase, rather than diminish, the chances of major nuclear war.

<p>This article examines the effect of the Transnistrian area on Moldova-Russia relations. D. Lake's concept of hierarchy will be used as the theoretical framework. The article examines why Russia's mechanisms of influence should be seen as a reflection of a hierarchical relationship between Russia and Moldova. It explains why this work has chosen a hierarchical framework and briefly introduces Transnistria. This is followed by two sections of analysis: security and economy, [with] subsections on events that highlight the hierarchical nature of the Moldova-Russia relationship. This article shows that Russia clearly has a hierarchical relationship with Moldova. Lake's theory proves to be a useful tool in understanding Moldovan-Russian relations. [R]</p>

<p>Since 1976, the militaries of the US and South Korea have been holding routine joint military exercises (JMEs) for the purposes of military training and deterrence against North Korea. These exercises are frequently cited as a cause of tension on the peninsula, causing North Korea to escalate its conflictual rhetoric and behavior. I empirically assess this claim using new data on US-ROK JMEs and machine-coded event-data collected by the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System. The findings show that North Korea does not systematically escalate its conflictual rhetoric or behavior during or near the occurrence of JMEs. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article develops the message that the artificially introduced administrative borders during the Soviet era, which were subject to the processes of re-delimitation after 1991, whether for reasons of security, administration, mutual distrust or the population's ethnic attachment, have become results and means of political manipulation and pressurization. This has resulted in further pushing regional states to follow mutually exclusive policies. Although for most of these states, border delimitation is not an objective but a declared way of achieving their security, the process of delimitation detailed below casts doubts on whether border delimitation, even if successful, would actually mean increased security for the region under the prevailing conditions of unilateralism and mutual distrust.

<p>Although it is tempting to view Russian policies through a revived Cold War paradigm, this is a problematic and ultimately misguided approach. Such an approach ignores the significant sources of discontinuity and rupture between the Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia. The essay presents an alternative framework for understanding and conceptualizing Russia's engagement with the Middle East. There are domestic drivers for Russian engagement which is linked to the perceived need to counter the threat of secessionism in the North Caucasus and the potential broader radicalization of Russia's Muslim population. There are [also] strictly economic interests in the Middle East. And there are geopolitical considerations which incorporate Russian ambitions to promote its credentials as a responsible great power supporting international norms.

<p>This paper highlights how conflicts are shaking the security of states on various fronts. And how conflicting states are developing war machineries in the name of security and ignoring the core issues of security like health security, economic security, food security, etc. I study the “Kashmir conflict” and its shadows on the security of conflicting states (India and Pakistan). The “Kashmir conflict” as a case study is analyzed in domestic and international contexts. This paper excludes a “blame game” to prove who is right and who is wrong. However, it argues that unresolved conflict, war and violence is wrong and has adverse impacts on the security of these states. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>While Western observers have used the concept of the China Model to describe China's development strategies and the potential threat they pose to Western liberal traditions, Chinese policy-makers have promoted South–South cooperation to emphasize China's goal of a harmonious world order based on nation-state sovereignty and mutual benefits. This article explores these two competing organizing principles with a focus on how each concept frames global development politics and China's relations with its development partners. Drawing on ethnographic research on China's new relationship with Costa Rica, I examine the assumptions and effects of these concepts in terms of how they shape specific development encounters. These examples suggest the intransigence of historical development inequalities and identities, which both support and limit China's global impact in significant ways. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article assesses former Russian President D. Medvedev's proposal for a new security system and varying perspectives in the context of this development. US-led unipolarity has been undermined as a gradually more independent “Europe” has weakened transatlantic unity and that of a broader “West”. Russia could neither join the NATO or the EU, nor assume directorship for security in the former Soviet Union. It has nonetheless increased its ties and influence with the EU, becoming a major trade partner and the biggest supplier of energy resources. A discourse of multipolarity accompanies Russian geopolitical ambitions and incorporates demands for new arrangements that can facilitate reliable cooperation in the security field and beyond. Medvedev's proposal is viewed differently by political-security sectors in the US, Germany, France, Poland, Russia and the EU. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Does President B. Obama's foreign policy rest upon a “grand strategy” or a “doctrine”? That question is examined here in the light of a critical discourse-analysis applied to the current US foreign policy debates, especially [among] university researchers and think tank-affiliated experts. There are at least three possible responses varying according to the definitions applied to the concepts of “grand strategy” and “doctrine”: the hegemonic, the internationalist and the neo-isolationist. Following the internationalist approach, we then demonstrate the existence of a new grand strategy of “comprehensive engagement”. This strategy seems to be based on three fundamental ideas that underpin Obama's foreign policy: the idea of US “multipartner” leadership, the concept of “smart power” and the “necessary force” doctrine related to the notion of “just war”.

<p>China's trade patterns with African countries have made Beijing the focal point of new anti-Chinese resistance narratives in Africa. China's trade policies now aim to access markets as part of China's larger domestic development strategy. China's state-run firms can channel China-Africa trade through extra-market decisions that influence flows, yet, ultimately, Beijing's ability to direct trade with Africa is constrained by market forces. Despite suggestions that shared illiberalism drives China-Africa trade, the author concludes that five interrelated causal factors overwhelmingly determine China-Africa trade: China's comparative advantage in labor-intensive and capital-intensive production; Africa's abundant natural resource endowments; China's rapid economic growth; China's emphasis on infrastructure building at home and in Africa; and the emergence of economies of scale in China's shipping and light manufacturing sectors.

<p>Turkey's improving relations with the non-Western world in general and Middle Eastern countries in particular have created question marks in the minds of many both at home and abroad and led some to the conclusion that Turkey, under the governance of ex-Islamists, is moving away from the West. However, little systematic empirical evidence is offered in support of an “axis shift” during the AKP era. We investigate the “Turkey-turns-away-from-West” claim by studying changes in Turkish foreign trade between 2002 and 2010. We fail to find a particular pro-Muslim or anti-Western trend in Turkish foreign trade in the AKP era. Thus, our findings lend support to the argument that the AKP's foreign policy is guided more by a sensible economic rationale than by ideological zeal. [R]</p>

<p>In the US, advocates of academic freedom — the ability to pursue research unencumbered by government controls — have long found sparring partners in government officials who regulate technology trade. The academic community and the government have each sought opportunities to demarcate the sphere of their respective authority and autonomy and assert themselves in that sphere. We explore these opportunities, showing how the Social Contract for Science set the terms for the debate, and how the controversy turned to the proper interpretation of this compact. In particular, we analyze how the 1985 presidential directive excluding fundamental research from export controls created a boundary object that successfully demarcated science and the state, but only for a Cold War world that would soon come to an end.

<p>In recent years, the Russian authorities have invested significant effort into promoting a positive image of Russia as an energy supplier. Yet, Russia's behavior sometimes seems to contradict the declared aim of improving this image. A particularly interesting case is the way the Russian authorities and Gazprom handled the dispute with Ukraine over gas prices in December 2008–January 2009, when the transit of Russian gas to a number of EU member states via Ukraine was seriously affected. This essay argues that in order to understand Russia's position during the crisis, one should take into account the impact of international images on Russian politics, in particular self-images and constructed images that the Russian authorities have been projecting in the West and in Russia itself.

<p>Over recent decades, Latin America has seen its position in the world order erode. Its share of total world exports has significantly declined. A broad opening to foreign investment has economically depressed many local initiatives, and the region's economic growth is now largely dependent upon foreign capital. Nevertheless, an incipient trend has become established that reflects a change in preference for foreign capital destinations, shaped by the degree to which a science-technology base is present. This [shows] that tax facilities, proximity to markets, and cheap labor are insufficient factors to guarantee the cycle of capital. Latin American governments have done little to build an attractive science-technology platform that could allow our countries to join these rapidly growing chains of commodity production. The case of Mexico is highlighted as an example of these trends. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article explores Uganda's decision to send peacekeeping troops to Somalia in 2007 as part of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and argues that the intervention has as much to do with Uganda's relationship with its donors as it has with maintaining regional stability. Museveni's decision to intervene is the most recent example of his regime's multi-pronged “image-management” strategy in which the President has involved Uganda in numerous foreign and domestic activities to ensure that donors perceive his government in a particular way vis-à-vis their interests: as an economic success story, a guarantor of regional stability, or, in relation to Somalia, an ally in the global war on terror. Museveni's strategy, conceptualized here within a constructivist framework, has been able largely to avoid censure in areas of traditional donor concern. [R, abr.]</p>

Considering the deep roots of Franco-Turkish relations (from the 16th c. to the 1970s), the achievements of the years between 1985 and 2000 and the more recent progress, this article argues that fatalism and passivity are actually the most serious threats to Franco-Turkish relations.

<p>Conceptualization of the South Caucasus as a distinct regional unit is a relatively new development. The three states face different political, economic and security realities, precipitating different strategic orientations. Conflicting dynamics complicate relations between states and serve to undermine efforts, both internal and external, to establish a sense of regional identity and advance inter-state cooperation. This paper argues that the concept of a distinct “South Caucasus” region is an externally generated, geographical label, which implies a certain degree of unity and positive interdependence that does not exist. The three states may be geographical neighbors, but they are not “good neighbors”, as the complex web of enmities that has developed over the centuries means the three states tend to look externally to “distant relatives”, undermining both regional cohesion and awareness.

<p>The alliance between Syria and Iran has been a persistent feature on the political landscape of the Middle East for more than three decades.

<p>A principal objective of South Africa's apartheid government's arsenal was not to deter hostile neighboring countries by threatening tactical use of nuclear force as in classical deterrence theory, but instead to compel the intervention of an ambivalent ally, the US. Thus, the case does not correspond to existing deterrence theories, which envision situations involving only a “defender” and “initiator”, and more accurately may be conceptualized as “catalytic deterrence”. While South Africa is a unique case of denuclearization, the country's nuclear strategy shares many characteristics with other “opaque” proliferators, such as no nuclear tests, denial of possession, and no direct threats. Understanding the mechanism of South Africa's catalytic deterrent subsequently provides an important case to amend our notions of deterrence and how similar opaque arsenals — such as those of Israel — may be employed in the future.

<p>This essay analyzes the impact of Israeli unilateralism — specifically that of its settlement project — on the two-state solution.

The essay is framed by a contrast with the Palestinian bid for full UN membership, rejected as unilateralism by the Western powers but in fact aimed at undercutting Israeli unilateralism and creating the conditions for meaningful negotiations.

Through this policy, Turkey realizes its interests to increase its power in the region and Israel profits security-wise. Because of mutual interests, it is unlikely that both states will finally abstain from one another. [R]</p>

<p>Much has been written about the ordering principle known as “unipolarity” in international politics. Ever since the prospect of “systemic change” first began to be glimpsed in the immediate aftermath of the Cold War's ending, controversy has swirled about whether the international system, once so easily styled as a “bipolar” order, had now become by default a unipolar one, and if it had, many turned to wondering what its implications must be. This article argues that unipolarity, while on the wane, continues to be a reasonably accurate label for the current structure of that international system, and moreover that it possesses implications for the management of the Canada-US border, in an era when “homeland security” has become an important theme in discussions of North American security.

<p>Structural changes in the North American and global economies since 2000 have contributed to gradual shifts in Canada's international economic policies. Although the US remains Canada's primary trading partner, underlying economic and political factors are leading Canadian governments to integrate the previously US-centered focus of these policies within a broader global framework. This article explores these trends through comparative and “intermestic” policy lenses within a broader global framework. Canadian policies in North America must increasingly accommodate the multi-dimensional character of trade and investment links and the trans-governmental institutions that have evolved to broker differences among the governments of major economies.

<p>Engaging the recent debate on China's assertive foreign policy, we suggest that it is normal for China — a rising power — to change its policy to a confident or even assertive direction because of its transformed national interests. We argue also that it is better to understand future US-China relations as a bargaining process. Whereas China negotiates for a new status in the system with redefined interests, the US and other countries need to adjust their old political practices. China's “core interest” diplomacy launched in 2009 is the first step in revealing “private information” for peaceful bargaining with the outside world. A status quo foreign policy is not a wise choice for the US because of the changing power and interest configurations in the international system. [R]</p>

<p>This article evaluates US perception of and response to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) operating in Yemen. It evaluates the empirical evidence on which the present understanding of the group is based, the implications of the sociopolitical context in which it operates, and the uneasy position of the Yemeni government in the War against Terror as it has been affected by US policy [since] the early 1990s. In the contested Yemeni state, AQAP is competing for political legitimacy and is increasingly dependent on public support. The US kill-or-capture response, the “on–off” nature of its support that has made Yemen vulnerable to the influence of Al Qaeda in the past, and the actions of the Yemeni government itself, means that none of the measures being taken has the potential to defeat AQAP.

<p>This article explores change and conceptual innovation in Chinese nuclear weapons strategy. It argues that drastic change towards a warfighting strategy is not considered likely. Some transition is underway, towards “assured retaliation”, but this transition is not a dramatic departure from past strategy which was based on uncertain retaliation. To illustrate this view, the article focuses on three areas: declaratory nuclear policy, military modernization, and academic discussions among military and civilian strategists in China. Declaratory policy offers a useful lens through which to consider Chinese nuclear strategy, especially nuclear deterrence and the policy of no first use. For its part, China's ongoing military modernization has been a source of much concern in the West, but here a distinction is made between nuclear and non-nuclear modernization, and emphasis is placed on how both underpin no first use.

<p>Since 9/11 [2001], Southeast Asia began to attract US attention and became the US second front against terrorism. Under the influence of neo-conservativism, the G.W. Bush administration changed Washington's “benign neglect” strategy for Southeast Asia and slowly led the US back to the region. Under the B. Obama administration, Washington has adopted a smart-power strategy that applies both the carrot and the stick. The Obama administration seeks to balance China's growing regional influence, advance US status in East Asia and respond to issues such as global terrorism, financial crisis and climate-change. This article addresses US policy changes in Southeast Asia and identify important factors that affect policy transformation.

<p>Despite the US “pivot to Asia”, it will remain deeply engaged in both Europe and the Middle East. But it must begin treating the latter region as a whole, not as a series of disparate parts; revisit its policies to Israel-Palestine negotiations and Iran; and lead in creating a viable security structure for the Persian Gulf. For their part, to ensure that US Asian and Middle East interests do not lead America to radically decrease its security “footprint” in Europe, its NATO allies must accept the terms of a new “transatlantic bargain”: accepting added responsibilities in North Africa and the Middle East, at times beyond judgments of their national interests. They must also join the US in developing a new Atlantic Compact, a new Persian Gulf security structure, and more cooperation between NATO and the EU. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.8143 HURST, Steven — <bold>Obama [USA] and Iran</bold>. <italic>International Politics</italic> 49(5), Sept. 2012: 545–567.</p>
<p>President B. Obama's choice of toughened sanctions as the means to prevent Iran achieving nuclear weapons status is explained less by any belief in their likely effectiveness than by the unattractive and risky nature of the alternatives. The use of force would not eliminate Iran's nuclear program and risks pitching the region into even deeper turmoil; the “Grand Bargain” with Iran advocated by others would alienate allies and domestic interests and undermine the administration's wider objectives in the Middle East. The attraction of sanctions, in contrast, is that though unlikely to work they pose little threat to US interests while allowing the Obama administration to stave off demands to adopt high risk alternatives and creating a breathing space for the administration to consider the future evolution of its Iran policy.

<p>A debate within fourth-wave deterrence theory focuses on whether and when a tailored approach, based on cultural, organizational, and idiosyncratic characteristics of a target state, has the greatest value. Tailored deterrence may not be appropriate under conditions of domestic political uncertainty in the target state, often those most in need of deterring. A more promising alternative for a defending state may be “deterrence management”. Deterrence management compensates for insufficient or low-confidence assessments of a target's values, organizational structure, power distribution, or cultural idiosyncrasies that prevent employment of tailored deterrence strategies intended to manipulate such factors. To make this case, I combine insights from deterrence theory with an exploration of the uncertain politics of a post-Kim Jong-il North Korea and the unpredictable process of power consolidation.

<p>The dominant explanations of Libya's nuclear reversal in 2003 privilege either coercion or carrots treating these instruments as alternatives. In doing so, they ignore that it took a combination of coercion, carrots and confidence-building to turn Libya around. This article demonstrates this by developing and deploying a theoretical framework that integrates these three instruments into a more coherent and convincing explanation of the case. It highlights that analysts and policy-makers would do well to focus more on how different policy tools can be used in combination to achieve desired outcomes than on how individual tools can be employed with decisive effects. It also demonstrates that the Libya success will be hard to replicate. [R]</p>
<p>62.8148 JENKINS, Rhys — <bold>Latin America and China — a new dependency?</bold> <italic>Third World Quarterly</italic> 33(7), 2012: 1337–1358.</p>
<p>Economic relations between China and Latin America have grown rapidly over the past decade. This paper documents the growth of trade, FDI and other financial flows between China and Latin America and identifies the interests of China in the region as a source of raw materials, a market for exports of manufactured goods and an area of diplomatic competition with Taiwan. It points to the asymmetric nature of the relationship in terms of the relative importance of bilateral trade to each partner, the composition of trade flows, and the balance of FDI flows. However, China is far from becoming a new hegemonic power in Latin America and the latter's relations with the US and Europe continue to be more significant than those with China. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>For the last four decades, Sino-Japanese relations have been characterized by steadily growing economic and socio-cultural interactions. Yet, greater interdependence has developed in tandem with bilateral tensions. Many analysts explain the latter as a result of Japan trying to balance or contain the burgeoning growth of Chinese capabilities. We question and qualify this widespread understanding of Japan's response to China's rise by examining how Japan has handled China's rise between 1978 and 2011. More precisely, how has Japan dealt with China's long-term core strategic interests, embodied in the post-1978 Chinese “grand strategy” believed to have been instrumental to China's rise? To a significant degree, Japan has accommodated the rise of China rather than balanced against it. [R]</p>

<p>This paper proposes that the conceptual political cartography of Eurasia is largely being rewritten, but conventional understandings of space, territory, and resources are insufficient in providing insight into a changing geopolitics. We interrogate the geographical logics of Russia's role as energy provider to Europe by focusing specifically on the provision of gas to Europe via Nord Stream, a new underwater pipeline that is scheduled to go online by late 2011. Drawing on debates in human geography on relational/topological views of space, and on the “splintering urbanism” thesis, the paper describes a rapidly evolving networked space that effectively “splinters” the territorial integrity of the region and thereby complicates notions of Eurasian geopolitics that emphasize proximity, territorial hegemony, and state-centric international relations.

<p>Following the 9/11 [2001] attacks, the US, with the approval of the international community and the support of a number of states, invaded Afghanistan. The mission had two aims: to search out and capture or kill those members of Al-Qaeda responsible for the attacks; to rebuild Afghanistan in the hope that by removing the conditions that facilitated the rise of the Taliban, Afghanistan would cease to be a threat to international peace and security. This paper, divided into three main sections, examines what the international community is striving to do in Afghanistan and explores whether “peace-building”, as understood by the international community, is achievable.

<p>This paper argues that Malaysia-Indonesia relations have become increasingly problematic and complex to manage in a post-Mahathir/Suharto era. The unequal pace of the democratization pattern in both countries has largely contributed to this state of affairs. The four key “transnational” variables or determinants such as migrant labor, mass media, NGOs and the Anwar factor have significantly impacted on Malaysia's ties with Indonesia against the backdrop of the unequal domestic political changes. These four variables have become more prominent in bilateral relations — often in negative terms. More specifically, they represent the dynamics of the people-to-people dimension in bilateral ties. As such, the deterioration in people-to-people relations threatens to significantly reshape government-to-government diplomacy. Bilateral relations could yet face their severest contradictions when official diplomacy is incapable of reflecting accurately popular sentiments. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>South Korea, the newest member to join the OECD's Development Assistance Committee, has signaled that it will become a major donor of official development assistance (ODA).

Using panel data covering twenty-three years (1987–2009) and 154 recipient countries, we examine whether South Korea's ODA reflects the recipient nation's humanitarian needs more than the donor's interests. We ask three questions: (1) What are the major determinants of South Korea's ODA allocation? (2) Has South Korea's ODA policies changed over different time horizons — that is, years, political regimes? (3) Does South Korea exhibit different standards of allocating ODA for different groups of recipient countries? [R, abr.]</p>

It will need to influence what global swing states want through outreach to publics and private sectors. And it will need to make the case that all four can best manage China's rise by strengthening international rules of the road. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.8063]</p>

<p>By examining peace operations in Côte d'Ivoire, Chad and the Central African Republic (CAR), and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), this article shows that French-led peace operations in francophone Sub-Saharan Africa are highly problematic. This is especially true for those countries towards which France simultaneously pursues a bilateral military policy. The maintenance of the policy makes the political neutrality of the operations difficult and undermines international peacekeeping efforts. Furthermore, it gives African actors the opportunity to instrumentalize the policies and use them against each other. Therefore, only a full multilateralization of French military engagement, as well as a stronger commitment by other external actors, can make peace operations in the region more credible and more effective.

<p>This essay explores Russia's OSCE policy. Analysts have noted Russia's disinterest and obstructive policies towards the Organization. What — if anything — does the Russian Federation still want from the OSCE? Does the OSCE still serve as a forum for dialog? These two issues are studied on the basis of rational institutionalism and realism. The essay demonstrates that Russia is still interested in the OSCE, but its policy has become more pragmatic, selective and instrumentalist. It includes obstructive and constructive strategies. At the same time, today the Russian Federation ascribes less significance to the Organization in European security. This is predetermined not only by its inability to push its interests through the OSCE, but also by the declining interest of other participating States in the Organization. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The latest US sanctions against Iran signed into law by President B Obama in December 2011 would bar foreign firms dealing with the Central bank of Iran from access to the American financial system. Since the Central Bank of Iran deals with most of the country's oil-related transactions, this measure when fully implemented would have the effect of badly hurting Iran's oil exports, which provide 80 percent of its revenues. The EU is separately considering its own sanctions aimed at embargoing oil imports from Iran. The main goal of these sanctions is to force Iran to give up its uranium-enrichment program. The Western countries claim that this program reflects Iran's intention to develop nuclear weapons, a charge that Iran strongly denies. [R]</p>

<p>This article argues that many of Ukraine's problems are long-standing and remain unresolved because government policies are virtual (i.e., do not conform to official documents or statements), thereby reducing the effectiveness of the West's (i.e., NATO and the EU) engagement with Ukraine and the ability of Kiev to pursue its declared foreign policy objectives. The article discusses Ukraine's relations with the West through cycles of Disinterest, Partnership and Disillusionment. Under Presidents L. Kravchuk and L. Kuchma three cycles equated to Kravchuk's presidency (Disinterest, 1991–1994), Kuchma's first term (Partnership, 1994–1999) and second term (Disillusionment, 2000–2004).

<p>The outbreak of the Russo-Georgian war sparked a very strong and swift reaction from the Baltic states and Poland. In contrast to other European states, they did not hesitate to accuse Russia of initiating the conflict and sought to punish it for its alleged imperialist ambitions. Traditional variables of national economic, geopolitical or security interests fall short of accounting for such acute sensitivity by Baltic and Polish politicians. Instead, this article argues that identity politics driven by historical-psychological legacies provide the most plausible explanation. The case illustrates how third parties decide their level of engagement in conflicts that have limited strategic importance to them. [R]</p>

<p>This article focuses on the history of Korea-Turkey relations. This relationship can be divided into three stages at twenty-year intervals. The first stage (1950–1970) deals with military-based relations. Two major aspects are discussed: the participation of Turkish troops in the Korean War and the presence of Turkish troops in the Korean peninsula after the Korean War. The second stage (1970–1990) outlines the process of founding cooperation. This part briefly examines the two countries' endeavors to lay an institutional arrangement for bilateral cooperation, particularly in trade and investment. The last stage (1990–2010) covers their deepening and diversifying relations. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>By examining Chinese perspectives on humanitarian intervention and national sovereignty, this article first argues that Beijing's interests are so multiple and complex that concern about the implications of humanitarian intervention for national integration is more crucial than oil in determining its policy towards Sudan. Paradoxically, China, a non-democratic country, is more influential than liberal democratic states in making the rules of humanitarian intervention in Darfur because of a lack of political will in the West. In addition, there are early signs that China intends to utilise its newfound power to remake international rules regarding territorial sovereignty. Further development is likely to be shaped by its interactions with the US. [R, abr.]</p>

Specifically, it examines which experts play a role in producing China's discourses and to what extent, and how the experts' relationships have shaped the community.

<p>During the Cold War, the Horn of Africa emerged as arguably the most highly penetrated regional subsystem in the world. Not only the two superpowers, but Middle Eastern regional powers intervened in interstate and intrastate conflicts there. Three geostrategic factors drew foreign powers to the Horn of Africa: (1) its location across the Red Sea from the oil-rich Arabian Peninsula; (2) an almost 2,500-mile coastline (stretching from Eritrea's border with Sudan in the north to Somalia's border with Kenya in the south) lying astride the Red Sea and the South African Cape maritime routes; and (3) Ethiopia's control over the headwaters of the Blue Nile, which account for 90 percent of the waters of the Nile River system.

<p>The Indian Ocean Region (IOR) is becoming increasingly significant in the world arena, with the US, India and China — the most important stakeholders in the region — playing substantial roles. Judging from the three countries' strategic thought, concerns, interests and power balances, it is the US–India potential competition for maritime dominance in the IOR that demands the most attention. However, competition does not mean confrontation. Since the three countries face similar security challenges and share common interests in the IOR, it is necessary for them to compete to a reasonable extent while pushing forward with functional cooperation. Because of the existence of an interdependent relationship and common security challenges, the future scenario will be one of dynamic and manageable competition, instead of inevitable conflict and rivalry.

<p>This article argues that Bahrain has provided a proxy arena of competition between Tehran and Riyadh that possesses key strategic value for both states. Given the fractious nature of identity incongruence within Bahrain, notably between the Sunni ruling family and the much larger Shia population, the kingdom faces serious internal-security challenges. These challenges then leave Bahrain open to the influence of other actors, for whom the stability of the country is strategically important. Although the veracity of claims detailing the Iranian influence in supporting the Shia of Bahrain is uncertain, the strategic importance of the Al Khalifa for Saudi Arabia, coupled with a history of Iranian action in Bahrain, clerical ties and Iranian rhetoric, means that Riyadh has to act under the assumption that these claims are valid.

<p>Focusing on diverse state approaches to nationalism provides a more nuanced view than that of Russian domestic and foreign policies driven directly by revanchist nationalism. The Russian authorities' “official nationality” is moderate in aspiration. However, the effect is less benign because the Kremlin both mobilizes extreme nationalism for regime goals and suppresses it when it becomes destabilizing. This approach prevents nationalism either of extreme or moderate orientation becoming an influential, independent force in Russian politics. Such conflicting imperatives make Russia a more unpredictable international partner than if its policies were founded on a consistent ideological nationalism.

<p>President G. W.

These initiatives call into question the separation of church and state. B.

Faith-based IR and political science scholars have sought to build on these initiatives and call for a greater role for faith in US foreign policy.

<p>This essay is based on a close reading of speeches and other public statements made by V. Putin and D. Medvedev during their presidencies, covering the period 2000–2010. Both presidents have regarded Russia's nuclear weapons as primarily political rather than military instruments. Both demonstrated a sustained desire to pursue strategic nuclear arms reductions through negotiations, particularly on a bilateral basis with the US, and an interest in minimum nuclear deterrence. The shifts in position taken by both presidents on US plans for missile defense in particular reveal that they attached as much, if not more, importance to Russia being regarded as an equal partner by the US than to any strategic gains that might be achieved through preventing the deployment of an effective missile defense system.

<p>Maintaining regional supremacy and stability and denying extra-regional actors a military foothold in South Asia have long been key objectives of India's regional policy. In pursuance of these objectives, India displayed a willingness to undertake coercive action against its smaller South Asian neighbors. Evidence of this is seen in the military intervention in Sri Lanka (1987–1990) and a virtual economic blockade of Nepal (1989–1990). However, during the past decade, India appeared to draw away from such overt interventionist policies and even accepted outside actors like Norway and the UN being involved in the peace process in Sri Lanka (2002–2006) and Nepal (2006–2011), respectively. Notwithstanding India's apparent shift in behavior, these actions do not represent a fundamental change in the country's traditional policy towards the region. [R]</p>

<p>US President B. Obama has attempted to refocus and revitalize the US war against terrorism, increasing emphasis on the war in Afghanistan. He has had to “sell” to the US public the renewed effort in order to maintain support for his policy, drawing heavily on the idea of “sacrifice” to justify the deepening of the commitment, arguing that the costs are necessary to keep the US safe from further terrorist attacks. This article explores this symbolic engagement with the sacrifices made to keep the US “safe” from terrorism. It considers whether this approach resonates with public and elite opinion; it also considers the sustainability of underlying public support for the war and analyzes how Obama has adapted his approach in order to fulfill his goal of drawing the US intervention to a close.

The friendship forged in those years continues to grow. It is based on a common set of interests and common set of values. We have a vigorous dialogue, and the basis for a strategic partnership has been laid in the Wellington Declaration.

<p>The three volumes reviewed in this article offer a range of feminist explorations of the Iraq War.

The books reviewed can be loosely described as emphasizing a standpoint feminist perspective, highlighting how gendered processes, practices, myths, images and expectations shape the day-to-day lives of men and women concerned with the Iraq War in both Iraq and the US. These insights can offer a challenge to the construction and reinforcement of the temporal division crafted between war and peace, making us think again about how we conceptualize violence in international politics.

<p>Stereotypically, Moscow's policies towards Cyprus have been treated diachronically via the hegemonic analytical paradigm of “political realism”. And yet, primarily since 1991, Moscow's Cyprus policies have been quite distinct, being marked by such “idealistic” characteristics as sustained support for the UN Resolutions, for international law (including respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity) and international ethics (including solidarity, protection of human rights, and opposition to illegality and injustice). Therefore, whereas the “power-political” reading of Washington and London's Cyprus policies remains valid, the identical reading of Moscow's policies needs to be transcended. Thus, the concept of “Pragmatic Idealism” is applied there to the <italic>sui generis</italic> Russia-Cyprus relationship which, after all, has been thoroughly affected by historical, political, religious, cultural, and axiological affinities and bonds.

<p>This paper explains democracies' military participation in the Iraq War. Prior studies have identified institutional and partisan differences as potential explanatory factors for the observed variance. The interaction of institutions and partisanship, however, has gone largely unobserved. I argue that these factors must be analyzed in conjunction: institutional constraints presume actors that fulfill their role as veto-players to the executive. Likewise, partisan politics is embedded in institutional frames that enable or constrain decision-making. Hence I suggest a comparative approach that combines these factors to explain why some democracies joined the ad hoc coalition against Iraq and others did not. To investigate the interaction between institutions, partisanship and war participation I apply fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Russia's foreign and domestic policies are still profoundly affected by the collapse of the USSR.

In order to understand Russian elites' modern world-vision and position, it is necessary to examine the questions of national identity and the consolidation of V. Putin's regime as well as Russia's complex relationship with Europe and the Western world. Neighboring countries, such as Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova, find themselves caught in a vise-like grip between the EU and Russia. This “in-between” state constitutes for Moscow a fixation which tends to overshadow the question really at stake: Asia's transformation and globalization.</p>

What was really relevant in this context: the international legal order of the UN Charter or some other international order dominated by values other than those embedded in the Charter? Moreover, what kind of a war was it: a legal war on the basis of international law or an ethical war in accordance with the criteria of the just war tradition?

The article finds much common ground between the two candidates; both are results-driven pragmatists, attuned to nuance and complexity, who nonetheless believe that US geostrategic primacy will continue through the span of the 21st c. The gulf between them on domestic policy is vast, but on foreign policy, there is little between them. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The peculiarities of Swiss security policy since the end of the Cold War are best explained not through Switzerland's structural position but through its unique strategic culture. Compared to other European neutrals, there are three particular idiosyncratic expressions of Switzerland's neutrality: strict adherence to institutional non-alignment in Swiss foreign and security policy; the Swiss army's militia principle; and the Swiss system of civil defense. Given their relative persistence despite radical changes in the strategic environment, these idiosyncrasies deserve more research attention and more theoretical scrutiny. This article argues that an examination of Swiss strategic culture, based on historical and identity narratives as well as public opinion, best explains the puzzle of distinctiveness. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Economic liberalization is still thought to be unlikely prior to hegemonic ascent. This assumption is based on the conventional narrative that Great Britain began lowering its trade barriers in the 1820s as it began its hegemonic ascent. [However,] Britain began pursuing an open trading structure in the 1780s — in precisely the multipolar world that hegemonic stability theorists claimed would be least likely to initiate the shift. This change in commercial strategy depended crucially on the intellectual conversion of a key policy-maker — the Earl of Shelburne — from mercantilist foreign economic policy to Adam Smith's revolutionary laissez-faire liberalism. Using the case of “the world's most important trading state” in the 19th c., this article highlights the importance of intellectuals — as well as their ideas — in shaping states' foreign policy strategies.

<p>New Zealand's approach to world affairs has always been influenced by its circumstances, which include absence of critical mass, remote location, lack of strategic raw materials and limited productive capacity. Its experience, especially in two world wars, helped shape a particular psychology of dependency in international affairs. Our strategic pathway was, therefore, straightforward if not always easy. But in today's world New Zealand must deal with a far more complex situation, though changes to the psychology of dependence still appear tentative. In an increasingly diverse international political landscape, New Zealand has a vital strategic interest in rules-based order. It must advocate for a more inclusive system that reflects the realities of the emerging international order. [R]</p>

<p>This article examines Serbia's Kosovo policies in the context of EU integration, in particular the divergence between Serbia's stance towards Kosovo and its aspirations towards EU candidacy. Considering the negative effects that the Serbia-Kosovo relationship has had on regional cooperation and Serbia's EU integration, this article considers why Serbia appears to have failed to “Europeanize” its Kosovo policies, i.e., to normalize relations in a way that would be more favorable to accession. It examines Serbia's Kosovo policies since 2000, and the ways in which domestic actors have deliberately manipulated and complicated the question of Kosovo and Serbia's EU membership. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The Japanese government and business sector have long seen opportunities in making environmental protection a core feature of industrial policy. The “green” economic diplomacy effort, which materialized in the late 1980s and largely builds on targeted domestic innovation policies, is now entering new ground. Assessing recent developments in the railway, nuclear power generation, water, and next-generation automobile industries, this paper analyzes how and why the Japanese government uses “green” environmental and energy technology in relations with emerging and developed countries. Adhering to comprehensive security traditions, Japan's policies aim to contribute to the national interest both in terms of economic prosperity and political stability. Adjustment to shifting global power balances, domestic politics, and climate change challenges also play a role, while “hard” security issues are barely considered. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Turkey redefined its geographical security environment over the last decade by deepening its engagement with neighboring regions, especially with the Middle East. The Arab spring, however, challenged not only the authoritarian regimes in the region but also Turkish foreign policy strategy. This strategy was based on cooperation with the existing regimes and did not prioritize democracy-promotion. The upheavals in the Arab world, therefore, created a dilemma between ethics and self-interest in Turkish foreign policy. Amid the flux of geopolitical shifts in one of the world's most unstable regions, Turkish foreign policy-making elites are attempting to reformulate their strategies to overcome this inherent dilemma. Turkey could make a bigger and more constructive impact in the region by trying to take a more detached stand and through controlled activism. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>In a remarkable turnaround, Turkey and the Kurdish Regional Government [in Iraq] have recently emerged as close partners in a region increasingly characterized by uncertainty. They share a discomfort with the centralizing inclinations of Baghdad's current government, a stake in seeing an end to the PKK's campaign of violence, and a preference for greater unity between the various forces opposing the Assad regime in Syria. Their economies are increasingly interlocked, and the KRG's emergence as a significant producer of energy is of benefit to both parties. Furthermore, the Ankara-Erbil relationship is one that serves Washington's regional interests and perspectives well. However, serious differences remain. Iraqi Kurds still aspire to incorporate Kirkuk, and support greater autonomy for the Kurds of Turkey and Syria too. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>India's Afghan policy is driven by, and is dependent on, many extraneous factors such as India's troubled relationship with Pakistan, its search for a land transit to Central Asia through Iran and Afghanistan and its concerns regarding use of Afghan territory by Pakistan to the detriment of Indian interests. Given the geographical constraints, India has relied on Iran for land access to Afghanistan. This has been complicated by Iran-US relations — the two countries with whom India shares common interests. India has also tried to address Pakistani apprehensions regarding its engagement in Afghanistan. Simultaneously, India's economic engagement with other countries of the region is likely to help it to sustain its presence in Afghanistan after 2014, when the Taliban may well be a part of the government in Kabul.

<p>Danish foreign policy is under transformation. Different versions of activism have gradually replaced adaptation and lately Denmark has participated more actively and independently in world politics than ever before. The core in activism is based on a liberal value system that seems to have replaced the adaptation logics dominating Danish foreign policy during the Cold War. Activism has evolved from a multilateral inspired activism in the 1990s to a more Atlantic centered activism during the 2000s. While analysts see the different phases as opposites, I argue that the types of activism should be seen as a difference of degree rather than a difference of kind. “Activism” as a foreign policy strategy, however, should be considered analytically as a difference in kind from the adaptation strategies that dominated Danish foreign policy during the Cold War.

<p>International aid to the Palestinian Authority is conditioned in part on democratization and good governance. However, since Hamas's victory in the 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council elections and its takeover of the Gaza Strip, aid agencies have supported the international boycott of the Hamas government. This article argues that aid agencies, by operating in Gaza while boycotting its government, subvert their mandates and serve the political interests of donors and the PA rather than the humanitarian and development needs of Gazans. As a consequence, assistance has, inadvertently and unintentionally, increased Gazans' dependence on humanitarian aid, impeded economic development, and enabled Israel to maintain its occupation and the blockade of Gaza.

<p>Optimizing the development opportunities presented by emerging powers' growing interest in trade, investment and diplomatic engagement in Africa seems a priority for the continent in the context of a changing global system in which power is more diffuse. Taking into account a reconceptualization of aid effectiveness as development effectiveness, this paper focuses on the manner in which African states understand and approach new opportunities for cooperation with emerging powers, especially China, India and Brazil, including the crucial issue of whether they seek joint development initiatives with both traditional partners and emerging powers. South-South cooperation, which is value-neutral although rhetorically reflecting the principles of solidarity and mutual benefit, must be part of an effective strategy to draw emerging economies into the national or regional development objectives of African states and the continent at large.

I make two general claims: (1) it is the development of common rules and values in various policy areas that constitutes the basis for the EU as a security actor; and (2) it is the successful projection of these rules and values beyond EU borders that will determine the impact of the EU as a security actor.

<p>In the near 20 years since the Oslo peace process began, Palestinians have suffered losses — socially, economically and politically — arguably not seen since 1948. This altered reality has, in recent years, been shaped by critical paradigm shifts in the way the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is understood and addressed. These shifts, particularly with regard to international acceptance of Palestine's territorial fragmentation, the imperative of ending Israel's occupation, the <italic>de facto</italic> annexation of West Bank lands to Israel, and the transformation of Palestinians into a humanitarian issue — have redefined the way the world views the conflict, diminishing the possibility of a political resolution.

By identifying democracy with “liberal democracy” — a discursively powerful political move — the contingent character of democracy has been lost.

And because they have failed to deeply revise the philosophical underpinnings of their policies, even after 2011, they risk another, even bigger, policy failure.

<p>This article applies IR theory to the US presence in the Pacific. It analyzes the ways in which geopolitical considerations of position are at the heart of US security strategy in the Pacific. It argues that America's long-term security position in the Pacific is a basic geopolitical matter, in terms of traditional geopolitics (regional position as “location”) and in terms of critical geopolitics (regional position as “power and aspirations”). In looking at US security strategy in the Pacific, three geopolitical features are noticeable: (1) Mahanian sea-power tenets, (2) overlapping competitive US-China concerns focused around the two island chains in the Western Pacific, and (3) the internal balancing carried out by the US in the Pacific which is particularly focused on Guam.

<p>The Cuban missile crisis — one of the most intensely studied events of the 20th c. — engages the attention of scholars from a variety of disciplines. Lessons learned by American practitioners and academics contributed to the conduct of American foreign policy in the 1960s and to academic understanding of nuclear deterrence, nuclear crises and crisis management in general. Nearly 50 fifty years of scholarship have generated new insights and understanding. From the 1980s, study of what in Moscow was termed the Caribbean crisis was informed by access to Soviet officials and Soviet archives, and became the forefront of the “new historiography” of the Cold War.

<p>Why is the British Virgin Islands a bigger source of FDI into China than the US, the EU and Japan combined? Why is there 10 times more investment from China in the Cayman Islands than there is in the US? This paper argues that these flows represent the efforts of Chinese and foreign investors to reduce governance and measurement transaction costs. Investors avail themselves of efficient institutions in offshore centers that are absent locally. These institutional attractions include the ease of raising capital on foreign stock markets, access to reliable courts, and more flexible and sophisticated financial products. Existing explanations of these capital movements, characterizing them as criminal money or tax arbitrage, are insufficient. Evidence is drawn from government statistics, private legal advice and interviews in offshore financial centers. [R]</p>

It revises the Department of Defense's force-planning construct, and identifies the Asia–Pacific and the greater Middle East as the two regions where the US military should focus its attention and resources. The US will continue to struggle to direct its military power towards its most important geopolitical priorities, such as rebalancing towards the Asia– Pacific, as opposed simply to respond to the many security surprises that are certain to arise.

The French role in the arrest itself was categorically denied by French officials, while Operation Licorne's strict respect for Security Council mandates and the imminent need for protection of various categories of persons were underlined.

The liberal or pragmatic view, which advocates working within the prevailing global order and integration with the global economy in order to advance India's economic performance, is currently dominant. At the same time, however, India has numerous identities that are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and which lead to India's foreign policy “ambiguity”. Four possible explanations for this ambiguity are proposed: mimicry versus differentiation; reluctant radicalism; strategic moral posturing; and differentiation across issue areas.

<p>This study provides a social constructivist reading of Russia's security policy under President V.

Drawing on social constructivist theories of identity, security and narratives, it argues that a change occurred in the Putin regime's conceptualization of Russian state identity: from an initially weak state which prioritized internal security threats and the fight against terrorism, to a strong state, whose main security “Other” was the West, by the end of Putin's presidency. This resulted in less priority to the terrorism issue in the official discourse and the widening of the notion of “threat” and “terrorism”, in line with a developing security narrative in both internal and external spheres.

<p>Disproportionate and unsubstantiated allegations of human rights violations, war crimes and racism have been employed as a form of political warfare designed to isolate Israel internationally. This strategy, based on the model used to defeat the apartheid government in South Africa, was adopted in 2001 at the NGO Forum of the UN-sponsored Durban Conference on racism, in which 1500 organizations participated. Since then, many human rights NGOs have consistently supported the political agenda of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), whose members dominate the UN Human Rights Council. In the decade following the Durban conference, the NGO network has issued frequent condemnations of Israel based on false or unverifiable allegations of human rights abuses and “war crimes”.

<p>Traditional perspectives identify three major patterns of behavior for rising states in international institutions: balancing, spoiling, and being co-opted. This article uses these perspectives to ask how the redistributive aspirations of three rising regional powers — India, Brazil, and South Africa (IBSA) — impact on international institutions in the fields of trade, money, and security. The findings indicate that there is strong variation across issue areas. Trade provides support for the spoiling perspective, while the areas of money and security exhibit aspects familiar both to the balancing and cooptation perspectives. A broader picture emerges of IBSA states' general integration into hegemonic norms and being coopted into existing international institutions, [while] balancing the influence of the established powers and reforming these institutions to conform to a more South-oriented, sovereignist image of world order.

<p>We argue that post-World War II American military interventionism cannot be understood with ideational or psychological forces alone. Rather, two crucial material variables, namely, geography and aggregate power, amplified by superior technological prowess, are indispensable for understanding the propensity for the US to intervene militarily abroad. These two factors have powerfully shielded the American elites and public from the horrendous devastation of war. As a result, compared to their counterparts in other major states, American citizens and elites have tended to be less repelled by the prospect of war. The outcome is that since World War II the US has been far more active in military intervention overseas than other major states. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Turkey's estranged relations with B Assad and its Syria policy once again demonstrate that Ankara's foreign policy is not a battle between pro-Western and Islamic camps, but a delicate calibration among three historically-rooted conceptions of Turkish grand strategy.

<p>Since the demise of the Soviet Union, unipolarity has been widely discussed as a general operational concept describing the international system in its many theoretical colors. This article examines some of the better known theories addressing polarity-related issues in international affairs, and assesses whether such a hypothetical construct could be used in determining Canada's foreign policy priorities. The article concentrates on methods and processes used in scholarship describing empirical realities of complex systems, such as the international system or strategic rivalry. It outlines a paradox that exists between the hypothesis of “unipolarity” and theoretical reasoning on one hand, and between perceptions and realities of a complex international system on the other.

<p>More than a year after the start of the Tunisian and Egyptian revolts, the question of how political Islam will return to regional politics is still open. This article explores the differences between the AKP's Turkish model and the Tunisian al-Nahda movement. The Tunisian and the Turkish case studies are examined and compared on three levels. First, the historical and structural contexts of the two countries and the relationship between the state and Islam are taken into account. Second, the two models of political Islam that have developed in Tunisia and Turkey are analyzed. Finally, the two different views of the social, political and economic life proposed by al-Nahda in Tunisia and by the AKP in Turkey are compared. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>There is a large literature on the impacts of explicit threats on the outcomes of crises between states, but the longer-term impacts of threats on dyadic state relationships and on international outcomes have been much less studied because of the difficulty of establishing causal connections between events separated in time. By comparing nearly identical foreign policy contexts before and after the Austrian Crimean War ultimata to Russia, this article demonstrates that, contrary to the prevailing view in much of the international relations literature, such long-term effects are not marginal ones that theoretical simplification with the goal of analyzing the central tendencies of the international system can usefully ignore. Policy-makers should take greater account of the long-term consequences of aggressive negotiating stances than current theories imply; scholars have underestimated the information conveyed by private threats in crisis-bargaining.

<p>This article examines China's and Taiwan's humanitarian assistance to Haiti, as well as the extent to which China and Taiwan — as non-Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donors — adhered to the DAC-established humanitarian assistance architecture. It argues that China's and Taiwan's emergency aid was comparable with the DAC donorship in terms of its declaratory commitment to altruism and the pursuit of strategic objectives. Both Beijing and Taipei considered cross-Strait relations and domestic and international public opinion when strategizing emergency aid. The primacy of politics determined a divided China's modalities of aid, funding levels, and institutional framework. The article concludes that strategic considerations — including cross-Strait politics, a suspension of cross-Strait diplomatic rivalry notwithstanding — are at least as significant as altruism in driving China's and Taiwan's humanitarian assistance.

<p>The 1990s witnessed a growing rapprochement in relations between Turkey and Israel, which in a decade's time have become strained, reaching an all-time low with the Mavi Marmara incident in 2010.

<p>This study analyzes the recent trajectory of Turkish foreign policy from the prism of international political economy with special reference to its impact on Turkey's ongoing democratic consolidation and global integration. Adapting an interdisciplinary approach with insights from political science, IR, economics and development studies, Turkey's structural transformation from an inward-looking import-substitution regime to a liberal export-promotion strategy are evaluated. In this context, the first- and second-generation neoliberal reforms in the 1980s and the 2000s are highlighted in line with their impact on democratic consolidation and global integration. The processes of state transformation and the ascendancy of economic issues to the level of “high politics” in the post-Cold War era are stressed with reference to economic diplomacy and “neo-protectionist” science and technology policies by industrialized and industrializing countries.

<p>Since the termination of its nuclear weapons program, commenced in 1989 and verified by the IAEA in 1993, successive South African governments have consistently advocated the country's commitment to nuclear non-proliferation. South Africa has secured a niche role through norm-construction and state identity for itself through its nuclear diplomacy with the IAEA. The article explores aspects of South Africa's nuclear diplomacy with the IAEA as an example of niche diplomacy. Therefore, it traces South Africa's diplomatic relations with the IAEA, starting with the IAEA's verification process and the implementation of a Safeguards Agreement (1989–1994) through the conversion of South Africa's research nuclear reactor (1991–2005); and its refusal to support the establishment of a nuclear fuel bank in Russia under the IAEA's auspices (2009–2010).

<p>This study explores how ideas related to South-South solidarity formed the interests and directed the collective actions of emerging states. It [examines] attempts by India, Brazil and South Africa (IBSA), through their development assistance mechanism, the IBSA Fund, to challenge traditional normative frameworks of best behavior associated to Western/liberal development models. I argue that contemporary South-South initiatives — and the IBSA partnership in particular — promote changes in the current political-normative configuration of international relations. Unlike South-South coalitions of the early post-colonial era, when newly independent states in Africa and Asia were economically weak, leading Southern states' economic gains have significantly raised their normative pull. This article shows the resilience of perceptions, values and ideas, which have been translated into conceptions of “distributive justice” promoted by Southern powers through initiatives such as IBSA.

<p>We examine two research questions: How did Presidents Johnson and Bush (1) use religious rhetoric to justify war, and (2) how were their speeches (or addresses) similar and different in terms of the words and emphases that they used to justify war? Answers to these questions can help contribute to our understanding of the role of problem-definition in the policy-making process. War policy is particularly fruitful area for comparison because war calls for the most important sacrifice a president can ask of citizens in terms of blood, treasure and security. Therefore, the reasons given for war must be carefully communicated to average citizens, elites, the media and allies. One of the main ways presidents do this is through their public addresses.

<p>The paper discusses South Korea's “brand Korea” initiative and the impact of cultural transformations on the South Korean national security narrative. It considers the practices of identity and security representation in South Korea and outlines how cultural transformations in a country which has built its national security on an assumption of racial and ethnic homogeneity are affecting relations between South and North Korea. It argues that these issues can be explored through a critical geopolitics perspective and that the key relationship resides in the narratives and representations of threat and “the foreigner”. It discusses critical geopolitics within a non-Western context and explores how cultural transformations are creating new narratives and new representations of the relationship between foreigner, national identity and national security.

<p>As part of a revisionist discourse, it has been contended that the core of Eritrea's political, cultural and economic identity is based on colonial premises and these three premises are false. As a result, Eritrea is in a dilemma. It is further contended that Eritrea's future lies in seeking unity with Ethiopia. This article is a rejoinder to the contention. It shows the truthfulness of the premises and argues that, save for the prevalent dictatorship, it was and it still is a correct decision for Eritreans to opt for an independent Eritrea. Avoiding the old talk, this rejoinder recommends that as sovereign states, Eritrea and Ethiopia should govern their relations by principles of civilized nations. [R]</p>

<p>This article aims to be a stepping stone for the creation of a new [US] North Korea policy based on the reflections on the strengths and shortcomings of the past ones. Continuous bickering between conservatives and progressives has blocked the rise of a constructive and positive policy on North Korea. A common denominator acceptable to both sides is imperative. There is a need for a solid and predictable program that can defy the change of administrations. The basic direction is to be the improvement of engagement, not the abandonment of it. A new policy entitled creative engagement, selectively learning from the past practices, rests on the principles of open thinking and flexibility, of proactive attitudes, of strategic engagement, of co-evolutionary process, and of multiple methods of liberalism, realism, and constructivism.

<p>The international climate-change regime is comprised of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol. Under the regime, China and India, two of the largest developing countries, have been exempted from any binding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-reduction targets that apply to developed countries. However, with their GHG emissions increasing, China and India have faced growing international pressure to undertake binding mitigation obligations in international climate-change negotiations. To enhance their bargaining power in the negotiations, China and India have been cooperating with each other, which has not only led to a new approach to addressing climate change but also defended the ethical benchmark of the regime. Their cooperation has weakened the EU's traditional leadership status and the leadership ambitions of the US. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.8250 YAHUDA, Michael — <bold>China's recent relations with maritime neighbours</bold>. <italic>International Spectator</italic> 47(2), June 2012: 30–44.</p>
<p>Chinese maritime assertiveness since 2008 is a product of China's growing economic and military power combined with a centrally fostered nationalism. Although incidents with several maritime neighbors may not have all been initiated by China, the Chinese over-reacted. Matters were made worse by the opacity of Chinese decision-making processes and by problems of governance as shown by the multiplicity of Chinese authorities in charge of separate naval forces. The American “pivot” to Asia provides neighbors with a hedge against an overbearing China. But they still need to cultivate relations with China on whom they were economically dependent.

<p>In the history of post-Soviet integration, there have already been attempts to create a Free Trade Area of the CIS, the Customs Union of Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. In the early 1990s many documents with integration intentions were signed, but agreements did not work in practice. The problems of post-Soviet integration cannot be brought down to subjective plans and the goals of different political leaders, nor does its perspective development depend on them. The main reasons for the difficulties are economic and deterioration prospects.</p>
<p>62.8252 ZHANG Jian — <bold>China's defense white papers: a critical appraisal</bold>. <italic>Journal of Contemporary China</italic> 77, Sept. 2012: 881–898.</p>
<p>Since 1998, Beijing has continued to issue Defense White Papers on a regular two-year frequency. Indeed, in recent years it has accorded greater importance to these documents. This paper argues that China's Defense White Papers warrant more attention than they have received so far. An examination of the making of the White Papers, the functions designated for these documents and their evolving content and structure reveals not only the different nature and purpose of the Chinese White Papers compared with their counterparts in Western countries, but also important changes and continuities in China's strategic outlook and its evolving perceptions of the role of the use of force in the context of the country's re-emergence as a major player in international affairs.

<p>The Kurds were late to the idea of nationalism in the 20th c., and became the largest stateless nation in the world, divided mainly between Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria. A Kurdistan regional government in Iraq was born, as the former Iraqi regime was weakened after the first Gulf War. Two decades on, the region has become more assertive and been making many new friends, largely because of its newfound wealth, its influence in post-Saddam Iraq, and its stability when compared with the rest of Iraq. Oil has been a curse for the Kurds and Iraq, but now the Kurds appear to have found a way to use its resources for economic development, ensuring that the Kurdistan region remains stable and can establish itself as a self-governing and influential entity.
