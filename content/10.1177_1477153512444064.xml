<p>The global increase in energy prices, the urgent need to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to the atmosphere and the high energy usage are currently the major threats to the greenhouse industry. Optimised control of the lighting quality, quantity and periodicity can contribute to improvements in the productivity and energy efficiency of greenhouses. In this paper, the effects of dynamic control of supplemental lighting intensity on electricity consumption and fresh weight accumulation of lettuce plants are investigated. The use of the dynamic lighting control resulted in a 20% reduction in the electricity consumption in comparison to a similar lighting system operated under a discontinuous on–off regime. However, there was no statistically significant difference between both regimes in terms of plants’ average fresh weight accumulated per electrical energy unit consumed.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1477153512444064"><title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>In northern latitudes, low availability of daylight and harsh weather conditions, especially during the winter season, are not favourable for year-round cultivation of vegetable and ornamental crops in the open field. Year-round plant cultivation is feasible in closed greenhouses where growth factors can be controlled independently of weather conditions or season of the year. It is known that the use of supplemental lighting in greenhouse cultivation has significantly contributed to improvements in the productivity of certain crops.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477153512444064">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477153512444064"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477153512444064"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477153512444064">4</xref></sup> However, the use of artificial light to supplement or replace the lack of daylight also causes a significant increase in the total energy use of greenhouses. Due to the continuous increase in energy prices and the global need to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, improvements in energy usage are urgently needed. These necessary improvements in the energy efficiency of greenhouses are most preferably achieved by reducing the energy inputs (e.g. electricity and heating) without hindering crop productivity. It is also known that appropriate environmental control has a large potential to improve the energy efficiency of greenhouses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477153512444064">5</xref></sup> Therefore, optimisation of supplemental artificial lighting can also contribute to address the current challenges that the greenhouse industry is facing (i.e. energy, environment and market).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477153512444064">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The growth and development of plants are influenced among other factors, by the quality (i.e. spectrum), quantity (i.e. intensity) and periodicity (i.e. time duration) of light exposure. The control of these parameters using artificial lighting is nowadays easier than in the past. The combination of light emitting diode (LED) lighting with microelectronics and electronics provides the means to do it.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477153512444064">7</xref></sup> Until now, the use of LED lighting for commercial production of crops has been limited to relatively small-scale experiments. This is mainly due to the high initial cost of the LED lighting installations in relation to conventional lighting. According to technology roadmaps, the costs of LED lighting will continue to decrease while energy efficiency will increase. These important development trends will facilitate and accelerate the use of LEDs in commercial horticultural applications. In addition to the well-known high energy efficiency potential, LEDs offer improved control possibilities over conventional lighting technologies such as high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps. HPS lamps suffer from restricted controllability, long ignition times and dimming range limitations. Development of suitable control regimes connected with LED lighting can further reinforce energy savings. The full control of light intensity (i.e. dimming) is among one of the possibilities offered by LEDs. Furthermore, full-dimming of LEDs can be achieved without loss of operation reliability (e.g. reduction of the lifetime expectancy, abrupt failure). Nowadays, supplemental artificial lighting installations in greenhouses are commonly controlled based on outside global solar irradiance. Depending on weather conditions, physical obstacles, time of the day, sun inclination angle or period of the year, the spectrum, intensity and periodicity of daylight varies widely and continuously. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1477153512444064">Figure 1</xref> shows examples of the daily variations of the global solar photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) at the experiment site during October measured at a 5-minute time interval.

</fig></p>
<p>To our knowledge, no investigation on the dynamic control of supplemental lighting intensity for optimised greenhouse cultivation of crop vegetables has been carried out. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of continuous dynamic control of supplemental lighting intensity on electricity consumption of the lighting system and on final fresh weight of lettuce plants grown in greenhouse conditions. To achieve this objective, a dynamic lighting control (DLC) system was developed. The DLC regime was intended to instantaneously compensate for variations of daylight intensity below a defined control threshold level at the plant canopy. Additionally, this would avoid unnecessary supplemental lighting above the defined control threshold level with the aim at achieving energy savings. As reference, two additional lighting systems were used. The reference lighting systems were controlled according to conventional discontinuous on–off regime typically used in greenhouses.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1477153512444064"><title>2.1. Plant material and growth conditions</title>
<p>A growth experiment was carried out in greenhouse conditions at Viikki, Finland (60.228 N, 25.016 E). Lettuce plants (<italic>Lactuca sativa</italic> L. cv. Frillice) were sown in pots (ø 6 cm) filled with peat substrate (B2S, Kekkilä, Finland) on 14 September 2010. After the first true leaves had just opened, the seedlings were placed in a hydroponic growing system under the three lighting treatments for 32 days between 27 September and 28 October 2010. In the hydroponic growing system, fertiliser solution (VihannesSuperEx 9-5-31 NPK, Kekkilä, Finland) with electric conductivity of 1.6 mS/cm was used. White reflective plastics curtains were used to separate the lighting systems and to eliminate the lateral lighting interference between the systems. Analysis of variance was used to test the statistical significance of the fresh weight results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1477153512444064"><title>2.2. Lighting systems</title>
<p>The lettuce plants were grown under three supplemental lighting systems (LED, LED–DLC and HPS). The LED and LED–DLC lighting systems were composed of 36 warm-white (WW) LED modules (13-W Light Line Source L-CM12/L-CM6, Citizen Electronics Co. Ltd, Japan) with correlated colour temperature of 2700 K. The viability of WW LEDs as artificial light source for lettuce growth was successfully tested in our previous research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477153512444064">8</xref></sup> The HPS lighting system was composed of two high-bay luminaires (Cropmaker, Elektro-Valo Oy, Finland) equipped with 400-W HPS lamps (Lucalox™ LU400/XO PSL/T/40, General Electric, USA). The measured relative spectral photon flux distribution curves of the lighting systems used are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1477153512444064">Figure 2</xref>.

</fig></p>
<p>The photoperiod was set to 18 hours light (4:00 AM to 10:00 PM) and 6 hours dark (10:00 PM to 4:00 AM). The maximum average PPFD contribution due to supplemental lighting at the growth area was approximately 150 µmol/m<sup>2</sup>/s. The average PPFD was determined based on measurements at 272 points uniformly distributed over the growth area of 1 m<sup>2</sup> at plant canopy height using a photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) sensor (LI-190SA, LI-COR, USA) connected to a light meter (LI-250A, LI-COR, USA). The measured average photon flux uniformity was approximately 80%. The measurement results of the average PPFD and lighting uniformities at growth areas are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1477153512444064">Table 1</xref>.

<sec id="sec5-1477153512444064"><title>2.3. Control regimes</title>
<p>The LED and HPS lighting systems were used as reference and were conventionally controlled using a discontinuous on–off regime. This discontinuous control regime was based on outside global solar irradiance. The LED and HPS lighting systems were switched off when the outside global solar irradiance exceeded the 270 W/m<sup>2</sup> threshold level. Due to starting limitations of HPS lamps and for reliability reasons, a time delay was included at turn-on and turn-off switching transitions. The regime was implemented using the greenhouse climate control installation (INTÉGRO, PRIVA, the Netherlands).</p>
<p>The light output of the LED–DLC lighting system was continuously controlled in order to maintain a constant PPFD at the plant canopy. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1477153512444064">Figure 3</xref> shows a simplified block diagram of the LED–DLC circuit. The main components of the DLC circuit were the LED array, quantum PAR sensor installed on the top of the luminaire and a programmable microcontroller connected to the pulse width modulation signal input of the constant-current LED drivers. The microcontroller was programmed to proportionally respond to instantaneous variations of the daylight within 0 µmol/m<sup>2</sup>/s to 150 µmol/m<sup>2</sup>/s range at the plants’ canopy height. The objective was to provide a constant PPFD of 150 µmol/m<sup>2</sup>/s during the lighting period at the canopy level when the available solar PPFD was below 150 µmol/m<sup>2</sup>/s. The electrical power demands of the lighting systems were measured and recorded at a time interval of 200 ms using a data acquisition unit (MX100, Yokogawa Electric Corporation, Japan).

<sec id="sec6-1477153512444064"><title>3. Results and discussion</title>
<p>The fresh weight of the plants was measured at the end of the experiment and the respective averages were determined. The HPS plants had the higher fresh weight (219.8 g), followed by the LED (219.0 g) and LED–DLC plants (170.2 g). The average fresh weight of the LED–DLC plants was approximately 22% lower than that of LED and HPS plants. Differences in the fresh weight were highly significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) according to an analysis of variance (SAS GLM procedure). According the Tukey’s studentised range (honestly significant difference) test, the LED–DLC system differed from the HPS and LED systems, but there was no difference between LED and HPS. The HPS and LED systems operated under the same control regime and were equally effective in promoting the fresh weight accumulation of the plants.</p>
<p>The LED–DLC lighting system had the lowest total electricity consumption (206 kWh) at the end of the experiment followed by LED (256 kWh) and HPS (429 kWh). The LED–DLC system consumed 20% less electricity than the LED system without the DLC control (drivers excluded). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the LED and LED–DLC systems in terms of the ratio between the final average fresh weight of the plants and the total electricity consumption. The electricity consumption of the HPS system could not be directly compared to LED and LED–DLC systems due to the different optical (e.g. light spatial distribution profiles) and electrical characteristics as well as the small growth areas used. The plants’ final average fresh weight, total electricity consumption of the lighting systems and their relation (i.e. g/kWh) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1477153512444064">Figure 4</xref>.

</fig></p>
<p>It is known that with a few exceptions, light quality mainly affects the morphological variables of plants, while productivity is mostly affected by changes in light quantity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477153512444064">9</xref></sup> The light quantity can be quantified using the daily photosynthetic photon flux integral (PPFI) at the growth area. The PPFI on the LED and LED–DLC plants was estimated based on the daily electricity consumption due to its direct relation to the photon flux output of the lighting systems, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1477153512444064">Figure 5</xref>. For that, it was assumed that the daylight contribution to the total PPFI was identical in all lighting systems. As such, the 20% lower energy consumption of the LED–DLC system in relation to the LED system has resulted in 20% lower PPFI, which closely matches the differences in the fresh weights of the plants (i.e. 22%). This suggests that the lower average fresh weight of the LED–DLC plants was caused by the smaller daily average PPFI. Moreover, fresh weight accumulation rate of lettuce plants benefits from increases on average PPFD up to 1000 µmol/m<sup>2</sup>/s or on PPFI up to 17 mol/m<sup>2</sup>/day.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512444064">10</xref></sup> For most crops, a 1% light increment results in 0.5% to 1% increase in harvestable product.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153512444064">11</xref></sup> However, this is an average value, which depends on several factors. For instance, the relative effect of light on growth is greater at lower light levels, at higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and at higher temperatures. Theoretically, light levels close to the saturation point of photosynthesis will allow for the maximum biomass accumulation or productivity due to the higher CO<sub>2</sub> fixation rate. The limits are set by the thermodynamic properties of the crop and its environment, namely the intercepted radiation by the plant canopy. According to the Monteith equation, the total dry matter content (biomass) at harvest is closely and linearly correlated with accumulated intercepted solar radiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477153512444064">12</xref></sup>
<fig id="fig5-1477153512444064" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Measured and linear regression curves of total photon flux output emission as a function of the electrical power consumption due to dimming of the LED–DLC lighting system</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1477153512444064-fig5.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Future study should consider the dynamic control of supplemental lighting to be based on the daily PPFI in addition to the instantaneous PPFD. In that way, it can be expected that reductions on electricity consumption due to supplemental lighting are achieved together with maximisation of crop productivity and photosynthesis efficiency. Conversely to cultivation in the open field, in the near future, the lighting conditions in closed environments are expected to be fully controllable. Although technically more challenging, further improvements on the DLC approach may include spectral optimisation considering the local, seasonal and daily variations of the daylight spectrum. LEDs are ideal candidates for the practical implementation of this kind of lighting environment.</p>
<p>The control of supplemental lighting in greenhouses is commonly based on the available global solar irradiance. The daylight availability (i.e. light intensity), among other factors, is influenced by the sky conditions and the period of the year. The cloudiness index, which is given by the ratio of the amount of diffuse to total solar radiation incident on the ground surface,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477153512444064">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477153512444064">14</xref></sup> was used to assess the sky condition. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1477153512444064">Figure 6</xref> is shown the influence of sky conditions (i.e. cloudiness indexes) on electricity consumption of the lighting systems. Both control strategies showed a clear correlation between the daily average cloudiness index and the daily average electricity consumption. The electricity consumptions of the lighting systems were higher under cloudier skies (i.e. higher cloudiness indexes) than under clearer skies (i.e. lower cloudiness indexes). Coincidently, cloudy days are more frequent during the period of the year with the shortest day lengths and lowest solar irradiances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477153512444064">15</xref></sup> to sustain viable crop development. Therefore, this fact reinforces the need to maximise the use of the incoming solar radiation.
<fig id="fig6-1477153512444064" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Variation of daily average cloudiness index (0–8) and electricity consumption of the LED, HPS and LED–DLC lighting systems during the experiment</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1477153512444064-fig6.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>An inverse correlation was found between the cloudiness index and the number of switching transitions resulting from the on–off control regime used with HPS and LED lighting system, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1477153512444064">Figure 7</xref>. Switching transitions were more frequent during partially cloudy than on heavily cloudy days. This was due to the wide amplitude variations of the daylight intensity caused by temporary shadowing effects created by the clouds over the experiment site.
<fig id="fig7-1477153512444064" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Variation of the daily total switching transitions and cloudiness indexes</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1477153512444064-fig7.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>An example of the effects of a partially cloudy day on the number of switching transitions of the HPS system during the photoperiod is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1477153512444064">Figure 8</xref>. During that specific day, 20 switching transitions using the HPS and LED lighting systems were detected. This gives an average of more than one switching transition per hour. At the end of the experiment, the final average daily switching transitions were nine, which correspond to 4.5 switching cycles. This switching cycle rate is more than twice that used to define the nominal lifetime of HPS lamps. It is likely that the stress caused by the frequent ignition on HPS lamps can negatively affect their lifetime, as happens to fluorescent lamps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1477153512444064">16</xref></sup> Moreover, premature failure of the lamp requires more frequent re-lamping, which will increase the maintenance costs and directly affect the system economics and the final production costs.

<p>The DLC regime makes it possible to supplement the rapid variations of the daylight intensity and in that way maximise its usage. The use of a DLC regime in large greenhouses may give the possibility to create a less stressful lighting environment for workers by avoiding abrupt changes on lighting levels due to on–off switching. This situation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1477153512444064">Figure 9</xref>, where the variation of the PPFD at the central point of the LED–DLC growth area was maintained constant in spite of the continuous variations of daylight irradiance.

<p>Lighting simulations of a large greenhouse installation were carried out in order to compare more accurately the energy consumption of HPS and LED systems based on required installed power density. The greenhouse structure was composed of a glass roof, double-sided acrylic walls and total horizontal area of 1000 m<sup>2</sup>. The aimed average PPFD and growth area was 150 µmol/m<sup>2</sup>/s and 800 m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Using the described greenhouse installation, several lighting designs were created and simulated. The best simulation results for each lighting installation was selected based on the lowest installed power density achieved with a minimum lighting uniformity criteria at the growth area of 70%. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477153512444064">Table 2</xref> presents the mounting heights, installed power densities and the lighting uniformities obtained with simulations of the HPS and WW LEDs.

<p>The lighting simulation results showed that at system level, the energy efficiency of the HPS lighting installation (1.099 µmol/J) was approximately 44% more energy-efficient than the WW LED solution (0.619 µmol/J). The results showed also that RB was the most energy-efficient LED combination. However, our previous studies suggest that the RB spectral quality might not be the ultimate LED solution to promote fresh weight accumulation of lettuce plants without daylight. The energy efficiency of the RB LED installation (1.086 µmol/J) was similar to HPS installation (1.099 µmol/J).</p>

<p>Improvement in plant productivity and conversion efficiency of the absorbed radiation into edible biomass may be achievable using appropriate control of light quality, quantity and periodicity. In this paper, the effects of continuous and discontinuous control of supplemental lighting intensity on the fresh weight accumulation of lettuce plants and on electricity consumption of HPS and LED lighting systems were evaluated. One of the advantages of the DLC over the conventional on–off regime is the fast response time to the variations of daylight intensity. Additionally, the continuous operation mode of the DLC regime allows for a more exact compensation for lack of daylight than the on–off control. This feature enhances the electrical power-saving potential of the lighting installation in relation to conventional on–off control. The use of continuous lighting control (LED–DLC) resulted in 20% reduction of the electricity consumption in comparison to similar lighting system operated under discontinuous on–off regime (LED). However, the LED and LED–DLC system performed similarly in terms of average fresh weight of the plants accumulating per unit of electrical energy consumed. These results indicate that further optimisation of the DLC regime is needed in order to reduce electricity consumption, without hindering the productivity of the plants.</p>
<p>In this study, LEDs were indispensable to implement the DLC regime without loss of system reliability. The operation reliability (e.g. lifetime) of conventional high-intensity discharge lamps, such as HPS lamps, can be influenced by the number of switching cycles. The on–off regime used to control the HPS and the LED lighting system had a daily average number of switching transitions twice as high as that used to define the lifetime of HPS lamps. The stress caused by the frequent ignition of HPS lamps can accelerate the depreciation of light output due to the faster electrode deterioration, blackening of the arc tube or changes in ballast electrical performance. Therefore the on–off control regime used in our experiment is not recommended to be used in practical applications for the sake of operation reliability and minimisation of maintenance costs due to re-lamping.</p>
<p>The use of LEDs in horticulture lighting offers novel possibilities of control compared to incumbent lighting technologies. These possibilities include the full digital control of the light quantity, in order to optimise the crop productivity. The digitalisation of lighting allows for the development of more intelligent supplemental lighting systems, which may contribute to a more sustainable year-round production of food in protected and controlled environments. LED technology can contribute to a successful response to these increasingly urgent global needs. In this paper, WW LEDs were confirmed as a viable supplemental photosynthetic light source for lettuce growth. However, the utilisation of WW LEDs in commercial greenhouses will depend on future developments of the LED technology and its related costs. Nevertheless, according to our simulation results, energy-efficient retrofitting of conventional HPS systems for lettuce cultivation will require installed efficacies above 1.1 µmol/J. The RB LED combination was still the most energy-efficient LED solution. However, further studies have to be carried out in order to fully validate the energy efficiency of different LED spectra taking into consideration the productivity and economic viability of retrofitting existing lighting installations with LEDs.</p>
