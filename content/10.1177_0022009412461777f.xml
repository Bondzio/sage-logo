<sec id="sec1-0022009412461777f"><title>Peter Anderson, <italic>The Francoist Military Trials: Terror and Complicity, 1939–1945</italic>, New York, NY: Routledge, 2010; 219 pp.; €95.99 hbk; ISBN 9780415800068</title>
<p>Especially since the early 1990s, Spanish historians have published a vast range of studies on Francoist repression. This research demonstrates that in the Civil War (1936–9) supporters of Franco executed around 75,000 men and women loyal to the Republican Government and killed tens of thousands more after the end of the conflict. Meanwhile, around 50,000 from Franco’s support base lost their lives as a consequence of violence in government controlled territory.</p>
<p>Peter Anderson’s study on the <italic>Francoist Military Trials</italic> during the early years of Francoism emerges from within this new historiography and breaks new ground in a number of ways. First, the author provides a bridge between debates about repression and complicity in European totalitarian regimes and the historiography of the Spanish case. Secondly, his case study focuses on a rural part of Southern Spain: the judicial area of Pozoblanco in the north of Córdoba province. This choice makes his study significant because it allows him to explore issues from a local angle which from a top-down perspective could never have been examined; his chosen rural area with its heterogeneous society in which day labourers, smallholders and large landowners coexisted also stands for many other parts of the still largely rural Spain. Anderson’s book is important too because it does not reduce the analysis to numbers or to the legislation which emanated from the regime. Using the local lens he is able to see the qualitative features of the Francoist repression, and also the real application and consequences of legislation.</p>
<p>The main thesis is that the Francoist regime did not implement its repression alone. Anderson shows that mass prosecutions of defeated supporters of the Republic in military trials, and in some areas nearly 15 per cent of the population came under investigation, depended on the collaboration of significant numbers of the regime’s grassroots followers. The examples analysed by Anderson also demonstrate that both the state personnel and the members of society who participated in the repression were embedded in the political events that took place from the beginning of the twentieth century. The Civil War, however, did form a turning point and by studying grassroots complicity Anderson affirms that the regime’s supporters helped to build Francoism from below.</p>
<p>The first part of this volume illustrates that the Spanish state regularly used violence in the period before the Civil War to keep the country ‘safe’ from its ‘internal foes’ who challenged the inequitable social status quo. The second part focuses on the Civil War, evidencing the features of rebel violence and the killing that took place in the government zone: for the former it examines the rebel self-proclaimed plan of terror, and with regard to the latter Anderson analyses the struggle of the Republican state to bring order in loyalist Spain after the first months of the war. It is in this context that we should understand the birth of the Francoist Military Trials. From November 1936 tribunals worked unflaggingly and continued their labours long after the end of the conflict. Their activity was marked by a complete lack of guarantees. But with his national trial system Franco was able to ‘castigate his enemies and refashion Spanish society while building up his state and presenting his rule as legitimate’ (53). It is in the third part of the book where Anderson demonstrates his thesis. We learn how some Francoists at the grassroots denounced their neighbours and that many did not hesitate to testify against them. Comparing popular participation in repression in Pozoblanco with the Nazi case in Germany, Anderson evidences that the former was even more intense. But that is not all. In the fourth part, the author reflects on the destiny of the punished after they were condemned and even after they were released from jail. The castigated were trapped in a web of repression, suffering the harsh conditions of the prison system, labour battalions or work camps. The granting of parole gave the last word to the same grassroots supporters who had sent them to the dock. And even if they were on parole they and their families felt the effects of the cultural and socioeconomic repression at the local level, being condemned to a ‘civil death’.</p>
<p>Anderson’s book on the repression is valuable for many reasons. But above all, the importance of his work comes in offering a vast range of examples of the qualitative dimension of the Francoist repression. With his focus on the ‘below’, by framing the nature of violence in twentieth-century Spanish history, and by bringing international debates into his research, Anderson shows that the Francoist military tribunals were far more than mere institutions without social participation, and that quite to the contrary of what the Dictatorship’s legislation and propaganda proclaimed, the repression did not wind down after 1941. Rather it became more focused, socially rooted, and did not properly draw to a close until after the end of the Second World War.</p>
