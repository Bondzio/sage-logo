<abstract>
<p>The opportunities and need for interorganizational collaboration in all production sectors have increased markedly over the later part of last century, yet, despite an extensive interorganizational relationships literature, little is still known about the way work is achieved in interorganizational collaborations and teams. Studies have failed to reveal the essence of the collaborative interfirm dynamic; the relationships between operational-level employees and how these are manifested and sustained at an interactional level. This case study of interfirm collaboration in the furniture manufacturing sector in France addresses this gap in the literature by examining the communication processes between the operational-level employees who produce enduring patterns of engagement. The findings reveal how actions are coordinated at the micro level through conversations and, in so doing, clarify how collective competence is formed and becomes stable. The result is a unique contribution to the literatures on interorganizational relationships (IOR) and organizational communication.</p>

<p>The interorganizational relationships (IOR) literature is extensive and expanding, yet Lawrence’s claim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059601112451125">1997</xref>) that little is known about the way work is actually achieved in interorganizational collaborations and teams still applies today. This is despite the possibilities, and in many cases necessity, for interorganizational collaboration in all production sectors increasing markedly over the later part of past century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059601112451125">Hardy, Lawrence, &amp; Grant, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059601112451125">Powell, 1990</xref>) through to the present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1059601112451125">Sanders, Autry, &amp; Gligor, 2011</xref>). We understand the initial agreement to collaborate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059601112451125">Jensen &amp; Meckling, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1059601112451125">Williamson, 1993</xref>), the different categories of interfirm relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1059601112451125">Sako, 1992</xref>), the dynamics of building cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059601112451125">Powell, 1990</xref>) and trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059601112451125">Bachmann &amp; Inkpen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059601112451125">Bachmann &amp; Zaheer, 2008</xref>), the relationship between contracts and trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1059601112451125">Vlaar, 2008</xref>), the interperson dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059601112451125">Dwyer, Schurr, &amp; Oh, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1059601112451125">Uzzi, 1997</xref>), the increasingly electronic nature of IOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059601112451125">Grover &amp; Saeed, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1059601112451125">Sanders et al., 2011</xref>), and the choices for interfirm information systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059601112451125">Hu, Sun, Zhao, &amp; Zhao, 2011</xref>). However, studies so far have failed to fully illuminate the heart of the collaborative interfirm dynamic, the relationships between operational-level employees, and how these are manifested and sustained at a microinteractional level at the interfirm interface.</p>
<p>This article addresses this gap in the literature using two real-life cases of interfirm conversation drawn from an ethnographic study of the communication processes of operational-level employees at the interface between French furniture manufacturers and a logistics (i.e., transport or conveyor) firm. It explores what is constituted in the flow of interfirm communication that enables collaboration and creates processes and practices that produce conditions for efficient collective action.</p>
<p>Our findings, which show how employees coordinate their actions at this micro level not only make a unique contribution to the IOR and organizational communication literatures but also provide valuable insights for managers wishing to encourage collective competence at an operational level. We reveal how interorganization relationships operate through conversations between the operators and, in so doing, clarify how collective competence is formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059601112451125">Cooren, Kuhn, Cornelissen, &amp; Clark, 2011</xref>), becomes stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601112451125">Cooren &amp; Fairhurst, 2009</xref>), and articulates with the purpose, control, and permanence afforded by the top-down structures of the participating firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059601112451125">Ackoff, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1059601112451125">Weick (1993)</xref> addressed the dynamics of relationships in an organization, asserting the essentially social nature of how sense is made of these relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601112451125">Weick, 1995</xref>, pp. 38-43 ) and the centrality of communication to organizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1059601112451125">Weick, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601112451125">1995</xref>), he does not provide a theory of communication to interpret the numerous phenomena he addresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059601112451125">Cooren, 2004</xref>). It seems the development of a theory of the microdynamics of organizing as afforded by an interpersonal communication focus has not been a significant focus in organizational studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059601112451125">Kreps, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059601112451125">Larkin &amp; Larkin, 1996</xref>), despite considerable research on such intraorganizational microcommunication issues as effective interpersonal communication and communication skills, superior–subordinate relationships, and influence tactics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601112451125">Jones, Watson, Gardner &amp; Gallois, 2004</xref>, p. 732). In contrast, at the interorganizational level, the microcommunication processes have taken a back seat to more macro-level concerns such as interorganizational networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601112451125">Jones et al., 2004</xref>, p. 731). This paucity of micro-level interorganizational communication literature was a significant factor in the decision to locate our study of IOR in the interpersonal communication at the operational interface and look to François Cooren’s work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601112451125">Cooren, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059601112451125">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059601112451125">2010</xref>) for inspiration.</p>
<p>The article begins by reviewing investigations into organizational communication, such as those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1059601112451125">Taylor (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601112451125">Cooren (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059601112451125">2010)</xref>, which have confirmed the value of studying collective intelligence phenomena that contribute to the construction of collective competence and also provide the justification for focusing on language in action to study social processes. A methodological section then describes the research design used for the two illustrative cases of interfirm collaboration presented in this article. The article concludes by discussing the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings from these cases in light of the aforementioned literature.</p>

<title>Collective Competence: The Product of Collaborative Action</title>
<p>Collective competencies are shared products of collaborative action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059601112451125">Bitencourt &amp; Bonotto, 2010</xref>), built through the communication involved in interactions between collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059601112451125">Cooren, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059601112451125">Cooren, Taylor, &amp; Van Emery, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601112451125">Cooren (2000)</xref> maintains that even minimal coordination through language implies performing a set of speech acts aimed at establishing and carrying out programs or action plans, while constructing and consolidating the meaning implied in the situation. Thus, language does not simply describe situations in the world; it also <italic>creates</italic> situations that structure our social world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059601112451125">Cooren &amp; Matte, 2010</xref>). It talks this world into being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059601112451125">Heritage, 1984</xref>). For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601112451125">Cooren (2000)</xref>, coordination is a process (that includes speech acts and physical acts) for organizing activities between individuals (including the involvement of instruments or “tools”) over time. Optimally, this process gets organized into a sequence of actions that result in the accomplishment of specific objectives.</p>
<p>The narrative schemas identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059601112451125">Greimas (1988)</xref> in tales and stories provide a useful starting point to analyze these sequences of actions. Cooren refers to four: manipulation, competence, performance, and sanction. In the social and organizational universe (rather than just the world of the narrative), individuals implicitly apply such schemas in the course of their everyday interactions. They use speech acts and physical acts to construct and implement action programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601112451125">Cooren, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The “manipulation” stage amounts to formulating an objective to be attained and then getting someone to take action to achieve this objective. The manipulation creates an imbalance between the people involved in the conversation because only one of them is required to undertake one or more tasks. Once the other person has been drawn into the action schema, the “competence” stage begins. In this stage, the subject (i.e., the person who has been induced to act) encounters setbacks (e.g., specific problems such as uncooperative individuals or equipment breakdowns) and is assisted (e.g., by colleagues or by acquiring new information). The competence stage thus involves a series of mutual changes of position.</p>
<p>In the third stage, “performance,” the subject either obtains the desired object (i.e., finds a solution) or fails. This stage is the realization of the action for which the first two stages paved the way. The action program then ends with “sanctions.” In most cases, these are embodied in the use of expressions like “thank you” or a reward. These settle the transactional debt created, for example, by asking a colleague for an explanation during the manipulation stage.</p>
<p>From this perspective, any conversation brings action programs into play. These give structure to the communication and reveal heterogeneous collectives, collectives with both human and nonhuman components. It is these collectives that achieve the action. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059601112451125">Greimas (1988)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601112451125">Cooren (2000)</xref>, in his theory of organizational action, assert narrative sequences are useful for the analysis of conversations because they shed light on moments of domination and/or of cooperation and the way the actions of the collectives’ members within the various conversations are interrelated. Thus, Cooren’s theory is highly relevant to the interpretation of the social dynamics of collaboration, such as those occurring during interfirm collaboration. However, this theory is less illuminating about how to manage such collectives and says little about the specific products resulting from this collaborative process.</p>
<p>Collective activity is not a new topic in the literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1059601112451125">Taylor (1911)</xref> addressed such activity, albeit from the perspective of each individual distributed along a production line, when developing his scientific organization of work, but little importance was placed on issues such as how to manage collective actions. Today, the perspective has changed as scholars and managers come to appreciate the centrality of collective actions to organizational processes and try to develop ways to maximize the collective competence that is an outcome of this collective action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059601112451125">Hutchins, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059601112451125">Orlikowski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1059601112451125">Quinn &amp; Worline, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Ruuska and Teigland describe collective competence as “a group’s ability to work together towards a common goal and results in the creation of a collective outcome, an outcome that could not be accomplished by one member alone due to its complexity” (p. 324). This competence integrates both practical and interpersonal competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059601112451125">Boreham, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1059601112451125">Ruuska &amp; Teigland, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1059601112451125">Whitley, 2003</xref>), to produce outcomes that belong to the collective.</p>
<p>Scholars have studied collective competence in terms of it being a stock of resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059601112451125">Boreham, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059601112451125">Krohmer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1059601112451125">Michaux, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059601112451125">Nordhaug &amp; Grenhaug, 1994</xref>). For instance, Michaux defines a collective competence as a set of “tacit, shared and complementary knowledge and know-how” (p. 8). Similarly, Krohmer proposes that collective competence is a “set of resources used by a group in order to deal with a specific situation” (p. 53). From these perspectives, members of a group purportedly share resources such as trust, a common operational language, and collective forms of representation. Such studies are in line with Boreham, who argues that competence should be regarded as an attribute of groups, teams, and communities. He proposes a theory of collective competence in terms of (a) making collective sense of events in the workplace, (b) forming and using a collective knowledge base, and (c) developing a sense of interdependency.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1059601112451125">Tompkins (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059601112451125">Orlikowski (2002)</xref> clarify the notion of collective competence further by adding a collective learning aspect. Tompkins studied the critical nature of diffusion in understanding the link between individual and collective competence. He found contemporary workers operate in dynamic environments that require them to actively and rapidly acquire knowledge and skills and share or construct such learning with others. Orlikowski shows that the competence “to achieve global product development” is both collective and grounded in the everyday practices of organizational members. She suggests that knowing is not a static embedded capability or stable disposition of actors but rather an ongoing social construction.</p>
<p>Although many studies have clarified the notion of collective competence, the underlying social and communicational processes are often understated. This is surprising given the consensus that collective competence is an ability that has been established and stabilized through collaborative social engagement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601112451125">Cooren (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059601112451125">2004)</xref> and other communication scholars’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059601112451125">Ashcraft, Kuhn, &amp; Cooren, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059601112451125">Fairhurst &amp; Putnam, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059601112451125">Putnam &amp; Nicotera, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601112451125">Putnam &amp; Pacanowsky, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1059601112451125">Taylor &amp; Van Every, 2000</xref>) concept of communicative constitution of organization (CCO) provides guidance for addressing this blind spot (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059601112451125">Cooren et al., 2011</xref>, for a comprehensive examination of this perspective). CCO proposes that what individuals say to each other as they communicate has constitutive power in a variety of ways. For instance, words frame the context in which they are then interpreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059601112451125">Bean &amp; Hamilton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059601112451125">Fairhurst, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059601112451125">Mills, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601112451125">Weick, 1995</xref>). At the same time, they socially construct participants’ relationships by calling upon particular identities and circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059601112451125">Barge &amp; Fairhurst, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1059601112451125">Mills, 2010</xref>) and bringing these to bear on the task at hand. What has not been examined, however, is how this occurs in the interface created by collaborating firms. It is this interface that the study in this article addresses. In doing this, the authors acknowledge that this interface is intimately linked to the “organization as institution”—the top-down influences that provide purpose, control, and permanence to any productive system. According to Ackoff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059601112451125">1999</xref>, pp. 334-335), without this central authority chaos would ensue.</p>

<title>The Interface: The French Furniture Industry</title>
<p>The French furniture industry emerged as an industry in the 1960s only to face considerable competition as significant volumes of furniture from foreign manufacturers’ started arriving in France. French furniture manufacturers were forced to update their production facilities and rethink their distribution processes. New ways of organizing work, including the personalizing of logistics services, were required. The precondition for such development was the establishment of more intense collaboration—a densification of the interfirm interface between manufacturer and distribution provider. Today, this interface provides an ideal site for studying interfirm collective action.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1059601112451125" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Our purpose was to understand how interfirm relationships are organized through discursive processes in order to achieve coordinated action. This meant we needed to examine the relational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059601112451125">Gergen, 2009</xref>) as well as conversational world at the interfirm interface in order to tap into these discursive processes. An ethnographic approach provided the framework for doing this, allowing us to engage with our subjects and experience their conversations <italic>in situ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601112451125">Golden-Biddle &amp; Locke, 1993</xref>) in a way that revealed how their understandings were created and played out in practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059601112451125">Ahrens &amp; Mollona, 2007</xref>, p. 312). An ethnographic approach ensured these conversations were gathered alongside thick descriptions of everyday life and the culture that supports it at the interface, thus allowing us to “uncover and explicate the ways in which people in particular work settings come to understand, account for, take action, and otherwise manage their day-to-day situation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1059601112451125">Van Maanen, 1979</xref>, p. 540). In other words, ethnography gave us access to “how things work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1059601112451125">Van Maanen, 2011</xref>, p. 218) in a highly situated and holistic manner.</p>
<p>Observations of workers from the furniture manufacturing and logistics firms were gathered using an observational framework developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059601112451125">Journé (2005)</xref>. This framework identifies four observation modalities, distinguished by the length of the observation period (long or short) and the observer’s position (variable or fixed). Over a 2-year period, the first author spent prolonged periods in the field making all four types of observation as well as conversing with workers and examining artifacts such as documents (e.g., profitability indicators for each trip, quality indicator sheets, and forms recording malfunction codes) and other aspects of the physical environment.</p>
<p>Scattered through this field work were 35 in-depth interviews averaging 75 min in duration. These explored both workers’ operational reality and how partnerships between the firms were represented by managers and employees from the interacting firms. These interviews allowed the significance of the researcher’s observations and workers’ experiences to be explored and accounted for. Interviewing ceased when nothing new emerged from the associated analyses, a strategy consistent with the notion of “saturation”—a concept commonly associated with the grounded theory approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601112451125">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Conversation and interview transcripts and observational notes were coded and connected using NVivo7 software to create a comprehensive and integrated account of the interfirm collaboration. By coding contextual elements, accounts gathered through interviews, and conversational data we were able to integrate into the analysis participants’ rationalizations (e.g., the reduction of stock volumes as a result of endeavors to follow the “just in time” management approach) and circumstantial factors that were making the interface between the firms relatively more fragile and requiring the firms to intensify the interface interaction. For instance, we were able to take into account the contributor to this interactional densification—the introduction of tracking software that enhanced the possibilities for exchanging computerized data.</p>

<title>Findings and Discussion</title>
<p>In this part of the article we restrict our focus to findings from the analysis of two conversations between operational staff from three organizations—a transport firm, a furniture manufacturer, and a furniture retailer—which were at the center of the study. These conversations were chosen to illustrate the valuable insights our study produced with regard to the communication dynamics of interest and their stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601112451125">Cooren &amp; Fairhurst, 2009</xref>) and how these dynamics contribute to collective competence. The two conversations, together with the descriptions of the circumstances in which they were embedded, show the role of conversations in the construction and operation of interorganizational relationships at the operational level.</p>

<p>The first conversation (Conversation 1, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059601112451125">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059601112451125">2</xref>) takes place between employees of two firms, which we have called OUESTRANSPORT and CALBERFRANCE. The person referred to as the “Operations Manager” represents the furniture transport company (OUESTRANSPORT) where he works, and the person labeled the “client” represents the furniture manufacturer (CALBERFRANCE). CALBERFRANCE is one of the transport firm’s regular, very active clients. This collaboration was one of the transport firm’s first to be formalized by a contract that specified the broad outline of how the partnership would operate. In that respect, the contract’s structure gave formal expression to the service relationship forged by the two firms’ senior managers. The prescriptive aspects of the contract suggest that the operators’ work involves simply validating, verifying, and implementing decisions made by the companies’ managements. In fact, unpredictable complications during deliveries or reloading (e.g., accidents, a delay during one delivery that causes delays in subsequent deliveries, breakages or shortages discovered while making a delivery) seriously undermine attempts to prescribe work activity. The type of flexibility that is achieved through human rather than information system is needed to sort out such day-to-day complications. The workers achieve this flexibility through their spoken interactions in the course of their routine work. To understand the realities of the collaboration therefore means shifting attention from the firms’ senior management perspective to that of the operational collective. Far from being a single and straightforward job of verification and planning, the operators from the partner organizations apply a collective competence to achieve their companies’ objectives.</p>

<p>The two parties involved in the conversation reported below have already worked together. The existing knowledge, which varies in completeness between the participants according to the system in which each is working, affects the way the collective performs. In this conversation, the various stages in the narrative and the action programs (APs), which are easily observable, are specified.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1059601112451125">1</xref></sup> At each stage, specific forms of action can be taken to support and manage the dynamics of the relationship between the two firms (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059601112451125">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059601112451125">2</xref>).</p>
<p>In our analysis we asked the following questions: What is going on in this conversation? Just the simple execution of a commercial contract entered into by the two organizations where these operators are employed? The conventional adoption of a subordinate role by a service provider when dealing with a client? A moment when both partners contribute to building the quality of the service? Is the outcome the result of a previously constructed mode of behavior applying to both participants?</p>
<p>The conversation begins with the usual presentation of the speakers and the firms they belong to. In Line 3, Jean-Luc (JL), the Operations Manager (OM), recognizes his client, Leila from CALBERFRANCE. It is clearly the tone of her voice that allows JL to identify his interlocutor. This shows that there have been previous interactions and that they already know each other. In contrast in Line 12, when Leila tells JL that she has been contacted by (someone from) OUESTRANSPORT the day before, she doesn’t use any name. In doing this, she highlights the very impersonal nature of that relationship, which is clearly not mirrored in the relationship between herself and JL. Indeed, in Line 10, she explains her problem to JL by using the words “Because she pissed me off,” which reveal a high degree of intimacy between these two actors despite the fact they don’t belong to the same company. Such colloquial informal language was frequently observed in the conversations collected, suggesting a high level of rapport and informality between the manufacturer’s and conveyor’s employees. Both sets of employees also use the term “client” to mean the consignee, suggesting both firms’ employees were on the same team serving someone else, in this case the consignee TOAST AND CHOCOLATE.</p>
<p>This interpersonal alignment can be partly explained by the respective firms’ managers’ desire to create very strong links between employees who cooperate everyday at the interfirm interface. The operational manager of the conveyor OUESTRANSPORT explains:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is a specific state of mind within this furniture industry. Our clients [manufacturers] like having a specific person here. This is why we very quickly divided France into areas, so that people call the right place. We really customized our service. They call each other by their real name! We have a very close relationship.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such organization encourages the realization of the manipulation phase, which is the phase through which people engage other people in the realization of action. When clients call their conveyor, they know where they are calling. They know they are calling the person they need. This proximity between manufacturers and conveyors makes “a couple” that is very often aligned against the consignee. Consignees are often considered as playing a negative role in this three-way collaboration process (i.e., manufacturer–conveyor–consignee triad). This can be explained by the fact that the consignee’s employees often refuse to cooperate by insisting on their authority as “client.” In Lines 12 and 14, Leila explains the whole situation to JL. The tone and pace of her voice suggest that the conversation with the consignee did not go smoothly. Leila didn’t like the way the consignee’s employee talked to her. This woman preferred to use her authority with Leila rather than get involved in the problem resolution process and inquire about the situation. By doing this, the consignee gets stigmatized by Leila and perhaps by JL. In this situation, the difficulty in creating a specific relation skill can be explained by the consignee’s lack of commitment in the coproduction process. It is this commitment that is valued by operators and contributes to the achievement of naturally occurring talk-based interactions. When people did not accept the simultaneous conception of the service being enacted, then we sometimes observed operations of “sabotage” by operators (e.g., delaying a delivery because a manufacturer or consignee didn’t get fully involved within the interactions but rather used their authority).</p>
<p>In Line 17, while waiting for his software to be ready, JL questions Leila about the weekly collection. Leila’s answer clearly indicates that she, as well as her company (“we”), knows OUESTRANSPORT’s ways of working. This is why they did not plan any furniture for collection (see Lines 18 and 21).</p>
<p>Lines 30 and 31 illustrate the use of what is referred to elsewhere as a “ritual joke” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059601112451125">Collinson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1059601112451125">Trice &amp; Beyer, 1984</xref>). “Last time” refers to an unfortunate event 2 years earlier when a truck driver making a delivery in Nantes town center with a two-trailer truck was stuck in the middle of a main street for 4 hr, unable to move. This caused traffic in the town center to stop. Since this day, references to this unfortunate event are regularly made by Leila and JL to indicate in a lighthearted way that a situation is fairly complex and collective competence is required.</p>
<p>In Line 27, because the software doesn’t give any useful information, JL decides to call AGEDIS, a small company within OUESTRANSPORT that is dedicated to a very up-market consignee. In Line 28, Leila does not understand why JL wants to phone AGEDIS since she told him (Line 12) that AVM44 was the one concerned. This shows again that she knows how OUESTRANSPORT usually works. We then learn that a new procedure has been implemented within OUESTRANSPORT, as explained by JL’s colleague:
<disp-quote>
<p>We have been told not to phone AGEDIS’ subcontractor any more but AGEDIS itself. The problem now is that it constitutes another intermediary and the client has to wait while AGEDIS is getting information!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This new procedure directly influences the way interactions are articulated (i.e., the structure of the action program) and imposes a new helper who may not be the most efficient one within the action program.</p>
<p>JL phones AGEDIS, but the right person is not available. He will have to call back later.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1059601112451125">2</xref></sup> Thirty minutes later, Delphine from AGEDIS calls JL back. She hasn’t any information on her computer. She has got to phone AVM 44. In a few minutes, Delphine phones back again. She informs JL that delivery is planned for 11.30 am because the consignee TOAST AND CHOCOLATE is not supposed to be open before 10 a.m. JL phones Leila and then accomplishes the action program opened by the client (as indicated in Line 45). Finally, Leila rewards JL (Line 52).</p>
<p>The case reveals that the two participants in the conversation are “macro-actors,” speaking on behalf of several collectives. The computers and the work of individuals who provided information for these are, in principle, simple intermediaries or tools, merely aids that nobody talks about. Nonetheless, like the senior managers, they play an essential role in ensuring that the interaction proceeds smoothly. For example, the client calls JL (OUESTRANSPORT’s OM) because of the existence of a commercial relationship between the two firms that is formalized by the contractual agreements signed by senior managers from their respective firms. Similarly, the OM’s log acts as a physical aid that contributes to the way he carries out his work. The contract and the log both illustrate how human beings and nonhumans’ become instruments intrinsic to an organizational process, which is a joint operation of a number of action programs. We found there are always numerous action programs operating, some more obvious than others, but they were all necessary conditions for the collaborative action to be successfully achieved.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601112451125">Cooren’s (2000)</xref> theory elucidates the dynamics of such interactions, drawing our attention to communication and its ability to draw on various physical and discursive objects (e.g., contracts, individuals, and assisting objects, together with speech acts) to achieve interaction and build successful collaborative relationships. The performance of the schema initiated by the client in the example above, therefore, rests on the intervention of a heterogeneous group of players whose individual characteristics had to be combined and coordinated so the participants become collectively competent. Achieving the action program initiated by the client then depended on the combined performances of each player in the main action program (OM, computer, service provider’s log, and various parties implicitly drawn on in the client firm). It also depended on the OM’s ability to respond, using the computer to supply the elements of a reply and, finally, the client’s ability to locate in her firm (CALDERFRANCE) the goods for dispatch. This being the case, the communication reveals a number of collectives: an individual and objects collective (AP2), the subsidiary’s organizational collective (AP3), and an interorganizational collective (AP1). It is their cooperation that allowed the situation to be resolved and the logistical service to be jointly built.</p>
<p>Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059601112451125">Boreham (2004)</xref>, we observed that these two operational-level employees (i.e., JL and Leila) made collective sense of events in their workplace because the activities they were required to undertake are highly interdependent. As Boreham, among other scholars, notes, the collective competence relies on shared resources (e.g., style of talk, trust, commitment, and collective learning) that have been collaboratively developed and used by actors. Individuals use these collaborative abilities and knowledge of how to get the other person to act. These abilities and knowledge supplement individuals’ practical knowledge and interpersonal skills, which are also necessary components that allow individuals to act within their collective.</p>
<p>What would have happened if the OM had not understood the way his client was talking and had objected to the way the client questioned him, and more generally his organization? The interaction would most likely have been unsuccessful. Our observations suggests that the speech qualities (i.e., rhythm, intonation, and style) of the language used in conversations are central to ensuring that interactants understand each other and collaboration results. This is supported by findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059601112451125">Hardy et al.’s (2005)</xref> investigation of the construction of a collective identity in the context of interorganizational relationships, which focused on <italic>cooperative</italic> and <italic>assertive</italic> styles of talk and showed how the success of a conversation (and, thus, of the collaboration) resulted from the creation of a tension between the two speech styles. Thus, if the conversation between the two partners was only of the cooperative type, it would be difficult for each of the participants to express their (possibly conflicting) points of view and, in part, promote their own interests. This conclusion is consistent with the results of empirical studies carried out on the notion of trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1059601112451125">Nugent &amp; Abolafia, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1059601112451125">Vlaar, Van den Bosch, &amp; Volberda, 2007</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059601112451125">Brulhart (2005)</xref> proposes interpersonal relationships might sometimes prevent people saying things to each other, leading to poor performance in the collaboration. They show that, although assertiveness is certainly an important factor in how interorganizational relationships operate, some individuals do not want to risk offending the other person by stressing their own position. Instead, they choose to minimize their assertiveness. Unfortunate or unsatisfactory decisions may result when they do this. The participants must therefore be able to be assertive and also demonstrate an ability to listen to the other person rather than adopting an attitude of dependence on the contractual situation and refusing to listen to the arguments of the person in the dependent position (the OM in our conversation). Only then will they be able to understand the other person’s priorities.</p>
<p>In the case we are examining here, the prior construction of symbolic artifacts, such as trust, allow the participants to retain modes of behavior jointly constructed over the course of past conversations and keep restoring these within the context of the current conversation. An employee at CALBERFRANCE, when talking about the communication environment shared with Jean-Luc, illustrates this point:
<disp-quote>
<p>With OUESTRANSPORT, if Jean-Luc has a problem with something that involves me, he will call me and we’ll sort it out together. There’s no point in worrying everybody when we can avoid other people suffering fallout from the situation. We don’t have a problem with that; we trust each other. Each of us trusts the other. I would say that if, one day, either I or Jean-Luc did something stupid, we’d sort it out. We’ll do everything necessary to sort things out so that nobody else need know about it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This artifact served as a basis upon which these two participants could ground their current action and is likely to prove useful in future interactions. Such (implicitly agreed) constructions are fostered when interlocutors have similar socioprofessional experiences and serve to foster unity in their actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059601112451125">Detchessahar, 1998</xref>). Interviews with these two operational-level employees revealed they were in very similar ages and were born and raised in the geographic area where their respective companies are based. They attended the same logistics college and were both hired by their current employers straight from college. Such similar backgrounds appear to facilitate the construction of collective competence by providing similar “habitus” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059601112451125">Bourdieu, 1980</xref>), where habitus is a set of acquired patterns of thought, behavior, and taste resulting from the internalization of culture or objective social structures through the experience of an individual or group.</p>
<p>Overall, the analysis of conversation reveals the workers know each other well. They know their partner’s concrete patterns of work and share ways of using resources, such as the tracking software. They also share expectations and reinforce these by jointly stigmatizing those who do not respect their expectations about the collaboration. Shared knowledge and expectations mean these workers are able to act as innovators, creating resources to help the collaboration process and facilitate adaption to changing circumstances. The result is an atmosphere of kindness and trust. All these elements, built by and through communicational activity, help to establish and maintain a certain level of service quality.</p>
<p>Both collaborators consider they are interacting with a quality operator who is able to appreciate the other firm’s needs. There is also a feeling of transparency and security in their relationship. Since these notions of adaptability, quality, and security are at the heart of the current expectations of logistic services by furniture manufacturers, they constitute central resources on which further relational competence can be developed. Furthermore, these resources are positive and reduce ambiguity, so they support individual and collective actions that make the interfirm collaboration more efficient and stable. They are also productions of prior interactions and, as such, have been used as a scaling-up mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601112451125">Cooren &amp; Fairhurst, 2009</xref>) and provide proof of a collective competence between these two organizations.</p>
<p>To reinforce the persuasiveness of our conclusions about how collective competence is created and sustained, we will now present another conversation that demonstrates the negative consequences of an unsuccessful first interaction. This conversation shows what happens when there is an absence of adaptability, quality, and security and, thus, collective competence between two operational-level employees at the interfirm interface. Owing to spatial constraints we focus our analysis on a specific point in the interaction. As collaboration “depends on the dynamics of the interactions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059601112451125">Cooren et al., 2006</xref>, p. 4), we will illustrate the establishment of a vicious circle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1059601112451125">Vlaar et al., 2007</xref>) in this specific case of interfirm collaboration, in which the first interaction between two employees who will have to work together in the long term produces negative resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1059601112451125">Nugent &amp; Abolafia, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Conversation 2: When the First Interaction Goes Badly</title>
<p>As explained, the transport firm (OUESTRANSPORT) loads furniture in Week 1 and delivery occurs in Week 2. In order to structure the organization of the deliveries, some furniture retailers require transport companies to make an appointment 1 week beforehand. The following two-part exchange involves three employees: Jean-Luc, the OM from OUESTRANSPORT; an unnamed employee; and Marek from the furniture retailer MEUBLESMARCHÉ (MM). This second case shows the consequence of a lack of commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1059601112451125">Quinn &amp; Dutton, 2005</xref>) to the collaborative dynamic between these two organizations’ employees.</p>
<p>Lines 5 and 8 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1059601112451125">Table 3</xref> show that JL, the Operations Manager (OM), had already constructed a specific relationship with Jean who used to work at the reception desk of MEUBLESMARCHÉ. In Line 7, JL tries to find out more about Jean’s departure as getting information about why Jean doesn’t work there anymore would help him understand what is going on in this company: Not much is said, so JL is left to speculate about the implications of Jean’s departure for the ongoing relationship between the companies.</p>

<p>The conversation in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1059601112451125">Table 3</xref> with Jean’s replacement, Marek, highlights a lack of rigor and commitment from Marek. This response leads JL to mistrust Marek and perhaps, as a result, his company. Indeed, in Lines 14 to 16, while trying to agree upon a day for this delivery, Marek proposes (too) quickly, “OK, so come Wednesday then, no problem.” Marek does not appear to note down the appointment plus he seems to want to end the conversation as fast as possible.</p>
<p>This conversation was the first of probably many between JL and Marek. Unfortunately, the way the conversation took place suggests that the collaborative framework that emerges will be based on distrust. Marek and JL do not really engage in collective sense making to deal with the situation. They do not collaborate in the formation of positive resources on which they could rely in future interactions, perhaps because Marek does not appreciate the interdependency of his furniture company and the transport provider. JL is prompted to ask for his interlocutor’s name to protect his company should Marek’s lack of a sense of interdependency bring negative consequences. In a subsequent conversation with the researcher he explains:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t really like it when people say, “OK, so come such and such a day then, no problem.” You see, the guy just said “Wednesday,” but he didn’t write it anywhere. So, you see, they ask us to make an appointment, but this guy wrote nothing down. That’s why I asked for his name. This way, the guy is a little bit more involved with me. Otherwise, my driver arrives in and they say, “There is no appointment, we can’t take the furniture!” So, I write, “OK with Marek” on the order, so nobody can deny it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is an example of how negative resources like distrust and omission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059601112451125">Ariño, 2001</xref>) are generated. These could lead to acts of sabotage, which may in turn lead to retaliatory measures that put the contractual agreement in jeopardy, if employees from partner organizations do not jointly recognize and value their interdependency. Acts of sabotage by operations managers when furniture retailers or manufacturers did not appear to be showing sufficient commitment to the coproduction of the service were observed. Such acts included delaying a delivery because a manufacturer or consignee didn’t behave cooperatively during interfirm interactions, choosing instead to invoke their authority. Such micro-level failures can have macro-level consequences by establishing inefficient collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601112451125">Cooren &amp; Fairhurst, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Implications for Theory and Practice</title>
<p>We chose the notion of collective competence as a starting point for understanding our data because they captured the essence of the interfirm collaboration we observed. This collaboration was a consequence of the dynamic interplay between all of the interrelated elements in a collective composed of heterogeneous resources, some human, others symbolic, and still other material resources upon which it was possible for employees at the interfirm interface to act. Our findings suggest that within this collective, the conversational activity of the people involved, understood both in information transmission terms and as a central process in the generation of knowledge, produces the connection between these various resources that in turn builds a symbolic framework for communication. This framework, just like the resources of which it is composed, develops in the course of the participants’ successive interactions and by incorporating new interactants or through the implementation of new management tools. New resources, such as trust or mistrust, are created and incorporated into the social stock of collective competence.</p>
<p>At an interorganizational level, such collective competence is related to, and interdependent with, the competencies of operational-level individuals and work teams and the organization as institution (i.e., formal structure composed of contracts, policies, rules, and procedures). Our analysis of the microdynamics at the operational level suggests that collective competence is a heterogeneous resource that straddles the human, symbolic, and material elements that constitute the interfirm space and is built through emergent communication activities. Its significance lies in the way it shows how resources created through interfirm conversations account for the dynamic and systematic emergence and refinement of collaborative competence and are dialectically related to the material circumstances of the interface. At the same time this analysis links the emergence of collective competence to the institutional side of the participating firms (e.g., norms, expectations, policies, procedures, and contracts; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059601112451125">Ackoff, 1999</xref>) to provide a multilayered account of effective collective action at the interfirm interface.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest interfirm collaboration must be understood more as an ongoing social process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059601112451125">Asanuma, 1989</xref>) between a client and a supplier that reveals and constructs the partnership through every interaction. From this perspective, interfirm collaborative cannot be defined <italic>ex ante</italic> (i.e., forecast in advance), but this does not mean that nothing can or should be done before and after interaction occurs. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059601112451125">Chandler (1977)</xref>, we believe the influence of managers who negotiate the interfirm contracts and develop the formal structures to comply with these cannot be overlooked.</p>
<p>Our analysis shows that trust is not only important between the CEOs or senior managers who establish a collaboration but that it is also a very important concern at the operational level where employees from collaborating firms interact. Our findings suggest trust can be construed as a local production too, constructed by actors as they face emerging issues together. It is subsequently tested and potentially enriched through every interaction. The quality of the dialogue that interpersonal interaction supports has a significant impact on how well an organization operates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059601112451125">Larkin &amp; Larkin, 1996</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section8-1059601112451125">
<title>Reflecting on Cooren’s Approach</title>
<p>Cooren’s treatment of issues of collective intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059601112451125">Cooren, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1059601112451125">Quinn &amp; Dutton, 2005</xref>) provides scholars with a useful framework to analyze conversations, by revealing the heterogeneity of collective action in terms of human and nonhuman actors. It also serves to illustrate the communicational dynamic of collaboration through time and space via the scaling-up mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601112451125">Cooren &amp; Fairhurst, 2009</xref>). However, collective intelligence phenomena have mainly been studied through extraordinary conversations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059601112451125">Cooren &amp; Fairhurst, 2004</xref>) or board meetings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059601112451125">Cooren, 2004</xref>), in line with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059601112451125">Boden, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1059601112451125">Weick &amp; Roberts, 1993</xref>). Similarly, the related concept, <italic>collective mind</italic>, has mainly been investigated in rare circumstances (e.g., navigating a navy vessel; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059601112451125">Hutchins, 1995</xref>), as a one-shot process (e.g., the Mann Gulch disaster; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1059601112451125">Weick, 1993</xref>), and sometimes between people who did not know each other before and will probably never have to work together in the future (e.g., the real estate agent and customer; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059601112451125">Cooren, 2004</xref>). Our findings suggest that to focus on extraordinary or rare situations overlooks the temporal dynamic of interaction in the analysis and, in so doing, neglects a key aspect of collective competence, particularly in more routine operational situations. If the notion of scaling up from interaction to organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601112451125">Cooren &amp; Fairhurst, 2009</xref>) encompasses temporal and spatial dynamics, it fails to capture the established and stabilized competence that will evolve through ongoing interaction and by any new management action. Such competence belongs to a group and, as our findings suggest, is constructed over time not only by members of this group through knowledge and resources they have constructed but also by managers during process definition, recruitment, group design, and tool implementation. By stating that “the organizational world appears to be spatially and temporally ordered not because of a sui generis entity called ‘organization’, which would structure its own activities a priori, but by the human and nonhuman interactants who not only contribute to its orderly emergence but also re-present it,” we believe that Cooren and Fairhurst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059601112451125">2004</xref>, p. 815) tend to underestimate managers’ capacity to influence interactions in more everyday situations at an operational level.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1059601112451125">Varey (2006)</xref> maintains, managerial implications do not seem to be a concern of the organizational communication perspective. Considering organization as something that emerges from interaction, scholars often underestimate what has been constructed and what can be implemented by managers to contribute to the realization of organization through interaction. For instance, in the first conversation we examined in this article, trust between the two employees is certainly a product of previous interaction, but this trust might also be explained by the similarity in the participants’ socioprofessional background, which has led to a similar habitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059601112451125">Bourdieu, 1980</xref>) of these two actors. Managers are likely to have designed their interfirm operational collectives with this similarity in mind. Agency, though local in many respects, is also partially thought and structured a priori and can be improved by managers’ actions. From this perspective, the notion of collective competence implies that collaboration is a dual process: Managers give employees autonomy to create their own action programs and interactional resources <italic>and</italic> build an a priori frame to structure action programs. The managerial actions proposed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1059601112451125">Table 4</xref> have to be understood according to this statement. These proposals extend Cooren’s approach by focusing on managerial actions before and after any situation that is analyzed. Thus, the CCO perspective provides valuable insights into the social (e.g., connecting people and organizing meetings) and material (e.g., implementing an information system) contingencies of (managerial) work “required to sustain an organization or to reveal the multiple forms of organizing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059601112451125">Putnam &amp; Nicotera, 2009</xref>, p. 4), but our finding suggests these must be firmly located within a wider temporal context to be fully understood.</p>

<title>Communication and “Knowledge of Organization”</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601112451125">Berger and Luckmann (1966)</xref> proposed that discourse is central to the “social construction of reality” because it constructs a social stock of knowledge on which people can rely to act individually and collectively. This study, by studying the conversations that allowed the interface between two companies to operate, provides a good example of the discursive construction and reconstruction of knowledge.</p>
<p>The conversation analysis for the first conversation revealed Leila and JL know each other. Because they know each other they can act as innovators, creating resources to help the collaboration process. Because the social stock of knowledge is used to respond to emerging situations, it does not have to be codified or standardized. Nevertheless, the social stock is structured by what is produced through communication activity. The conversation analysis revealed that naturally occurring talk-based interactions produce different resources that help operational-level employees to develop a relation-specific skill concurrent with new strategic and organizational objectives. For instance, we observe what we called “ritual jokes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059601112451125">Collinson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1059601112451125">Trice &amp; Beyer, 1984</xref>). These suggest the interlocutors sharing a joke not only know each other but also have a shared past, which produced collective resources that help to define delicate, complex, and uncertain situations and, in doing so, contribute to collective performance.</p>
<p>Stigmatized people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059601112451125">Goffman, 1963</xref>) are discursively constructed and also constitute a sign of a shared past. In the incident in the first conversation, stigmatization affirms the collaborators’ shared values, queuing in addition the expected utterances from each interactant. The tracking software operated similarly. By transmitting information, this tool both supports and shapes the communication dynamic. However, operational-level employees can’t rely solely on standardized information provided by this tracking software. They need to talk about the information provided by such software. In so doing, an employee at the interfirm interface confirms to his or her counterpart his or her involvement in the collaboration by showing him or her possesses what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059601112451125">Dubar (1998)</xref> calls “knowledge of organization.” In other words, the employee demonstrated that he or she knows how his or her partners’ firm works (i.e., what the specifications of his or her company’s products are as well as his or her organizational processes). Giving proof of such knowledge is very important because it creates trust. When somebody wants to talk to a specific person, it is because he or she trusts him or her more than the interfirm information system (IIS). We believe such trust emerges because the interactants have something the IIS does not—“knowledge of organization.” This trust constitutes a specific asset for collaboration and has to be developed.</p>
<p>As we see in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059601112451125">Putnam and Nicotera (2009)</xref>, despite a varied and extensive history of organizational communication scholarship that has explored the relationship between communication and organization and concluded in various ways that communication is constitutive of organizations, scholars are only now beginning to explore the role of materiality in this constitutive process. There is scope for those studying organizations from a CCO perspective to examine how communication interfaces with practical problems in the material world, notably by taking into account the heterogeneous aspect of collectives that face and resolve emerging situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1059601112451125">Taylor, 2009</xref>). In this respect, our article extends the works on interfirm collaboration by showing how such collaboration produces and relies upon integrated social and material (i.e., geosocial) resources, such as insider tools and information systems.</p>

<sec id="section10-1059601112451125">
<title>Managerial Implications: Creating the Conditions for Efficient Collective Action</title>
<p>This section discusses how everyday managerial action can be informed by the conceptual framework we are proposing, which builds on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601112451125">Cooren’s (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059601112451125">2004)</xref> perspective, which in turn is underpinned in many ways by the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601112451125">Weick (1995)</xref>. The challenge of organizing work between the product provider (a furniture manufacturer), service provider (a transport company), and a client (a furniture retailer) involves organizing the competence of participating collectives so they support productive interorganizational relationships. The transport firm and its manufacturing partner must create the tools for action. This involves developing interfirm penetration at all levels, and not simply, as is often the case, at the senior management level. To enhance the value of the service provided to the retail client, these two collaborating firms will also need to decide what is needed within their organization (intraorganizationally) so that the interorganizational agency operates properly.</p>
<p>Each action program depends on the decisions at many levels in these organizations. Successful collaboration between the manufacturer and the transport company is, therefore, not a foregone conclusion. To succeed, the collaboration presupposes detailed communication that surpasses simple agreement to build collective competence. The conversations examined in this article show that this competence relies on combining a variety of resources (<italic>physical objects</italic> such as contracts, tracing technology, and reporting tools; <italic>symbolic objects</italic> such as rules, procedures, and agreements; and <italic>individuals</italic>, who organize ways for the service relationship between the parties to operate). These resources allow the manufacturer and its service provider to understand each other and enable each party to meet the other’s expectations. Each action program is then potentially problematic, as seen in the second conversation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1059601112451125">Table 3</xref>). Using Greimas’ narrative stages, we suggest that the role of management can be viewed within a framework of interactions. To illustrate this, the following table contains a nonexhaustive list of actions for a manager in each stage of the main narrative schema.</p>
<p>These factors favoring the dynamics of communication are texts. They directly influence the operators’ conversation practices and, thus, provide levers for management action. Making an inventory of them in each organization where conversations take place will enlighten the managers about the factors that locally influence the operational practices of the individuals responsible for everyday operation and the construction of their collective work mode. Such an initiative should then make it possible to think in detail about the framework for operational interactions and to encourage construction and development of collective competence.</p>
<p>Taking an interest in these work collectives formed in the context of interorganization relationships amounts to analyzing a complex whole comprised of human beings, objects such as management tools and information technologies, direct communication, and willingness by the people involved to cooperate. As the JL’s manager from OUESTRANSPORT explained,

<p>I want us to be capable of discussing with customers how we improve together the way we collaborate. We have to get richer communication. All the time, in everyday interactions, we must know what is going on at our client’s without being there. This is really a project of mutual integration, sharing our problems with our customers because many of them are bound to the way they work. We want to create “a couple” between operators who have to work together.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>So, how is it possible to make this become a reality? We consider the creation and diffusion of what we have called “knowledge of organization” is needed, which requires a relatively high degree of stability of employees within each company. We also believe interaction will be more efficient if people know each other, which presupposes ongoing interaction. Encouraging interactions also implies thinking about the animation of these workgroups. This gives us cause to (re)consider the role of middle managers. We propose these managers’ role is reframed from one focusing on decision making and dissemination to that of an activity leader. This would see them more involved “in” the communication processes and so in the construction of collective competence.</p>
<p>Encouraging interaction also implies creating tools that encourage conversation and facilitate rather than constrain human behavior. This would require firms to question the role of computerization and more specifically Interfirm Information Systems (IIS) in a particular collaboration. In the transport firm we studied, the IIS was supposed to coordinate instead of the actors. However, our analysis of the interfirm collaborative sphere showed this computerization was just one resource that, by reducing the need for cognitive activity, freed employees to engage in subjective processes (i.e., local and emergent) and produce knowledge in the interactive space. This suggests that managers should not forget to socially connect operational-level employees to each other. Standardization (in this case through computerization) and the (subjective) social stock of knowledge are both important for successful collaboration and encouraging high-performance teams.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This examination of the operational interface between the firms explored is unique in that it looked beyond the macrointerdependencies of interfirm collaboration to those micropractices that discursively constitute the collective action at the heart of such collaboration. By analyzing workers’ conversations it was possible to reveal how successful IOR are founded on collective competence that emerges through repeated interaction across a temporal frame. This collective competence was shown to be a product of both the autonomy given to actors and the management actions intended to organize the interfirm collaboration. Combined, these two elements weave together objects, in particular information and communication technologies, with human action at all levels in the collaborating organizations. Our analysis revealed that adaptability, quality, and security are necessary resources for the achievement of this collective competence at the operational interface as they produce the trust necessary to sustain positive engagement. Together these findings suggest a framework to guide organizational scholars when analyzing interorganizational relationships that portrays the interfirm interface as a multilayered space where collective action integrates people and the objects they create and use across time to create collective competence by using local resources that are constituted through conversation. It shows how repetition and time contribute just as significantly to the creation of the dynamics of cooperation between the people involved as the formal construction process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059601112451125">Hardy et al., 2005</xref>). It also shows that a multilevel analysis (i.e., individual, group, organization, and interorganization) of the sites where collaboration occurs that incorporates geosocial constituents is necessary if we are to account for interorganizational relationships. In doing so, it makes a unique contribution to both the IOR and organizational communication literatures by offering an extension to the perspectives on collective action offered by both Weick and Cooren and highlighting how work is accomplished through dialogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059601112451125">Larkin &amp; Larkin, 1996</xref>). We would like to think that our unique microcommunication qualitative analysis, grounded as it is in a rich and textured ethnography, provides new insights for both scholars and managers wishing to understand and encourage collective competency at an operational level and promote high-performing interfirm teams.</p>
