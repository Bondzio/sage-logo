<p>To readers of the <italic>Economist</italic> or the <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic>, India is a land of opportunity, a rising economic power, a massively expanding market, the next Asian tiger. Beneath the hype, there exists a kernel of truth to such statements: The Indian economy overall has grown at a rapid pace over the past three decades, and this growth has been especially dramatic within a few regions and economic sectors. However, even a casual traveler to India is aware that this is not the whole story, and that despite these changes in India’s macroeconomy hundreds of millions of people remain in poverty in India, often in close juxtaposition to the glass skyscrapers of the “New India.”</p>
<p>Professor Kohli takes this economic inequality as the puzzle for this concise reinterpretation of the political economy of contemporary India. He asks why, given the electoral weight of the poor in democracies in general and India in particular, why has the national government tended to adopt policies that favor indigenous big business over economic redistribution? In Part 3, Kohli extends the problem to the regional level, examining why states have pursued such different mixes of regulatory and redistributive policies, examining why probusiness policies have tended to dominate in western states such as Gujarat and Maharastra, why redistribution has been more prevalent in the south and in Bengal, and why the northern Hindi-speaking states have pursued neither policy consistently (a pattern Kohli calls “neo-patrimonialism”).</p>
<p>Kohli’s argument is developed in three main stages. First, he argues that big business has gained a disproportionate influence over the behavior of the Indian state, due to international trends toward economic liberalization, India’s permissive system of campaign finance, and a broad cultural and intellectual commitment to free markets within the governing class. Second, he contends that this disproportionate influence by business interests has led to a narrowing of the democratic basis of economic policy making, with fiscal and economic policy being developed by technocratic elites with only symbolic concessions to the redistributive policies demanded by ordinary voters or envisaged by the country’s founders. Third, he suggests that these probusiness and anti-redistributive policies are intimately connected to the poor performance of the Indian state in alleviating poverty and the growing divergence between more and less prosperous areas of the country. These points are demonstrated using a mixture of broad historical discussion, some national macroeconomic data, and three case studies of particular states (Gujarat, Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh).</p>
<p>One of the novel features of Kohli’s discussion of the causes of economic liberalization is that he places the beginning of India’s economic takeoff in the 1980s, rather than in the much-mythologized “big bang” of reforms under the Narashimha Rao government. Using the both the descriptive and quantitative evidence, Kohli shows that the pace of industrial growth had already accelerated under Indira Gandhi’s last government in the early 1980s and that this was associated by a deliberate push by Mrs. Gandhi to emphasize production at the expense of the antipoverty programs that had been the basis of her political success a decade earlier. He also argues convincingly that the dominant theme of both these early reforms and the later big bang was not the advancement of free markets but the advancement of a particular set of well-connected and large Indian firms, such as the Tata, Ambani, and Birla dynasties. In general, Kohli argues, these firms had benefited from the relaxation of the rigid permit, tariff, and exchange rate regime of the Nehru era, which effectively excluded foreign investors and smaller local firms.</p>
<p>Any satisfactory theory of why governments liberalize is necessarily multicausal, and Kohli provides a broad set of theories to explain the Indian government’s change of heart, ranging from the global (the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of international trade openness) to the national (the increasingly fierce competition for political office and the potential influence of money under India’s comically weak campaign finance laws) to the local and ideological (the varying cultural attachment of different elite group to redistribution). However, the multicausal framework and the book’s short length leave little time for the detailed discussion of these pathways or of how they relate to each other.</p>
<p>In particular, one would like a more extensive discussion of the contention that certain political parties, preeminently the Communist Party of India (Marxist), have either an ideological commitment to redistribution or a well-developed lower-class constituency that makes them less susceptible to capture by business elites, and that the opposite is true of parties mobilized on ascriptive or personalistic criteria. In positing the idea that different political parties or different political cultures are inherently less corrupt or more friendly to redistribution, the argument seems to ignore the extreme mutability of the ethics, ideology, and personnel within Indian political parties. As Kohli admits, even the CPI(M) has frequently compromised its redistributive principles to benefit either its own members or big business, most famously in their use of private violence against individuals who resisted government programs to redistribute land to industrial companies. A more interesting line of argument, followed by many of the pieces (including Kohli’s own) in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414013483266">Frankel and Rao (1989)</xref>, would be that politicians are equally immoral but face differently structured social coalitions with different sets of political demands. In the case studies, Kohli cites many of the historical factors mentioned in Frankel and Rao’s chapters but does not turn this into a more general theory of how social coalitions in India are structured or why some social groups gain power relative to others.</p>
<p>The second part of Kohli’s argument, that the influence of business has led to a “narrowing” of Indian democracy at the apex, is the most interesting and provocative for students of national-level Indian politics. Most observers of Indian politics would readily agree with the basic point: To a remarkable extent, very important decisions of economic policy are made by a small group of people with Western PhDs, whereas electoral conflict revolves around ascriptive identities or pork-barrel distribution. The internal dynamics of this pattern, particularly the relationship between the technocrats and electoral politicians, would be a promising topic for further study.</p>
<p>The third portion of Kohli’s argument, that India’s extensive poverty is a product of its business-dominated political economy, is the most complex. Although Kohli shows that income inequality has increased in recent decades, this is not necessarily evidence of biased state policy. Going back to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414013483266">Kuznets (1955)</xref>, economists have argued that some level of increased inequality is an inevitable part of economic growth and the transition to urbanism. Even if inequality rises, moreover, the conditions of poor citizens can improve if some portion of the increased growth reaches them. This is what has been happening in India, where absolute poverty rates have been falling continuously for the past two decades.</p>
<p>None of this, of course, weakens Kohli’s argument: It is possible and even probable that India could have selected a growth trajectory that did more for its poorest citizens. However, this fact puts pressure on the author to articulate what such a propoor economic policy would look like, and Kohli seems to distrust many of the models of populist politics that have been practiced in India. Although he views Kerala and West Bengal as having made laudable achievements in reducing poverty, he seems well aware of the shortcomings of the political systems of both states. Similarly, he is wary of romanticizing the political economy of the prereform period, which tended to redistribute poverty as much as wealth. The antipoverty programs of the current UPA government he dismisses as symbolic and badly implemented. This leads him to conclude somewhat pessimistically, calling for a program of redistribution to the poorest states and an increase in the efficiency of the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>It is possible, however, that Kohli is too quick to dismiss the potential for redistribution posed by the robustly pluralist and often caste based party system that has emerged since 1989. Although in some states, like Kohli’s case study of Uttar Pradesh, new regional parties have focused on symbolism and corruption, this is no means universally true. Leaders as various as N. T. Rama Rao, Chandrababu Naidu, Devraj Urs, M. G. Ramachandran, and Nitish Kumar have been able to knit together caste rhetoric, business friendliness, and populist promises to both win elections and bring benefits to the rural poor. Even without charismatic leadership, national parties have been able to deliver excellent development outcomes in circumstances where a strong two-party system helps voters credibly punish poor performance: Examples include Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, and Rajasthan. Although the caste appeals used by many of these leaders may be unsavory and their personal morality rarely bears examination, the fact remains that it is possible for the electoral process to create incentives for the distribution of resources to even the poorest voters.</p>
<p>As a brief reinterpretation of how the Indian political system makes policy, this book is a contribution to the ongoing and growing debates on the alleviation of poverty and the causes of regional variation in India. It may prove particularly suitable for students and Westerners in India, who will value an accessible introduction to the gap between the India within their hotel or office and the one they see out the window.</p>
