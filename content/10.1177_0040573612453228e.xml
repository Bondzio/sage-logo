<p><italic>In Search of Self: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Personhood</italic></p>
<p>J. Wentzel van Huyssteen and Erik P. Wiebe, editors</p>
<p>Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2011. 387 pp. $45.00</p>
<p>In the first paragraph of the introduction to J. Wentzel van Huyssteen and Erik P. Wiebe’s collection, <italic>In Search of Self: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Personhood</italic>, the word “quest” is used three times to describe the unity of this volume: a quest in search of self. “Quest” is an appropriate term to describe this collection, for it is the academic equivalent of a group of explorers, each with his or her own expertise, that has set out to search for something elusive, such as a rumored new continent about which we have reports and from which we have artifacts or tattered map fragments. The quest, if successful, would arrive at “self.” The team is populated by anthropologists, cognitive scientists, theologians, philosophers, and psychologists with a few other specialties less prominently represented: primatology, ethnography, psychotherapy, and neuroscience. Physics, especially quantum physics and cosmology, are sometimes invoked, but none of those were able to make the voyage. No lawyers, literary critics, or political scientists were invited or heard from. And so this book is something of an adventure recounted through the reports and field notes of 27 authors in 18 articles with an introduction, an index of names, and an index of subjects. Did this intrepid band of academics made up of well-established authors as well as young scholars, some in undergraduate and graduate programs, arrive at “self”? In some ways, yes; in some ways, no. Maybe, like many modern quest stories, there is room for a sequel.</p>
<p>The articles in this collection follow upon an introduction that accomplishes four tasks. (1) The introduction sets the expectations for what an academic investigation of the category of “self” will look like in the current landscape, and that is: a multidisciplinary venture with a wide array of concerns, including consciousness, identity, agency, Trinity, and more. (2) The introduction wisely and carefully informs the reader that the result of this quest will not take the form of a definitive conceptual map. What follows, however, is the suggestion that the hermeneutical phenomenology of Paul Ricoeur, primarily centered on the period that resulted in his Gifford lectures published as <italic>Oneself as Another</italic>, may provide a unifying perspective to bring some order to the diversity of concerns that arise in the multiple discourses that speak about “self.” This remains, at best, a suggestion by the editors that is not taken up in articles or in any sort of epilogue. (3) The introduction then reviews a wide array of contemporary literature discussing “self” and “person,” most of which operates at the intersection of theology and contemporary cognitive science. (4) The final step is to organize the 18 offerings under four topic headings: “The Self and Origins,” “The Self and Multiplicity,” “The Self and Identity,” and “The Self and Emergence.”</p>
<p>Each of the 18 articles is a quality piece of work, sometimes representing a summary of the research in a particular field (like Ian Tattersall’s work on primatology), sometimes representing the project of a particular institute or research group (like the article from the Mindsight Institute co-authored by E. Bergemann, D. Siegel, D. Eichenstein, and E. Streit), sometimes representing a case study (like the ethnographic article by Joāo Biehl), but more often than not representing a philosophical/theological issue (such as agency, identity, multiple selves, teleology, the border of the human and nonhuman, emergence, desire, and person) intersecting with cognitive science, neurophysiology, or mind–brain discussions.</p>
<p>The articles individually make varying demands on the reader for background information and conceptual familiarity. Some previous acquaintance with Western philosophy, especially phenomenology, will be helpful for several of the articles, especially those by Calvin Schrag, Helene Tallon Russell and Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki, Kathryn Keller, J. Haag with T. Deacon and J. Ogilvy, and Roger Scruton. None of the articles should be beyond the studied reach of a college junior or senior, and all are suitable for graduate coursework on religion and science, theological anthropology, philosophical theology, and possibly pastoral theology. To be sure, not all readers are going to agree with the discourse, warrants, or evidence supporting the various claims. Some articles make what are tantamount to empirical claims based on philosophical deduction. Some articles make large-scale philosophical claims rather directly related to more local neurological study. Critical responses to the individual articles may range from “voodoo science” to “philosophically naïve” to “pastorally disengaged.” At the same time, the responses will also vary from, “I never thought of that connection” to “now I see what phenomenology is up to” to “there are resources in religious traditions (Christian, Jewish, and Buddhist represented here) that have some important conceptual tools to offer.”</p>
<p>And that is ultimately the value of this collection: it presents a diversity of disciplines and discourses that deal with the self under a wide variety of aliases: person, subject, the “I,” agent, the human. So the attentive reader will leave this exchange much better aware of what theology must take into account if it is going to be part of a contemporary discussion informed by more than (but not instead of) the classical sources of Scripture and tradition. The self arrived at in this quest is more like an archipelago than a continent, more like a series of islands with some presumption that there are yet submerged land-links to be explored later. This is where another step could have been taken in this volume: an epilogue to complement the helpful introduction. Since it does not seem that the authors of the individual articles were asked to be aware of or respond to the work of their fellow authors, it would have been helpful to have an epilogue that creatively charted what the major consistencies and inconsistencies about self are on the other side of this volume, what the most pertinent questions arising from this study are, and perhaps most importantly, whether we ought to continue asking the questions that are asked here under the rubric of “self,” or whether this multidisciplinary (not truly interdisciplinary) study ultimately suggests that “self” is just not capable of being a sufficiently fine-grained concept to capture what is at stake in the modern discussion about human identity, multiplicity, and plurality. But maybe that is what the sequel to this quest will be about.</p>
