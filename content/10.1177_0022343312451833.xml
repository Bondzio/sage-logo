<p>Aalto, Pami; Vilho Harle &amp; Sami Moisio, eds (2012) <italic>Global and Regional Problems: Towards an Interdisciplinary Study</italic>. Farnham &amp; Burlington, VT: Ashgate. xv + 244 pp. ISBN 9781409408413.</p>
<p>The end of the Cold War held the promise of more peaceful relations between states. Despite this, a series of unprecedentedly complex issues and threats have since emerged. Aalto, Harle &amp; Moisio's edited volume proposes that these challenges should be addressed with renewed focus on the study of regional and global problems, and the interaction between the two. Relevant issues range from environmental and resource-based problems to political and social issues such as rescaling higher education, and the risks to future economic and socio-political systems from ongoing threats of war and nuclear armaments. Particularly interesting are discussions on climate change in the Arctic and how this has produced a discursive transformation of both land and sea in the High North, highlighting how climate change in the Arctic Circle is being securitized using questionable natural scientific data and geopolitical discourse. Using a series of additional cases, the book addresses a range of themes in IR and peace research, and highlights well that the complex problems in the post-Cold War era are not limited to the regional and global levels, and that local perspectives also deserve attention. This volume offers an approachable introduction to important current issues at global and regional levels and is a sound addition to the security, peace research, and sociology literatures.</p>

<p>Contemporary political conflicts, especially what have been dubbed ‘fifth wave’ conflicts (that is, outbreaks of extreme violence and cruelty with intensely ideological or apparently irrational motivations), are often especially hard on women. At the same time, as the authors of this extensive study argue, women and women’s concerns are frequently underrepresented or neglected altogether in post-conflict transitional processes. Pushing beyond conventional ‘gender mainstreaming’, the authors advocate a ‘gender-central’ approach to all of the post-conflict phases, from peace talks and ceasefires to peacekeeping missions, disarmament/demobilization/reintegration programs, criminal accountability mechanisms (including restorative and transitional justice), remediation (such as truth commissions, reparations, and lustration), constitutional design/reform, governance, and economic and social development. While the coverage is thorough and the material dense, the discussion and the recommendations in the book seem somewhat general. The authors do not offer extended in-depth case studies, so the particularities of specific situations are lost. Further, since there are few examples of successful (or even attempted) gender-central post-conflict processes to describe and evaluate, the authors cannot propose many details for how those processes might be constructed or implemented. Nevertheless, their account of the many ways in which women are affected by contemporary conflict and in which those effects and injuries could and should be addressed in serious peacemaking and nation-building efforts is a worthwhile contribution. Scholars and policymakers interested in post-conflict peace, justice, and stability will benefit from the data and perspectives in the book.</p>

<p>Braithwaite, Rodric (2011) <italic>Afgantsy: The Russians in Afghanistan, 1979–89</italic>. London: Profile. xiv + 417 pp. ISBN 9781846680540.</p>
<p>A veteran diplomat and former British ambassador to Moscow, Rodric Braithwaite has written an outstanding book on a topic that was never one of his key professional concerns, but which he has researched thoroughly and presented with great compassion. The bigger picture of the Afghan war, into which the geriatric Politburo stumbled with much reluctance, having no appetite whatsoever for ‘imperial expansion’, is highlighted in dozens of tragic episodes and eye-witness accounts. Braithwaite argues convincingly that the war effort was not so heavy for the colossal Soviet military machine and the casualties were not that shocking, but the senselessness of the sacrifices and the predictable failure ‘did reinforce the lack of confidence of the Soviet people in their government’ (p. 330). The defeat added to the systemic exhaustion of the Soviet model but it didn’t cause the collapse of the USSR; the Mujahedin victory, in a perfect historic paradox, did inevitably result in the collapse of the Afghan state. The book deals primarily with the direct impact and echoes of this forgotten war for Russia, but the devastation of the social ties and cultural codes that had held Afghanistan together shines through vividly. Mikhail Gorbachev was well aware that the withdrawal of Soviet troops would bring years of violent chaos, but his attempts to convey that warning to Ronald Reagan were utterly unsuccessful. The deepening catastrophe of Afghanistan was a means to bring the ‘mega-strategic’ confrontation between two superpowers to a conclusive end, and the winning side was not inclined to accept compromises, particularly since the issues with unruly rebels appeared so microscopically local. Once again ‘withdrawal’ is a current strategic imperative, and the scope of future consequences may be beyond our ability to estimate.</p>

<p>Bruneau, Thomas; Lucía Dammert &amp; Elizabeth Skinner, eds (2011) <italic>Maras: Gang Violence and Security in Central America</italic>. Austin, TX: University of Texas Press. viii + 309 pp. ISBN 9780292729285.</p>
<p>Although there are several excellent Spanish-language overviews of Central American gangs, including in particular the comprehensive three-volume study published by a consortium of Central American research institutions, <italic>Maras y Pandillas en Centroamérica</italic>, as Donna de Cesare remarks on the cover of this book, an English-language overview of Central American gangs is ‘long overdue’. This uneven volume does not adequately fill this deficit, however. Some of its individual contributions are very interesting, including in particular Al Valdez’s unusually detailed history of Los Angeles gangs, Sonia Wolf’s coherent overview of the Salvadorean situation, and Cris Matei’s meticulous overview of US anti-gang interventions. Furthermore, even if this reviewer is not persuaded by the self-reported survey method underpinning his chapter, Mauricio Rubio’s contribution offers a number of very interesting and thought-provoking observations. Most of the rest of the chapters, however, suffer from being outdated, superficial, poorly referenced, or uncritically repeating stereotypes about gangs. This patchiness significantly weakens a volume that had the potential in the way that it is organized to offer a useful balance between empirical country-based case studies on the one hand, and overviews and analyses of policy responses to gangs on the other. At the same time, some of the latter are also problematically framed in a way that demonizes the gang phenomenon. The most obvious example is the chapter by Clifford Gyves, which discusses the need for better ‘intelligence’ about gangs, in order to better ‘combat’ them, a militaristic vocabulary that obviously projects gangs in a particular way. To this extent, while this volume could be added to course reading lists about Central America, gangs, or violence more generally by virtue of the lack of alternatives, it would need to be critically accompanied and contextualized by other literature.</p>

<p>Despite attempts since Westphalia to bestow order upon a chaotic world, some areas have always fallen through the cracks. This truism forms the basis for <italic>Unrecognized States</italic>, a noble effort to illuminate the hidden spaces that sovereignty has left behind. The primary contribution lies in reframing state recognition as on a spectrum instead of its normally assumed binary status in order to understand unrecognized states’ struggles for global acceptance. However, Caspersen’s definitional reliance upon post-Soviet locations is unnecessarily arbitrary and limiting, omitting important recent cases (Palestine, Kashmir, South Sudan) to favour peripheral cases (South Ossetia and Gagauzia). Although concise and engaging, many underdeveloped arguments would have been more persuasive were they confined to the post-Soviet regions that formed the basis for fieldwork. For example, Caspersen comes tantalizingly close to discussing how democracy has become a de facto requirement for new states – highlighting how unrecognized states started trumpeting democratization gains in the 1990s to impress the UN, but stopping short of analyzing why recognition goalposts have shifted from establishing a mere monopoly of violence to mimicking Western democratic models in order to ‘earn’ international legitimacy. Other areas of potential expansion include how great powers and regional powers bestow recognition upon potential states, how local elites use independence arguments or calcification of the status quo to mask power grabs, and the actual process from international non-recognition to acceptance – where successful cases could have highlighted contemporary international law benchmarks and blockages. While Caspersen’s work encourages further analysis of the interesting similarities of a select group of unrecognized territories, questions remain regarding what these areas mean for the future of sovereignty, interdependence, and global governance in an increasingly challenged and fractious state system.</p>

<p>Dinar, Ariel &amp; Robert Mendelsohn, eds (2011) <italic>Handbook on Climate Change and Agriculture</italic>. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar. 544 pp. ISBN 2009930434.</p>
<p>The <italic>Handbook on Climate Change and Agriculture</italic> is an ambitious edited volume. It sheds light on numerous dimensions of the climate’s impacts on agriculture from a multidisciplinary perspective, giving a comprehensive insight to the complexity of the topic. The volume is divided into five subsections covering (1) studies on agronomic impacts of climatic changes on crop productivity and food security, (2) economic analyses of climate impacts on agriculture, (3) agricultural impacts on the economy, (4) studies on the role of agriculture in mitigation of greenhouse gases, and (5) work on the potential of agricultural adaptation strategies in response to climate change. The strength of the book derives from a series of studies with diverse backgrounds, varying arguments and geographical foci, and a multitude of methodological approaches. The 22 chapters cover impacts of precipitation and temperature variation on crop yields and livestock, assess uncertainties in economic climate models and raise awareness of the potential and effectiveness of adaptation innovations to secure food supply. The various topics and approaches reflect well the multifaceted impacts global warming may have on the plurality of farming schemes around the globe. However, the uncertainties associated with a changing climate give little room for concrete courses of action, and many of the suggestions on what to expect and on the way forward remain vague. The lofty ambition of the editors to traverse the spectrum of possible implications of climate change on agriculture in one volume unfortunately affects the consistency of these studies, which varies tremendously between chapters. Nonetheless, the handbook is a complex and excellent first source to gain an understanding of the challenges associated with securing food for a growing population in times of global warming.</p>

<p>Gardner, Lloyd C (2011) <italic>The Road to Tahrir Square: Egypt and the United States from the Rise of Nasser to the Fall of Mubarak.</italic> New York: New Press. x + 230 pp. ISBN 9781595587213.</p>
<p>In the wake of the revolution comes the publishing spree. Judging by its title<italic> The Road to Tahrir Square</italic> promises to help the reader understand how the revolution at Egypt’s Tahrir Square came about. It doesn’t. Instead it traces US policy in the region, with a semi-focus on Egypt, from 1945 until today. As such the subtitle is a much better guide. The problem is not so much the text itself, which is interesting and decently well written, but that the reader – led to expect one thing – is disappointed. The book gives little insight into Egypt as such and the events of 2011 are only briefly discussed. The author is very clearly a historian – the weight of the book is dedicated to the period up until Sadat’s death in 1981. This dateline corresponds with the available archival material. Only one quarter of the book covers the last 30 years of Egyptian history. One can therefore suspect that the author was working on a book about US Middle East policy when the Tahrir demonstrations took place and that the publishing house then convinced him to make it relevant for current affairs. This is not to say that the book is irrelevant, as it is important to understand the past in order to comprehend the present. In the current situation in which the Middle East is in turmoil, this is all too easy to forget, and the type of book that <italic>The Road to Tahrir Square </italic>attempts to be is sorely needed. However, owing to its lack of focus, this is not that book.</p>

<p>Aiming to bring political demography to the forefront of political science, the editors of this volume hold ‘that demography must be considered a major driver of politics alongside classic materialist, idealist, and institutional perspectives’ (p. 4). Despite the breadth of topics covered, <italic>Political Demography</italic> does not sacrifice depth of content. Its 18 well-written chapters highlight different methodologies, scales, problems and possibilities through national, regional and cross-national studies. These examples combine thematic and historical analysis and delve into the six main components of demography: population size, age structure, fertility, migration and mortality and their interactions with policy. The book primarily focuses on the domestic and international consequences of age, with the demographic transition and the youth bulge as the two primary considerations. The capability of aging nations to mobilize resources towards foreign policy objectives when dealing with increased domestic medical allocation issues, electoral restructuring and the dynamics of power transition theory are all discussed, as are the policy issues dealing with ethnic change and migration as a means of mitigating the transition. Youth bulges, an emerging topical research question, occur in countries possessing extremely low average population age, with the largest generation being the youngest. The book illustrates the tendency of nations undergoing this phenomenon to have higher levels of civil unrest, lower democracy ratings and potentially greater economic growth. This book answers a need within political science, as demographical questions are becoming an increasingly fruitful avenue of research. It should prove useful for advanced undergraduate or graduate courses, and it is a resource for scholars looking to add a broad understanding of a complex topic.</p>

<p>Kemp, Walter; Vesselin Popovski &amp; Ramesh Thakur, eds (2011) <italic>Blood and Borders: The Responsibility To Protect and the Problem of the Kin-State. </italic>Tokyo: United Nations University Press. xii + 258 pp. ISBN 9789280811964.</p>
<p>Consider the position of countries whose dominant ethnic category has co-ethnics residing as minorities in neighbouring states. If the rights of such minorities are imperilled by their government, do their so-called ‘kin-states’ have a special responsibility or right to protect them? The contributors to this edited volume ask this question and, as a whole, answer ‘no’. They recognize that kin-states, in the wordplay of one contributor, might have a ‘kinterest’ in protecting co-ethnics abroad, but they argue that kin-states’ responsibility is no greater than that of any other individual state under the doctrine of ‘the responsibility to protect’. The contributors warn that undue kin-state interference might aggravate conflicts. Then what are kin-states to do? The volume prescribes bilateral agreements between kin-states and their co-ethnics’ governments, and the institution of credible monitoring mechanisms. In effect, the contributors seek to stop kin-states from acting unilaterally. This is reassuring, because they leave it to the kin-states themselves to determine which groups are to be considered co-ethnic and the objects of their ‘kinterest’ (p. 48). The putative co-ethnic minority is given no part in the constitution of transnational relations. Indeed, the volume displays little sensitivity to current sociological theories of ethnicity in transnational contexts. The existence and nature of legitimate kin-state relations are contested. For example, individual members of ethnic minorities might well dispute the kin-state status of ‘kinterested’ states. Such insensitivity to theories of ethnicity is perhaps indicative of the fact that this volume is primarily a piece of advocacy for the responsibility to protect doctrine, and it ought to be read as such.</p>

<p>McGlinchey, Eric (2011) <italic>Chaos, Violence, Dynasty: Politics and Islam in Central Asia</italic>. Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Press. xiv + 216 pp. ISBN 9780822961680.</p>
<p>The book stands out boldly in the academic literature on the post-Soviet transition of Central Asia, challenging the very idea of ‘transition’ which implies a gradual or a revolutionary change from despotism to democracy. McGlinchey points out that 20 years of independent state-building have brought the three ‘stans’ he has extensively researched – Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan – no closer to democratic rule than at the end of the USSR in 1991 (p. 19). He further argues that instead of continuing with futile but politically correct efforts aimed at promoting democracy, researchers should focus on explaining the variations in authoritarian regimes and examining their durability. These variations are indeed striking: Kyrgyzstan has experienced a chaotic struggle for power; Uzbekistan is rigidly controlled by a brutal tyrant; and Kazakhstan enjoys steady growth under the firm rule of the Nazarbaev family. McGlinchey suggests that these variations are rooted in the peculiarities of political decisions in the late Soviet period and driven by three major factors: availability of economic resources and rents, geopolitics and the influence of the immediate neighborhood, and the resurgence of Islam. He tests his model and the particular hypotheses on the three cases labeled as ‘Chaos’, ‘Violence’, and ‘Dynasty’ and finds good causal explanations for the variations, establishing also that ‘at the individual country level they are remarkably stable’ (p. 169). The chaos in Kyrgyzstan indeed shows few signs of subsiding, but the explosion of violence in Kazakhstan in December 2011 indicates that the dynasty is losing its grip on power. The result is a convincing work of academic discourse, showing empathy for the men and women who struggle for democracy.</p>

<p>Nest, Michael Wallace (2011) <italic>Coltan</italic>. Cambridge &amp; Malden, MA: Polity. x + 220 pp. ISBN 9780745649313.</p>
<p>Conflict minerals have morphed from benign lumps to media sensations over the last two decades, and coltan is no exception. An essential component of every laptop, video game system, and mobile phone on the planet, tanalum (constituting the desirable half of the composite coltan found in the Democratic Republic of Congo) is ubiquitous and misunderstood. In this work, Michael Nest demolishes conventional perceptions of the politics of coltan. Too often thought of as ‘hacked from the ground in chaotic mines lorded over by a thug with a gun’ (p. 31), Nest persuasively shows how coltan matters less to the DRC than assumed – being only about one-third as profitable as tin. Beyond simple extraction, mining needs hierarchal organization and legitimate production chains, and resource conflicts are often at least as much about unsustainable price spikes, the weakness of political institutions and local land rights regimes as they are about securing minerals to pay for war. A serious work that harnesses both political ecology and political economy literatures, Nest’s writing remains encouragingly accessible. This primer echoes truths found in conflict mineral debates worldwide, shining particularly when discussing the myriad initiatives of the global ‘activist marketplace’. Well-intended mining activists tangibly tie ignored conflicts to omnipresent Western devices, in this case overplaying coltan’s role to get disinterested Western publics to care about a forgotten war. However, when discussing coltan’s future, Nest unfortunately embraces the easy – but lazy – critique of China’s Africa policies. As China builds mineral reserves that are comparable to those of other global powers, forwarding unsubstantiated claims of China’s supposed uncaring support of despotic regimes in exchange for access encourages the same simplistic assessments that are so effectively dismantled in other chapters. This minor stumble does not diminish the work – a must-read for resource conflict scholars.</p>

<p>Themnér, Anders (2011) <italic>Violence in Post-Conflict Societies: Remarginalization, Remobilizers and Relationships.</italic> New York: Routledge. xiii + 210 pp. ISBN 9780415579223.</p>
<p>Much has been published about disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) in recent years. Themnér’s book, however, takes a refreshingly different approach by proposing an original theory about the wider topic of post-conflict violence. Based on his doctoral thesis at Uppsala University, this book focuses on the crucial question of ‘why former fighters of some ex-combatant communities re-engage in organized violence, while those of other such communities do not’. This question is addressed through a comparative study of six demobilized, non-state armed groups in Sierra Leone and the Republic of Congo. The massive re-engagement of four of these ex-combatant communities is explained by the presence of entrepreneurs of violence who draw on the services of intermediaries to contact former fighters. However, the re-recruitment is only successful where these ‘remobilizers’ can appeal to pre-existing social ties (‘relationships’). This link between war-sponsoring elites and former rank-and-file soldiers is probably the most important contribution. It consists of not only material benefits but also emotions of affinity, trust and fear activated by former mid-level commanders who operate between the two levels. Earlier explanations of recidivism – such as lack of physical security, economic difficulties and political exclusion – are seen as irrelevant since the six ex-combatant communities are similarly ‘remarginalized’. This finding might be due to the limitations in the community approach, as levels of remarginalization may indeed not vary much across ex-combatant communities, but they certainly do vary among individual ex-combatants. This book is an important source for both theory-interested scholars and practitioners, who have yet to deliver solutions for the reintegration of former mid-level commanders – crucial actors for post-conflict violence, as is convincingly demonstrated by Themnér’s work.</p>

<p>Welzer, Harald (2012) <italic>Climate Wars: Why People Will Be Killed in the</italic> <italic>Twenty-First Century</italic>. Cambridge: Polity. vii + 222 pp. ISBN 9780745651453.</p>
<p>When Harald Welzer’s book <italic>Klimakriege: Wofür im 21. Jahrhundert Getötet Wird</italic> was first published (Fischer, 2008), it generated a lot of attention, not at least because of its snappy and provocative title. Now, four years on, the book has been translated to reach a global audience. And new readers need not worry; the content is equally controversial in English and the projections about the world of tomorrow are equally bold. In a research field dominated by articulated uncertainties, conditional statements, and vague projections, <italic>Climate Wars</italic> represents a refreshing alternative. ‘Obviously’, Welzer informs us, ‘[increasing scarcities] will lead to violent conflict among those who wish to feed off the same area of land.’ This and other prophesies about the future should not be considered mere speculation. Rather, we learn, they are founded on knowledge about why wars have been fought in the past. Climate wars are already occurring, and the causal connection between climate change and conflict is unquestionable and direct. While this book has little to offer in terms of new insights into security implications of climate change, it is actually a rather enjoyable read – if only because of its evident disconnect from contemporary scientific discourse.</p>

<p>Zenko, Micah (2010) <italic>Between Threats and War: U.S. Discrete Military Operations in the Post-Cold War World. </italic>Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press. xii + 228 pp. ISBN 9780804771917.</p>
<p>The application of limited, surgical and often covert force to attain politico-military objectives has become increasingly popular among consecutive US administrations. In exploring this phenomenon, Zenko provides a timely and perceptive text on discrete military operations (DMOs). The publication addresses three basic questions: why DMOs are utilized (to punish, deter or coerce US adversaries at significantly less political, military, human and financial cost than conventional warfare); whether DMOs achieve their intended military and political objectives (full military goals are achieved in just over 50% of cases while full political goals are rarely accomplished); and what determines success or failure (political constraints, operational design and efficacy of objectives). Published prior to the killing of Osama Bin Laden, the book examines data from 36 American DMOs conducted between 1991 and 2009 and interviews with current and former senior policymakers. The book is dominated by four case studies and is rich in operational detail as well as intrigue, highlighting the deeply contrasting attitudes of military and civilian personnel towards DMOs. Nevertheless, analysis and contextualization of concepts, threats and legal and technological frameworks are distinctly absent. Despite the publication’s clear focus, Zenko neither offers nor seeks to present deeper substantive discussion beyond the tactical and strategic utility of DMOs, and there is a lack of rigorous detail in each of the author’s policy recommendations. While readers may be frustrated by the book’s brevity and resulting deficiencies – it provides limited scope compared with benchmark works such as <italic>Force Without War</italic> (1978) – Zenko offers a well-researched insight into what is likely to become an ever more common means to exert state power without seeking territorial control or defeating an opposing army.</p>

<p>Zetland, David (2011) <italic>The End of Abundance: Economic Solutions to Water Scarcity.</italic> Amsterdam: Aguanomics. xiii + 208 pp. ISBN 9780615469737.</p>
<p>This self-published book recommends economic solutions to water scarcity at the levels of personal and social choice. It targets ‘water abundance’, wherein water is un-priced or under-priced, as contributing to the current era of ‘water scarcity’. It introduces economic concepts clearly and offers examples of where markets hold promise to manage water scarcity (i.e. in agriculture) but fails to assess counter-arguments citing some of the same examples as contributing to – and even creating – aspects of water management problems. The conceptual treatment of ‘water scarcity’ applies a supply–demand calculus against a stock-flow model of water. It does not discuss the (contested) metrics of water scarcity in contemporary policy or the politics of defining the management units the book promotes (i.e. ‘watersheds’). As the book acknowledges, climate change undermines the idea that interannual water variability fluctuates within stable limits; but given this, it is unclear why the stock-flow model is appropriate. For instance, the book argues that the market should allocate water after other environmental or personal values are protected, but without the stable limits required by stock-flow models it is unclear how such protections should be set in a way that grants security to rights holders. The penultimate chapter argues that property rights are appropriate for achieving the human right to water, while the book concludes by arguing that interstate conflicts should be adjudicated with market tools or local (i.e. community) mechanisms to remove political gamesmanship from water-use decisions. Unfortunately, Zetland does not address issues regarding the politics of ‘local’ or ‘community’ scales for effective water governance. In sum, to be convincing the book’s arguments require a clearer articulation and defense of the political position they forward alongside the solutions to water scarcity that are offered.</p>
