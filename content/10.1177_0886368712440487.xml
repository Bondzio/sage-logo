<p>Every now and then an opportunity emerges that you feel compelled to accept. Assuming the role of editor of this journal is one those opportunities. It was sudden; I worked with Fay Hansen to publish several articles, the most recent in the September-October issue. I was shocked by her passing as I am sure many of us who knew her were as well. She held this job for a long time.</p>
<p>This journal has existed for a long time. I first published in it more than 20 years ago. I also recall participating in discussion groups in the Manhattan offices of the American Management Association that were then summarized in the journal. The field of compensation and benefits has seen significant change over the years. My goal is to keep it at the forefront of developments in the field.</p>
<p>My career has been largely in consulting. Along the way I managed the practices for two large firms. I also managed the compensation function in two large corporations. It was long ago but I have an MBA and PhD from the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. I’ve developed five books on pay and performance, the most recent was <italic>Planning Wage and Salary Programs</italic> (2009). I mention that to suggest I have a broad background that spans the spectrum of issues related to compensation and performance management. My years in benefit consulting firms provide me with a solid understanding of benefits although it is not my primary interest.</p>
<p>As editor I plan to promote best practices and innovation. That has been my professional focus. While I appreciate research, this is not a research journal. I want to encourage practitioners who have developed new ideas or refined accepted practices. If ideas are controversial, I plan to solicit articles on both sides of an issue. Articles based on research will certainly be accepted, but I would want the author to document its relevance to sound management.</p>
<p>I see compensation and benefits as tools to facilitate and support talent management. If I have a primary interest today, it is creating or sustaining high-performance organizations. Rewards are a central issue. Too often human resource practices are discussed in a way that ignores the impact on an organization and its performance. I want to encourage articles that showcase evidence that “people [and their management] are the only sustainable source of competitive advantage,” to rephrase an argument in a popular book.</p>
<p>I also plan to solicit articles on global issues. For companies planning to start an operation in another country, the employment laws and accepted practices are a central consideration. Moreover, with increased globalization, companies are also rethinking talent management practices.</p>
<p>Finally, I plan to seek out the viewpoints of individuals recognized for their expertise—the thought leaders. The expert in this issue is Ann Bares, who is possibly best known as the author of Compensation Force, one of the top-rated human resource blogs on the web, and founder/editor of the online Compensation Café©.</p>
<p>Perhaps most important, I want to hear the ideas of readers of this journal. I want to know what subjects are current hot buttons and what issues you want experts to address. If you disagree with the views expressed in an article, I want to hear from you. This is not a blog but I would like to find a way to allow for the exchange of ideas. This journal has value only if it helps readers. That is the goal. Each article will hopefully do that.</p>
