<p>While ‘security’ has now become a central theme in criminology, the literature on it is limited (and, limiting). One of the major issues plaguing the literature is definitional, that is, that it is often unclear what is meant by ‘security’. As noted by numerous scholars, what is needed is empirical documentation about what ‘security’ is to a variety of actors. In this article, I explore what ‘security’ looks and feels like to particular actors working in an emergency shelter. In so doing, I explicate the discursive production of the polysemy of ‘security’ by exploring the ways that ‘security’ is thought about, made sense of and put into practice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Criminology, like, though perhaps much later than, other disciplines, has produced a voluminous and still heavily growing literature on ‘security’. Indeed, there appears to be an ‘obsession with security’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1362480612466564">Lucia Zedner (2009</xref>: 1) puts it, which is reflected in the fact that the study of security has become ‘a central theme in criminology’ (p. 1). To a large extent, this obsession makes sense given that life plays out in what is referred to as the ‘security society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1362480612466564">Zedner, 2003b</xref>: 156) or ‘security state’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1362480612466564">Hallsworth and Lea, 2011</xref>). Yet, for all that is written and opined, the literature on security is limited (and, limiting). There are several reasons for this. One significant problem is definitional, that is, it is often unclear exactly what is meant by the term. The claim made by RBJ Walker some 15 years ago and in a different setting, nevertheless applies well to what is currently unfolding. ‘Whether analytically or rhetorically’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1362480612466564">Walker (1997</xref>: 63) writes, ‘claims about security increasingly have an air of slovenly imprecision. A word once uttered in hard cadences to convey brutal certainties has become embarrassingly limp and overextended.’ The legal-philosopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1362480612466564">Jeremy Waldron (2006</xref>: 455) has made similar observations noting that the literature ‘almost never address[es] the question of what “security” means’. Criminology, as the epigraphs to this article suggest, is certainly not immune from this problem and it is perhaps this that leads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1362480612466564">Zedner (2009</xref>: 9) to remark that ‘Security is a promiscuous concept.’</p>
<p>The recent exhortations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1362480612466564">Mariana Valverde (2011</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1362480612466564">Valverde, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1362480612466564">2008</xref>) among others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1362480612466564">Loader and Walker, 2007</xref>: 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1362480612466564">Shearing and Johnston, 2010</xref>: 496; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1362480612466564">Zedner, 2003a</xref>) are introduced here for they speak to what is perhaps <italic>the</italic> pressing problem facing the study of security, that is, the paucity of empirical inquiry. Valverde’s major point of contention is that security does not exist as a thing. While ‘it may be grammatically correct to use the term “security” as a noun that is the subject of a sentence …’ she writes, ‘it is dangerous to go on to the assumption that security actually exists, even as a fuzzy concept’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1362480612466564">Valverde, 2011</xref>: 5; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1362480612466564">Valverde, 2001</xref>: 85). In other words, ‘we [should] think about security not as a thing, a concept or condition but rather as an umbrella term under which one can see a multiplicity of governance processes that are dynamic and internally contradictory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1362480612466564">Valverde, 2011</xref>: 5). To a large extent, it is the lack of empirical inquiry that is the culprit behind the tendency to not only think about security as a thing, but also provide grandiose theoretical musings that often miss the mark. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1362480612466564">Clifford Shearing and Les Johnston (2010</xref>: 496; emphasis added) comment, ‘criminologists <italic>must insist</italic> on the importance of empirical enquiry that scrutinizes a priori assumptions’ about security. Thus, what is required is empirical documentation of what security looks and feels like to a variety of people (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1362480612466564">Eisch-Angus, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1362480612466564">Goold et al., 2010</xref> for two examples). This is because ‘all that we can [largely] know about security is what people do in its name, and … therefore our focus should be on <italic>practices of governance</italic> that in fact appeal to “security”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1362480612466564">Valverde, 2011</xref>: 5; emphases added). In focusing on these practices, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1362480612466564">Valverde (2011</xref>: 9; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1362480612466564">Valverde, 2008</xref>) notes three interrelated concepts that studies of security projects should account for: logic (concerning rationales, objectives, purposes and discourses); scope (concerning scale and jurisdiction); and techniques (concerning practices encompassing both agents and equipment).</p>
<p>It would be remiss not to mention several works that have examined the way security is undertaken in various settings. Some of these have explored the manner in which private security officers are involved in the policing of private spaces such as malls and other quasi-public spaces open to the public (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1362480612466564">Button, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1362480612466564">Huey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1362480612466564">Wakefield, 2003</xref>), residential sites (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1362480612466564">Rigakos, 2002</xref>) or spaces of leisure such as night clubs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1362480612466564">Hobbs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1362480612466564">Rigakos, 2008</xref>). As richly textured as these ethnographies are, and as far as they go in explicating the manner in which particular security mechanisms are at work, they do have limitations. The main problem is that the studies noted above (and many others as well), in one way or another, are related to studies on policing, be it public, private or some hybrid form. This has the unfortunate effect of translating concerns about security solely into concerns about policing and vice versa, and this is especially so in the aftermath of 9/11 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1362480612466564">Johnston and Shearing, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1362480612466564">Loader and Walker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1362480612466564">Shearing and Johnston, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1362480612466564">Wood and Shearing, 2007</xref>; for exceptions, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1362480612466564">Moran and Skeggs, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1362480612466564">Neocleous, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1362480612466564">Shearing and Stenning, 1985</xref>). Second, and related, security has often been conflated with physical safety, what criminologists generally refer to as ‘primary safety’—that is, ‘the basic physical safety of oneself and one’s loved one’s’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1362480612466564">Valverde, 2001</xref>: 84)—and elsewhere referred to as ‘the pure safety conception’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1362480612466564">Waldron, 2006</xref>: 461), or that which closely parallels what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1362480612466564">Anthony Giddens (1984</xref>: 50) calls ‘ontological security’. This is also the case with the foregoing studies where security is largely reduced to concerns about crime and violence. These two problems have the effect of unnecessarily narrowing and reducing security to the way particular actors conceptualize it, leaving aside a whole host of other ways in which it is thought about, made sense of and put into practice.</p>
<p>In this article, I take the exhortations of Valverde (and others) seriously and seek to explore and explicate what security looks and feels like to particular actors working in a specific setting. This setting is an emergency shelter for men in Ottawa, the capital of Canada. This site is particularly useful because it sheds light on the way different sites—over and beyond what has been the focus of traditional and orthodox criminological inquiries, such as correctional institutions or the policing of public spaces—are also heavily governed by logics and rationales of security, and, as will become apparent and perhaps more importantly, the much broader ways that security is, and can be, conceptualized than what these studies have unearthed and documented. It is important to keep in mind that the site in question here is one that is largely, if not primarily, designed to promote social services and welfare in general, and yet, it is one where concerns about security trump all other concerns and logics. Thus, even welfare services, it appears, are governed through the logic of security and expanding the focus of inquiry can shed light on the way the logic of security has become all encompassing in contemporary life and the myriad ways that it is thought about and acted upon.</p>
<p>My findings reveal the polysemy of security, that is, that what security looks and feels like to one person is quite different from what it is to others, or, to put this another way, that security can mean many different things. This is not necessarily a novel finding, as there has been some mention of it, both in criminology (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1362480612466564">Dupont, 2006</xref>: 173; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1362480612466564">Zedner, 2009</xref>: 9–25) and in disciplines such as anthropology (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1362480612466564">Eisch-Angus, 2011</xref>: 94–96), though much more along these lines is required. Specifically however, what the literature lacks is illumination on how it is that the polysemy of security comes into existence. This requires, as will become apparent, coming to grips with the contradictions within security projects. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1362480612466564">Valverde (2011</xref>: 4) puts it, ‘different security projects, even those within the same general field, often clash with one another’, so much so that they ‘often exhibit internal contradictions’. In seeking to fill these voids, I explore the discursive production of security as it is thought about, made sense of and put into practice by various personnel who work in the shelter (for a similar approach that treats security as ‘speech acts’, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1362480612466564">Buzan et al., 1998</xref>: 23–26).</p>
<p>The ways that management and staff think about and make sense of security is vastly different. Management is clearly ‘obsessed’ with security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1362480612466564">Zedner, 2009</xref>: 1) and the primary means by which it seeks to achieve and maintain order is through a strategy of, what in academic circles is referred to as, ‘governing through security’—that is, the way numerous areas of public life are subsumed under concerns about security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1362480612466564">Valverde, 2001</xref>: 89–90; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1362480612466564">Simon, 2007</xref>, for a discussion of ‘governing through crime’). However, management, largely driven by concerns over legality, especially given the legal mandates imposed by the collective agreement and the Union, tends to think of security largely in terms of ‘primary safety’ concerning physical safety from violence and other types of bodily harm. It is not that other issues beyond violence and bodily harm are neglected; rather, they are often funneled into a discourse about violence and bodily harm. Front line staff however, while certainly cognizant of the importance of physical safety, tend to think of security in much broader terms. Thus, concerns over poor pay, job (in)security, stress and health concerns (relating to bed bugs or having to come into contact with various ‘dangerous’ or unclean materials), among others, are all translated into concerns about security. The term ‘human security’, which in the general sense is meant to capture the ‘welfare of ordinary people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1362480612466564">Paris, 2001</xref>: 87; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1362480612466564">Zedner, 2009</xref>: 39–44) and covers a variety of concerns ranging from the economy, the environment, the community, to health, the body and personal safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1362480612466564">Paris, 2001</xref>: 90), nicely captures the broad manner in which security is conceptualized by the workers.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the logic of ‘governing through security’ that management relies upon so heavily in ordering the shelter is also what the workers utilize to convert these myriad issues into concerns about security. Here, just as managers, they draw upon the law to translate these concerns into concerns about security: for example, health concerns about bed bugs are turned into concerns about security largely because provincial legislation pertaining to health and safety, in many ways, has already conflated the two. In addition however, and from a practical standpoint, front line staff are well aware that turning various concerns into issues of security will provide them with better traction because management speaks the ‘language’ of security. It is in these ways that these issues are taken up and put into practice.</p>
<p>The rest of the article is organized as follows. I begin with a discussion on method. The next section attends to the ways in which the shelter is constructed by management and staff as a space that is, or at least can be, volatile. Using the example of ‘The Bubble’, I then look at the way management has sought to address some of these volatilities; this example nicely illustrates the way management equates security with, and thereby reduces it to, primary safety. The section which follows explores the contradictions of security projects, again using ‘The Bubble’ as an example. In the next two substantive sections, I use the example of health to explore the way members of the staff translate a variety of concerns into concerns about security. In the final section, I explore the way logic of ‘governing through security’, which is grounded upon and facilitated by the law, is relied upon by both parties to address their concerns.</p>

<sec id="section2-1362480612466564" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method and scope of the study</title>
<p>The data for this article are derived from an ethnography conducted over the course of one year, between September 2010 and 2011, involving approximately 300 hours of participant observations. In addition, 16 interviews with the personnel who work in the shelter were conducted. I began my observations in the Fall of 2010. In total, I visited the shelter on 51 different occasions, each visit lasting on average five to six hours in length. I spent time during the mornings, afternoons, evenings as well as during the overnight period and did so throughout the four seasons of the year. My time was spent sitting and talking with staff and caseworkers, most of which was spent in ‘The Bubble’ (see the following sections) and in the offices of the caseworkers. Often, I would follow staff or caseworkers as they attended to issues that cropped up. This took me to other locations in the shelter, such as outside or upstairs where the sleeping quarters are located, or to the basement where meals are served. During these ‘walks’ I was able to observe the way staff responded to issues and interacted with clients. Especially during the early stages of the study, I spent considerable time sitting in the lobby observing staff and client interactions from afar. During these times I would often be engaged in conversations by clients and I took this opportunity to interact with them. I was provided with virtually unlimited access to the shelter during my visits and this allowed me to attend staff meetings and other information sessions which provided further insights into the workings of the shelter. I completed my observations sometime during the Fall of 2011 and then began the interviews with front line staff, caseworkers, managers and supervisors. The interviews were semi-structured and largely open-ended and each lasted, on average, one hour.</p>
<p>As with any research and the data that are produced, there are limitations and, unsurprisingly, this study is not immune from such problems. For the sake of brevity however, I will refrain from rehashing matters about the limits of knowledge production that are now well trodden and discussed <italic>ad nauseam</italic> (readers who are interested about such concerns, or for those who are ‘methodology addicts’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1362480612466564">Zygmunt Bauman (2003</xref>: 2) so wryly puts it, can consult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1362480612466564">Button, 2007</xref>: 21–29 or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1362480612466564">Wakefield, 2003</xref>: 83–103, among others, who have spelled out in detail the numerous concerns that emerge from undertaking similar research, some of which are relevant to the discussion here). The simple reason for this is that I am uninterested in seeking to proffer grandiose Truth claims about security (or anything for that matter), but rather, in the spirit of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1362480612466564">Valverde’s (2011)</xref> exhortations, only interested in narrating the way particular groups think about security that is sensitive to time and place among other contextual factors. This is a story about the stories that certain people tell about security, and no more, and should only be read as such.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1362480612466564">
<title>Volatility, uncertainty and the unpredictability of the shelter</title>
<p>The shelter is located in a five story building, inclusive of the basement, though the two upper floors are reserved for clients who have special needs (a program run by the city for those with severe drug and alcohol addictions) and for those clients who can pay rent, who are manned four to a room. The main floor of the building functions as the intake centre for clients. It has a large lobby where clients congregate and pass time. In addition, it is on this floor that most of the offices, including the offices of the supervisors, case workers and some managers, are located. The sleeping quarters are located in the basement (which also contains the kitchen and the dining hall) and the second floor. The shelter can accommodate 129 persons per night: there are 90 beds on the second floor and nine in the basement; in addition however, the basement also has the capacity to ‘house’ another 30 clients, in what is called an ‘overflow’ section. More so than not, especially during the winter, the shelter is filled to capacity. Like many shelters, the demographics of the clientele who stay in the shelter are vast and varied (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1362480612466564">Culhane, 1992</xref>: 430–431, for an example in Philadelphia). Those who use the shelter include: the homeless or otherwise visibly poor; persons recently released or discharged from jails, prisons, mental health facilities or hospitals; persons traveling from one city to another who are looking for a place to stay for a night or two; persons who are new to the city; persons who have been either evicted by their landlord or asked to leave by their spouse or partner; and, in a handful of cases, young adults who have run away from home.</p>
<p>More often than not, very little is, and can be, known about the clients, especially when they originally enter the shelter. This, to a large extent, has to do with the procedures related to booking clients into the shelter, which while requiring staff to ask clients for identification, do not prohibit providing them a bed if a client states that he does not have any. In many instances, clients claim that they are bereft of identification. Thus, it is virtually impossible, at least at this stage, to ascertain the ‘true’ identity of clients and many staff members believe wholeheartedly that many clients, especially those who have recently been released from a correctional institution or who are evading the police, enter the system under a pseudonym. The shelter, as they see it, can potentially function as a safe haven for criminals. This alone makes some staff members uneasy. On one wintry night for example, a man, who presumably was seeking comfort and warmth from the weather, stood in between the two main doors of the shelter and would continue to stand there for a significant amount of time. His behavior immediately raised the suspicion of some staff members who believed that he was a drug dealer waiting for his clients. The confident and calm manner in which he stood and stared into the work space of the staff definitely made one female staff member uneasy. At one point, while leaving for a break, she notified her colleague about ‘this guy with the red coat’ and told her, ‘don’t let him come in; <italic>he’s creepy</italic>’ (emphasis added). The enigmatic nature of clients and the unease it may pose is best captured in a statement of one staff member: ‘I just assume that everybody’s violent and everybody has AIDS.’ For her, this tactic made sense because, more often than not, very little is, and can be, known about particular clients.</p>
<p>Enigma aside, the threat of physical violence and bodily harm is a serious concern to many staff members and is taken even more seriously by management. The shelter is nothing like the chaos and anarchy that pervades some shelters such as the infamous Armory in New York City (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1362480612466564">Dordick, 1996</xref>). Nevertheless, it is a place that is ‘volatile’, as one supervisor put it. In this sense, the shelter is quite typical of other shelters where ‘Crime is a pervasive aspect of shelter life and includes the use of drugs … and theft.’ It is a place where ‘everything is up for grabs—the resident’s personal belongings, his bed or locker, his bodily safety, and his privacy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1362480612466564">Grunberg and Eagle, 1990</xref>: 523). It is, in many ways, akin to a ‘near total institution’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1362480612466564">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In particular, there is a sense that the shelter, like many others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1362480612466564">Dordick, 1996</xref>: 394; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1362480612466564">Karabanow and Rains, 1997</xref>: 315), is like a prison and this sense is one that is commonly shared by management, staff and clients. There is, as one staff member put it, a ‘Kind of the prison mentality’ that pervades the shelter because, as a supervisor put it, the place ‘is one step from being in a prison’. In large part, the processes by which clients are admitted into and then governed while in the shelter play a significant role, perhaps unwittingly, in spawning this mentality. A striking aspect of this is that when clients book a bed they are provided with a bed number. From that moment until they exit the shelter, that number becomes a significant part of their lives; indeed, it constitutes them as a client of the shelter, so much so that when confirming their bed, something that must be done on a daily basis, or when lining up for meals, clients provide their bed numbers, not their names, as an identifier. Even though staff members know the names of the clients and address them by their first names, the identity of the client, institutionally at least, is based on this number, just as it is in prison. Additionally, the daily routine of the shelter is quite like a prison. As one case worker explained, clients, just like prisoners, lose their autonomy because virtually every aspect of their lives, ranging from when they must wake up, go to bed, eat, shower, watch television or apply for aid, is institutionally regulated. In fact, even the morning wake up calls, which are performed daily at 7am, supposedly remind some clients of their experiences in prison and thus staff were told by a supervisor during a staff meeting, ‘You gotta be diligent in wake-ups.’ Unsurprisingly, when clients speak of or describe the shelter, the phrase, ‘It’s like a jail’ can often be heard, and staff members firmly believe that clients ‘think it is like they are in jail’. To say then, that the shelter is a place that is fraught with problems is an understatement and these problems, to a large extent, are a product of the volatility that pervades it. How volatile the shelter is, or at least, can be, is evinced in the war metaphor that is often used. As one female staff member put it: ‘When I come to work, <italic>I come ready to battle</italic> with the clients’ (emphasis added). In echoing this, a supervisor commented to the staff members present at a meeting: ‘We are front line workers. <italic>We are in the Trenches</italic>’ (emphasis added).</p>
<p>If the shelter is like a battle ground and shelter life for the staff (and clients), like a war, then it should not come as a surprise that management has taken these threats very seriously and sought to protect its ‘soldiers’ from violence and bodily harm. As one supervisor bluntly put it: ‘<italic>my primary concern is the safety of my staff</italic>’ (emphasis added). Many exhortations are often made, especially during staff meetings, to remind staff of the importance of being vigilant. For example, during a meeting, a supervisor reminded the staff that if and when a situation arises where a staff member calls for assistance, ‘you go as fast as you can’ and this response should not be ‘nonchalant’. In other words, he repeated, ‘a call for back-up obviously supersedes what you are doing’. There are also numerous rules that reinforce this view: one example being that staff members are to always keep a certain distance when interacting with clients. What is noteworthy is that in these examples, while the focus is on security broadly conceived, it is primarily one about primary safety, that is, the physical well-being in relation to the absence of violence and bodily harm. In what follows, I use the example of ‘The Bubble’ to explore the way the conceptualization and governance of security is largely reduced to a concern about primary safety.</p>

<title>Creating a safe haven: ‘The Bubble’</title>
<p>‘The Bubble’ was a product of a very rare, but nonetheless unfortunate and extremely violent, episode that occurred about three years prior to its erection. A male staff member was stabbed repeatedly in the stomach—‘gutted’ as one staff member put it, ‘eviscerated’ as a supervisor claimed—while undertaking a routine wake-up call during an overnight shift. Often, staff members who work overnight are tasked with waking clients who request to be awoken during the early morning hours, be it for work or for other reasons. When the worker approached and awoke the client, the client, who was supposedly suffering from severe mental illness, was startled and attacked him. The worker survived the attack but, unsurprisingly, was never the same again and supposedly still finds it difficult to maintain even a modicum of stability in his life. It was this incident and its aftermath that highlighted the need for significant change in the shelter’s safety procedures that eventually led to the erection of ‘The Bubble’.</p>
<p>Prior to ‘The Bubble’, front line staff worked in a semi-enclosed space. The large reception area that operated as the intake center for clients, was, like many other reception areas, enclosed only by a counter at the front, about three-and-one-half feet in height. Behind this counter stood a fiberglass-type shield that served as an additional barrier of protection which staff could utilize if and when they felt that an interaction with a client was getting out of control. However, clients could easily gain direct physical access to the workers by simply jumping over the counter, which, as recalled by some staff and management, did happen, even if only irregularly. As one female staff member said of the space: ‘No protection whatsoever! None, none, zero!’</p>
<p>This lack of protection worried management who thought it imperative to safeguard staff from the potential for further catastrophic incidents. They began by inviting security consultants to survey the space and provide recommendations as to how it could be better secured. Numerous recommendations were put in place, but the most significant was the erection of ‘The Bubble’. ‘The Bubble’, as it is referred to fondly by some workers and pejoratively by most, is a fully enclosed space that, being a ‘protective cocoon’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1362480612466564">Giddens, 1991</xref>: 126–133) of sorts, fortifies the space that front line staff work in. It is approximately 10 feet in height and length, but only some six feet in width and thus ends up being a very small space given that it must accommodate at least three staff members at a time, often more given the heavy traffic in-and-out of it (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1362480612466564">Figure 1</xref>). It is rectangular in shape though the front is oval-like. The front of ‘The Bubble’ has a counter that is about three feet in height from the bottom up and another two feet or so from the top down; the remainder, that is, the middle portion, is made up of glass panes. This glass portion also has two windows that allow staff and clients to interact. At the ends of ‘The Bubble’ are two doors that have glass in the middle to enhance visibility. Both sides of ‘The Bubble’ overlook two of the entrances to the shelter, one, the main entrance, the other, a side-door, and both sides are fully composed of glass from top to bottom and thus provide good visibility. However, the visibility from within ‘The Bubble’ overlooking the lobby area is quite poor and staff must rely on the surveillance cameras or the large oval mirror situated on the upper-right hand corner outside ‘The Bubble’ to circumvent this ‘blind spot’.</p>

</fig>
<p>Ostensibly at least, ‘The Bubble’ was meant to be, and is symbolic of, a fortress, one designed explicitly with the primary safety of staff in mind. Some, though not the majority of, staff members think well of ‘The Bubble’ and its capacity to enhance safety. One example nicely brings this to light. While interacting with a severely drunk client in the lobby, a female case worker was physically threatened by him; he called her a ‘bitch’ and threatened to stab her, and while being escorted out of the building by the security guard, warned her that ‘This ain’t far from over.’ The case worker then entered ‘The Bubble’ and proceeded to call the police. While on the phone, and presumably in response to a question about her well-being, she replied, ‘I am in this bubble, so <italic>there is nothing he can do to me</italic>’ (emphasis added)! This statement nicely captures the fact that, at least for her, ‘The Bubble’ is a safe haven that shields and provides solace from the chaos of the shelter, and the mere entrance into it provides a sense of safety that is unmatched, because in this case, ‘there is nothing’ that clients ‘can do’ to staff when in ‘The Bubble’.</p>
<p>While ‘The Bubble’ was envisaged by management as a fortress that would enhance the security of staff, more often than not, it failed to live up to its ideal, not only because of inherent flaws in its structure (see below), but also because of the complacency and nonchalant attitudes of staff. Virtually all the staff members would leave the front door unlocked and ajar—by turning the bolt outwards so that the door could not fully close—when leaving the ‘The Bubble’ for a short period of time (this allowed them easy re-entry without having to use their keys to unlock the door, a sign of their laziness, some even admitting this much). This however, ran blatantly in the face of the type of protection that management had envisaged. On one occasion, a member of the management team walked into ‘The Bubble’ only to find that the door was unlocked in the ways described above. He immediately counseled the two staff members on duty, saying: ‘Keep it locked boys. <italic>That’s why we built this for your safety and security</italic>, so keep it locked’ (emphasis added).</p>
<p>‘The Bubble’ is an apt example of the preoccupation with security that enveloped the thinking of management, one that still continues to preoccupy its thinking. However, it is a particular type of security that is envisaged here, one that is equated and conflated with primary safety. That is, the well-being of staff is equated to well-being in the physical sense and this is said to be present when violence and bodily harm are absent—recall that it was a rare but horrific violent act, the stabbing, that spawned the supposed need for ‘The Bubble’. This is the way management thinks and makes sense of security and ‘The Bubble’, as I have sought to show, highlights the way this thinking is put into practice.</p>
<p>The example of ‘The Bubble’ should not be taken to mean that management is either unaware or unconcerned about a variety of other issues that are pertinent to the lives of staff and clients. They certainly are. Rather, my contention is that in these cases, there is a tendency to treat these as somewhat less important than concerns about primary safety, and in some cases, such as concerns over poor pay, as unimportant. In addition, when these concerns are taken up, they are often funneled into a narrative of and about primary safety. One example puts this into perspective. One major concern that management has is the use of personal laptops or the use of communal computers by members of the staff to ‘surf’ the Internet for private purposes. At one staff meeting this issue was raised by the supervisor who conducted the meeting. In gently admonishing the staff members to refrain from this practice, he, rather adroitly, turned the problem into a problem about primary safety. He suggested that if staff members are preoccupied with ‘surfing’ the Internet, they will be unaware of their immediate surroundings and what is taking place. This, he noted, would put them in danger. ‘We have to be aware of our surroundings’ he cautioned them and then added: ‘The minute we are not is when someone gets hurt … Always be aware of your surroundings, personal space <italic>and be safe</italic>’ (emphasis added). Rather than criticize the staff members for their dereliction of duty to serve the clients, the supervisor turned this failure into one about the safety of the staff. This however, was more than a tactical shift. Rather, it is also representative of a preoccupation with primary safety, where a variety of issues get constructed through such a narrative. ‘The Bubble’, as I have sought to show, is perhaps the clearest example of this. It is also an apt example of the contradictions inherent in security projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1362480612466564">Valverde, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1362480612466564">
<title>The contradictions in security projects: ‘The Bubble’ and insecurity</title>
<p>Without a doubt, ‘The Bubble’ gave rise to numerous undesired, perhaps unanticipated, effects that ran counter to the sort of security that was envisaged by management. One significant issue concerned the relations between staff and clients. One of the effects of seeking to fortify staff from the risks of bodily harm—essentially shielding them from, or at least, reducing, direct physical contact with, clients—was that what was hitherto supposedly a cordial relationship between staff and clients was made tepid and distant, a change that was palpably noticeable to all parties concerned. Unlike before, the newly erected physical barriers further enhanced and reinforced an ‘us versus them’ mentality. ‘The Bubble’ became symbolic of the fear and trepidations that staff, supposedly, held toward clients. This only served to further enhance its infamy. As one client explained to a member of the staff: ‘To most of us, “The Bubble” is the place we don’t know anything about. We know there is staff in there, but we don’t know about it.’ The intimacy and familiarity that clients and staff supposedly shared was now all but eviscerated.</p>
<p>This was a major source of concern to staff members for whom a good working relationship with clients was essential to their well-being, their security, in other words. ‘The Bubble’ had become a source and symbol of insecurity. It was a far cry in practice from the desired effects that were supposed to accrue. Management, for its part, was adamant that the problem was not ‘The Bubble’ per se, but the behavior of the staff. According to management, ‘The Bubble’ was erected to offer unmitigated protection in cases of emergencies; it was not designed nor meant to be used as a ‘permanent’ site for staff to spend time during their shifts at the expense of interacting with clients and patrolling the lobby. As a supervisor put it: ‘the staff are all in … [‘The Bubble’] and they’re chatting away and having a grand old time and everything is happening in the lobby and they’re not paying attention.’ In fact, during the stages when this study was nearing its end, management was in the process of thinking about ways to ensure that staff spend most of their time outside ‘The Bubble’ mingling with clients.</p>
<p>‘The Bubble’ aptly illustrates the possible contradictions of a security project when it is put into effect. Partly, these contradictions speak to the way different actors make sense of security. This is nowhere better evinced than in the way members of the staff translated concerns about health into a security issue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1362480612466564">
<title>Security, health and ‘The Bubble’</title>
<p>One, presumably unforeseen but significant, concern that emanated in, and because of, ‘The Bubble’ pertained to health. To a large extent, this is directly a product of the diminutive size of the ‘The Bubble’ in relation to the number of personnel that it must accommodate. As a staff member succinctly put it: ‘This room is a prison. Everybody sits in here, then everybody gets miserable.’ A recurring problem was that ‘The Bubble’ was often untidy, unclean and littered with trash, this, despite the daily cleaning that it is subjected to by the housekeeping staff in the mornings. On one occasion during an overnight shift a staff member noticed the garbage and paper that littered the space below his chair. ‘What the hell is all this stuff under here?’ he queried to his colleague and then commented: ‘It’s like a garbage can!’ After spending considerable time cleaning the place, he commented to another colleague that ‘The Bubble’ is ‘pretty gross’. The relatively small area in which he worked was, more often than not, ‘like a garbage can’, one that carried with it serious health consequences.</p>
<p>What was also a major health concern was the air ventilation in ‘The Bubble’. On some days, especially in the winter, it was unbearably warm and many male staff members were reduced to wearing their inner T-shirts. The one fan in ‘The Bubble’ was looked upon to provide some solace, though it failed to consistently do so. ‘We were cooking man’, one staff member once commented to a colleague about an exceptionally warm and humid night in the ‘The Bubble’ that he, and I, endured. On other days, it was extremely cold and some staff members would wear sweaters over their sweatshirts, or two sweatshirts, to keep warm. The inconsistent temperature made the working conditions far from pleasant. Much more than pleasantness however, was at stake. Many staff members complained that this inconsistency was making them sick. One staff member went as far as requesting, even, demanding, that management either install a window in ‘The Bubble’ which would provide fresh air from the outside or provide an air purifier; the latter was promptly furnished which made things somewhat better. However, in an effort to find some reprieve from the extreme heat and discomfort that pervaded ‘The Bubble’, staff members would often leave one of the front doors ajar to facilitate better air circulation. This act illustrated the way the very device which was erected as a means of protecting staff members, also placed them at risk of violence and bodily harm (reminiscent of the way <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1362480612466564">Elizabeth Stanko (1990</xref>: 100) speaks of the telephone as a tool of (in)security: ‘By having a telephone women are forced to deal with sexual intrusions, potentially each time the telephone rings’).</p>
<p>The winter months brought additional challenges because of the flu season as highlighted in the following example. One cold and wintry night, a staff member walked into ‘The Bubble’ to begin his shift. He had been battling a severe cold and flu for about a week or so and was clearly showing signs of fatigue—he was at the point where he had virtually ‘lost’ his voice. He blamed his predicament on another staff member whom he believed originally contracted the flu but failed to take precautionary measures, such as seeing a doctor. He had become despondent because of what he saw as inevitable, that is, the spreading of the flu from one to another, which would only prolong his agony. This example speaks to much more than the tensions among members of the staff. While the spread of the flu in the work place is quite common during the winter, in the shelter, it is magnified and exacerbated because of the very small space in which the staff members find themselves in. ‘The Bubble’ then, perhaps unexpectedly, also posed great strife in the life of the staff, in this case, relating to health.</p>
<p>For members of the staff, these health concerns were threats to their security. First, and most obviously, sickness is itself a sign that the body is not secure: it is ill and weak. There is also the possibility of ‘infecting’ fellow family members, a concern especially for those who had young children. In addition, being sick meant that staff would miss work; this was particularly concerning to those who were part-time or still on probation because their absences were not compensated monetarily. Their health, in other words, is their ticket to security, in this case, the security to earn a living and provide for them and their family. They, as many commentators have (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1362480612466564">Burris, 2006</xref>), see health and security as going hand-in-hand.</p>
<p>I do not contend that management was unaware of the problems with and in ‘The Bubble’. They certainly were: two members of the management team even acknowledged that ‘The Bubble’ was poorly designed in terms of space; in addition, furnishing staff with an air purifier was akin to an apology. Rather, it is my contention that these health concerns are not constructed as a security issue by management, because, as I have noted above, security, for management, is largely one about violence and bodily harm. Sickness, while having numerous repercussions that can harm the body, is not equated with the type of harm that is occasioned through violence. In order to further highlight the relationship between security and health and the way management and staff depart in their views, I draw on the example of bed bugs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1362480612466564">
<title>Bed bugs and the signs of insecurity</title>
<p>Bed bugs are, without a doubt, part and parcel of shelter life. It is a significant concern for those who live and work in the shelter, and management has been proactive in addressing this problem, this especially so after a significant outbreak in the shelter just about the time when I began my research. On each of the floors, the points where the walls and floors meet are sprayed every week with insecticides. Management also embarked upon a major renovation of the lockers to address this problem. Prior to the renovation, the lockers were some six feet in height and more problematically, situated from the ground up. New, smaller lockers, about three feet in height, were installed about six inches above the ground so as to ensure that bed bugs would not be able to ‘hide’ in the crevices between where the wall and the lockers meet (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1362480612466564">Figure 2</xref>). This change also provided easier access when the spraying is undertaken. Management also purchased new mattresses which did not contain creases, an important change because it was believed that bed bugs could ‘hide’ in the creases (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1362480612466564">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Not surprisingly, bed bugs are a major source of concern for staff because the potential for contact with a bed bug, and the risk of being bitten, is high, or at least, so it is believed. Virtually all staff members abhor cleaning and emptying lockers<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1362480612466564">2</xref></sup> for a variety of reasons, bed bugs being an important one. They frequently complain that they are not provided with the appropriate equipment, such as industrial gloves, that will adequately protect them, and many often resort to using their own. The fear of being bitten by a bed bug consumes many staff members so much so that some have reached levels of paranoia. One female staff member was bitten by a bed bug, or two, though she is unsure as to how and where this happened. She explains that the marks remained on her body for nearly two weeks and the itching was incessant (even when describing the incident she slightly quivers and mimics scratching her hand). ‘I got bite [sic] in my butt and I am not supposed to get it there’ she tells her colleague. She then quips, ‘Now they owe me a coat because my coat shrunk [sic]’—presumably when she had it dry-cleaned. Her paranoia was revealed to me when she—with the best of intentions—would gently admonish me for leaving my bag on the floor and pick it up and move it to higher ground; this happened virtually every time our paths crossed. Often, she could be found using a flashlight to check her coat for bed bugs. She is however, more than mindful of her paranoia and how unhealthy and consuming it has become.</p>
<p>One example, drawn from an interaction between a member of the front line staff and a supervisor at a staff meeting aptly illustrates the way concerns about bed bugs are translated into concerns about security by members of the staff and their frustration with management for failing to see it as such. The staff member in question had recently ‘carried’ home a bed bug—at least, he only spotted one—and spent a considerable amount of time ‘combing’ his home for more and then thoroughly cleaning it. He was worried about not only being bitten by bed bugs but also of the damage to the property that would be incurred, along with the great inconveniences this would pose him and his wife, and their pets. He was unclear however, of exactly what procedures were in place to compensate staff affected by such incidents. In seeking clarification, what became plainly obvious is that for him—and many other staff members—the concern about bed bugs was not just a concern about health; it was concern about security, the security of life and body (in this case, being bitten by a bed bug and the effects of the bite), the security of property (damaged property that would have to be discarded) and the security of overall well-being and quality of life (his and his wife’s mental health and happiness—he once remarked to me that his wife was unhappy that he was working at a shelter largely because of the concerns about bed bugs, which it appeared, was a mild strain on their relationship). Bed bugs, in other words, became a powerful symbol of the insecurity that pervaded his work and <italic>home</italic> life. The bed bug was a security threat.</p>
<p>The supervisor who listened to the queries of the staff member was sympathetic toward and supportive of him and his situation, or at least, so it seemed. He explained that the shelter had instituted immediate measures—in the way of facilities to take a shower and be provided with ‘fresh clothes’—and more long-term measures—such as paying the costs of fumigating the home, if deemed necessary. These measures and sympathies however, were insufficient to assuage the staff member’s concerns, largely because, conceptually, he and the supervisor were on different ‘pages’. While bed bugs were a significant concern for management, this concern was quite narrow in construction, relating to immediate physical bodily harm and to a lesser extent, harm to property. In the most significant sense, bed bugs were a threat to the good order and governance of the shelter: the absence of bed bugs, in other words, meant that the shelter operated with less hassles. This staff member however, was less concerned with the order and governance of the shelter; rather, he was concerned about <italic>his</italic> well-being both at work and at home. Yet, he found little reprieve because the manner in which management made sense of the problem tended to take the particular, in this case, the staff member, and abstract his concerns into broader concerns about the shelter. His security, to a large extent, only mattered insofar as what it signified about the shelter itself; and even more problematic, his security, as he broadly conceived of it, was largely irrelevant to the issues at hand. Thus, while the supervisor later admitted to me that from the perspective of the staff members, ‘the bedbugs … it’s a safety issue of mental strife …’ his follow-up statement made it very clear that he was less than sympathetic to their position: ‘until they [presumably scientific studies] tell us that the bugs are transferring communicable diseases … then I don’t consider it [a problem]. I just think of them as pests. They’re like fireflies.’ Equating bed bugs to pests—that is, as something that is, at most, a nuisance—meant that it eliminated the possibility of appreciating the potential security threat that members of the staff saw them as. This disjuncture in the conceptualization of security, unsurprisingly, was deeply distressing to many members of staff.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1362480612466564">
<title>‘Governing through security’, the law and the makings of the polysemy of security</title>
<p>While management relies on the logic of ‘governing through security’ to order the shelter, this very logic is also relied upon by members of the staff. Staff members realize that labeling a variety of matters as issues of security provides them with better traction when communicating with management. Ironically however, as I have sought to show, it is the rather overly broad manner in which security is conceptualized that has tended to weaken this traction and caused distress.</p>
<p>To a large extent, it is the law that both demands and facilitates the flourishing of ‘governing through security’. For management, the obsession with primary safety is a product of the legal stipulations that are strongly advocated by the Union. That is, in an effort to abide by the collective agreement, management has taken every precaution—perhaps to the extent of being overly precautionary—to attend to and eradicate violence and bodily harm, so that even the use of personal or communal computers becomes a problem about the potential bodily harm that may violently befall a member of the staff. It is also in the law that staff members find a sympathetic space within which to broadly construct and conceptualize their vast concerns as concerns about security. The Union, again, is one example, but it too draws from extant legislation that allows for such broad constructions. Health is one such example as evinced in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1362480612466564">Occupational Health and Safety Act (1990)</xref> of Ontario.</p>
<p>To illustrate how this can unfold, I draw from what transpired at a mandatory workshop for staff members conducted by the Director of Human Resources. The workshop was titled ‘Training Module for Employees—Creating a Respectful Workplace’. The Director explained that the Module was prompted by the recent amendments to the Occupational Health and Safety Act on 15 June 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1362480612466564">Ontario Bill 168, 2009</xref>). These amendments also required every employer to review its policies regarding violence in the workplace. According to the Director, this required additional material regarding harassment to be covered, because under the shelter’s policy on workplace violence (Operating Policy 03, 06), ‘workplace harassment’ is given a prominent role (section 3.02). In order to discuss ‘workplace harassment’ however, it was necessary to introduce several other topics, namely, diversity and discrimination, which, prima facie, appear to have little to do with violence. In fact, during the entire session, very little was actually said about violence itself. Rather, the session began with a lengthy discussion about diversity, then moved into a discussion about respect and finally, the focus turned to harassment. Under the umbrella of health and safety in other words, a variety of tangential issues became the focus of inquiry and were given prominence.</p>
<p>It is my contention that the broad constructions of ‘health’ and ‘safety’ both in the policies of the shelter and in various legislation, pave the way for staff members to similarly turn a variety of issues into concerns about security. Thus, issues which on the surface appear to have little to do with security, at least, as perceived by management, such as poor pay, work-related stress and health, among others, are all funneled into a narrative of security via the very same logic relied upon by management, that is, ‘governing through security’. It is in this way, I suggest, that the polysemy of security for these actors is produced and sustained over time.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, I have sought to put one, what I hope will be an important, step forward in beginning to fill a deep void in the (criminological) literature on security studies. Taking the call for empirical documentation of what security entails, I have explored the discursive production of the polysemy of security, paying attention to what security looks and feels like to different actors working in a specific setting. What is interesting here are the struggles that take place between management and members of the staff to define and conceptualize what security is, and by extension and more importantly, what it ought to be. It is in these struggles that light on exactly what security entails is shone. These struggles reveal the way each group must resist particular norms of and about security in order to advance particular issues that are relevant to their lives. As I have sought to show, the resistance on the part of the employees is a conscious effort to turn issues that would otherwise fall outside the radar of management into language that is commensurate with that of management’s. This tactic works ‘successfully’ only because employees rely upon the same logic, that of governing through security, that management relies upon heavily. Yet, it is important to remember that management is not a mere pawn to this resistance; rather, it too actively resists the efforts of employees, so that its vision of security, driven in large part by concerns over, even preoccupations with, legality, can predominate. The very meanings about security that unfold in the shelter, in other words, are constituted by a series of struggles to turn particular issues into a commensurate language. This, as I have shown, is facilitated through the logic of ‘governing through security’ which pervades virtually all aspects of society and is a crucial marker of the way life is currently being ordered.</p>
<p>This can be appreciated when recalling that even in a site that is largely, if not primarily, geared toward the delivery of service and welfare, logics and rationales of security not only impact and shape the way they are delivered, but more importantly, seem to trump all other logics and rationales in the ordering of the shelter. Welfare, in other words, is also governed through the logic of security and in that sense, sites such as emergency shelters are not as dissimilar from other sites, such as correctional or military establishments, that are primarily derived for and ordered through security. Therefore, this article highlights the importance of studying and unearthing how various logics and rationales of security dominate sites that are supposed to be, facially at least, governed by a different set of logics and serves as an important reminder to criminology itself that it needs to be flexible enough to branch out into more unorthodox sites of inquiry if it is to come to grips with the polysemy of security and its production.</p>

<p>Earlier versions of this article were presented at the Second Annual National Conference, ‘Critical perspectives: Criminology and social justice’, held at Carleton University, 5 May 2012 and the Law and Society Association Annual Meetings, Honolulu, Hawaii, 7 June 2012, where I received helpful and constructive feedback (this, especially so with respect to the former occasion where a fruitful discussion, largely initiated by some of my colleagues and friends, helped shed some significant and interesting insights, many of which have made their way into this version). I am also extremely grateful to the anonymous reviewers who took the time to read this article and in particular, to four (of the five) reviewers, as well as Mariana Valverde, who provided very helpful and constructive comments that have greatly improved it. Additionally, I am grateful to Lisha Di Gioacchino for her research assistance on this project. What is narrated here would not be possible without the cooperation of the numerous personnel at the shelter who warmly welcomed me and permitted and tolerated my intrusions into their work (and in some cases, personal) lives, all the while patiently responding to the litany of questions that I posed. For this I am extremely appreciative and grateful. The usual disclaimers, of course, apply.</p>

<p>Many scholars have equated homeless shelters to a total institution (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1362480612466564">DeWard and Moe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1362480612466564">Dordick, 1996</xref>: 402; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1362480612466564">Grunberg and Eagle, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1362480612466564">Stark, 1994</xref>), though some have sought to challenge this (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1362480612466564">Marcus, 2003</xref>). A total institution is ‘a place of residence and work where a large number of like-situated individuals, cut off from the wider society for an appreciable period of time, together lead an enclosed, formally administered round of life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1362480612466564">Goffman, 1961</xref>: xiii). In other words, the ‘encompassing or total character is symbolized by the barrier to social intercourse with the outside and to departure that is often built right into the physical plant’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1362480612466564">Goffman, 1961</xref>: 4). This point about the physical barriers to departure is crucial to its definition, where, more so than not, clients or residents are unable to leave of their own volition. This is however, quite different from an emergency shelter, where the clients are free to choose. For this reason, I label emergency shelters as ‘near total institutions’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1362480612466564">De Lint, 1998</xref>: 266, 281, note 1).</p>

<p>Every time a client is discharged from, or of his own volition leaves, the shelter, he is to empty the locker that he was provided. Where this does not happen, which is quite often, staff are tasked with cutting the lock, emptying the locker, bagging the belongings and placing them in storage.</p>
