<p>This article explores the negotiation of a father–son relationship in the context of addiction, as conveyed from the vantage point of the relationship the author maintains with his father. The author conveys narrative fragments to explore a range of facets of the relationship and to illustrate how relationships of this kind often resist easy answers.

<body>
<p>It was commencement for my master’s degree. That day remains strong in my memory for several reasons. It marked a professional accomplishment that would further motivate my goal of becoming an academic. It is also memorable because of something else that happened during the ceremony, something that, this many years later, still reinforces the relationship I have with my father and how I tend to orient myself generally to father–son relationships.</p>
<p>In the crowd were my mother, father, and my then boyfriend, Thomas. It was wonderful to have them there in support of me. As I walked in the processional, from seats to stage, I thought of the lessons this first stage of graduate school had taught me, such as how it began to open my eyes to the ways communication matters, and more particularly, how interpersonal communication and relationships, especially those in the family context, for better and worse, constitute the complex ways we understand each other and ourselves. I thought of the ways this path felt especially meaningful, but how it also presented just as many questions as answers.</p>
<p>The emcee read my name and, as I walked across the stage, I heard someone shout from the stands, “Wayyyyyyy to gooooooooo, Fee!!!” “Fee” was a family variation of “Feifer,” a childhood nickname. It was my father who yelled “Fee” for me that day. The outburst felt wonderful and strange—its reverberations were needed and yet unfamiliar.</p>
<p>Thomas would remind me of that day for years to come, when I struggled with how my father lived with chemical dependency and its effects/affects on the family. He would remind me of that moment when I did not want to hear it, which was often. Thomas would stress the love he felt that moment symbolized, even when I did not see or feel it. He challenged me to open to relational possibilities that might be less visible, when, for me, resistance felt safer. Essentially, Thomas called me to look clearly at/through the contradictions and mixed messages compromising the relationship between my father and me. In doing so, he asked me to understand and accept more fully a relational reversal, a moment that worked uncomfortably against so much of our experience.</p>
<p>This article explores the fashioning of a father–son relationship within the context of addiction, as conveyed from the vantage point of the relationship I maintain with my father. I convey narrative fragments to explore a range of facets of the relationship and to illustrate how relationships of this kind often resist easy answers. Certainly, they are multifaceted interactional processes confounded by the powerful grip of history and emotion. In seeking a clearer understanding of the complexities of the father–son relationship within addiction, I aim for a fuller understanding of the difficulties that motivate and complicate my own recovery.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077800411429088">Carey (1989)</xref> conceptualizes communication as “a symbolic process whereby reality is produced, maintained, repaired, and transformed” (p. 17). Through communication we create, sustain, fix, and alter the ways in which we understand ourselves, others, and how we negotiate worlds together. In turn, interpersonal relationships are multivocal and often contradictory discursive processes, and therefore, are best explored dialectically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800411429088">Baxter &amp; Montgomery, 1996</xref>). In other words, relationships are the consequence of multiple and competing orientations and practices; thus, making sense of them is a dynamic, complex, and often uncertain task. Baxter and Montgomery write, “Relational parties do not enter relationships <italic>tabula rasa</italic> but bring the inner echoes of their socialization experiences with them” (p. 59, italics in original). Relational partners come to understand and enact relationships over time and through diverse voices or influences. At any one time, a range of echoes helps constitute any relationship. Dialectically studying communication and relationships, then, privileges truths over Truth, contingency over certainty, and complexity over simplicity.</p>
<p>This project results from a desire to make sense of what previously have felt like disparate ideas. I convey these experiences believing, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077800411429088">hooks (1999)</xref>, that reflexive writing is “the healing place where I could collect the bits and pieces, where I could put them together again. It was the sanctuary, the safe place” (p. 7; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077800411429088">Berry &amp; Clair, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800411429088">DeSalvo, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077800411429088">Ellis, 2004</xref>). My story joins those persons who write as a means of liberating stories and storytellers.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>We write because language is the way we keep a hold on life. With words we experience our deepest understandings of what it means to be intimate. We communicate to connect, to know community . . . When I sit with words that I trust will be read by someone, I know that I can never be truly alone. There is always someone who waits for words, eager to embrace them and hold them close. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077800411429088">hooks, 1999</xref>, p. 12)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>By seeking a similar sort of connection through my story, I take experiences that previously were kept in solitary confinement to a community of others, persons who might have similar experiences from which I can grow and who might benefit by the telling of mine.</p>
<p>The following fragments serve as echoes of lived experience that help constitute this father–son story. Each fragment gives voice to a distinct and important influence, yet one fragment also can be read with and/or against other fragments, to further underscore, or perhaps even further complicate, the tensions and contradictions inherent in our relationship. Although these fragments are never complete, my hope is that they build toward a fuller story of what has been, and continues to be, an intriguing and, at times, perplexing relational ride.</p>

<title>Relational Echoes of Addiction<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077800411429088">1</xref></sup></title>
<p>My father is many things. He is a long time Irish Catholic Chicagoan who views complaining (e.g., about one’s health, or a long day of work) unproductive and unnecessary. Embedded within cultural messages of his generation are suggestions that husbands “bring home the bacon.” My father routinely woke up early, worked, came home, ate dinner, watched a bit of television, and then fell asleep. Still today, there are few frills in my father’s life. He is a curious mix of stoicism and dry humor, and yet, he is funnier than he lets on to most people.</p>
<p>He is a retired roofer who spent well over thirty-five years of his life laboring daily over hot Chicagoland roofs to provide financially for his family. He worked as a dedicated union member who longed for the benefits of his pension, rewards that would make the neglect this job necessitated on his body more worthwhile. The conditions for roofing were so severe that, on many nights, he would come home with dark reddish-brown burned skin from the scolding hot tar they used on roofs. Still today, I instantly think of him whenever I smell hot tar on nearby rooftops that are under construction or repair. Noxious I suspect for many, this odor calls back my childhood memories of greeting him when he would arrive home and hearing him exhale an exhausted “ooooooh,” as he plopped his sore body down into the family room chair. “Take off my socks,” he would request. It was a game he liked to play. When I obliged, he maneuvered his feet in ways that prevented the socks from coming off, leading them to stretch really long. He eventually would relinquish control over me and I would fall to the ground.</p>
<p>I rarely wanted to play this game as a child. I can now see the game as my father working to connect, in his own way.</p>
<p>“Hi Keith,” says a quiet and shaky voice from the other end of the phone. It is the voice of my father, who has just been released from the hospital. Having again secured and abused many painkillers over the course of several weeks, pills that were not his, pills he obtained without a prescription, he had been hospitalized for the past five days. The emergency room doctors decided to admit him for observation, to make sure he did not stroke out, or have a heart attack while detoxing. “I just . . . wanted you to know . . . I’m home.” (Quiet)</p>
<p>“Good,” I replied. “How are you doing?” (Quiet)</p>
<p>I knew how he was doing. I was on autopilot . . .</p>
<p>Folk wisdom suggests hospitals are places to be avoided. They are common markers of illness and disease. Going, being admitted, and being required to spend an extended stay in hospitals typically indicates that something is, or could be, wrong with our well-being. Loving someone typically means we want the person to stay away from hospitals.</p>
<p>My father’s addiction-related hospitalizations over the past several years have meant that possibly, perhaps this next time, he will see how he needs greater help than he has been given, a greater care than he realizes is needed or has been willing to accept. Yet, even more, they have meant the family receives a break from the challenges associated with living with an active addict. Indeed, while conventional wisdom would suggest we must long for him to be home, that his being home would return us to the love that we all know, that longing has rarely occurred. In fact, while I know my mother often misses him, I sometimes cannot help but detect a certain lilt to her voice during his hospitalizations, as if she is on retreat. Contrary to popular belief, balance and calm often have come from when he has <italic>left</italic> the home. Hospitalization from disease is a way to cope with dis-ease.</p>
<p>I have no clear memories of conversations about, or experiences with, substance abuse issues from my childhood, and I suspect my siblings share in that absence with me. As we grew into adulthood, we became more aware of these issues. Only over the last ten years have we begun to speak with my mother about them. Only recently have we had conversations, and usually indirectly, with my father. We would hear from him of a “pill issue,” without much more being said. Only very recently did we begin to speak frankly with him, daring to extend the conversation, when the problems began to escalate.</p>
<p>I learned from my mother and sister that this time was bad. It was the first time he stayed in the hospital for more than four days and others have referred to him as “strung out.” It was the first time I heard my father in this shape. He was at the lowest point in his addiction.</p>
<p>That night’s phone conversation was gut-wrenching. My father spoke with no guard or self-monitor as he discursively regurgitated the chemical toxins that had pervaded his body, toxins of which he now craved more. Barely able to catch his breath, he spoke sweet relational messages complemented by scary messages about himself and his addiction. He was raw, emotionally and cognitively.</p>
<p>My father had three brief sentences to share with me over the course of an eleven-minute conversation. First, he and my mother and sister were traveling across the state tomorrow to check out a treatment facility. Should he make the trip and admit himself, it would be the first time he has gone through month-long treatment. Second, he loved me. I had begun hearing that from him in recent years; here, couched in his rawness, it felt real and convincing. Third, he was sorry if he had ever done me any harm. I had never heard those words. My mother took over for him on the phone, each time, when an overflow of emotion led him to flee. That night would be the first time I heard my father sob, the echoes of what I expect were his grief and shame traveling across the wooden floors of their house, and between me and my mother.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800411429088">Denzin (1987b)</xref> speaks of alcoholism as creating an “emotionally divided self” (pp. 20-21), and my father’s demeanor during that call stresses how chemical dependency generally “splits” and draws it into conflict persons’ selves. Chemically dependent selves—persons who are on and off chemicals—display distinct characteristics; recovery becomes the process of reconciling divided selves. During our call, it was my father’s voice speaking to me in ways that were Dad-like, in the sense that I know he struggles with the illness. However, they also were not so Dad like, because the self being presented breached who I knew him to be. Indeed, that night marked the first time I came to know intimately the meaning of persons being “beside themselves.” Temporary moments of calmness quickly were overcome by panic and withdrawal . . . then calm . . . then more panic and withdrawal.</p>
<p>Physically and emotionally taxed, my mother was at her own lowest point of the addiction. We both were there, and in a complex emotional space that, upon our hanging up, left me with dissonant feelings. I responded . . . with hope because the urgency of the situation made it seem like we have momentum</p>
<p>. . . with cautious hope, because his denial in the past has been so severe. Indeed, I have seen this sort of play before; its characters, plot, and outcome feel all too familiar.</p>
<p>. . . in ways that are filtered by the hesitation that past hurt makes necessary, by a personal shield that protects me from the possibility (likelihood?) of another negative outcome.</p>
<p>. . . with a feeling of numbness. This response comes not from a lack of desire to think about what could be, but from knowing what has been. It comes from frustration, anger, and fatigue. It comes, again and again.</p>
<p>As expert “baby boomers,” my parents always have been, and still today remain, loyal to television. Growing up I heard stories of my mother’s family walking over to the homes of close neighborhood friends who had televisions to watch Milton Berle. I heard about her family’s first television and the excitement surrounding that purchase, a big deal at that time. Television came to hold special significance; it was an important pastime and family ritual.</p>
<p>Still today, each night of the week, and often each hour of “primetime television,” is dedicated to a given program they are following. Television is an endearing and cute aspect of their relationship that helps bond them. They have “their shows,” and often encourage me to watch the programs myself, perhaps to share in their sharing, and to make them “our shows.”</p>
<p>I remember when cable television first grew in popularity and began to be widely marketed. Salespersons walked door to door through neighborhoods and tried to sign up customers. We subscribed and took to the wider selection of channels and clearer reception. In doing so, we also were taking to television as a captivating instructional tool that helped create an understanding of what it meant to be family and to live as fathers and sons.</p>
<p>The loving family mattered in and to mainstream U.S. culture, and certainly the White and heterosexual family mattered more. The Brady’s, Landon’s, Seaver’s, and Keaton’s, and many others like them, represented <italic>the</italic> snapshot of how we should orient and perform ourselves within the family. They were picture-perfect portraits of loving and nurturing relationships, the epitome of normal. I saw fathers who were present physically and emotionally, a reliable investment that made their sons stand in awe. Fathers and sons were, or worked to become, buddies.</p>
<p>The functional familial unit of this generation was tightly bonded, and family discourse was consistently nurturing. Family members who experienced conflict worked, sometimes painstakingly, and often haphazardly and comically, to return to a picture-perfect stability. When conflict threw families off track, the goal typically was to repair the bond and restore harmony. It was a mediated story that underscores the pervasive belief that interpersonal communication and relationships are, or should be, about making progress; that is, relational partners ought to work to a specific and certain terminus or some end state of relational satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800411429088">Baxter &amp; Montgomery, 1996</xref>). This expectation works in contrast to the dialectical position that advocates both the inevitability of, and the benefits of working within, the messiness of relationships.</p>
<p>Granted, I was never explicitly told by others that the images of family interaction were models I should follow. Still, my loyalty to television taught me that relationships between father and son normally were of that very specific and idealized type. Moreover, while I do not recall ever asking others about my father or about our relationship in these ways, wondering why “dad was not always like them,” the narrative of the ever-present, nurturing, and expressive father established a benchmark against which I would make comparisons. Absent were storylines that related to father–son relationships like mine, and through this absence, media voices tended to distort what “dad” and “dad and son” meant or what it could mean. Through the omission of voices that portrayed stories like mine, they left out stories assuring viewers like me that these sorts of relational challenges happen, they create pain, that we are normal if not tightly bonded, and that, perhaps, things get better. I cannot help but think this myopic representation also presented fathers of the time with an unattainable goal to pursue.</p>
<p>Still today I am uninterested in many televised father–son representations. They feel flat and nauseating.</p>
<p>My mother loves to tell a story from my childhood, and I love that she loves to tell it.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>“I remember getting a call one day,” she tells family and friends. “It was from the kids’ school.”</italic></p>
<p><italic>“Mrs. Berry?” the principal asks</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>“Yes, this is she.”</italic></p>
<p><italic>“I’m calling because right now I have your son in my office.”</italic></p>
<p><italic>“Oh my, which one?”</italic></p>
<p><italic>“Keith. I caught him picking a bunch of flowers on school property.”</italic></p>
<p><italic>“Oh, I’m so sorry, Mr. Kompier.” (Insert dramatic pause for effect/affect.) “I just had major surgery,” she continues. “Keith was probably picking those flowers for me!”</italic></p>
<p><italic>She ends the story with her smile beaming, saying, “What kind of first grader does that!”</italic></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>I was picking flowers for her. While I did not understand surgery at that age, I knew the image of Mom laid up on the couch meant she was not well. The flowers were meant to make her feel better. Thus marks the beginning of a son’s undying love for his mother. It is a love that feels self-evident and pure, a love rooted in deep affection and appreciation.</p>
<p>It also sometimes complicates things, including my relationship with my father.</p>
<p>The word “period” characterizes the communication between my father and me when I was a teenager and in my twenties. This has nothing to do with a love for punctuation. He spoke the word when we talked about things about which we disagreed. “Period” meant the interaction was not going to continue and that his word was “the bottom line.” Hearing this signaled to me that conversations were over, and my perspective would not be heard. Similar to this was his stock phrase, “I don’t get it!” or other short, sarcastic, conversation-halting statements that followed someone in the family saying something that he did not understand and, more likely, with which he did not agree. I grew accustomed to this type of communication and began to expect it—even in times when he probably did not mean to be hostile.</p>
<p>I felt weak and powerless in these interactions. Many people would directly address his insensitive communication, and maybe even tell him to “drop dead.” When I heard them, I stopped trying. My father is not physically violent, so he was not going to cause me bodily harm. However, dare I venture past “period,” I felt as if I had no way of knowing what he would say.</p>
<p>I learned to adapt to my father’s defensiveness in numerous ways:</p>
<list id="list1-1077800411429088" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>I developed keen observational skills that helped me get a sense of his openness for communicating with me, and, if so, what the climate of those interactions might be like.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I began to embrace timing. I carefully attended to those times when I felt I should attempt to communicate with him and those when I should keep things to myself.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I began to communicate by attempting neutral standpoints on the topics we discussed. It felt safer to agree with him. Yet giving no opinion was likely to solicit less of a negative response than offering a disparate one.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I learned to overexplain things. If my father asked me a question, I gave him as much information in my response as I could (i.e., I built a sizable argument), so that he might agree or at least understand, and hopefully not cut me off at the knees. This work to protect was exhausting. I would imagine he also grew tired of hearing me “beat around the bush” and would have preferred to hear me get to the point.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I inadvertently developed a reflection process that involved painstaking mental role play.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I would imagine conflict-oriented scenarios (either real or fictitious) involving my father and me. These were visualizations with powerful visceral reactions. I reflected on things to the point of feeling a heavy, overheated feeling in my stomach and tightness in my chest.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I grew to fear silence and kept myself busy as much as possible. Silence afforded too much time to reflect on and feel my anger and hurt. It encouraged me to listen carefully in order to hear what he was doing in other rooms and to see whether he was about to approach me. Keeping busy and staying outside the house helped me avoid him, his communication, my disconfirmation, and even becoming hostile with him.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>I told no one in my family about the ways I managed these interactions. Yet I am fairly certain they employed their own practices in pursuit of a similar end: the comfort and emotional safety typically made possible by avoidance. Now I more fully understand how these ways of performing are indicative of a family system struggling through active addiction. Yet, at the time, I did not have the language to share distress, and distance felt safer. I did not have a way to express how coping with aggressive behavior meant becoming a different person.</p>
<p>Indeed, I became through these interactions many selves within the same skin, including a consummate planner, who sought to control actions as much as possible; a prompt and reliable fixer, who put out any small fires before they became five-alarm infernos; a ruminator, who had to run through things in his head as much as possible; and a peacemaker, who relentlessly and exhaustingly sought to maintain whatever sort of balance he could. I became a teenager and young adult averse to spontaneity in this relationship and others like it.</p>
<p>This transformation reveals how identity is not just developed through communication, but negotiated, and following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077800411429088">Jackson (2002)</xref>, “As with any negotiation, there is the possibility of gaining, losing and/or exchanging something . . . [i]n this case, that something that is at stake is identity” (p. 245). Based on how we lived this illness, I became many things, including a coping self who stayed during hardship, and a vulnerable self robbed of becoming selves who otherwise might have been. I necessarily became someone whose interactions implied that pursuing certainty, even if untenable, was mandatory. What does, could, or will each interactional moment mean? The thirst for predicting and controlling my surroundings was deep and yet unquenchable.</p>
<p>“All that I am, or hope to be, I owe to my angel mother.” I first heard this sentiment, one often attributed to Abraham Lincoln, when my mother delivered a eulogy for her mother. It was the perfect complement to a speech honoring the long life of my Gram, a spectacular woman who survived a number of challenges of her own. It is also a perfect compliment to my Mom.</p>
<p>My mother is many things. She is a retired teacher of forty years, whose impact on young hearts and minds has been invaluable and immeasurable. “Touch your shoulder, and Mrs. Berry is there,” is a saying she would persistently tell her students. She was, and still is, a master teacher outside of the conventional classroom; she leans toward others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800411429088">Pelias, 2011</xref>) in ways that exude care. Mom persistently leans confidently and warmly. She has lived in ways that expertly perpetuate the loving model of her mother and also have resulted in her not always taking care of herself as she should. Through her sacrifice, however, her children gained.</p>
<p>Mom resembles, for me, a prototypical mother innately sheltering her children through the hardships of addiction in the family. As a converted Catholic of her generation, her attitude always suggested that staying in the relationship was imperative, for the well-being of her children. She has always loved my father, and still does. Through her mothering, Mom taught us the importance of family, and of living compassionately. We were encouraged to be socially active and responsible, and always . . . <italic>always . . .</italic> to live with a positive attitude.</p>
<p>“This too shall pass” is a favorite mantra of hers, and it was a favorite of her mother’s as well. If we steel ourselves long enough and have faith, the stormy climate at hand will leave us alone, and sunshine shall return. As a source of great strength, “This too shall pass” can help us persevere through many obstacles that fall in our way. Certainly I have benefited in many ways from living through a dedicated positive orientation. On the other hand, if not associated with proper action taking, I fear it (and other mantras like them) also serves as an anesthetic that numbs wounds and downplays conflict situations that need confrontation. It can prevent persons from performing in ways that show that harsh climates sometimes merit a direct and sustained response and that doing so may even be enjoyable.</p>
<p>When I was twenty-five years old, I “came out” to my father during a violent thunderstorm that knocked out the power to our house. In the dark, with Dad sitting in his chair, and me sitting across the room on the couch, I stumbled through a rehearsed paragraph in which I told him that I was gay. I said many difficult things, including my not wanting to disappoint him, not wanting him to feel responsible, and that I did not choose to be gay. Such gay coming-out clichés! He told me he knew I was gay, stood up, stumbled with his severely damaged knees across the dark room, and told me, “You’re my son. I love you and will always love you.” I like to tell people that the name of my “coming out” story is, “When the Lights Went Out, I Came Out.” Since then, from time to time, should the lights go out in a room in which both my dad and I are, he will smile and ask me whether I had something important to tell him.</p>
<p>Seeking clarity on the nature of relationships necessarily calls us to be clear on the nature of identity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077800411429088">Schrag (1997)</xref> writes, “We are dealing not with a single, unitary, sharply defined portrait, but rather with a portrait that is itself curiously diversified . . . a multiplicity of profiles and perspectives through which the human self moves and is able to come into view” (p. 1). Thus, we are many persons within, and performing through, the same body. Multiple aspects of our identities shape how we negotiate our relationships, including sexual identity.</p>
<p>It would take some time, but my father would come to learn that being gay can be understood and lived in affirming and “normal” ways. I trace some difficulties in his adjustment to the generation from which my father comes, and some to his illness. However, I also associate some of the struggles I lived through, those at the time that felt exclusively “Dad-related,” with having little to do with my father, and plenty to do with my own working to understand and accept myself during an even more heteronormative and homophobic generation than today’s. After all, missing from that generation were affirming voices like Lady Gaga singing “Born this Way,” and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077800411429088">Savage and Miller (2011)</xref> telling LGBTQ youth, “It gets better.”</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800411429088">Gadamer’s (1960)</xref> conceptualization of play suggests that we immerse ourselves in the “to and fro” of moments of lived experience (“art”) to escape from life’s seriousness. This escape, the “play,” entails a loss of subjectivity, and an eventual emergence from this activity as reconfigured human beings. Thus, while we may “lose ourselves” in play, we always “exit” play changed.</p>
<p>My father’s family has constituted a fertile playground of this sort, largely sustained through humor, throughout much of my life. The matriarch of the family, my father’s mother, would often stop conversations at family gatherings, wet her fingers, and entertain us by “playing her nose” (actually, she was secretly humming). She took requests too! Her favorite was Tiny Tim’s “Tiptoe through the Tulips.” Play often took many bizarre forms for the Berry’s.</p>
<p>As a young adult, I developed a close relationship with my sister, which I still cherish. Throughout our twenties, we developed and would rely heavily on our “shtick.” “What if” or “imagine if” questions were a significant part of our repertoire. These typically centered on things that breached everyday expectations of human behavior. For instance, I recall my sister, Chad, a close family friend, and I eating out at a restaurant. Out of nowhere, she grabs our attention by saying, “Imagine if, suddenly, a clown came out of the kitchen on giant stilts, walked passed our table, and said hello.” In kind, our friend and I give our own scenarios, and our communication becomes a chain of these imaginary questions. I remember another occasion when I was writing on my computer at home and talking on the telephone with my sister. Without any sort of segue from the ordinary topic at hand, I told her that a small bear was happily skipping past my window. She says, “Oh nice,” and we returned to our previous conversation topics, only for me to later work into our conversation a subtle comment like “oh, by the way, the bear is back.” My sister replies, “What does he want this time?”</p>
<p>Humor-infested play still fills my life today, and across a number of relational contexts. The talk between my friend Tony (nickname “Sparks,” sometimes “Sparkles”) and me (“Charles,” sometimes “Charlie”) is complemented by momentary or sustained escapes: creative rearranging of names, guessing games, and outlandish questions, just to name a few. As we live in different states, we often talk multiple times a day on the phone, which has led Sparks’ partner, Jerry (“Fuzz”), to name us Wilma and Betty. I think of us more in contemporary terms as Oprah and Gayle. With students, I intersperse humor during serious class discussions, both as a means of breaking from the intensity of talking about tough cultural topics and as a way to make complex topics more accessible and less threatening. I tend to want more play in work conversations with colleagues, although my sense that others are not always wishing or willing to be as playful prompts me (usually) to tone down escapes.</p>
<p>Not every moment is playful, but every playful moment is rich. Moreover, this play might be silly, but silly in the context of hardship is not without purpose. For instance, play of this sort offers release, even if momentarily, from the intensity of the moment at hand. It creates a temporary distance and reprieve from life’s seriousness; thus, play enables a much-needed and healthy way of coping with disease. Also, within this particular mode of playing dwells a related point of interest. The rapid interactional “to and fro” tends to stress the importance of timing, or needing to be quick on one’s feet, something so critical in the serious everyday encounters that often occur within the relational space of active addiction. Thus, there appear to be no clean breaks, or at least total escapes, in terms of how we communicate when vacillating between nonplay and play.</p>
<p>I stand to the left of my mother’s hospital bed, with my brother and sister on her right. Mom is recovering in the hospital’s intensive care unit after successful bypass surgery. She is ventilated, fidgeting, and struggling to open her eyes—an image I do not believe I was ever prepared to see. Although barely with us physically, as she hears each of our voices, Mom smiles and squeezes our hands. That small physical gesture means that Mom is still there, that she will return to us relationally once she is able.</p>
<p>Soon thereafter, something happened that still intrigues me today. Mom grabbed my hand and, with her cold little fingers drew the letter “D” and a question mark in my palm. Before the surgery, she had expressed concern about how my father would cope during the surgery. Therefore, I am confident the gesture meant “Dad?” “He’s doing great, Mom,” I lied. “He’s resting at the hotel.”</p>
<p>My mother’s cardiologist told the family that bypass patients rarely remember anything from the week of their surgery, because of the heavy amounts of anesthesia and painkillers they consume. Mom’s process confirmed this counsel. We will never know what she meant in that moment. It could have asked, “Is Dad working ahead through the painkillers I had put into three weeks worth of envelopes?” That is the interpretation I worked with for some time, as a result of what was a very turbulent week with him during her hospitalization. It is the interpretation I tend to believe, and with which I now would be at peace, if it were accurate. After all, at the time of the surgery, my parents had been married for forty-five years. Seeing his wife in that condition must have been a traumatic experience; thus, a relapse might have happened, especially without his having developed healthy coping skills that might have helped him more effectively negotiate his fear and sadness. And yet, the gesture also could have asked, “Is Dad okay? He loves me dearly and this will throw him. Is he okay? Give him hugs for me.” It could also have asked a combination of these ideas, and it could have meant something altogether different.</p>
<p>For months I fumed and vented to others about the chaos of the week and how painful it was to have our mother begin her cardiac recovery without his steady presence by her side. I was angry. I could not comprehend how, given all that she has done for my father, and especially in the last ten years with respect to his failing health, he could not be fully present. I saw my mother cry in her hospital bed that week about my father and listened to her say things no son wants to hear a beloved mother say. I lived my Mom’s tears that week as if they were my own. Yet, this time, no bouquet of flowers could make things better.</p>
<p>“Hi Keith,” I again hear my father’s voice on the other end of the telephone. It has been four weeks since my father hit his bottom; indeed, since all my family hit our bottom. After much coaxing by my sister, Dad admitted himself to treatment that next morning. As a successful business owner, it most certainly was her best sales job ever. By admitting himself to treatment he made help available for himself in ways that could finally begin to compete with the illness. He admitted himself to potential for major life change.</p>
<p>This solitary man would need to spend the next four weeks living with others (i.e., sleeping, cooking, and cleaning alongside roommates) and endure weeks of extensive individual and group therapy. He would participate in a number of types of therapy and extracurricular activities, learning in treatment about the importance and benefits of honest self-disclosure, confrontation, and emotionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077800411429088">Denzin, 1987a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800411429088">1987b</xref>), and keeping oneself busy throughout the day, and by living healthy choices. In this particular treatment center, he would be immersed in art, music, and equine therapy—discovering through arts and crafts, playing music with others, performing on stage, and visiting with and brushing horses. He would be asked to work out regularly and spend time on the beach and water. He would be required to learn about a new way of looking at his past life and the impact of his choices and would need to come to a new way of looking at relationships and, most important, himself.</p>
<p>“I’m out and doing well!” my father said enthusiastically and strongly, after completing the full month’s stay. I hung up feeling impressed and proud—still feeling dis-ease, and thus guarded, yet hopeful nonetheless. He had done what many of us had hoped for, and frankly, what I had been sure would never happen.</p>
<p>I am many things. I am a forty-year old academic who loves what I do; who conducts research, writes, and teaches in ways that feel meaningful; who remains a proud Chicago native who also appreciates the beauty of life in Duluth, MN/Superior, WI; and someone who believes that experiences inherent to the illness of addiction teach us lessons and shape us into persons who can emerge positively, with beneficial ways of performing (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800411429088">Berry, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Whereas at twenty-five I came out to my parents as gay, I come out here at forty as a “mama’s boy” who meant well, but who sometimes has been blinded by love and anger. I come out as someone whose experiences within the difficult space of addiction created the conditions that make possible an inability to negotiate boundaries consistently, and in healthy ways. I now see ways in which I have owned some of my mother’s experience with my father. I sought to carry and protect her, much like she did for her children. My anger for how his illness has impacted her likely has amplified my anger for him. My point here is that this mama’s boy is coming to terms with how the relationship I have maintained with my father is always, at least in part, interconnected to my understanding of my relationship with my mother, and particularly how I believe she has been hurt by his illness.</p>
<p>In essence, my ways of responding positioned me as a surrogate spouse. At times I tried to fill the emotional gaps for her that I felt my father left open, as she so masterfully did for my siblings and me. To be sure, Mom never asked for this surrogacy, and would never want “her problems” to lead me to “worry about her.” Nonetheless, she did not need to ask. I was working off impulse. The “choice” in responding felt natural.</p>
<p>It has been nearly two months since my father finished treatment. He is practicing a strong program of recovery, which means consistently attending different group meetings across the city. He tells us he is happy he went through treatment and wonders what would have happened had he not done so. Now, he and the family are immersed in the process of reconciling a new normal, as we work to discern who we are to ourselves and each other. We are now working through a quixotic relational shift that is perplexing and intriguing, a shift that includes a “new start” relationally, a “restart” that informs the ways I now relate with my father.</p>
<p>Present now is a fatherly-self-just-in-recovery who persistently—relentlessly—performs as engaged parent: “Call [me] a lot, Keith!” “We’re both here for you, you know that, right?” A fatherly-self-just-in-recovery who has elevated his level of disclosures and humor; who says things that make this un-blushable son come close to blushing; who relates in ways that motivate me to have extended and enjoyable phone conversations with him; who communicates ‘minimal encouragers’ as we chat, to demonstrate he is actively listening; who follows up on past topics reliably and genuinely; who offers ‘thank you’ after I let him know ‘I understand’ his being frustrated about losing memory; who communicates opinions and emotions through ‘I statements’; who sleeps regularly as a result of living a healthy life, and therefore, is available at times that have been unavailable for many years; who speaks both literally and metaphorically; who talks openly about his shortcomings; who talks with optimism; who talks and talks. . . .</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800411429088">Baxter and Montgomery (1996)</xref> explain the twin impulses in any one relationship of autonomy and connection, wherein relational partners desire and interact from a place illustrating separation and closeness. Amid this shift, my father performs from a space suggesting the desire for heightened closeness, a space markedly absent from our relationship in the past. I think I want to be close, but this new movement pursuing closeness is difficult, because so much of how I know him, and he and I together, is the stuff of separation. Although our relationship in recent years had grown to be stronger, the performance of new Dad is often overwhelming, prompting me to share with family and friends, “He needs to slow down!” Indeed, at this point, my father likely does not want to waste any more time and is now motivated to make up for that which has been lost. I want and need a reasonable amount of time and space for adjustment, to allow the hurt previously motivating distance to dissipate, as more positive encounters take place.</p>
<p>Once again my father is beside himself, but now on the other side of his illness, performing as a different person. Certainly there are aspects of his present identity that feel as though they resonate with the father I knew in the past. Yet he is also a stranger, often contradicting assumptions about what he will say and who he is. Present now in beautiful ways is a liberated self; indeed, the drugs of his past that muted his voice no longer have the same hold. The same can be said for those of us who love him. At the same time, this fatherly-self-just-in-recovery also is a jarring self, whose interactions are typically novel, and whose performances of self position him in many ways as someone we are just getting to know for the first time. His transformation unsettles as much as it intrigues. It prompts questions about what I know to work and feel correct and safe communicatively.</p>
<p>“The only day that matters is today,” Dad has shared with me on several occasions since he returned home. “Ya know, Keith, we just glance at the past.” Hearing this from him evidences how this central tenet of treatment and recovery has made an impact on him and reminds us he is practicing a recovery program. By living in the now, he works to let go of the shame and guilt of past indiscretions. By being present, he takes life one day at a time, which helps make the stressors of life more manageable.</p>
<p>Being present or mindful is a way of living I have practiced for years. It has carried me in many beautiful ways, through both pleasure and pain. Now with my father, I typically am able to be present; yet, because of our history, this is not an easy task. Things seem to be moving forward so quickly. Also, I find myself longing for the “making amends” step of recovery and wonder when, or whether, that day will come. Does his pretreatment apology, where he was sorry if he has ever done me harm, “count” for the amends? Will there be a more explicit and specific conversation of wrongdoing from the past?</p>
<p>The struggle to embrace “presentness” in this recovering relationship is particularly significant when I hear stories that essentially “out” him for lying to us. Those moments send me back to moments in which I was let down or moments when I thought Dad was genuinely sick, not altered or hungover.</p>
<p>I feel better and happier with this new relationship; yet I also wonder whether my father knows how much harm he has done. I want him to know, but I do not want to harm him or his recovery. I want him to hear me, but I do not feel as though that conversation should need to take much time. I simply want to be heard.</p>
<p>Before returning home from treatment, my father stopped by a local tattoo parlor and got his first tattoo. Appearing on the upper part of his left arm and near his shoulder is a large and colorful eagle. The facility where he did his treatment uses in their teaching the metaphor of the bald eagle, stressing its beauty and strength, as well as the ability to rejuvenate and transform its life. Dad is very proud of the tattoo and recently returned to the city of his treatment to get more ink, two complementary symbols appearing directly below each of the eagle’s talons: “freedom” and “4/15/11” (his sobriety date).</p>
<p>He tells us the tattoos are symbols of his recovery and enjoys talking about them. For instance, just the other day I called my parents to talk, and Dad answered.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>“You walk today yet, son?” he asked me, soon after we began talking. He knows I have been working again to take better care of myself.</p>
<p>“Nah,” I responded, “It’s raining today.”</p>
<p>“Ah, come on,” he encourages, “why let a little rain stop ya?!?”</p>
<p>“I might later, when the storm lets up.”</p>
<p>“When storms come,” my father swiftly responded, “all the other birds find a place to hide.” (Dramatic pause.) “The eagles soar above the storm.”</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>During the brief period of time since my father successfully completed the treatment program, there have been moments when “past Dad” and “past Keith and Dad” still show themselves. Learning and (un)learning within the context of overcoming hardship takes time and concerted efforts. We all are learning new ways to relate. Indeed, we all are in recovery, and I remind myself that relapses can (and shall?) happen.</p>
<p>The eagle concept my father used to encourage me, like so many moments in his new recovery, feels odd yet inviting. I am struck by the smoothness with which he went to the passage communicatively, how beautifully it worked in interacting with me, and how it felt persuasive and yet not aggressive. Who is this man? He sounded like a teacher who does not demand but finds accessible ways to engage students. He sounded like the professor I try to be. I heard “me” in Dad’s encouragement. I heard someone with whom I could relate more comfortably. I hope he stays.</p>

<title>Reconciling the Echoes</title>
<p>We have been battered by modern times into obsessive problem solvers, but as life pares us down into only what is essential, it becomes clear that the deepest sufferings of heart and spirit cannot be solved, only witnessed and held. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800411429088">Nepo, 2000</xref>, p. 222)</p>
<p>I end this story, not trying to “problem solve,” but by reflecting on what the understanding(s) that come to light through this account might mean for a son in recovery. I briefly take inventory on the dynamic nature of the father–son relationship in this context and use that insight to contemplate my own recovery.</p>
<p>I am struck by how numerous voices shape this and other relationships within the family, by the ways feelings, and especially pain, anger, and hope, drive interaction and perception; how multiple messages come to shape a relationship of this sort, a reality making any attempt to identify one interpretation for behaviors seem futile; how the changing nature of communication feels especially pressing in the context of addiction and recovery; the ways boundaries between relational partners are often overlapping, and within the context of addiction, perhaps especially so; and how easy it is within these experiences to internalize communication, problems, and troubled relationships, that is, how easy it is to relate too closely to relationships, to become consumed by them. In this way, the father–son relationship in the context of addiction begs for especially open-ended and uncertain understanding(s). Certainly the echoes “cannot be solved, only witnessed and held.”</p>
<p>Especially clear here is what a recovering son can take from this reflexive journey, not to “fix,” but to work to a newer and fuller understanding of this relational experience. Indeed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077800411429088">hooks (1999)</xref> writes, “Writing is a way to clarify, to interpret, to reinvent” (p. 12). So, as I begin to reinvent myself for the next chapter in this relationship’s story, I work to be present and sit with the complexities. However, I also believe that coming to a newer understanding is best honored by contemplating ways to incorporate these insights into this newly created life. And so, I end by contemplating what is ahead of me, what recovery means for me.</p>
<p>Recovery entails working to distinguish the relationships I maintain between me and my father and mother, even though my heart feels like I will always be closer to Mom. I know I will always care deeply for her in ways that put boundaries at risk. However, I also know that, so long as I am aware of that tendency, and am still more owning and taking care of my own life (vs. others), I will feel at peace. And that cultivated sense of peace, in turn, I would like to feel, can only help the ways I build a new relationship with my father.</p>
