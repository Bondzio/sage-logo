<p>In the past decade sex trafficking has become a major crime concern and the scale of this phenomenon generates much attention domestically and internationally in policies, policing and legislation. This book analyses the frameworks and the design of policy responses and their implementation to tackle sex trafficking in Australia, a major destination site, and in Serbia and Thailand, both major source, transit and destination countries. The authors interviewed a range of contributors including those working in state and non-state organisations which include policy-makers, representatives of NGOs, law enforcement officials and trafficked women in order to understand victims’ experiences. In the paradigm of the Three Ps (Prevention, Protection and Prosecution), the authors expose the failures of state and non-state organisations in understanding the complexity of entrapment and the journeys of women. Through identification, prosecution and support initiatives the book draws attention to women’s treatment and how they are ‘diagnosed’ by the ‘experts’, who define their experiences according to a set of predetermined ‘symptoms’. Additionally, the book effectively emphasises the problematic approaches in the Three Rs (Repatriation, Reintegration and Rehabilitation) and how this can reduce women's independence and self-determination. It identifies the need for a critical criminological and feminist agenda to recast the problem of sex trafficking and outlines the need for a victim-centric approach that current responses in dominant law enforcement struggle to meet.</p>
<p>Segrave, Milivojevic and Pickering outline how prostitution and immigration are connected with the issue of sex trafficking and how the issue of border control strategies plays its role in the interventions and policies produced. In its examination of sex trafficked women we see the journey of women draw on gendered and racialised understandings of victims which are disparate from the issue of violence against women (VAW) and their exploitation. Women not identifying as victims of trafficking can be predominantly constructed as law-breakers themselves which aligns them with illegal migrants and sex workers. Unless they are perceived as an ‘ideal’ victim, their ‘performance’ legitimises this and concurs with the stereotypical conceptualisation of trafficked women; they are treated as criminals. The criminal justice process highlights how women can be conceived to have contributed to their own victimisation and are subject to judgement from the point of identification and beyond. What is clear is the primary focus in the criminal justice process and in border control to manage trafficked women through processes where victims are constructed as ‘tools’ for the prosecution and ongoing support is linked to the criminal justice process. Underlining policy and practice is the powerful ideology of women's ‘proper place’, ‘home’ and ‘belonging’, which fail to address migration, mobility and the choices of women.</p>
<p>Whilst short-term support can be accessed, the neoliberal state is reducing and the responsibility of ‘recovery’ ultimately lies with women, who will be open to criticism if they fail. The state's intervention could be seen to be politically motivated at the heart of responses and leaves little for women to access in terms of practical help either in countries of destination or source. A key critique of the book is that responsibility is effectively and consistently evaded by state and non-state actors. Trafficked women who avoid strategies of support highlight the inadequacy of existing support frameworks, which is a valuable contribution in ensuring that women are not silenced or marginalised in our collective responses. This book addresses the importance of women's voices at the heart of anti-trafficking responses and how initiatives located within the law and order framework can further expose women to abuse and ill-treatment by those tasked with their protection. This book outlines the need for a more nuanced and sophisticated account of women's needs and an improvement in framework and policy to effectively tackle trafficking, and as such will be beneficial to those involved in improving current programmes and policy.</p>
