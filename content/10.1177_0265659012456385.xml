<abstract>
<p>This article reports a series of interviews with education and health practitioners. The aims were to identify interventions used in practice with children with speech, language and communication needs, to explore explanations for the choice of intervention and to identify the ways that outcomes were measured. Participants (<italic>n</italic> = 61) included educational psychologists, speech and language therapists and education advisory staff. They talked about interventions in terms of published programmes, principles and activities, strategies, resources and training programmes. There was evidence of local adaptation of interventions and wide development of local programmes. The choice of intervention was governed by a desire to meet identified service gaps and with reference to the evidential and/or theoretical basis of the intervention and the practicalities of the intervention. Outcomes were typically measured at the level of the individual rather than a service level. The study provided insight into the range of interventions in current practice, how service managers justify intervention choices and measure outcomes. The data from this study informed a national survey to examine patterns of usage of interventions.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>In 2008, the Bercow Review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265659012456385">Bercow, 2008</xref>) of services for children and young people with speech, language and communication needs (SLCN) called for the establishment of a research programme to ‘enhance the evidence base and inform delivery of better outcomes for children and young people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265659012456385">DCSF, 2008</xref>: 10). The UK government of the time responded by commissioning a programme of research (known as the Better Communication Research Programme <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.warwick.ac.uk/go/bettercommunication">http://www.warwick.ac.uk/go/bettercommunication</ext-link>) to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions. The concern was to improve understanding of what interventions work for children and young people with SLCN so that commissioners might develop services that were more effective and cost-effective. A number of projects arose from that programme of work, and these are described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265659012456385">Lindsay et al. (2010)</xref>. One project aimed to identify the research evidence available for interventions currently in use in both education and health services. As a first step it was therefore necessary to identify what interventions were being used with children with SLCN. This article describes that process.</p>
<p>Previous reviews of services for children with SLCN have focused on the range of provision in terms of educational placements for children and young people with SLCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265659012456385">Lindsay et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0265659012456385">2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265659012456385">2005b</xref>). Studies have also surveyed practitioners’ modes of delivery of intervention (e.g. group, direct, indirect) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265659012456385">Fuller, 2010</xref>). The latter study focused on the nature and delivery of speech and language therapy within local Sure Start programmes (similar to Head Start programmes in the USA). Other studies of practice have surveyed speech and language therapists’ (SLTs’) use of interventions for children with speech problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659012456385">Joffe and Pring, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0265659012456385">McLeod and Baker, 2004</xref>) and receptive language impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265659012456385">Law et al., 2007</xref>). The two studies of speech interventions focused on interventions already mentioned in the research literature. They also investigated delivery processes such as frequency, and factors influencing the choice of intervention. Both surveys, one in the UK and one in Australia, concluded that individual SLTs favour particular interventions, although some that are mentioned in the literature were rarely used in practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659012456385">Joffe and Pring (2008)</xref> also found that SLTs typically combined interventions.</p>
<p>In contrast to these previous surveys, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265659012456385">Law et al. (2007)</xref> started with an open question about interventions in use. They asked SLTs to identify a child from their caseload with receptive language impairment and to outline three activities they had recently used with that child, giving practical reasons and explicit rationales for their choice. Participants’ descriptions of interventions fell into two categories, focusing on skills acquisition and metacognitive skills. About one third of the explanations of intervention choices related to the underlying deficit such as processing limitations. The rest were described as ‘theories of therapy’ where there is no direct reference to an underlying deficit and the focus was more on the aims of the intervention.</p>
<p>These previous studies have focused on interventions for specific groups of children. In contrast, the aim of the study described here was to gain an understanding of interventions used across the full range of SLCN. Furthermore, the focus was on the interventions used by services as a whole rather than the practice of individual practitioners.</p>
<sec id="section2-0265659012456385">
<title>1 Defining intervention</title>
<p>Since we planned to identify interventions inductively from the reports of service managers and team leaders, it was useful to investigate how interventions had been described in the literature. However, this was not quite so straightforward since there were a variety of definitions. At its broadest, an intervention is viewed as an action or technique or activity or procedure (or indeed combinations of these) that reflects a shared aim to bring about an improvement, or prevent a negative outcome, related to a child’s speech, language and communication skills; this can also include the modification of factors that are barriers or facilitators to change and the modification of an environment to facilitate communication development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265659012456385">Bunning, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265659012456385">Dockrell and Messer 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0265659012456385">Dollaghan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0265659012456385">Law et al., 1998</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0265659012456385">Law et al. (1998</xref>: iii–iv) define intervention as ‘an explicit application of therapeutic/educational techniques intended to modify an individual’s performance in a designated area associated with communication’. Words such as treatment, therapy, intervention, and remediation are used interchangeably although they carry slightly different connotations, some more medically oriented than others.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265659012456385">McCauley and Fey (2006)</xref> present a model of intervention that identifies components that, they suggest, should be made explicit in the development or description of an intervention. The model covers the goals of intervention, the goal attack strategies, procedures, dosage, who delivers the intervention and the context in which it is delivered as well as the monitoring and assessment processes to be used. In an analysis of therapies used in acquired aphasia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265659012456385">Byng and Black (1995)</xref> identify key components of therapy including the design of the task and how it was explained, the stimuli and materials used, the nature of the interaction between therapist and patient, the feedback and facilitation provided as well as the duration and intensity of intervention.</p>
<p>In the research literature evaluating interventions, the specifics of an intervention have sometimes been lacking. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0265659012456385">Pickstone et al. (2009)</xref>, in a systematic review of interventions that target a child’s environment, commented on the variability of detail that is given by research reports. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265659012456385">Pawson (2006)</xref> criticizes the rather sloppy use of the word intervention. He argues that it is used as a catch-all term that conflates various activities such as clinical treatment, a healthcare programme or a training programme that are often quite dissimilar, leading to confusion about what is being described.</p>
<p>Against this confusing background, we set out to identify the interventions currently in use by health and education professionals with children with SLCN. The first stage was a qualitative study which aimed to gather data from service managers about the interventions being used in their service.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0265659012456385">
<title>2 Research questions</title>
<p>The aim of this project was to map the interventions that are used with pupils with SLCN. In particular we aimed to:</p>

<title>II Method</title>
<sec id="section5-0265659012456385">
<title>1 Overall design</title>
<p>The research study adopted a qualitative design based on individual and small group semi-structured interviews. Key personnel from Local Authorities and NHS Trusts with responsibility for provision for children and young people with SLCN were approached regarding their participation in the study. At the time, other projects, commissioned from the governments’ Better Communication Action Plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265659012456385">DCSF, 2008</xref>) and known as the Pathfinder projects, were starting to examine aspects of joint commissioning. Initial contacts were made through these Pathfinder sites in order to create links between the two programmes of work. Some additional Local Authorities and NHS Trusts who were known through previous research programmes were also approached in order to establish a sample of services that were geographically diverse.</p>
<p>Interviewing followed an iterative process, so that data collected were fed back into successive interviews. All interviews were taped and field notes were taken at the time of the interviews. The tapes were not fully transcribed; instead, on-line analysis of the interviews was carried out using a structured format to collate the answers to each question. Recordings were used to provide clarification and to check for the detail of participants’ wording. Service documents were collected in order to provide context about how specific interventions were used within service care pathways.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0265659012456385">
<title>2 Sample</title>
<p>The sample covered 14 different areas: six rural counties, seven urban and one inner London Local Authority (LA), with a spread around England. Interviews were held with senior managers from 10 Educational Psychology Services (EPS) and 14 National Health Service (NHS) Speech and Language Therapy Services. In 10 of the 14 areas, Speech and Language Therapy Services were in the same locality as the EPS. It was decided to interview managers since they would have an overview of the interventions used in their service; however, managers were also encouraged to include their team leaders and relevant associated service managers. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0265659012456385">Table 1</xref> summarizes the interviews that took place and the participants involved in each interview. In total, 61 practitioners were interviewed: 13 Educational Psychologists (EPs), 33 Speech and Language Therapists (SLTs), and 15 managers of local authority specialist advisory teaching teams (LAs). The latter group of participants had various designations, which included references to SLCN, inclusion, sensory services, communication and interaction.</p>

<title>3 Procedure</title>
<p>Two phases of interviewing took place. The first phase was piloted with a range of LA and NHS SLT managers and team leaders in one LA. Data from this pilot were used to inform development of the final version of the interview (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0265659012456385">Appendix 1</xref>). Respondents were first asked how they defined groups of children with SLCN and how they defined the terms ‘universal’, ‘targeted’ and ‘specialist’ (terms used to describe levels of intervention or services in the Every Child Matters agenda, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0265659012456385">DfES, 2003</xref>). This helped to ensure a common understanding of the groups of children of interest. Respondents were then asked to list all the interventions they used with children with SLCN, listing first of all those targeting communication, then language and lastly speech. They were then asked to describe one intervention from each list in detail. Given the variety of definitions found in the literature, it was anticipated that professionals from differing disciplines would identify and define interventions differently, so we did not wish our questions to contain preconceptions about what would be offered as examples of interventions; the questioning process therefore began with broad open questions and probed for additional detail about their reasons for the use of the intervention and the outcomes used.</p>
<p>The second phase began when the interventions listed by interviewees in Phase 1 had reached saturation, that is no new interventions were being identified. As part of the iterative process, a preliminary analysis of the interventions mentioned in Phase 1 had generated three broad categories: programmes, activities and principles or approaches. These lists were shown to interviewees who were asked to identify those used in their service and to add any others not already listed. Within each category, participants were asked to identify frequently used interventions about which they were asked a series of short questions:</p>
<list id="list2-0265659012456385" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>what age of child would be targeted with such an approach;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>what the intended outcomes would be;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>if they evaluated the effectiveness of the intervention at a service level; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>whether the intervention was used at a universal, targeted or specialist level (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0265659012456385">Appendix 2</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Interviews were carried out by the first three authors (two SLTs and one EP), in pairs at first to check for consistency of process and then singly subsequently. Interviews took from 45 minutes to 2 hours and were conducted in the interviewees’ work place in a quiet room.</p>

<sec id="section8-0265659012456385">
<title>4 Analysis</title>
<p>Responses for each interview question were initially collated; key categories and concepts were then identified from within each set of responses; responses were then assigned to the categories. The findings below present the emergent categories for each question.</p>

<title>III Results</title>
<sec id="section10-0265659012456385">
<title>1 Description and categorization of SLCN</title>
<p>Two main interpretations of the meaning of SLCN emerged from the first phase interviews: SLCN as intrinsic to many types of special needs or SLCN as an overarching category with many sub-diagnoses. Generally, participants from education backgrounds described SLCN as intrinsic to many types of special need and did not suggest sub- types.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s hard to think of children we are working with (who have) no need of some kind of communication need. (EP)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Descriptions of SLCN were clearly influenced by the Special Education Needs (SEN) Code of Practice used in England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0265659012456385">DfES, 2001</xref>). One participant commented:
<disp-quote>
<p>We ask what are the concerns and what are the barriers to access and then what are the interventions … We are driven by Code of Practice definition of SLCN; so would not label a child but look at indications of need (LA)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast, SLTs tended to categorize children with SLCN into a diagnostic category or type of impairment (e.g. specific language impairment, cleft palate, voice problem, dyspraxia). One exception to this was an SLT service that categorized their children with SLCN into therapeutic need following the Care Aims model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0265659012456385">Malcomess, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Responses to the questions about ‘universal’, ‘targeted’ and ‘specialist’ in the Phase 1 interviews brought broadly similar answers from all participants, in that there was an acknowledgement of a hierarchy of need and provision; however, education practitioners tended to use the notion of wave one, two and three, or tier one, two and three, to express this idea. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0265659012456385">Figure 1</xref> shows one SLT practitioner’s differentiation, which was typical of most.</p>

<title>2 Types of interventions identified</title>
<p>In Phase 1 and Phase 2 interviews, participants described interventions in a variety of ways, irrespective of whether they were talking about interventions for communication, language or speech. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0265659012456385">Table 2</xref> shows the interventions that participants chose to describe in Phase 1; as can be seen there was little overlap between education participants and SLTs. Education participants generally deferred to their SLT colleagues when offering interventions about speech. In Phase 2, similarly, there was little overlap in the choice of interventions described. A total of 158 different interventions were mentioned, and from these eight broad groupings of interventions emerged. Descriptions of each category along with examples appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0265659012456385">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<p>Within the interviews there was not always time to probe for detailed explanations of terms that were used.</p>
<p>It was rare that interventions were linked exclusively to any particular level of intervention (that is, universal, targeted, specialist) or to any particular age or diagnostic group, although some interventions were used in a more targeted fashion. For example, the Picture Exchange System (PECS) was reported mostly in the context of children on the autism spectrum and with those with severe and profound learning difficulties.</p>

<title>3 Participants’ rationales</title>
<p>When asked why they had chosen to use a particular intervention, respondents often gave a list of reasons.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Because it’s visual … it fits with the Garrett sentence processing model and uses multi-sensory approach … not aware of research data to support it, but there’s evidence from (case) notes (to) support its use. (SLT)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Respondents’ statements of rationale frequently indicated that the intervention targeted an identified need or gap in services. This included references to the support that the interventions provided for professionals and parents to help their understanding or reduce their levels of anxiety.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>To skill up the pre-school workers in the county to support all children. (SLT)</p>
<p>It meets the needs of children who can’t articulate. (LA)</p>
<p>We had a significant number of schools with children entering nursery with deficit language skills. (LA)</p>
<p>It’s a tool for schools to use independently to assist children with their social communication. (LA)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some made reference to evidence of the intervention’s effectiveness. These were either based on personal experience, local evaluations or on research evidence.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Because it works. (SLT)</p>
<p>We achieved good results through the evaluation initially. (LA)</p>
<p>The evidence is that visual approaches help young people to cope. (LA)</p>
<p>There is a strong evidence base about learning social skills within a group setting where children are able to learn from peers and practice skills with peers. (SLT)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In some cases, there was reference to some underlying theoretical position.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There’s a solid theoretical background explained in the manual. (SLT)</p>
<p>It’s based on the Stackhouse and Wells approach. (SLT)</p>
<p>It’s based on the idea that children learn best within real situations and real experiences that the child has on a day to day basis. (SLT)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Respondents also gave pragmatic reasons, related to efficiency, accessibility and popularity.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It was a way of seeing more children. (SLT)</p>
<p>It’s fun for children, it’s easy to provide visual resources for the sessions and fairly easy for another person to run the sessions. (SLT)</p>

<title>4 Outcome evaluation</title>
<p>Participants were asked how they evaluated children’s responses to the intervention. They talked about improving or increasing the children’s skills in communication, language and speech as one would expect; they also mentioned the broader aspects of children’s social and interaction skills and aspects of psychosocial functioning such as self-esteem and behaviour. Participants also reported that they were looking to impact on the child’s environment through change in the interactions of significant adults. <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3-0265659012456385">Appendix 3</xref> shows the outcomes mentioned in relation to examples of interventions identified by participants.</p>
<p>In terms of the methods used in the evaluation of outcomes, participants mostly reported that outcomes were measured for the individual child. Systematic evaluation of an intervention across a service or an authority was rare, although some reported that a particular intervention had been evaluated in a one-off project within their area. Some interventions are associated with evaluation forms, which participants reported that they used routinely, for example a questionnaire associated with the Hanen programme. Feedback from parents and teachers regularly played a part in the evaluation of outcomes through questionnaire completion; one group reported that a user group was consulted for feedback. However, the predominant focus of evaluation was on the individual child.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0265659012456385">
<title>5 Documentation</title>
<p>A wide range of types of documentation were submitted. Some gave guidance on which intervention should be used for specific groups of clients. For example, one SLT service care pathway showed that a child with speech difficulties aged above 3 years, 6 months and with good attention would receive a diagnostic screen programme while the same type of child but with poor attention would receive a sound awareness group programme. Some services provided practitioners with a range of interventions to select from using their professional judgement. Other services listed interventions related to the area targeted (e.g. one EPS listed interventions for children where the target was improved attention and listening) or related to universal, targeted or specialist levels of intervention. Some services focused on the amount of intervention or at what point intervention would be provided for different groups of children. In some cases there was no direct or specific reference to the type of intervention.</p>

<sec id="section15-0265659012456385" sec-type="discussion">
<title>IV Discussion</title>
<p>This study took a qualitative approach in terms of the sampling process, the structure of the interviews and the analytical approach. Sampling was purposive, aiming to gain an understanding of the range of interventions in use with children across the spectrum of need within SLCN. It should not therefore be surprising to see so many different interventions or to see differences in the way that interventions were described. This reflects the diversity of practice that was sampled and the personalization of responses that is a function of qualitative methods. Structured systems of describing interventions that include the goals, purposes, context and monitoring procedures such as that described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265659012456385">McCauley and Fey (2006)</xref> were not routinely used to talk about interventions. This may be a function of the informality of the interview context or it may reflect the variable way that interventions are described in the literature where there appears to be no consistency or consensus about how interventions are reported.</p>
<p>It was apparent that the intervention labels were used as a shorthand way of referring to an intervention. So the same label could easily be describing different interventions or different labels could be used to refer to similar interventions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265659012456385">Pawson (2006</xref>: 33) refers to this as ‘label naiveté’ and cautions that a label may be used to describe an intervention associated with a particular set of theories, propositions and procedures whereas actual practice may differ from this.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659012456385">Joffe and Pring (2008)</xref> found that SLTs typically combined intervention approaches and note that this is quite different to how they are evaluated in the research context, where the focus is on a single intervention. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265659012456385">Fuller (2010)</xref> who noted a high rate of innovation in speech and language therapy approaches in Sure Start, there were many locally developed interventions described in our study. This seemed to be in response to local needs. Although our study did not explore if and how interventions were combined, rationales given by respondents suggest that the development of new intervention regimes might be through a process of adaptation and combining of interventions to make them fit a perceived service (or individual) need.</p>
<p>Participants frequently made reference to the evidence supporting an intervention in justification of its use. However, in the local development or adaptation of interventions, practice may be moving away from the format that has been evaluated. Thus, even if an intervention has been shown to be effective, we cannot assume that its effectiveness will be similar if applied to a new group of children or with a number of adaptations. In practice, fidelity to the original intention and design of an intervention is difficult to achieve, even where the intervention is relatively straight forward with a strong evidence base. For example, the Lidcombe Programme has convincing evidence from randomized controlled trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0265659012456385">Jones, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0265659012456385">Lattermann et al., 2008</xref>), yet practitioners outside the research context do not always stick to the basic parameters of the intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0265659012456385">Rousseau, et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265659012456385">Shenker et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265659012456385">Pawson (2006</xref>: 30) observes that ‘[complex] interventions are embedded in multiple social systems’ and as such are subject to ‘negotiation, leakage, borrowing, resistance, mismatch, adjustment, bloom and fade’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265659012456385">Pawson, 2006</xref>: 35) as practitioners try to make the interventions fit local circumstances and work for particular individuals. As a result, interventions are rarely equally effective in every context.</p>
<p>Previous studies have reported varying levels of awareness and use of evidence in practitioners’ choice of intervention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0265659012456385">McLeod and Baker (2004)</xref> found that a very small percentage of their sample (1.1%) referred spontaneously to their use of research literature and indicated that they read journals infrequently. Joffe and Pring found a more positive view of research in their later article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659012456385">2008</xref>). In this study, practitioners frequently indicated that evidence that an intervention ‘works’ was part of their rationale for its selection. However, they referred to evidence from their own experience, from local evaluations as well as published research. Furthermore, the level of evidence was only one of the factors that was taken into account when selecting interventions and respondents were clearly balancing practical issues with a process of selecting an intervention to match the needs of the children, perhaps using what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265659012456385">Law et al. (2007)</xref> referred to as ‘theories of therapy’.</p>
<p>Although other studies have investigated the assessments and measures currently used by SLTs, they have not investigated the use of outcome measures per se. Respondents in this study specified the outcomes targeted by each intervention. However, none of our respondents indicated that outcomes were being collected at a service level. Given the current political context of outcomes-based commissioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265659012456385">Department of Health, 2010</xref>) whereby services will be commissioned to deliver specified outcomes, it is of concern that services remain unable to demonstrate the outcomes achieved by the various intervention they offer.</p>
<p>In this small-scale study, the aim was to identify the range of interventions in use, so it was not appropriate to look for patterns of usage. Service managers do not necessarily know about all the details of interventions employed by their teams. However, by talking to services managers, we obtained an overview of all the interventions used in the participating services. Current practice is constantly changing and evolving so, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0265659012456385">McLeod and Baker (2004)</xref> note, the study only provides a snapshot of practice at the time.</p>

<title>V Conclusions</title>
<p>This component of the Better Communication Research Programme was the preliminary step in a programme of work to explore the evidence basis of current practice. This study provided information about the kinds of categories of interventions that are in use by services. Interventions identified in this study were used in the next stage of the programme of work, which carried out a survey to examine the distribution of the interventions and to identify patterns of usage with different age groups and types of SLCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265659012456385">Roulstone et al., 2012</xref>). The final stage of this component of the Better Communication Research Programme examines the evidence for the interventions used in current practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0265659012456385">Law et al., 2012</xref>). Even where there is evidence to support the effectiveness of particular interventions, it is important to bear in mind that those interventions may have been adapted in practice. Therefore, evaluations to judge the impact of an intervention locally would be advised.</p>
