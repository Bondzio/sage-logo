<abstract>
<p>The face-to-face confrontation involved in the crime of robbery renders vast amounts of financial, physical, and psychological injury in the United States. This study developed hypotheses from existing literature regarding salient situational factors associated with the prevalence of overt physical coercion during commercial and street robberies. The study examined the effect of situational and personal characteristics on robbers’ use of coercion, with data coded from police reports of 1,281 street and commercial robberies in one precinct of Detroit, Michigan, between 2000 and 2003. The research results are relatively consistent with findings from the literature on robbery in the last 40 years: Street robberies involve a greater prevalence of physical force than do commercial robberies; guns reduce the likelihood of physical force; and victim resistance increases physical force. Additionally, characteristics of victims and offenders play a secondary role in predicting whether physical coercion is brought to bear on the victims of robbery.</p>

<p>The crime of robbery, which involves using force or the threat of force to take another’s property, evokes fear among the general public. Robbery and attempts at robbery can be conceived as having variable outcomes: success or failure to gain property, injury to victim, resistance from the victim, and level of perpetrator force, for example. The last, use of physical force by the perpetrator, is the focus of this article.</p>
<p>Regardless of the considerable situational variation noted above, the idea of a robbery instills fear in the public. According to data based on the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), approximately two thirds of all robberies involve strangers attempting to take the property of others by force and threat of physical harm or death, which is sometimes realized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011128709352233">Catalano, 2005</xref>). The consequences of this crime include economic loss, physical injuries, and psychological harm to the victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011128709352233">Ruback &amp; Thompson, 2001</xref>). Participants at a recent Police Executive Research Foundation roundtable were convened to address an apparent sharp increase in violence. Thomas Streicher, the police chief in Cincinnati, was quoted in the media about the nature of present-day robberies. The article read, “Robbers, especially juveniles, are more likely than ever to shoot victims, even when they do not resist. [According to Streicher] ‘there’s almost a different code on the street that it’s not a robbery <italic>unless you shoot somebody</italic>’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011128709352233">Willing, 2006</xref>; italics added).Official data indicate that in 2005 there were 921 robbery–murder victims, which represent 5.5% of the total homicides for that year. Of these deaths, 698 (about 3 of every 4) were attributed to firearms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011128709352233">Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2005</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011128709352233">Loftin, 1986</xref>). According to the 2005 NCVS data, approximately 1 in 3 robberies and attempts involved an injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011128709352233">Catalano, 2005</xref>). In that same year, the average loss resulting from robbery was estimated to be $1,230—as inflated by the inclusion of bank and commercial robberies—for a total of approximately $513 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011128709352233">Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2005</xref>). Clearly, the physical and economic impacts that accrue from these crimes represent serious issues for policy makers and criminologists. Nevertheless, in 2005 the likelihood of being killed during a robbery amounted to a risk of slightly more than 2 per 1,000 robberies; furthermore, the total number of robbery homicides in 2005 is far below the numbers recorded in the 1980s (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128709352233">Cook, 1985b</xref>). Thus, exploration of variations within the phenomenon of robbery, which is perceived to be uniformly extreme in violence, is an area where the current research can fill an important knowledge gap. Such research can serve to apply systematic empirical inquiry to statements regarding the proliferation of youth violence.</p>
<p>Has the nature of robbery changed, as suggested by Chief Streicher’s quote? Will previous research continue to offer insight into the nature of violence and coercion that occur in contemporary robberies? Some have suggested that this phenomenon changed, in part, as the crime of robbery became more closely associated with illicit drug use, drug markets, and gun violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128709352233">Blumstein, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011128709352233">Jacobs, 2000</xref>). Analyses of Uniform Crime Report data indicate that robbery rates steadily increased through the 1980s and likely accelerated with the introduction of crack cocaine markets in urban areas of the United States (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128709352233">Baumer, Lauritsen, Rosenfeld, &amp; Wright, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to compare contemporary commercial robberies and street robberies with respect to the use of physical force during the events. To accomplish this task, I address the following five issues: First, I examine the literature on robbery and robbers to determine whether types of robbery, such as street and commercial robbery, should significantly vary in terms of force used to accomplish each. Second, I consider the effect of situational factors (e.g., resistance, presence of weapon) and characteristics of the participants (e.g., sex of the victim and robber) in the existing literature to develop a theoretically informed working model of physical coercion during robbery. Third, I discuss the collection of data from official crime reports in the Detroit, Michigan, research site. Fourth, I examine analyses of physical force used by robbers against victims to test key hypotheses and ascertain whether there are differences in the level of force used in the two types of robberies. Finally, I discuss the implications of this research and suggestions for future research and data collection.</p>
<p>Research on the nature of robbery events comes from three primary data sources: Like the current research, the first source relies on coding data from official police reports to ascertain outcomes, such as injury or physical assault, completion, and victim resistance. The second involves analyses of NCVS data from a cluster sample of households in a rotating-panel design. This data collection effort allows researchers to examine how situational and personal characteristics shape robbery outcomes and generalize to the national level. The last data source involves interviews with active and incarcerated robbers to glean data on methods, motives, and expectations of perpetrators.</p>
<p>The literature on robbery includes developing typologies of robberies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011128709352233">Normandeau, 1968</xref>), describing individuals who commit robberies and their motivations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011128709352233">Gill, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011128709352233">Wright &amp; Decker, 1997a</xref>), and exploring the robbery transaction between the victim and the perpetrator in terms of resistance, force, or injury (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128709352233">Luckenbill, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011128709352233">Tark &amp; Kleck, 2004</xref>). These research themes represent useful distinctions for the current project and contribute useful hypotheses for consideration when accounting for physical coercion in contemporary robberies. In what follows, I establish the distinction between street robbery and commercial robbery as a meaningful dichotomy with regard to understanding robbers’ use of coercion.</p>
<p>Uniform Crime Report data from 2005 indicate that the modal robbery was classified as <italic>street/highway</italic>, at 44% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011128709352233">Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2005</xref>). Commercial robberies (including gas stations, convenience stores, and other nonbank commercial interests) accounted for approximately 23% of robberies, and residential robberies totaled about 14% of all robberies. These numbers are consistent with Normandeau’s examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011128709352233">1968</xref>) of 1,722 robberies in Philadelphia between 1960 and 1966, which indicate that commercial and street robberies composed 26% and 52% of all city robberies, respectively. Less prevalent types identified in that work include robberies of residences (7%) and robberies of victims with a brief (10%) or ongoing relationship (5%) with the perpetrator. Similarly, Zimring and Zuehl’s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011128709352233">1986</xref>) on a sample of Chicago robberies and robbery–homicides indicate that commercial and street robberies made up the majority of cases, whereas home invasions and other types of robbery were much less frequent. Although research on robbery events distinguishes street and commercial robberies as separate categories, the extant research indicates that situational aspects of the two types and use of physical force by perpetrators may be somewhat different. I explore this hypothesis using information derived from the diverse methodologies used to study robbery and robbers.</p>
<p>Data acquired from interviewing captive and active robbers lend important background consideration to their techniques for successfully completing the crime. This descriptive research approach can illuminate the utility of weapons and actions in robberies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011128709352233">Gill (2000)</xref>, for example, interviewed 341 commercial robbers in English prisons. He identified some individuals as <italic>professionals</italic>: They tend to carry out commercial robberies and adopt weapons and tactics that avoid or minimize the raw physical force used on victims. Thus, commercial robberies conducted by professionals might be somewhat less violent inasmuch as those robbers explicitly adopt approaches to avoid violence:
<disp-quote>
<p>Many reiterated the point that the purpose of a weapon is to avoid conflict and that they would back down rather than risk injuring someone. Some robbers put limits on the level of violence they were prepared to inflict. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011128709352233">Gill, 2000</xref>, p. 77)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128709352233">Luckenbill (1980)</xref> made the cogent observation that the commercial robber relies, to some extent, on the victim’s becoming a participant in relieving the business of its money. In his study, two offenders shared the notion that employee cooperation in commercial robberies is a prerequisite to successful completion:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>OFFENDER 3:</speaker>
<p>Well, I didn’t know where the money was, and besides, I didn’t know how to open the cash registers.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>OFFENDER 7:</speaker>
<p>If he won’t open the safe, you’re dead. You might as well leave. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128709352233">Luckenbill, 1980</xref>, p. 372)</p>
</speech>
<p>As noted, one aspect that differentiates street and commercial robberies appears to be the participation of planning, or professional, robbers in the latter. For example, in Wellford, MacDonald, and Weiss’s interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011128709352233">1997</xref>) of 148 incarcerated convenience store robbers across five states, approximately one third indicated that they planned the convenience store robbery more than 6 hours in advance. Among those robbers who had prior experience in committing robberies (<italic>n</italic> = 43), 40% indicated that they had spent more than a day in planning the robbery. About 16% of the sample reported abandoning a plan to rob another store. Petrosino and Brensilber’s interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011128709352233">2003</xref>) of 28 incarcerated convenience store robbers in Massachusetts indicated a much lower level of planning, with 13 robbers reporting no planning, 12 reporting 5 minutes to 4 hours’ planning, and only 3 reporting a week or more of planning. One inference drawn from this research is that some effort goes into commercial target selection in the context of American convenience store robberies and other commercial robberies. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011128709352233">Conklin (1972)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011128709352233">Einstadter (1969)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011128709352233">Feeney (1986)</xref> referred to robbers that target businesses as <italic>professional</italic>, such distinctions may not apply in contemporary samples. Stark contrasts between robbery types, in terms of the use of physical coercion, are not likely to be as great as those observed in the past, but examination of hypothesized differences is worthy of investigation in a contemporary sample.</p>
<p>A recent body of research focused on active armed robbers in St. Louis, examining their motives, target selection, risk management, and approaches to the crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011128709352233">Wright &amp; Decker, 1997a</xref>). This work yielded few armed robbers that specialized in commercial robberies, which the authors noted as a potential result of their using snowball sampling techniques. The most common approach to robbery identified among the 87 robbers was one of opportunistic predation, congruent with street robbery. This seminal research established that street robberies rely on “creating the illusion of impending death” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011128709352233">Wright &amp; Decker, 1997a</xref>, p. 127) via stealthy approach, the use of guns, and physical assault on victims (see also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0011128709352233">Wright &amp; Decker, 1997b</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011128709352233">Katz (1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011128709352233">1991</xref>) observed, the motivation for persistent robbers may lead them, in an existential fashion, to approach the use of violence and control as a savory and enjoyable part of the work while they develop their “badass” identity. This conjecture was not confirmed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011128709352233">Wright and Decker (1997a)</xref>, but the lifestyle of robbers did comport with the chaotic pursuit of excitement (e.g., women, drugs) predicted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011128709352233">Katz (1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011128709352233">1991)</xref>. Nevertheless, street robbery and the use of greater levels of force could be an area that differentiates it sharply with the commercial robbery events noted above.</p>
<p>One other element that might distinguish between professional and opportunistic robbers is the time of day when the offense is committed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011128709352233">Van Koppen and Jansen (1999)</xref> argued that professional robbers may take advantage of daytime hours to maximize the rewards available as businesses perform banking transactions. Conversely, opportunistic robbers may be inclined to use the cover of darkness for their relatively unplanned and impulsive attacks.</p>
<p>The varied literature on robbery allows one to develop additional working hypotheses about the heterogeneity of the use of physical coercion that should be present in robbery transactions. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011128709352233">Table 1</xref> presents (in summary form for ease of reference; see column 2) the key hypotheses and the nature of the expected relationship between independent variables and the extent of physical coercion, as derived from extant literature. For example, prior research suggests that resistance by the victim, presence and type of weapon used, and gender of the offender, as well as gender, age, and race of the victim, are important factors in determining whether robbers resort to physical coercion.</p>

<p>As noted above, the research suggests that physical coercion is likely to be greater in street robberies than in commercial robberies. Consideration should be given to the fact that commercial victims may be less inclined to protect assets that do not belong to them—that is, resist—and thus facilitate quick transfers of cash to robbers, whereas street victims will have more incentive to guard their personal items. Resistance to robbers is linked with homicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011128709352233">Zimring &amp; Zuehl, 1986</xref>), reported injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128709352233">Cook, 1986</xref>), and robbers’ belief that the application of greater force is necessary to convince the target that they mean business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128709352233">Luckenbill, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011128709352233">1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011128709352233">Wright &amp; Decker, 1997a</xref>). Data derived from police reports generally indicate that resistance increases the likelihood of victim injury, but all researchers recognize the difficulty of establishing causal order from official data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011128709352233">Block, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011128709352233">Conklin, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011128709352233">Zimring &amp; Zuehl, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>This shortcoming is also recognized in analyses of the National Crime Survey and NCVS before its redesign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128709352233">Kleck &amp; DeLone, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011128709352233">Tark &amp; Kleck, 2004</xref>). To disentangle the consequences and causes of resistance, research needs to distinguish victim resistance as that occurring before or after any physical coercion—that is, before or after robbers have engaged in physical contact. Researchers have recently capitalized on the temporal sequencing of injury and resistance, which is more precise because of methodological changes in the NCVS data collection protocol. Tark and Kleck’s research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011128709352233">2004</xref>), for example, indicated that many efforts of victim resistance or self-protection decrease injury in robberies. This finding does not appear to be consistent with prior victimization research, which relied on a more tenuous causal order and will require further study for confirmation.</p>
<p>Interviews of active robbers indicate that perceived victim resistance can lead to the imposition of physical coercion to reestablish control. The line of argument often lays blame on the victim, as illustrated by one robber’s opinion about injury resulting from resistance: “Man, that’s on them, he should have followed our instructions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011128709352233">Wright &amp; Decker, 1997a</xref>, p. 127). Such a perspective is consistent with Anderson’s code of the street (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128709352233">1999</xref>), which demands compliance in situations involving urban street robberies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011128709352233">Baumer, Horney, Felson, &amp; Lauritsen, 2003</xref>). The expectations of compliance may vary across robbers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011128709352233">Jacobs (2000)</xref> interviewed one robber who described shooting and wounding a drug dealer for hesitating to give up the goods: “He shouldn’t have took that long to give it to me” (p. 95).</p>
<p>The presence of a weapon appears to influence coercion because it, paradoxically, reduces overall physical coercion and simultaneously increases the likelihood of a lethal event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011128709352233">Block, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011128709352233">Conklin, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128709352233">Cook, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128709352233">1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128709352233">Gabor et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128709352233">McDonald, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011128709352233">Normandeau, 1968</xref>). This finding is consistent with Wright and Decker’s interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0011128709352233">1997b</xref>) of robbers: As armed individuals, they are able to create the illusion of impending death, when compared to those who are unarmed or armed with weapons other than guns. Victims readily perceive the symbolic importance of the gun; hence, robbers argue that its mere presence can be a mechanism for eliminating noncompliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011128709352233">Gill, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011128709352233">Luckenbill, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011128709352233">Wright &amp; Decker, 1997a</xref>).</p>
<p>Official data indicate that gun use by robbers appears to reduce injuries in the context of robbery events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011128709352233">Block, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011128709352233">Martz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011128709352233">Zimring &amp; Zuehl, 1986</xref>). Reduction of victim resistance is one indirect pathway through which guns may operate to reduce the prevalence of physical violence. Others argue that it may be an artifact of reporting biases among victims and police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128709352233">Block &amp; Block, 1980</xref>). Nevertheless, the conjecture is consistent with reports from robbers that they reduce resistance by displaying a lethal weapon. Thus, the hypothesis is that (a) the presence of a gun reduces physical coercion in robbery events and, to a lesser extent, (b) the possession of another type of weapon reduces physical coercion when compared with unarmed robberies.</p>
<p>The last consideration in terms of the robbery event is that of victim–offender relationship. Victims who know their robbers tend to suffer more injury, homicides, and violence in general when compared to victims who do not know the perpetrators. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011128709352233">Zimring and Zuehl (1986)</xref> established this finding in Chicago robbery–homicide data, and it has been confirmed with regard to victim injury in analyses by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128709352233">Felson, Baumer, and Messner (2000)</xref> using victimization survey data. Thus, physical coercion used by robbers in acquaintance robberies is predicted to be greater than that of robberies involving strangers.</p>
<p>With respect to the personal characteristics of victims, females appear to experience less overall injury in robberies, as reported to the NCVS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128709352233">Cook, 1987</xref>), as well as in official crime reports examined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011128709352233">Zimring and Zuehl (1986)</xref>. Armed robbers consider females as pliable targets with a high likelihood of compliance. Female robbers interviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011128709352233">Miller (1998)</xref> specifically considered female targets to be more compliant. Male robbers also voice a reluctance to use physical force on female victims, but this may be due to social desirability of response rather than actual chivalry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011128709352233">Wright &amp; Decker, 1997a</xref>). Nevertheless, accounts from robbers, data drawn from victimization surveys, and official records all indicate that females are less likely to experience physical coercion and injury (as a proxy for coercion) at the hands of robbers.</p>
<p>Consideration of victim race as a predictor of physical coercion in a robbery is somewhat controversial. The data analyzed in the present research is composed of mostly African-American (96 percent) robbers. Though interracial robberies could be hypothesized to yield greater physical coercion, there is limited capacity to detect such interaction effects. This hypothesis emanates from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128709352233">Anderson’s (1999)</xref> “code of the street” which dictates hypercompliance with a robber’s demands, a behavior more likely to be exhibited by African-American victims residing in distressed urban neighborhoods. Conversely, non-African American victims may emit behaviors that are interpreted as resistance. Area identified NCVS robberies from 1995–1997 were analyzed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011128709352233">Baumer et al. (2003)</xref> and multivariate results indicated that, in disadvantaged neighborhoods, victims were less likely to report nonforceful resistance. Consistent with the “code of the street” we might expect victim race to be a proxy for knowledge of the expected behavior pattern during robberies. Failure to follow the script, by non-African American victims, is likely to yield greater physical force used by the robber.</p>
<p>In sum, I offer the following seven hypotheses for testing (also in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011128709352233">Table 1</xref>):</p>
<list id="list1-0011128709352233" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Street robberies are more likely than commercial robberies to involve physical coercion.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Resistant victims are more likely than nonresistant victims to experience physical coercion.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: The presence of a gun reduces the likelihood of physical coercion during a robbery.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: The presence of a nongun weapon reduces the likelihood of physical coercion during a robbery.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 5</italic>: Victims who are acquainted with the robbers are more likely to experience physical coercion.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 6</italic>: Female victims are less likely to experience physical coercion during robberies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 7</italic>: African American victims are less likely to experience physical coercion during robberies.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>These hypotheses can be broadly considered as being representative of variations in situational characteristics of the robbery event and personal characteristics of those involved. The expectation is that the situational aspects of the robbery are likely to be most powerful in explaining whether physical coercion is used. The prior research indicates strong effects for resistance and weapons effects. The data developed on participant characteristics, such as race and gender, do not appear as strong and consistent predictors across prior studies, especially in multivariate analyses. In the following, I introduce official data from a high-crime precinct of Detroit, Michigan, which was used to test these hypotheses.</p>
<sec id="section1-0011128709352233">
<title>Site</title>
<p>The data collected for this project came from an area formerly identified as the Eighth Precinct of Detroit, which comprised 14 patrol areas, each about 1 square mile. The Detroit Police Department has since reorganized into six districts; hence, all references to the geographic area of the Eighth Precinct represent geographic deployment patterns at the time of data collection. With a population of approximately 106,000, this precinct was one of the largest in terms of population. It had a high violent crime rate, including 3,195 robberies, or 12% of the citywide robbery total of 27,000 recorded during the study period. Note that the Eighth Precinct was the focus of a federal Strategic Approaches to Community Safety Initiative grant in 2000, which aimed at reducing gun violence via interagency partnerships and an action research program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011128709352233">Bynum &amp; McCluskey, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The precinct population was nearly 90% African American, and 30% of the population was 17 years old or younger. Unemployment, although not as high as citywide statistics, was above 10%, and 8% of households reported receiving public assistance (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0011128709352233">Table 2</xref>). The proportion of robberies (12%) relative to the population of the precinct (or 11% of the total in Detroit) indicates that the area was representative of the city as a whole. One might be concerned with issues of generalizability given that the sample consists of several extremely disadvantaged neighborhoods within the precinct. However, these areas are likely to be similar to those worked by robbers studied in St. Louis, Missouri, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011128709352233">Wright and Decker (1997a)</xref>. Therefore, there is little reason to believe that the study will not generalize to other neighborhoods and areas in cities experiencing deindustrialization patterns similar to those of Detroit.</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data collection involved coding paper-based offense reports from the period of January 2000 through September 2003 in the Eighth Precinct for a total of 45 months of robbery data. Data regarding items such as race, age, and gender were gleaned from form elements, whereas data on the robbery encounter were coded from written police narratives. The universe of armed, unarmed, and attempted robberies recorded in the precinct was captured during that period.</p>
<p>There was not a perfect concordance between the number of electronic records and the paper records filed at Detroit Police Department. This could be due to missing or misfiled reports not located at the precinct and/or errors in coded data. Efforts to establish a complete record included working closely with Detroit Police Department personnel to obtain as many reports as possible and examining electronic data to determine cases that were outstanding and required more intensive collection efforts. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0011128709352233">Table 3</xref> presents official data totals for the Eighth Precinct during this period, as well as the number of cases collected each year. The lowest concordance rate occurred in 2000 (where only 46% of cases could be obtained), whereas 2001 represented the largest concordance (83%) between case reports coded and the totals generated within the Detroit Police Department tracking databases. Monthly totals for 2000 and 2002 were explored to determine if there were systematic patterns in data loss, and it appears that the months of July through September had low concordance (&lt; 50%) between total cases recorded in the electronic data file and total paper reports that could be located. Note that the highest monthly totals tended to occur in the October–December period, which is consistent with other researchers’ seasonal findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011128709352233">Van Koppen &amp; Jansen, 1999</xref>). As such, the pattern of missing cases is not heavily skewed by the missing months. Even with this attrition, data collected represent nearly 2 out of every 3 robberies, or 1,987 of 3,195 known cases.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>The Detroit Police Department computer file indicated that 79% of completed robberies involved armed perpetrators; case files that were coded for the sample indicated that among the completed robberies, 83% involved a weapon. The computer file indicated 8% of cases as robbery attempts, and the coded paper case files yielded a total of 13% attempts. Thus, armed robberies and attempts are somewhat overrepresented in the data compared to the department’s tracking data summaries for the Eighth Precinct. One possible explanation for the large proportion of attempts is that in a small number of cases, the reports indicated that no property was taken, although these were identified as completed robberies in the electronic file. Given the vagaries of official data collection, the disjuncture between what could be obtained and what was available is unsurprising. Note that no sampling strategy that drew on this precinct’s files would have included cases missing from this analysis, given that no paper file was present for coding purposes.</p>
<p>Coding of the data commenced with a database developed for the purpose of examining injury and force in the context of robberies. This included a template of the official incident report and a section where approach, processing, and exit actions of the perpetrator and the victim could be recorded for each, including sequences of perpetrator commands and threats, victim resistance, and use of weapons. This approach allowed for the causal ordering of variables to be established for the current research.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Commercial robberies and street robberies were isolated from the sample of 1,987 cases for analysis. A total of 1,492 cases were identified as street or commercial robberies; of those, 1,281 (86%) had sufficient data to be included in the analyses conducted below. Information on the age of the perpetrator was missing in 26% of these cases, but strategies were adopted to minimize the impact of missing data on the total number of cases included in the analysis. Home invasions and carjackings accounted for the additional 495 robberies coded during the period. The nature of carjacking lends itself to the opportunistic targeting consistent with street robbery (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128709352233">Jacobs, Topalli, &amp; Wright, 2003</xref>) but involves conversion of the merchandise similar to theft. Home invasion robberies appear to have a higher likelihood of extreme violence than do street robberies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011128709352233">Zimring &amp; Zuehl, 1986</xref>) and may be associated with settling grievances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128709352233">Black, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128709352233">Felson et al., 2000</xref>). As such, these two types of robbery were reserved for separate analysis to establish a sharp contrast between street and commercial events.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0011128709352233">
<title>Dependent Measure</title>
<p>Adopting injury as an outcome could be a proxy for physical coercion, but it measures the consequences of physical coercion and not necessarily its use. For example, a forceful punch that lands on a youthful male may cause no injury, but an equally forceful impact to a frail, elderly victim may result in severe injury (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011128709352233">Bachman, Dillaway, &amp; Lachs, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011128709352233">Tark &amp; Kleck, 2004</xref>). Thus, included in the category of physical coercion within the dichotomous dependent measure is firing a gun (whether hitting or missing), hitting the victim with a gun or other weapon, and making aggressive physical contact with the victim (punches, shoving, and kicks that may or may not yield injuries), as well as noted injury to the victim. This measure is divergent from one that captures only reported injury; that is, 279 cases (22%) involve what is defined here as physical coercion, whereas in only 130 cases (47% of all instances of physical coercion) was the victim coded as injured from the information on the police report. For example, in 62 cases, robbers were reported to have fired their weapons, but in 19 of those instances no victims were injured.</p>
<p>One shortcoming of this approach is that of assuming intent through weapon firing. Systematic error may accrue if one suspects that commercial victims are less likely to be hit if warning shots are more routinely used in those cases. If the intent in those cases is to scare and not physically harm, then the expectation is fewer wounds from gunfire. To explore this notion the 62 firings were isolated and identified as 23 cases of commercial robbery gun discharges and 39 cases of street robbery discharges. Of the commercial victims, 26% (<italic>n</italic> = 6) were hit; of street victimizations, 33% (<italic>n</italic> = 13) involved a victim hit by the gunshot. A chi-square test of independence on the subsample of 62 cases indicates that the independence of commercial and street victimizations cannot be rejected, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = .357, <italic>p</italic> = .55. Thus, the confounding of physical coercion with robbery approaches does not appear to be a substantial threat to the findings reported.</p>
<p>Research on prisoners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011128709352233">Wells &amp; Horney, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011128709352233">Wright &amp; Rossi, 1994</xref>) indicates that guns lessen the overall prevalence of injury to victims. Additionally, among those who use guns for robbery, the self-reported intent is generally not to fire the gun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011128709352233">Wright &amp; Rossi, 1994</xref>). Consistent with the current research, the gun acts as an implicit coercion, and only when activated by firing is it coded as explicit or physically coercive. In summary, there would arguably be undercounting of physical coercion if only injury were used as a proxy measure for physical coercion. As such, the measure used here is more broadly conceived, and the reference category for this variable includes robbers who displayed weapons, made threats, or merely engaged with a threatening presence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0011128709352233">
<title>Independent Measures</title>
<p>Nine variables are used to represent characteristics of the robbery event, including type of target, victim resistance, weapon presence and type, the number of victims and offenders involved, whether the robber was known to the victim, and indicators for whether the robbery occurred during the midday or evening hours. Robbery type is captured by a dichotomous measure to distinguish street robberies from commercial events. Of the cases included in the analysis, 62% were street robberies (<italic>n</italic> = 796), and 38% were in the reference category of commercial robberies (<italic>n</italic> = 485).</p>
<p>Resistance is measured by a binary variable that includes both active physical and passive noncooperation by the victim as indicating the presence of resistance (1 = present, 0 = otherwise). We used the narratives in the police reports to establish whether physical coercion occurred before or after victim resistance. To establish causal order, we captured only resistance before physical coercion in the measure of citizen resistance, which occurred in 7% of cases (<italic>n</italic> = 88). Attention to the sequencing of citizen resistance captured within the narratives eliminated six instances where citizen resistance followed physical coercion by the robber.</p>
<p>Two binary variables capture the presence of weapons. One measure captures the presence of a gun (1 = yes, 0 = no), and another captures the presence of any other weapon—including knives, bats, bricks, pipes, and other nongun instruments—and is similarly coded if present (1 = yes, 0 = no). In 994 robberies (78%), the perpetrator possessed a gun, and in 79 robberies another weapon was deployed. In only 7 cases did the case reports indicate that guns and other weapons were both present, and in only 18% of the cases (<italic>n</italic> = 215) was no weapon present.</p>
<p>Implicit coercive power can also be present in numbers; thus, the numbers of victims (<italic>M</italic> = 1.1) and the number of perpetrators (<italic>M</italic> = 1.6) are included as variables. Note that single victims compose 91% of the sample (<italic>n</italic> = 1,171) and single robbers, 58% (<italic>n</italic> = 745). Counts for both variables are used in the analysis. Robbers known to the victim compose approximately 4% of the cases and are dummy coded (1 = present, 0 = otherwise). The nature of the relationship (acquaintance, relative, etc.) is not reliably discernible, so it should be minimally interpreted such that the victim at least knows the person by name or nickname. Finally, a pair of time-of-day dummy variables are included as relevant controls and represent midday robberies (10:00 a.m. to 3:59 p.m.) and nighttime robberies (10:00 p.m. to 3:59 a.m.). The former represent a period when public areas are busy (midday); therefore, injury should be reduced because robberies have to be speedy, by necessity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011128709352233">Van Koppen and Jansen (1999)</xref> argued that that professional robbers might take advantage of banking transaction times that may occur in this period. As such, we would expect reduced levels of coercion and injuries in this period. Conversely, periods of quiescence and darkness, in which robbers may have more time and therefore more opportunity to adopt forceful tactics against victims, are represented in the nighttime variable.</p>
<p>Participants’ sociodemographic characteristics were captured in a series of measures. Perpetrator race is a binary variable (1 = African American, 0 = other), and 96% of cases involved an African American perpetrator. Similarly, the victim’s race is a binary variable (1 = African American, 0 = other), and 83% of victims were African Americans. With respect to sex, perpetrators and victims diverge: Females were involved in only 4% of the cases as robbers (1 = any robbery involving a female, 0 = all others) but represent victims in 36% of the robberies in the sample. For consistency in coding, in the rare case of mixed races and sexes of multiple victims and multiple perpetrators, each of the four dichotomous variables was coded to reflect the presence of African American or female participants.</p>
<p>Several measurement issues were considered in creating an indicator of offender age, given that missing data on perpetrator age were substantial. Rather than discard cases because of missing information, we decided to substitute several coding strategies to account for the problem. First, the age of the robber, as reported by the victim, was coded from cases with valid data, with the age of the primary robber reflecting situations that involved more than one robber. Age was then divided into categories (0 = missing; 1 = younger than 17; 2 = 17 to 25; 3 = 26 to 40; 4 = older than 40), with the modal category being the 17–25 group. Slightly more than half the cases in the sample (<italic>n</italic> = 659) are in this group. In the analysis presented below, a dummy variable represents missing data on perpetrator age. We adopted alternative approaches to analyzing the relationship between apparent age of the robbers and physical coercion, including mean substitution as well as isolating the 17–25 age group for analysis. The results reported below did not change under these alternative approaches for dealing with missing data.</p>
<p>With regard to the age of the victims, those older than 50 were coded as elderly victims, with all other ages as a reference category. The literature suggests that robbers are reluctant to use as much force against elderly victims; 14% of the sample is in this category. A countervailing effect, ease of injury, should not matter in the current analyses, given that physical coercion (not its outcome) is the dependent variable of interest.<sup>3</sup> Note that, in analyses not presented, the effect of a continuous measure of victim age in years yielded results consistent with the findings reported below.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Logistic regression models are appropriate for the analysis of dichotomous dependent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128709352233">Menard, 2002</xref>). Thus, we used logistic regression models to estimate the relationship among the characteristics of robbery events, the characteristics of the victims and offenders, and the use of physical coercion by robbers. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0011128709352233">Table 4</xref> features three logistic regression models predicting the presence of physical coercion used by robbers. The first model focuses on characteristics of the event; the second focuses on the characteristics of the offender and the victim; and the last combines these two domains. Models 1 and 2 are consistent with expectations that situational factors are better predictors of physical coercion; that is, five of the nine situational aspects and only two of the eight demographic characteristics are statistically significant. Significant situational coefficients include street robbery, resistance, gun robbery, relationship, and daytime robbery, and all are in the hypothesized direction. With regard to the personal characteristics of robbers and victims, Model 2 indicates that physical coercion is less likely to be used against females and African American victims, which is also consistent with the hypothesized effects.</p>

<p>The full model indicates that each statistically significant relationship persists when individual characteristics and situational characteristics are combined, perhaps indicating that situational characteristics are not heavily dependent on who is involved in the robbery as a victim or a perpetrator once the event has commenced.<sup>4</sup> With regard to situational factors, street robberies have slightly higher odds of resulting in physical coercion; resistant victims have 3 times the odds of experiencing physical coercion; victims who are confronted by a robber with a gun have about one third the odds of experiencing physical coercion; those robbed by a nonstranger have slightly more than twice the odds of experiencing physical coercion; and robberies that occur during the day have somewhat lower odds of involving physical coercion when compared with other times of day. Two victim characteristics—being female and African American—each reduce the odds of experiencing physical coercion by more than half.</p>
<p>Overall, the model is significantly better than chance at predicting physical coercion, but the pseudo <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> indicates that it is somewhat weak in terms of accounting for variation in the dependent variable (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011128709352233">Menard, 2000</xref>).<sup>5</sup> One important question to consider is whether the combined models of commercial and street robberies are masking underlying variation that is inconsistent across the models. For example, resistance in commercial robberies may yield more terminations of the robbery and less effort to gain compliance via physical coercion. Similarly, the relationship between gun use and coercion may vary across the two types.</p>
<p>To explore these possibilities, we split the sample into street and commercial robbery subsamples and separately regressed the 15 remaining independent measures on physical coercion. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0011128709352233">Table 5</xref> shows the results. To determine if the measures have a distinct impact across the samples, we computed the <italic>z</italic> statistic to compare the slope coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011128709352233">Paternoster, Brame, Mazerolle, &amp; Piquero, 1998</xref>). The comparisons indicate no obvious variation across the two types of robberies, except that the intercepts are significantly different (<italic>z</italic> = 2.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), indicating a lower overall likelihood of physical coercion in commercial robberies. This is consistent with the argument that robbers who target commercial establishments are, as they claim in interviews, less inclined to use force in these events. Other coefficient comparisons that are marginally significant are curious: Nonstranger commercial robberies are more likely to yield injuries (<italic>z</italic> = 1.82; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10, two-tailed test), which could be consistent with grievance resolutions observed in personal robberies in the NCVS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128709352233">Felson et al., 2000</xref>) and with Black’s hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128709352233">1983</xref>) regarding the self-help aspect of interpersonal violence. The exclusion of home invasions from the street robbery category may explain why there is no direct effect on physical coercion found for nonstranger robberies in the model. Race of the robber is also marginally significant in contrasts (<italic>z</italic> = −1.69; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10, two-tailed test) and indicates that more physical coercion is used by African American robbers during commercial robberies as compared with street robberies. Neither coefficient is statistically significant by conventional standards in the subsample models. Furthermore, recall that the number of robberies involving non–African American offenders was small and therefore contributes to unstable estimates in these subdivided samples.</p>

<p>Given the 15 contrasts across the two models, there appears to be no persuasive pattern of evidence to suggest that the two robbery types are significantly different in terms of adoption of physical coercion by offenders. Comparisons of the pseudo <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> statistics indicate only minor differences in fit across the models. The tentative conclusion here is that commercial robberies feature significantly less physical coercion than do street robberies, consistent with the hypothesis discussed earlier. Thus, the models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0011128709352233">Table 4</xref>, which treat analysis of the two robbery types in a combined form, appear to be adequate for describing robbers’ use of force across commercial and street robberies. Disaggregating by robbery type is unnecessary and offers little advantage in explaining physical coercion. With respect to the seven hypotheses, six find support in the analyses conducted on robberies in this sample. The lone hypothesis not supported was that robberies involving nongun weapons are indistinguishable from those involving an unarmed perpetrator.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This research explored urban robberies in a single precinct of Detroit, a Rust Belt postindustrial city where the most serious street crime in the United States is typically concentrated. The purpose was to examine the extent to which robbers used physical coercion in different types of robberies not typically studied together: commercial robbery and street robbery. The former has been studied as a phenomenon unto itself, especially with regard to convenience stores (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128709352233">Amandus, Holmes, &amp; Zahn, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011128709352233">Wellford et al., 1997</xref>). By contrast, studies of robberies using NCVS victimization data are constrained to personal robberies because commercial robberies are not captured therein (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011128709352233">Baumer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128709352233">Cook, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128709352233">Kleck &amp; DeLone, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with efforts to understand serious violence, this research used data coded from official narratives to develop models predicting offenders’ choice to use physical force against robbery victims. The multivariate models generated results consistent with prior research: Less physical coercion is associated with gun robberies, robberies of females, robberies of African Americans, and robberies that occur during the day. More physical coercion is associated with street robberies and robberies by nonstrangers.</p>
<p>The only finding that appears contrary to previous analyses is that resistance generates a higher likelihood of physical coercion used against the victim. This runs counter to Tark and Kleck’s recent finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011128709352233">2004</xref>) involving analysis of the NCVS data suggesting that resistance is a wise course of action. As a general rule, based not only on Tark and Kleck’s analysis but on robbery data that cover the entire United States, resistance is a fair recommendation—but not in the context of a distressed urban neighborhood, where it actually becomes dangerous advice.</p>
<p>There is a known divergence between victimization data and official crime data. The process by which the winnowing of cases for official recording occurs is systematically linked with injury, gun use, and resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128709352233">Block &amp; Block, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128709352233">Cook, 1986</xref>), which are in turn related to victim reporting and police recording patterns. Robberies reported in the Eighth Precinct are no doubt subjected to these reporting biases. Nongun robbery attempts, for example, may generate much less concern among victims and police and therefore become likely to be systematically excluded from the sample. Additionally, data were coded from official reports and thus do not capture the subtle resistance categories and self-protection efforts that the NCVS probes in its interviews. Resistance here is generally active resistance, and it results in robbers’ application of physical coercion in many cases. Nuanced categorization of resistance found in this sample is not possible and may thus mask variation in resistance consequences.</p>
<p>The consistency of predictors across street and commercial robberies indicates that if a victim resists, then the likelihood of perpetrator violence escalates. Research involving samples of urban robbery victims and extensive interviews regarding their choices is necessary to untangle and resolve this issue. With respect to the NCVS robbery cases (75% of which do not involve guns), some resistance can be considered a wise and prudent course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011128709352233">Tark &amp; Kleck, 2004</xref>). However, when confronted with a gun—as most of the victims in officially recorded robberies in Detroit experienced—the idea of resistance collides with the code of the street, which dictates compliance and calmness.</p>
<p>Comparison of NCVS gun and nongun robberies is an important step in disentangling this question as well, but that sample (even with 25% gun use) yields few interviews with victims whose experiences correspond with those observed in Detroit’s Eighth Precinct. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128709352233">Felson et al. (2000)</xref> analyzed 4 years of victimization survey data comprising 1,201 robberies, 24.7% of which were gun robberies, which yields about 297 instances of victims’ confronting a gun based on 4 years of interviews. This amounts to about 75 gun robberies per year from which to draw inferences about the optimal patterns of victim behavior to avoid injury and thwart robberies. Injury is at least partially an artifact of luck, as evidenced by the 19 victims in the current sample who experienced a discharged firearm but no injury. It is also related to one’s resilience at weathering a physical assault with no injury; thus, rethinking injuries as a dependent measure appears to be necessary.<sup>6</sup> That the NCVS may undercount serious crimes suffered by victims is clear from Cook’s analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011128709352233">1985a</xref>) of missing gunshot wounds and more recent questions raised about injury counts in the NCVS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011128709352233">Lynch &amp; Cohen, 2007</xref>). Undercounting such serious victimization likely hampers a complete understanding of the violence faced by the urban poor—precisely the group in need of effective crime analysis and policy prescriptions.</p>
<p>Alternative data collection strategies are required if criminology is to make a more meaningful contribution to victims’ safety in the most distressed neighborhoods, such as those examined here. Such places are exactly the locations where serious robberies proliferate, like those that captured the attention of Chief Streicher at the outset. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011128709352233">Wright and Decker (1997a)</xref> surmised, robbery is being concentrated in the poorest neighborhoods where cash, not plastic credit, is king.</p>
<p>Thacher’s analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011128709352233">2004</xref>) of social class and robbery victimization indicates that a growing burden of robbery is falling on the poorest respondents in the NCVS, regardless of the types of events that it captures. Thus, “going where the robberies are,” to paraphrase a statement attributed to Willie Sutton, appears to aptly summarize an important future research agenda among American criminologists. That endeavor is the logical extension of work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011128709352233">Jacobs (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011128709352233">Wright and Decker (1997a)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011128709352233">Miller (1998)</xref>, who capitalized on the insight to query active robbers in the neighborhoods where they plied their trade.</p>
<p>One possible remedy could involve the NCVS surveyors’ establishing relationships with large urban police departments and systematically adding known victims of serious crime (e.g., gunshot wounds, robberies) to the sample currently interviewed. This will capture detailed accounts of more serious victimizations and so allow researchers to have a more accurate estimation of how victim behaviors influence robbery outcomes.</p>
