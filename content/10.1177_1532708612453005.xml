<abstract>
<p><italic>What are the challenges of doing feminist research within a military institution?</italic> This became the guiding force of my research with the Midwest Family Program of the National Guard (MWFP). This article examines both my experiences as a feminist scholar conducting research in a military institution as well as the gendered tensions within the MWFP. While in the field, my research shifted from a traditional ethnographic study to a deeply personal autoethnographic project. Analyzing my interviews, documents from MWFP, and published books by military wives, I consider how hegemonic masculinity and emphasized femininity shape the MWFP and public discourses of the military family. Simultaneously, I reflect on my own relationship with social power as an academic conducting research on a military institution. What my analysis exposes is how the National Guard relies on a complementary set of gender identities, at both the individual and institutional-level, reinforcing the position of hegemonic masculinity in society.</p>

<title>Caveat</title>
<p>I’m drawn to the hypermasculine. I’m drawn to places in which men—or a certain type of man—reign. This masculinity draws me in as it generates fear and anxiety. I want to peel back the layers of that which scares me—terrifies. I want to peel back the layers of that which I do not understand—war, military, trauma—and which has intruded upon my development as a woman. That which draws me in intellectually, emotionally, institutionally, interpersonally.</p>
<p>I do not consider myself a military sociologist. Sure, I have conducted research on women in the military (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532708612453005">Weber, 2008</xref>) and (as you will find out in this paper) with the Mid-West Family Program (MWFP)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1532708612453005">1</xref></sup> of the National Guard. I spent my first four years as an assistant professor focusing on these projects. Understandably, some of my colleagues often try to classify me as a military sociologist. But I am certain those who do military sociology would agree that I really do not fit into that field. I often wonder where it is I do fit. Yes, some of my larger projects have been focused on war and the military, but it is not because I am interested in understanding the structures and mechanisms of the military for their own sake. My interest in the military came from the personal affect war has had on me; the Vietnam War to be precise. My father’s experiences in the Vietnam War, along with his status as a Vietnam Veteran, deeply affected my home life while I was growing up. So, I wanted to understand how personal and cultural trauma shape individuals’ relationships with loved ones and their understanding of the social world. My dissertation was an attempt to understand those relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532708612453005">Weber, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>After earning my degree in 2005 and finding a tenure-track position, I turned my attention to the realities of the U.S.’s current war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. My goal was to examine how the military was handling family issues and the soldiers’ homecoming for this war. At the same time, I was also interested in what had changed since the Vietnam War because Vietnam Veterans and their families were largely left to fend for themselves as they tried to navigate the process that is now called reintegration. My interest in gender identity underlies all of these concerns. With all of these pieces working together, I strive to interrogate the relationship between the military and constructions of masculinity and femininity.</p>
<p>One final disclosure before I begin this story. I adhere to the foundations of feminist qualitative research that forego “traditional and rigid ideas about objectivity” in order to “[open] new spaces to consider the enduring question of bias” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532708612453005">Olesen, 2005</xref>, p. 251). As a feminist, woman, child of a Vietnam Veteran, and a survivor of childhood abuse, this story of the MWFP is not about me, but it <italic>is told</italic> by me. This means I come to this research with a specific set of ways I look at the world. This should not be interpreted as bias. Rather, my analysis should be recognized as an attempt to engage with what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532708612453005">Harding (1991)</xref> calls strong objectivity. It is a practice that compels me to “investigate the relation between subject and object rather than deny the existence of, or seek unilateral control over, this relation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532708612453005">Harding, 1991</xref>, p. 152). I assert that the only way I can present this material is by recognizing how I am on “the same critical, causal plane as the object of [my] inquiry” (p. 161). My motivations to study the MWFP have everything to do with my position within and experiences with patriarchal structures. This is why I am clear about not being a military sociologist. This is why I tell this story as a person who is affected by war without ever having been a soldier serving in a war.</p>

<title>Hindsight</title>
<p>While participating in an Inter-Service Family Assistance Committee (ISFAC)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1532708612453005">2</xref></sup> meeting, I looked around the table and wondered how I got to this place. Sitting with military personnel from the National Guard, the Marines, and the Navy, I felt awkward and out of place. The ISFAC’s mission is supposed to bring together civilian and military organizations, but I was probably the only civilian not employed by the military in some way. I knew I did not belong from the very beginning, yet I still wanted access to soldiers and their families so that I could understand the toll war was taking on them.</p>
<p>The more I went to these meetings and the more I observed the MWFP, the less comfortable I felt. The more I felt like I was drowning inside of an enormous bureaucratic machine that had very different interests and values than me. But somehow I knew this was the right direction. It was what I needed to do to better understand the cost of war. (Right?) Sometimes you have to step inside the machine to make sense of it, but I was never truly inside of it. At best, I was hanging on to its fringes, looking in. As a feminist scholar, I had a continual critical eye to the processes and workings of this highly masculinized institution. The people in the institution were kind and had a genuine concern for military families. However, they have to reside within the ideological frame of the military. It is a frame that sees the family as important, but only insofar as how it serves its current mission: war. For the folks around the table, there were multiple institutions at work: military, family, war, gender. All of these institutions (not to mention each person’s social baggage) shaped each of the 15 people sitting around this table. This felt like the best and worst place to examine the intersections of military, family, war, and gender.</p>

<title>The Tangle of Gender, Family, and the Military</title>
<p>I hate being drawn to the hypermasculine. Sometimes I wonder if it is an attraction to hegemonic masculinity or if it is an attraction to a power that can never be mine because of my gender. It is a power that generates fear and anxiety. It terrifies me, because in it I see violence and suffering. Every time I enter an institution and experience the various power dynamics within it, I shudder at the thought that I am powerless, as powerless as I was as a child.</p>
<p>Research in family and military were never the driving force behind my work. It is my interest in gender and power, along with current events and my personal history, that brought me to the areas of military, war, and family. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612453005">Connell (1987)</xref>, gender and power is at work in most social institutions. It is not just family that provides some of the primary ways we are socialized into gender, but the military and war are also key institutions that reinforce dominant understandings of gender power relations and help maintain the gender order—that is, patriarchy.</p>
<p>The only appropriate way to articulate the relationship among family, military, and gender is to understand it as a tangle of intricate relationships. The MWFP works with all of these social institutions, but in ways that fuse them into a single thread, making it challenging to pull out the different cross-sections and strands that a researcher often needs to explore social life in greater depth.</p>
<p>When dealing with family and gender, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532708612453005">Coltrane and Adams (2008)</xref> explain that “gender relations and family life are so intertwined that it is impossible to understand one without paying attention to the other” (p. 1). Our gender shapes the relationships in our families and often determines expectations surrounding our social position and “include hidden messages about gender” (Coltrane &amp; Adams, p. 25). Using a gender lens when looking at how the family works with the military is particularly helpful in my research, because it enables me to critically examine the type of family and gender relationships that the military relies on in their mission and structures.</p>
<p>Understanding gender relations in the family simultaneously with a patriarchal institution such as the military (and its counterpart, war) is important both in understanding how masculinity and femininity are working together in complex ways in the military, but also how an institution such as the family works with the military to reinforce patriarchal power structures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532708612453005">Goldstein (2004)</xref> reinforces the importance of conceptualizing the military and war as gendered institutions. He asserts in his book, <italic>War and Gender</italic>,
<disp-quote>
<p>The single main lesson of this book for those interested in gender is to pay attention to war. To end denial and face war’s influence on gender is, I believe, an important step in changing both sexism and the war system. (p. 411)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Goldstein is calling upon gender scholars to pay more attention to the institutions of military and war at the same time he calls upon researchers of military and war issues to address gender relations. Goldstein, like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532708612453005">Coltrane and Adams (2008)</xref>, argues that gender is a central part of understanding institutional forces (war and family, respectively). This has been an ongoing interest for me and I admittedly come to both the military and family through my interest in gender.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612453005">Connell’s (1987)</xref> work on hegemonic masculinity and emphasized femininity guides my analysis of the data and how the MWFP work at the intersection of gender, military, and family, I draw on. Hegemonic masculinity is the form of masculinity most admired and valued in a society at a particular time. It is an ideal more than a reflection of the personality and reality of the majority of men (Connell, p. 184). Connell emphasizes that hegemonic masculinity in our contemporary era is based largely on heterosexuality and its connection to the institution of marriage (p. 186). Hegemonic masculinity is a reflection of the power relations between it and subordinated forms of masculinity. These relationships are an important component of the patriarchal structures of society (Connell, p. 183). In the context of my work, I consider military masculinity as one form of hegemonic masculinity dominating our current culture.</p>
<p>At the same time, masculinity informs and is informed by femininity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612453005">Connell (1987)</xref> identifies emphasized femininity as the revered form of femininity that supports hegemonic masculinity. All femininity is subordinate to masculinity within patriarchal societies, but femininity is not unified in its compliance with the power structures engendered under patriarchy. Emphasized femininity “is defined around the compliance with this subordination and is oriented to accommodating the interests and desires of men” (Connell, p. 183). In an update on hegemonic masculinity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532708612453005">Connell and Messerschmidt (2005)</xref> discuss the importance of understanding the relationship between masculinity and femininity at both the institutional and interpersonal level. My work in the MWFP and the literature on military families provides key insights into the relationship between emphasized femininity and hegemonic masculinity at both the institutional and interpersonal levels of experience.</p>

<title>An Institutional Education: Entering, Working in, and Exiting the Field</title>
<p>During my time with the MWFP, I could feel myself slipping into the vortex of compliance. I hated the way I struggled to fit the methodological and sociological ideal. I wanted to say something meaningful and valuable. I wanted families to receive the attention they deserved, but I felt myself becoming more critical of what I observed and of my own position as researcher. I was trying so hard to be what I thought I should be—what I thought academia wanted me to be—that I lost my research voice. I handed it over to the academy’s expectations. I felt as powerless as my child self because I gave my power to something that terrified me. I didn’t have to give it away, but isn’t that how hegemony works?</p>
<p>I spent 2 years of my research life getting to know the workings of the MWFP. I made a contact with the MWFP through a colleague and built a rapport with that contact. I was granted tremendous access to the staff and a variety of activities and meetings going on within the MWFP. I entered the field with several broad questions: (a) What value did the National Guard place on families? (b) What support did families receive from the National Guard? and (c) How did the war in Iraq and Afghanistan impact the organizational processes of the MWFP?</p>
<p>Over the 2 years I worked with the MWFP, I collected myriad forms of data. Observational notes, interviews, documents from their meetings and programs, archival newspaper articles, and material relating to military families.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1532708612453005">3</xref></sup> It was my intention to conduct a relatively conventional ethnography of the MWFP in order to raise awareness about the work that was being done within the military for families. The war had led to tremendous growth in the MWFP. They grew from a staff of 3 to 18 in the 3 years since the war began and increased their visibility in the National Guard. The resources funneled to the MWFP indicate, at least on the surface, that the National Guard valued their soldiers’ families. During the time I was there, the MWFP struggled with typical organizational growing pains. Positions in their organization were not clearly spelled out. People were also stepping on each other’s toes at times, trying to figure out, as many of my informants stated, how to “stay in their own lanes.” Although I initially focused on the growing recognition of the needs of families, my attention shifted to <italic>the way</italic> growth was happening and how the military’s conception of family and gender relations shaped that growth. I became less interested in the fact that families were being considered as part of the military equation and more interested in the <italic>quality of the growth</italic> of the MWFP. I realized that the story I needed to tell was about <italic>how</italic> the growing recognition of the family shaped and reinforced meanings of gender and family.</p>
<p>Therefore, I became more interested in how conceptions of the family, generally, and gender, specifically, framed the way in which the MWFP handled family issues. A key argument I make in this paper is that the National Guard relies on a complementary set of gender identities, at both the individual and institutional-level to reinforce its societal role. The family, in this context, is fraught with traditional conceptions of heterosexual gender relations. Specifically, it conforms to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532708612453005">Dorothy Smith (1993)</xref> calls the <italic>standard North American Family</italic>. As she explains,
<disp-quote>
<p>The standard North American family is an ideological code in this sense. It is a conception of the family as a legally married couple sharing a household. The adult male is in paid employment; his earnings provide the economic basis of the family-household. The adult female may also earn an income, but her primary responsibility is to the care of husband, household, and children . . . (p. 52)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Much of the work going on in the military family both in what I observed with the MWFP and the memoirs of military wives, demonstrates work with this standard of family.</p>
<p>I knew at some point that I would shift my attention from the MWFP and its staff to the families served by the MWFP. I started working on gaining interviews with family members, but I envisioned a research project that enabled me to take my ethnographic work and expand it into a project that included survey data. Admittedly, I planned it this way, because I assumed that the military and those in positions of political power would have a bias for quantitative data. I assumed they would put more value in what the numbers were telling them and it would pique their interest, so that they would look more deeply at the qualitative data. Ironically, they did take it more seriously, but not with the effect I had anticipated.</p>
<p>I spoke with my primary contact about sending out an email to the families of National Guard soldiers, asking them to participate in a survey. She was open to the idea and thought it would provide helpful information for them as well as for my own research. She passed the information on to the MWFP State Family Director to make sure it would not pose any problems. Soon thereafter, he informed me that he had to run the request through the Judge Advocate General (JAG), but he did not foresee any problems. A few months later my contact told me she was leaving her position in the MWFP. This coincided with the news that JAG raised concerns about what would happen with the data I wanted to collect. The potential of my survey triggered concerns that my ethnographic research did not. I was essentially denied access to solicit for participants through the MWFP listserv. Looking back, I realize how naive I was, thinking that I could do this research without raising concerns from the National Guard. I thought this would be a relatively informative and benign survey, but it made me start to think about what kind of researcher I really am and what I am willing and unwilling to compromise in my desire to conduct research in a large institution such as the National Guard. Because I had been primarily functioning within the MWFP, it also reminded me that the MWFP was not its own organization. It answered to the larger power structures within the National Guard. I left with only three interviews with soldiers’ wives<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1532708612453005">4</xref></sup> and no survey data. I still had all the other data I collected during my 2 years with the MWFP, but I was left struggling with how to pick up the pieces of this work. Disheartened, I was unsure if I had anything to say even though I had an incredible amount of data.</p>
<p>The way I envisioned my research with the MWFP all but disintegrated. As a result, I started to understand that the story was changing and the research would still be about the work of the MWFP, but that it needs to be told from my own experiences. What I thought would be my most conventional research endeavor became a transformational experience that helped me understand what kind of researcher I am. My traditional ethnography morphed into an autoethnographic project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532708612453005">Ellis, 2003</xref>). By this I mean my analysis dramatically shifted to reflexive inquiry.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I am both the author and focus of the story, the one who tells and the one who experiences, the observer and the observed, the creator and the created. I am the person at the intersection of the personal and the cultural, thinking and observing as an ethnographer and writing and describing the storyteller. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532708612453005">Ellis, 2009</xref>, p. 13)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Inspired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532708612453005">Ellis’ (2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532708612453005">2009)</xref> work with autoethnography in conjunction with the struggles I had with this research, I knew that this research needed a different approach. I had to address the tensions between masculinity and femininity within the military and military family that kept rising to the forefront, because it kept pressing against a nerve in my own life. I started to recognize that my struggle with this research had everything to do with my anxiety and discomfort with both hegemonic masculinity and emphasized femininity. Therefore, I cannot tell the story of the MWFP and military families without providing insight into the depth of my personal turmoil. I am part of the story—for better and for worse.</p>
<p>What follows are analyses of the interviews I conducted with the staff of the MWFP and observational notes from my ethnographic work, as well as 10 randomly selected books on military families written by military wives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1532708612453005">5</xref></sup> I use the ethnographic data in conjunction with the books in order to examine the discourses surrounding gender relations from both the perspective of military wives and the staff of the MWFP. Why am I including literature by military wives in my analysis? The information provided by the staff of the MWFP was rich, but did not tell enough of the story about family experiences with the military. There are an unprecedented number of books published on the experiences of military wives and if I wanted to understand the perception of military families, I needed to address how popular media was selling the story of military wives.</p>

<title>War and Gender: Shifting Priorities, Not Patriarchy</title>

<title>To ensure total force family readiness</title>
<p>Reading this statement, the work of the MWFP and its extension, ISFAC, contextualizes the family as part of a military war mission. <italic>Family readiness</italic> to support soldiers. <italic>Readiness</italic> for the absence of the spouse, father, son, mother, or daughter. <italic>Family</italic> as the standard North American family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532708612453005">Smith, 1993</xref>). <italic>Family</italic>, which moves through the contours of emphasized femininity and hegemonic masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612453005">Connell, 1987</xref>). The work of the MWFP, and its various resources and services, are provided to support the soldier <italic>and</italic> the National Guard. Their <italic>war mission</italic> is the family, so they focus their attention on the experiences, struggles, and challenges the family faces while the soldier is deployed. Although the staff of the MWFP work within an organizational frame that departs from what one might expect within a military institution, they nonetheless must function within traditional military protocol. The MWFP, as an organization, functions much like emphasized femininity. That is, it functions to support the mission and work of the National Guard, an institution of hegemonic masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532708612453005">Kronsell, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The trajectory of growth in the MWFP reflects a growing recognition within the National Guard in particular, and the military in general, of the importance of the family. The increased importance is the result of a variety of factors. One significant factor includes the growing numbers of military members who are married with children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532708612453005">Karney &amp; Crown, 2007</xref>). Another important factor is the perception that retention relies on keeping the soldiers happy and to keep soldiers happy (particularly married ones) they must keep families happy. Family and soldiers are understood as a unit. As the Family Director of MWFP succinctly stated when talking about the priority of the MWFP, “Family first, then soldiers. But most of the family issues are related to something with the soldier anyway.” The work of the MWFP focuses on relationships between the soldier and his/her family (primarily wives and children, but also some parents). The growth of the MWFP in the face of our current war efforts has shifted the position of the MWFP within the National Guard. This recognition, though, is not about the value of families as much as it is about supporting the National Guard’s war efforts.</p>
<p>Watching the workings of the main office of the MWFP, in which six of the staff did their daily work, the dynamics between the staff were relaxed and informal. There was a sense that the work between the staff did not emphasize the hierarchy of the chain of command that is dominant in military organization. When I asked the Family Readiness Coordinator about the way the hierarchy was set up (I mistakenly assumed she was in charge of the workings of the office), she struggled with her response.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As far as a hierarchy of who’s where? Yeah, well that’s kind of—I don’ t know if anyone would say that they’re—I’d say that we all would probably say that we are team players rather than a hierarchy of who belongs to who, because I mean I really don’t ask [others in the office] anything because they really fall underneath the Family Assistance Coordinator. So, uhm, it’s kind of interesting how things work. However, you know, we didn’t have any of those people when I came on.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some of her struggle reflects the growing pains of the MWFP, but it also reflects the way the MWFP does its work. They function as an independent staff that works together to support families and provide them necessary resources and support.</p>
<p>The organization of the MWFP also reflects the general apathy that dominated the National Guard’s shifting attitude toward the MWFP. Repeatedly, my informants explained how the current war suddenly threw them into a new position in the National Guard. The Family Readiness Coordinator explained that
<disp-quote>
<p>the [MWFP] itself falls directly underneath the Assistant Adjutant General. So the [MWFP] is a very visible program. So prior to deployment, the Family Program did not have that high of a status. In fact, it was a relatively low status program and did not get much attention.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One of the social workers employed by the MWFP perceived the changes in the priority of the family as a part of recruiting and retention.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Certainly with the war starting, the organization, as every other military organization across the nation, identified that “oh my, this might have a negative effect on recruiting and retention” . . . They talk about the three-legged member, you have the service member, you have the family, and you have the employer and those are the three entities that are going to retain your service members. So, talking about a pop culture term when they say, “if mama ain’t happy, no one ain’t happy.” I mean that they are recognizing that family is a huge piece of that. If you have family members unhappy about with how their service member is being treated or supported or not supported that has a huge impact.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This perspective was reinforced by the Family Readiness Coordinator. When I asked her about the impetus behind the shifting view of the family within the National Guard, she stated,</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Family Readiness Coordinator:</speaker>
<p>Well, I think families actually decided.</p>

<speaker>Family Readiness Coordinator:</speaker>
<p>Yeah. It really was. When, when deployment started those of us in the program certainly realized the importance of the [MWFP], but it was hard to convince others in the National Guard and even up until then families didn’t have much interest in the [MWFP] because they didn’t think their soldier was going anywhere. So as a result of those deployments [to Iraq] everyone stood up and took notice and then it’s status was really escalated to immediate, I mean right underneath the Adjutant General.</p>
</speech>
<p>Ultimately, the combination of concerns over retention and recruitment, the changing face of National Guard deployments to be centered around war missions, and the voices of the families affected the way the National Guard perceived the value of families and the MWFP. The complex negotiation of priorities established a value of the family that reinforced patriarchal ideals rather than changing its own values as an institution of hegemonic masculinity.</p>

<title>Supporting the National Guard, Supporting the Soldier: The Real Work of Emphasized Femininity</title>
<p>Both the data from my work with the MWFP and the published books by military wives reinforce the ways individuals and institutions such as the MWFP uphold the position of emphasized femininity in relation to hegemonic masculinity. The MWFP exemplifies the way institutions are set up to create a power structure that supports the importance and value of patriarchal ideology. The MWFP and the National Guard function through an interdependent relationship in order to function effectively. Similarly, the military family relies on the perception of the supportive and dedicated wife, who manages home life in order for her husband to serve in war.</p>
<p>Although the MWFP was gaining recognition and support within the National Guard, its work was contextualized as highly feminized. The fact that women predominantly work and function within the MWFP correlates with the type of work they are expected to do as they deal with families (primarily women) of soldiers. As the Family Readiness Coordinator told me, “I’m a former teacher. [Our Youth Coordinator] is a former teacher. A lot of the soft-skilled professions tend to migrate to us.” The staff consists of a number of teachers and former and current social workers. Understandably, most of the staff has worked in human services in one form or another. The importance of <italic>soft-skills</italic>—and how they define and understand soft-skills in this context—is important to how the MWFP functions. The staff consisted of six men and ten women. With one exception, the men were either in leadership positions or worked alone in one of the satellite offices across the state.</p>
<p>At the top of the MWFP’s chain of command is the Family Program Director. His position works with and between the MWFP and the National Guard. This position is key to understanding how the MWFP functions within the National Guard. The director functions as a conduit of information between the hierarchy of the National Guard and the informal networks of family relations he must oversee in the MWFP. He explained that
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m kind of the policy guy. The one that relates stuff from the national level, the National Guard Bureau, um, state level . . . the Adjutant General, down to the trenches. I’m kinda the link to the state commands. The educator from the Guard Bureau, and the one that kind of oversees the whole program. I’m what they call a “joint” person.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>He understood his position in relationship to the National Guard, but as he explained his relationship to the MWFP, he, like the Family Readiness Coordinator, did not feel comfortable talking about his position in the same terms of the chain of command that dominates then National Guard’s organization. Yet, he recognized his position of authority in the MWFP. When I asked him about overseeing the staff in the program, he stated, “[They are] not necessarily under me, but <italic>I’m the state</italic>, [emphasis added] you know, and then we have the wing and the Army.” As the representative of the state, he clearly understood where he rested in the power structures of the National Guard and MWFP, yet did not want to articulate his position in direct terms when addressing the work within the MWFP.</p>
<p>This, in part, could be because he was relatively new to the position (approximately 1 year), but it also conveys the innocuous (yet essential) way that power flows between the National Guard and the MWFP. The Family Readiness Coordinator told me that she worked with him frequently in her job, which was necessary for her work, but also to train him. “He [Family Program Director], um, it’s been an opportunity to kind of mentor him along because he came in from outside [the MWFP] and not, you know, he basically came into a challenge. A challenging job.” The value of educating both the National Guard chain of command about family issues and civilians about the realities of war deployments were dominant features discussed by each staff member I interviewed. It reinforced the value that the staff placed in their work to support and educate the National Guard even as they struggled with their contributory position within the National Guard.</p>
<p>As the MWFP has grown and more attention has been given to the work that they do, there is growing accountability to the larger National Guard structures. The Family Readiness Coordinator has to work with command officers to set up briefings and trainings for soldiers and families. She explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>So the commanders ultimately decide when and where and how and all that, you know. It’s kind of a—it’s a joint effort. Some of it, though, like the meeting I’m doing . . . this weekend. These other full-timers that are getting soldiers ready to go do not have anything to do with that. I’m doing kind of a briefing before the briefing. An initial briefing to help families, because we know families are anxious out there. So I’m coming in, I’m going to meet them. Tell them, you know, who the [MWFP] is. Here’s what our FACs [Family Assistance Centers] can do for you. Here’s what a FAC is. Some of them do not even know there is a FAC. So, so that then is just driven by me—or the [MWFP].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is very different from their earlier experiences before the war in Iraq. As the Family Assistance Specialist at the main office explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>I started here kind of working more direct with the families and of course we didn’t have a boss, it was just five individuals running Family Assistance Centers [FAC] around the state and doin’ our own thing. Talkin’ to each other, “whatta ya doin’ here, whatta ya doin’ there, how are ya doin’ this, how are ya doin’ that?” You know, the military would keep feedin’ us, “this is what we want.” We had to do reports for this, reports for that and we were goin’ “geezus criminy we gotta keep doin’ these frickin’ reports, we got no time to talk to our families and meet with them anymore.” So then they [National Guard leaders] were like, we gotta have a coordinator, we gotta have a leader for all you guys to take care of that business so you can do your ground, foot business.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The evolution of the MWFP moved from an organization with little attention from the leaders of the National Guard left to take care of the families with scant resources to a growing subfield that still remains on the margins of the National Guard. It has become not only more structured and better resourced, but also more accountable to the larger workings of the National Guard.</p>
<p>When asked about struggles she faced in her day-to-day work, the Family Coordinator stated that “I don’t really think anything except that sometimes we go up against command and you have to do things that way. Otherwise, I think it’s pretty good.” She went on to explain that she wished
<disp-quote>
<p>That we [MWFP] didn’t have to do—have as many regulations kinds of things. You know? Sometimes you can get—the rules that the Guard, the memorandums and the, you know, you want to take more families here or other. And you want to allow them to do more things.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She felt some constraint between the work to help families and the work to follow the National Guard’s bureaucratic rules. The staff struggled with some of the policy coming down from the National Guard leadership. All of the staff spoke about the disjuncture between what the MWFP needs to accomplish for their families and what the National Guard thinks are the best practices that they put into policy. Many of these disjunctures were the result of both the gendering process of the MWFP and the regional issues faced by this MWFP, which worked with a large number of rural families.</p>
<p>At the interpersonal level, the work that military wives discuss as their “mission” primarily emphasized the importance of supporting their soldiers and their homes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532708612453005">Stevens (2010)</xref> reminds readers
<disp-quote>
<p>Don’t forget to tell them [your soldiers] how much you appreciate them. I believe that we should feel very proud to be military families, and that we should work together to make one another successful in our mission. I don’t look forward to Brian deploying again, but at the same time, I can’t help but be thankful that I am married to someone who cares about others, who believes in something greater than himself, and who is setting such an amazing example for our children. (pp. 31-32)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although she is asserting the importance of mutual support, it is clear that the importance of her husband’s work is worth the sacrifice of having to be without her husband and face the worry and risk of losing him in war.</p>
<p>The importance of support for the deployed husband was a continual theme in the memoirs. It was discussed in terms of how to maintain clear communication and keep the stress of home to a minimum for their husbands, as well as being aware and cognizant of the ways in which their husbands may change after the do come home from war.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . the realization once again hit me that MY service was not over. I also knew from past experience that it would not be for some time. My husband needed me, and would continue to need me to help him readjust in a patient and loving manner. I believe that this is a key concept for the military family. We must realize that the “tour” may be over, but the “tour of marriage” is just the beginning again. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532708612453005">Stevens, 2010</xref>, p. 21)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The language of the military again intervenes. The <italic>tour of marriage</italic> is used to articulate the work involved in reintegration. Although the importance of supporting their husband was a steady theme, there were degrees of ambiguity running through it.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I stayed strong because I thought that’s what he needed. By “strong” I mean that I didn’t cry or really say much to him about how I was feeling. That was totally out of character for me, because most of the time I talk about my feelings. I don’t like to keep anything in where it can eat me alive. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532708612453005">Dawalt, 2007</xref>, p. 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This wife struggled to be what she thought her husband needed and conform to emphasized femininity. In this case, it was a woman who controlled her emotions as she looked to her husband’s needs first and foremost</p>
<p>Support also included other expectations that focused on relieving stress and worry from the husband who was overseas. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532708612453005">Pavlicin (2003)</xref> comments that spouses she has spoken with emphasize the importance of the gender of their friendships.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Some spouses say that being around same-gender friends allows them to talk more freely without adding to their spouses’ anxieties . . . Why same gender? One wife explained, “If I spend too much time with any other male, my husband worries that the man is taking his place.” (p. 132)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The emphasis on heteronormativity not only focused on the supportive element that a wife provides, but also affected the way in which military wives structure their social life. Penny Monetti (2011) reinforced this in her discussion of ways of coping with the stress of her husband being deployed,
<disp-quote>
<p>When our husbands offered no sympathy regarding the perils of potty training, worries of a child readjusting to a new school, or the need to talk to someone without a milk moustache, Stitch Club filled the void . . . (p. 192)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Stitch Club being a knitting group for the women to come together and vent about their struggles. Friendships with other women in traditional activities were often the advice that the wives provided for other women.</p>
<p>The importance of support is reinforced with a model of femininity that is not exactly what I expected when I read these books. The books relied upon the idea that women are not socialized to take care of themselves and their homes and that these books were providing a model to follow. It is a model that asks the women to strive to be the rock of support for their husbands as they simultaneously understand their limitations and abilities as women. I found the messages confusing at times and had to remember that these were popular culture images of military wives—even if they were written by military wives. The ideals of emphasized femininity complemented the hegemonic masculinity placed on soldiers and the work of war. Much of the work or war relied on the maintenance of the standard North American Family. This is not to say that this is the way all men and women in the military live their daily lives, but more about the ideal expectations to conform to patriarchal family structures that complement military structures.</p>

<p>The books published by military wives reflect the growing attention of families in this war era. The way the women write about their experiences as military wives builds a greater understanding of how emphasized femininity complements hegemonic masculinity. The language used by the women in the books I analyzed consistently borrowed from the language of the military, translating it and utilizing it in ways to articulate their experiences at home. The language of the family, in these books, was infused with military descriptors, which upheld hegemonic masculinity through their own adherence to emphasized femininity. You can see this in the chart above, excerpted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612453005">Kay’s (2002)</xref> book, <italic>Heroes at Home</italic>. The translation from “military speak” to “spouse speak” reinforces the work that women must do to support and reinforce the value and meaning of the work that military spouses are doing. The relationship between hegemonic masculinity and the public sphere of action for the soldier is consistently countered with emphasized femininity’s dominance and navigation of the private sphere of home and hearth. The clear position of wives in the home and the work they do to support and stand by their soldiers is a central and continual theme in these books, even as they vary in the ways in which the authors recommend other wives cope with the deployments.</p>
<p>The language of the military in the books published by military wives draws on placing value on women’s work at home in military terms. Chapter and book titles such as “Plungers &amp; Other Survival Gear” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532708612453005">Pavlicin, 2003</xref>), “The Family Mission” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532708612453005">Stevens, 2010</xref>), “What You Can Do for Your Warrior” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1532708612453005">Monetti &amp; Monetti, 2011</xref>), <italic>365 Deployment Days: A Wife’s Survival Story</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532708612453005">Dawalt, 2007</xref>), <italic>Happily Ever After Combat</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532708612453005">Stevens, 2010</xref>), and <italic>Standing By: The Making of an American Military Family in a Time of War</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532708612453005">Buckholtz, 2009</xref>) were consistently utilized along with discussions of how to cope with deployment and the stress of daily life without their husbands. This echoes the language used by staff of the MWFP and their way of addressing the family and providing support for family issues. The importance of “briefings” was discussed frequently in the MWFP’s work with families, as a way to inform families about how to prepare for deployment. In addition, the staff often spoke of having to teach family members the language of the military, including the numerous acronyms. This was also a key feature of some of the books, which often provided a glossary of acronyms commonly used in the military (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532708612453005">Garrett &amp; Hoppin, 2009</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532708612453005">Pavlicin, 2003</xref>). The learning process is a seemingly obvious and necessary point, but it is important to understand how these books reinforce a language that supports the work of war through women’s at home management of homelife in the midst of a great deal of uncertainty.</p>
<p>I found the language particularly interesting when juxtaposed with the way in which the Family Director spoke about his wife managing the home while he was deployed to Iraq.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’ve been in the Guard for 21 years; it’ll be 21 years next week. And I’ve applied for several full-time positions, but the ones that really interest me, and having been deployed, being a father of three, I just really thought I could bring a different perspective to the position [head of Family Program]. And I think it’s very important. I just . . . the soldier gets the easy job . . . we do! We go to work, we got three squares a day, we got a roof over our head, we got free gas, vehicles to drive, somebody to fix ’em, we got heaters and air conditioners, uh, plenty of water, I mean, what else do we need? <italic>We got the gun and all the bullets we want</italic>. You know? <italic>We don’t have to deal with the day-to-day crap of living in the real world</italic>.[emphasis added] You know? It’s structured, it’s scheduled, you’re fed, you’re happy . . . soldiers got it easy. And I say that all the time. The hard part is being the ones stayin’ at home.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>His comments were sincere. I could sense the level of appreciation he felt about the work his wife did at home. His comments speak to the way in which the military reinforces a relationship between masculinity and femininity. <italic>We got the gun and all the bullets we want</italic> juxtaposed against <italic>the day-to-day crap of living in the real world</italic>. There is something in his words that triggered for me a symbiotic interdependency between hegemonic ideals of masculinity and the requisite support of emphasized femininity that patriarchy requires to maintain itself. Although on the surface he articulated appreciation for his wife, his social position affords him the ability to rhetorically give value to his wife’s work as he establishes his own masculine position in the military.</p>
<p>This is neither to diminish his work in Iraq, nor the work he did with the MWFP. I only want to highlight the complexity in which language plays into the way the construction of hegemonic masculinity in the military context and its supportive diminutive of emphasized femininity.</p>

<title>Tensions Between Super Women and Heroic Institution</title>
<p>In their 12 years of marriage, she estimates he’s been deployed at least half of the time. Dorothy herself is a cross between a super hero and Marilyn Monroe. She’s too busy <italic>treading water</italic> [emphasis added] to notice, but her friends who have watched this suddenly single spouse work full-time, mow the lawn, raise three kids, patch the fence, change the oil, program the VCR, and file the taxes while remaining a happy and fulfilled person have stopped to admire (Karen Pavlicin, p. 95).</p>
<p>For the most part, in my view, I’m surprised at how, I thought that today’s generation, the x’ers and the y’ers. I’m 56 years old, so I look at how, to me, I thought that the couples, you know, the spouse was a lot more independent, and with the things that can happen in this world, and they’re not. They really relied on their husband to take care of “our things,” and “our home,” and “my car,” and all this stuff. You asked me a specific, but it’s all general. We’ve worked on worrying about the lawn, to the snow, to the front door breaking, it’s all nitty gritty. They’ll call and say “what can I do, can you help me?” You bet. We have people we can call that are handy men, or the Family Readiness Groups, when they get together, they make lists. That’s their job. Make a list of people who are handy, and share it with us, so instead of calling you they can call me and I can say who can fix this door, who knows a little about electricity because the light switch broke, who knows about a car, her battery is dead, can you go over an help her (Family Assistance Specialist).</p>
<p>The tension between the helpless wife and the superwoman made me consider the complex ways women respond to the emphasized feminine ideal. The books struggled with the ideal military wife in different ways, but most articulated the status of superwoman was a challenge, but it was a worthy challenge as their husbands were making the ultimate sacrifice for their country. Dorothy in the passage above, represents the ideal that many of the wives writing these books directly and indirectly refer to in their conceptions of what makes a good military wife. At the same time, this contrasts with the reality that some of the staff of the MWFP discussed in their day-to-day work. They faced calls with wives who were struggling to get by and who fell into moments of helplessness, anxiety, and despair. In this final section, I reflect on the tensions and shifts in emphasized femininity, particularly in contrast to the perceptions of staff and the work they do for families.</p>
<p>As I read through the books by military wives, part of me wondered if these types of books were necessary because this was the sort of woman and family that the military needed to support the military, generally, and war deployments, specifically. When examining both the interviews and the books, I discovered how the superwoman was an ideal that the wives in the books and the staff of the MWFP simultaneously believed in and understood as an unrealistic standard. Doing this work made me realize how much we are affected by ideals that can often uphold patriarchal power in the name of some personal sense of newfound empowerment and independence.</p>
<p>I set up <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532708612453005">Pavlicin’s (2003)</xref> quote with one of my informants in order to highlight the disjunctures between ideal and real experiences of families—particularly women spouses navigating emphasized femininity. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612453005">Connell (1987)</xref> makes clear regarding hegemonic masculinity and emphasized femininity, these are ideals that we uphold for ourselves and others. These are not necessarily people who live and exist in the world. Pavlicin’s description of the spouse who is part superhero, part Marilyn Monroe, sets up an unattainable ideal, which she claims <italic>does</italic> exist in the world, even though this woman is <italic>treading water</italic>. The tension within the ideal is further revealed in one of my informant’s descriptions about the helplessness he identifies his day-to-day work with spouses of deployed soldiers. I find this striking, because there is a challenge that the women in these memoirs struggle to articulate: that of navigating independence and strength in ways that do not challenge the relationship between hegemonic masculinity and emphasized femininity. What I found emerging in the memoirs was an emphasized femininity that was structured around showing strength and independence when managing home and family alone, but negotiating that strength in a way that did not threaten the balance between husband and wife upon the soldier’s return home. To boil it down more, emphasized femininity as articulated in the military wife is one that is independent but not threatening to the soldier’s hegemonic masculinity. The perfect mix of superhero and Marilyn Monroe.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612453005">Kay (2002)</xref> discusses the top 10 qualities of a hidden hero (i.e., the wife of a soldier). They include sense of humor, flexibility, courageous, strong, patriotic, faithful, independent, acronym reader, and superhero. At the same time, she discusses the importance of sacrifice for a wife of a service member and highlights a number of different military wives, who she considers hidden heroes. For example, she highlights a woman who gave up advanced study at MIT to be a military spouse. This woman responds to Kay’s question about whether or not she regrets being a military family,
<disp-quote>
<p>Maybe a few twitches of longing here and there, especially when I read my alumni magazine from college. Because my classmates are getting advanced degrees, becoming partners in law firms, and achieving a lot out there. Then one of my kids laughs or runs up to give me a hug, and I think “Not on your life.” (p. 38)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although I do not claim that motherhood is any more or less important than any other work a woman does, I do wonder about the strong sentiment within the discourse of military wives to be willing to sacrifice their own desires and ambitions in order to support their husband’s service. The quality of flexibility that Kay outlines in her book implies the willingness to sacrifice their own desires in the name of the value of their husband’s work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532708612453005">Garrett and Hoppin (2009)</xref> reinforce this when they state,
<disp-quote>
<p>The need to remain flexible is nowhere more evident than in spouse employment and education . . . The desire to create a life for yourself and the need to balance it with your servicemember’s military service is a challenge that has faced many spouses throughout the years. (p. 13)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Oftentimes, within the perimeters of these books, the wives find balance through other mechanisms in the home and/or within the context of the military as they move or struggle without their husbands quite a bit of the time.</p>
<p>The military wife as superhero builds on the support of the soldier and military instutition. Much of this theme relies on the notion that women can do everything—when they need to. The books focused on how to do tasks at home that normally their husbands did. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532708612453005">Dawalt (2007)</xref> has a chapter titled, “Man, Who Needs a Man?” in which she discusses her struggle to learn to depend on herself for household tasks her husband would normally do. She discusses the process of learning to change the lights in one part of her house.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Next I had to take down my lights and put back the homeowners’ lights—all seven of them! Here again I had to tell myself “you can do it, you can do it.” I turned up my Kelly Clarkson CD, and with “Miss Independent” playing . . ., I set about changing the light fixtures. I am afraid of heights, so getting on top of the ladder and balancing myself and the light fixtures was no small feat. Seven light fixtures took me four hours to change, but I did it all by myself—no man needed. So see, if I can do it, anyone can. (p. 46)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612453005">Kay (2002)</xref> discusses a similar situation in which she needed to plow her driveway.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I finally shook the snow off my boots and went inside in time to get the kids ready for school, my husband’s operations officer called and asked in an “I’ll help the little woman out” way: “Would you like me to come over and snowblow your driveway?” I squared my shoulders, smiled sweetly, and held the phone firmly in my hand as I replied. “No, thanks, I’ve already cleared our driveway—and two more!” (p. 20)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The range of attitudes may vary, but in each there is a clear value in the importance of women taking control of the home when necessary. This newfound ability to do things they never imagined in support of their husband exemplifies a form of empowerment that runs counter to structural mechanisms of patriarchy. Underlying many of these memoir was the tension between the empowered independent woman and the woman who understands her place within the standard North American Family and in relation to the military organization.</p>
<p>The tension between their newfound independence and maintaining emphasized femininity is highlighted in the way the women narrate preparation for the return of the soldier. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532708612453005">Stevens (2010)</xref> expressed a great deal of ambiguity about her husband’s return and the disruption that created to her routine. As she explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>I realized that I did resent him trying to take control of the finances, spending money, or “messing with my schedule.” I was so used to managing every minute of the day, getting the kids on a consistent routine, and doing things my way that I had eliminated any opportunity for Brian to be involved or give an opinion. (p. 25)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She identifies several scenarios that can occur upon a soldier’s return home, including “the soldier who returns and immediately begins to discredit the spouse at home, change everything back to the way that they want it, and criticize the actions that were taken in their absence” (p. 25).</p>
<p>Not all women, though, find their time during their husband’s deployment empowering. Instead, they contend with feelings of isolation, loneliness, and helplessness as they navigate crises (large and small) that lead them to call the Family Assistance Centers (FACs) or the leaders of the Family Readiness Groups (FRGs). The need for a part of the National Guard to deal with family, who are often civilians with little knowledge of military jargon and protocol, requires a level of flexibility and willingness to deal with problems that do not have quick fixes. The staff of the family program often complained about how much they had to hold the hands of their spouses, yet maintained that on some level, that was part of the job.</p>
<p>The level of comfort of dealing with human emotions and stress among the staff of the MWFP ranged dramatically. Two of the Family Assistance Specialists voiced some of their discomfort about handling issues that were too emotional for them. The specialist positions require the most direct contact with family members, because they take calls from the families and are often the first ones to hear from families in their day-to-day stress. One of the specialists, a woman who worked on her own in one of the satellite offices, commented, “Oh, yeah. I don’t do well with people calling me crying. It’s like, oh . . .” She preferred, “organizing and you know, paperwork, that’s my personality.” She was relieved when the MWFP hired social workers to handle some of the more challenging emotional issues. “Well I work with the groups but she [social worker] gets to do all that touchy feeling stuff.” The other specialist, a man who worked out of the main office with primarily women, voiced similar frustration with handling emotional issues family members faced.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>And then, thank God, we got social workers to help. That was one of the best things that ever happened to us. You got a broken car, I’ll talk to you, but if you’ve got something personal or emotional, this is who you talk to. And there were very few of us at the time. But we are so much better resourced. Now, it’s a whole 360 on all our resources.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For this particular specialist, the ability to forward <italic>personal</italic> or <italic>emotional</italic> issues to the social workers enabled him to function more effectively. He did not express that these issues were beyond the perimeters of the MWFP, but that there were certain people who should take care of those issues, who he felt were qualified. Before the social workers were added to the staff, he referred calls to women on staff. “Luckily we had a couple of women starting then, and women can understand that.” <italic>That</italic> meant the emotional anxiety that some of the wives experienced during deployments.</p>
<p>Within the work of the MWFP, support networks were established through the FRGs. In these groups, many of the women attempted to fill in the blanks of their own abilities and strengths in order to manage the home on their own. From the data I had started collecting on the wives of deployed soldiers, I began to recognize that the women did their best to hold their families and homes together during the deployment. The challenges that the women faced were not as neatly framed as the books their counterparts published. Instead, the tension between ideal and real created impediments for both the women maintaining the household without their spouses and the reintegration process.</p>

<title>Caveat as Conclusion</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Accomplished autoethnographers do not proclaim how things are or how life should be lived, but instead strive to open up a moral and ethical conversation with readers about the possibilities of living life well.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532708612453005">Ellis, 2009</xref></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Again, I return to the caveat that initiated this paper. I am by no means an <italic>accomplished ethnographer</italic>, but my goal is still that which Ellis articulates—<italic>to open a conversation</italic>. My personal investment in this research and the way that I left the field ended up creating turmoil for me in a number of ways. It is reflected here in my struggle to figure out how to end this paper. In some ways, I end the way I started. With limitations. I do not have enough of a sample of wives to be able to provide a meaningful contrast between the published memoirs and the lived experiences of women struggling to keep her home and family together during deployments. But I do have clarity in my purpose and aim.</p>
<p>As a feminist scholar focused on how women navigate within gendered institutions, I am intrigued by the way femininity tangles up with masculinity. The ideal (read hegemonic) forms of masculinity push and pull against ideal (read emphasized) femininity. The interesting insight that the memoirs provide is how women interpret taking on what they consider masculinized aspects of running a household. These newfound roles disrupt the boundaries of gender conformity that they often work so hard to maintain in their descriptions. The idea of feminine independence that is nonthreatening to masculinity sets up a contradictory standard that challenges women and men when deployments end. As with many of the challenges of reintegration, going back to what existed prior to deployment is too much to ask of all those involved. Although the impulse is to find normalcy as defined by what existed before deployment, the real work of reintegration (and the gendered components within reintegration) involve a nuanced negotiation between what the soldier gained and lost during deployment and what the spouse gained and lost at home.</p>
<p>What interests me is how gender norms and ideals impact the reintegration process. From this research, as well as my previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532708612453005">Weber, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532708612453005">2008a</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1532708612453005">2010</xref>), what I have observed are the ways gender norms are challenged in war, but not just for the men and women who go into battle. The spouses (women/wives in this case) must confront gender norms and ideals, which makes the reintegration process doubly challenging as men often have to face a variety of anxieties about their own gendered identities.</p>
<p>As much as I want to believe that the women who wrote the memoirs I analyzed have it all under control, I cannot help but wonder how much that control undermines the real work that is necessary for successful reintegration. When I sat around those tables and observed the ISFAC meetings and listened to my informants talk about their work and military families, I could not help but think back to my life with my father. The I (me) in this research had to contend continuously with memory “as it flashe[d] up at a moment of danger” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532708612453005">Benjamin, 1968</xref>, p. 257; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532708612453005">Ellis, 2009</xref>). My past incessantly haunted my present research. Autoethnography has layered impact upon the research moment. As I wove together my data analysis, I went through a number of revisions of myself and my father as I simultaneously reexperienced past events in my life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532708612453005">Ellis, 2009</xref>). I kept reflecting on my past as well as my motives for doing this work. What was I after? I guess part of me wanted to find a solution that was healthier and safer for this generation of soldiers and families than it was for me and my family. That by trying to find answers to the struggles of present veterans, I wanted to believe there would be an answer for me. I wanted to believe that by naming it (reintegration) then maybe there would be more <italic>possibilities for living life well</italic> in the postwar experience. It is never that simple, though. With headlines such as “After Service, Veteran Deaths Surge: Suicides, Vehicle Accidents and Drug Overdoses Take Lives” becoming more and more frequent, my hope wanes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532708612453005">Glantz, 2010</xref>). It has been 44 years since my father was in Vietnam and my family is still dealing with the aftershocks. I cannot help but wonder where all the families the MWFP serve will be 44 years after Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>This is pseudonym. The Family Program is a part of the National Guard in each state. The Family Program is largely responsible for supporting families during deployments by providing resources and support through Family Assistance Centers (FACs) and initiating and overseeing Family Resource Groups (FRGs), which are primarily run by wives and other family members of National Guard soldiers.</p>

<p>There are a variety of Inter-Service Family Assistance Committees (ISFAC) across the country. This ISFAC emerged out of the work done by members of the MWFP. I became involved in the ISFAC from its inception in our region in the summer of 2006. Once a quarter we would meet at various facilities that ranged from military bases in the state to the offices at the Red Cross. There were a variety of topics covered at these meetings. Usually the discussion included updates on information available for families and news about any issues that families might be facing. Early on, the meetings had about 15 people in attendance. Later meetings grew to 20 to 25 people. Members included individuals such as employees of the MWFP, National Guard soldiers, Veterans Administration representatives, employees of resources such as Military One Source, representatives from different military branches (i.e. Navy, Marines), and political representatives. I was one of two academic members. Importantly, there was no strictly family representation.</p></fn>

<p>I took observational notes at all meetings I attended over a 2-year period. For the interviews, I used a semistructured interview process. I interviewed 11 people who worked with the MWFP.</p></fn>

<p>When doing a search for books on U.S. military families on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link>, approximately 750 citations come up. Narrowing that down to military families and deployments in the current war era, approximately 80 citations remained. Of those, over two-thirds are counseling and how-to manuals, 5 are memoirs, and another 5 are research oriented academic books. Books by military wives took the form of memoirs and how-to manuals for other military wives. I randomly selected from both memoirs and how-to manuals.
