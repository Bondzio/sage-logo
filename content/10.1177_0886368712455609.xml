<abstract>
<p>The author’s contention is that just as our political leaders are realizing that, 4 years into economic depression, they need to combine their austerity approach with a new focus on investment and growth; so the balance of compensation and reward activities in our organizations needs to shift away from an extreme cost focus toward policies that more positively engage their employees and develop their talent. Using data from a comprehensive study of reward strategies and practices among 252 organizations based in 25 countries in Europe, he profiles a number of dimensions of this shifting balance: from low to added value pay, from fixed to variable rewards, and from a focus on technical design to paying more attention to reward delivery, emphasizing line manager involvement and more open employee communications. Making this shift will take courageous leadership in the current climate but will, he argues, of itself be a powerful force for reengaging employees and driving recovery in corporate and national economic performance.</p>

<p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the season of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us.</p>

<sec id="section1-0886368712455609">
<title>The Context: Cutback and Grow</title>
<p>In the context of continuing global depression and economic uncertainty, the world of reward management in the United Kingdom and continental Europe might seem from the headlines to be retaining its traditional, recessionary focus on cost reduction, with little apparent sign of Dickens’s “hope” or “light.” Forget retention and motivation, just batten down the hatches on your pay and benefits’ budgets and costs.</p>
<p>“Staff morale hit as pay cuts and freezes continue,” reported <italic>The Daily Telegraph</italic> in London in January<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0886368712455609">1</xref></sup>; “Pay cuts and wage freezes continue in 2012,” according to a survey by the Irish Business and Employers Confederation<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0886368712455609">2</xref></sup>; and “Thousands protest against European Union Austerity Cuts” in pensions and welfare, as reported by the BBC.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0886368712455609">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, despite continuing market falls and fears for the future of the euro, the international economic debate about how best to emerge from this awful depression has taken on a new tone in recent months. Led by President Barrack Obama and supported by the new socialist French president Francois Hollande, the world’s most powerful G8 (Group of Eight) leaders meeting at Camp David in late May 2012 emphasized in their joint communication “the imperative to promote growth and jobs” rather than simply addressing still-weak national balance sheets through continuing debt reduction.</p>
<p>Youth unemployment was a particular concern, and human resources (HR) directors that I speak to in Europe very much support the need for employers to help their governments in providing training opportunities and employment for young adults, however bad the financial climate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0886368712455609">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The United Kingdom’s deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, catching the mood in an interview with <italic>The Financial Times</italic>, “signalled a shift from lurid warnings about the debt crisis to a fresh emphasis on growth.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0886368712455609">5</xref></sup> Clegg admitted that the U.K. government’s heavy focus on austerity “can have a dampening effect on mood,” which is essential for growth, influencing our current “depression” in both senses of the word. The International Labour Organization argues that we are in fact in an “austerity trap,” with a rising “risk of social unrest” unless governments do more to promote growth and employment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0886368712455609">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Both Clegg and Hollande used a twin-sided coin analogy to explain, as the latter put it, that “we need to pursue these two goals simultaneously, budgetary solvency and maximum growth.”</p>
<p>In this article, I review the main trends in reward strategies and practices occurring among companies in Europe and argue that a similar, more balanced, twin-track approach, both cost- and growth focused, is emerging and is required. I profile several of the key shifts in the balance of reward management activities that we are seeing following the initial, cost-driven response to the economic recession in 2008/2009. These are primarily designed to deliver the improved employee engagement levels and “mood,” which will be essential to fuel corporate growth as the economy, hopefully, recovers and “the best of times” return.</p>
<p>My data sources for this review have primarily been Aon Hewitt pay and reward surveys. Most notably, in late 2011, Aon Hewitt carried out an in-depth questionnaire survey followed by client discussions of strategic reward issues and trends, <italic>Reward Fundamentals 2012</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0886368712455609">7</xref></sup> We gathered data from 252 organizations from different sectors across 25 countries in Europe to garner a comprehensive picture of the key thoughts, plans and experiences at the top of reward managers’ minds right now. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886368712455609">Figure 1</xref> profiles the respondents and their organizations, which included well-known names such as BMW, Barclays, BP, Carrefour, Dow Corning, Microsoft, RWE, SAP and Toyota.</p>

<title>From Cost Driven to Engagement and Talent Focused</title>
<p>The pressure on HR and compensation functions in Europe to cut costs and support the business in delivering improved efficiency and productivity is unrelenting. Our latest 7th European HR Barometer of HR director priorities shows that cost reduction is the most influential factor this year on HR and compensation policies and practices, and its importance has actually increased a notch compared with our 2011 study. Risk management and dealing with market volatility and recession and continuing internal restructuring and downsizing are also still in the top 10 most influential factors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0886368712455609">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig2-0886368712455609" position="float">

<caption><p>The dual cost: talent “squeeze” from the 2012 HR Barometer</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0886368712455609-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>But HR and compensation directors now face a dual “squeeze” in their efforts to support the challenging productivity and profit targets that boards are setting in support of positive growth in stock prices. Although the financial pressures continue, labor markets are starting to recover, and skill and talent shortages are emerging in many countries in Europe, particularly for highly specialized skills and the most talented, highest performing staff. As a growing minority of companies starts to rediscover and dust down their growth plans to expand into new product and overseas markets, a shortage of talent to fuel this growth is now the second most important factor influencing European companies’ HR and reward policies.</p>
<p>To illustrate in the United Kingdom, the 2012 National Management Survey<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0886368712455609">11</xref></sup> carried out by the Chartered Management Institute found that 59% of employers have experienced problems in recruiting managers and 55% in retaining them in the past 12 months, up 10% on a year earlier. Globally, according to Manpower Group, one in three employers are reporting difficulties in filling jobs due to lack of available talent, including 42% of German employers and an increase of 9% in shortages over the past year in France.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0886368712455609">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>And just as our nation states have to cut their debts but at the same time invest in economic growth and jobs, so is this creating a “cost/talent crunch” for HR and reward functions in Europe. The “crunch” and the reward strategies organizations are adopting to address it are evident in the findings from our Reward Fundamentals research and specifically the overall reward priorities for the participants this year (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0886368712455609">Figure 3</xref>). They are remarkably consistent across companies, countries and sectors.</p>
<fig id="fig3-0886368712455609" position="float">
<label>Figure 3.</label>

</fig>
<p>Most obvious and not surprising is the need to support improved performance in the future and to recruit and retain the firm’s highest performers and key talent. But also in the top five factors are the need to better leverage and more efficiently use the total reward spend, the major cost for most European employers, and to improve staff engagement and morale in a generally difficult economic and social climate throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Essentially there appear to be two main dimensions to this cost: talent dilemma that our organizations, as well as our governments, face. First, how do you recruit and hang onto your best, most in-demand and talented people when there is still little money available to fund salary increases and bonuses? And second, more broadly, how do you motivate and reengage staff after 2 to 3 years of widespread pay freezes and cuts?</p>
<p>According to Christopher Kinsella of the Chartered Management Institute, “We understand organisations are still struggling to provide general salary increases due to recession. But a company that does not work hard to retain its employees and invest in its people will find itself in a difficult situation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0886368712455609">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>And from the point of view of engaging and motivating their staff to higher performance, the picture for many employers is the difficult situation that Kinsella cites. Analyzing the data from the engagement surveys that Aon Hewitt run for clients in Europe, during 2010 we found that on average, levels of employee engagement fell by a disastrous 4%, with declines evident at all levels in the organization (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0886368712455609">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig4-0886368712455609" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0886368712455609-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Our latest findings suggest that these levels have at least stabilized in Europe. Paralleling the European Central Bank’s latest forecast of 0.5% GDP (gross domestic product) growth this year, the overall engagement score among our European clients increased into 2012 from 51% to 52%.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0886368712455609">14</xref></sup> But employees’ desire to “strive,” to exert extra effort and engage in behaviors that contribute to business success, remains well below the levels evident in 2008 and 2009. And while employee engagement does emerge as a top reward priority for 2012 in the Reward Fundamentals research, with 78% of respondents seeing rewards as critical to building and sustaining engagement levels, 24% of participants in that study felt that their existing rewards package was failing to motivate and engage their staff.</p>
<p>Employers appear now to be recognizing this major business issue of the engagement recession. In terms of base pay management, their major reward cost, 20% of employers plan changes in 2012, and the pattern shows they are responding in two main ways.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0886368712455609">
<title>From Low Pay to Added Value Increases</title>
<p>First, pay increases are back, and are gradually increasing across most of Europe. Aon Hewitt’s latest salary increase survey<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0886368712455609">15</xref></sup> shows a big decline in the number of reported pay freezes (e.g., from 12% of the 224 U.K. participants down to none reported this year), and forecast awards for the remainder in 2012 are generally above the 2011 levels—for example, up from 2.5% to 3.2% for managers in the United Kingdom, 2.8% to 3.2% in Germany, 2.8% to 3.0% in the Netherlands, 2.9% to 3.7% in Latvia and even in Ireland up from 2.3% to 2.5% (excluding freezes).</p>
<p>As my Paris-based colleague Vincent Cornet put it recently at a conference of compensation and benefits directors in Brussels,:
<disp-quote>
<p>With the prolonged period of economic depression and continued austerity measures, companies are feeling the need to show a positive sign to employees . . . attempting to be socially responsible.” One of the solutions to “the austerity trap” identified by the ILO [International Labour Organization] is for governments to make “a careful increase in the minimum wage” and for employers to ensure that wages grow in line with productivity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0886368712455609">16</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Employers seem to be responding. The fast-expanding Intercontinental Hotels Group, which owns Holiday Inn, announced that it was adopting the London Living Wage of £8.30 an hour for its staff, well above the National Minimum Wage in the United Kingdom that they previously offered, providing more than 800 employees with a wage boost worth nearly £5,000 per annum. Have they gone mad in forgetting the essential focus on pay cost austerity? Isn’t this commercial suicide?</p>
<p>Not according to IHG Managing Director Stephen McCall, who recognizes, as London Mayor Boris Johnson put it, that “not only does this foster a loyal and hardworking workforce, it can lift people out of poverty and give people a proper reward for their labour.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0886368712455609">17</xref></sup> Growth in pay and jobs boosts the consumer confidence and spending, which are so essential in our service-based economy—or, as Deputy Prime Minister Clegg put it, combining “that mix of credibility on the economy and social fairness.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0886368712455609">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>We can see similar actions in the United States, where last year 18 states raised their level of minimum wages above the federally required minimum rate. The National Employment Law Project estimates that the extra $600 in workers’ paychecks will add $366 million to the country’s GDP and create more than 3,000 new jobs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0886368712455609">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>A variety of research studies support the benefits of basing employees’ pay on added value rather than just minimum cost. For example, Brown, Sturman, and Simmering<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0886368712455609">20</xref></sup> found that higher pay levels were associated with greater efficiency and also improved perceptions of pay fairness.</p>
<p>A CIPD (Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development) research study led by Professor Michael West<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0886368712455609">21</xref></sup> similarly found that good pay levels, with a performance-related component and an attractive total rewards package, drive higher employee engagement, which in turn is associated in a positive upward spiral with improved customer service and increased consumer spending/revenue.</p>
<p>But second, organizations are not spreading these pay increases peanut butter–like in a thin smear across their entire workforce. A significant minority of even the most recession-hit firms are taking specific measures to recognize and retain their most talented and able, highest performing people. Smaller pay budgets do appear to be forcing this differentiation from the workforce as a whole. As one reward director told us in the <italic>Reward Fundamentals</italic> research:
<disp-quote>
<p>We are looking to focus what little budget is available on major projects and high performers, rather than making across-the-board increases.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We found that last year, more than a third of employers in Europe had reserved a portion of their salary increase budget to more effectively differentiate pay awards for their top talent and high performers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0886368712455609">Figure 5</xref>). Other actions included discretionary stock awards, learning and development opportunities and higher bonus payments.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0886368712455609-fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>This leads us on to two other ways in which organizations in Europe are responding in this continuing era of austerity and the dual requirements to engage employees while retaining cost focus: variable pay and total rewards policies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0886368712455609">
<title>From Fixed to Variable Pay</title>
<p>In the United States, in 1991 the average base salary award for salaried staff on Hewitt’s Total Compensation Management database was 5.0% and the median bonus was 3.8%. The figures 20 years later were 2.4% for base pay and 11.3% in bonus. The shift in Europe has not been so marked and varies by country, but it is now almost universally heading in this same direction, with more plans, more staff covered and gradually increasing bonus opportunities.</p>
<p>Introducing bonuses in a recession might initially seem a little odd, especially when high bonuses were implicated as a factor in driving the initial financial and banking crisis in 2008, and also given that in my life as a consultant, a new bonus scheme that pays out is universally feted, while one that does not generally receives a less enthusiastic welcome!</p>
<p>But while fixed pay proportions have risen in response to the crisis in investment banking, in the rest of the economy the twin attraction—for finance directors of greater cost variability so as to be able respond to unpredictable and possibly declining revenues and for HR directors of being able to more clearly recognize the highest performing and most able staff—have fuelled and speeded this continuing trend in Europe toward variable pay.</p>
<p>The initiatives HR directors are most commonly planning and taking in 2012 illustrate this, with new or amended, individual and collective bonus plans being referenced by 40% and 37% of the participants, respectively, and new employee share plans by one fifth (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0886368712455609">Figure 6</xref>). Across our pay databases in Europe, more than a quarter of the participants have introduced new plans or extended their coverage over the past 2 years, compared with less than 5% who have removed or reduced the membership of incentive plans.</p>
<fig id="fig6-0886368712455609" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0886368712455609-fig6.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The growing popularity of combined or multilevel bonus plans, whereby a corporate profit or funding element is subsequently modified by team and/or individual performance, illustrates how in the Austerity Era, reward professionals are seeking to balance and achieve what previously were regarded as competing objectives, in this case to ensure plan funding and reinforce collective endeavor, as well as differentially rewarding the individual “stars.”</p>
<p>Similarly, despite the strong focus on profits and cash flow during the recession, we are this year seeing a swing back in popularity toward sales and revenue and more growth-oriented bonus plan measures. The incidence of non-financial measures in bonus plans has also continued to grow over the past 3 years, with customer service targets now evident in more than one third of plans. Of our surveyed companies, 17% are planning further changes in plan measures in 2012 and 24% other changes in their bonus plans.</p>
<p>A utility I am currently working with, for example, uses a set of business metrics categorized into three within its management and general employee bonus plans, covering financial measures, operational measures and health, safety and environment goals. The compensation function is currently reviewing these measures and the balance between them.</p>
<p>Research suggests that both dimensions, rewarding collective commitment and incentivizing individual excellence, have an important role to play in driving companies and countries out of recession. A wide variety of studies show associations between employees having a financial stake in business success and high firm performance. Wallace Bell, for example, found that firms with profit-sharing plans outperformed a matched sample of firms without them by more than 50% in terms of their levels of profitability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0886368712455609">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>And data in the United Kingdom’s national Workplace Employee Relations Survey demonstrate that employers with some form of performance-related pay and employee shareholding had, on average, 17% higher productivity and half the labor turnover of those without.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0886368712455609">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Improving the links between pay and performance is the second most important reward priority among European employers. Our research suggests that in higher performing companies, bonus payments are more differentiated and employees also have much higher perceptions of the strength of these links between pay and performance. Fifty-six percent of employees at those companies on our European engagement database rated as the best to work for agree that their performance has a significant impact on their total pay, compared with the European all-company average of just 35%.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0886368712455609">24</xref></sup> They also think that their pay is fairer than employees in other companies. Other research studies confirm that knowledge workers and high-potential and high-performing staff are generally strong advocates of individually-driven variable pay systems.</p>
<p>Of course, not all bonus plans are successful. Common problems reported by the participants in our survey and at our associated client seminars were the following:</p>
<list id="list2-0886368712455609" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Payouts had become viewed as an entitlement rather than as genuinely variable pay.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Employees felt disenfranchised and unable to influence the plan measures.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Plan designs were too complex and plans were badly communicated and managed.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Correspondingly, bonus plans in higher performing and best employer companies were rated highly on perceived levels of staff involvement and communications (which 23% of companies plan improvements to this year), alignment with business goals, support from top managers and included bonus opportunities that were big enough to make a difference to people.</p>
<p>This raises the next key austerity-induced trend evident in our Reward Fundamentals study: a growing focus on the operation and delivery of reward plans, rather than just their design.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0886368712455609">
<title>From Design to Delivery: Total Rewards</title>
<p>Compared with the last time, 5 years ago, when we ran a similar Reward Fundamentals study, respondents throughout Europe gave much higher ratings to their current pay and reward plans in terms of the quality of their design and the level of their alignment with business goals, for example,</p>
<list id="list3-0886368712455609" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Eighty-seven percent of respondents felt that their pay and reward practices reflect business needs and priorities.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Seventy percent believe that pay and rewards are well integrated into the business-planning process.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>More than twice as many as in the 2007 study rated their current designs, such as job evaluation and bonus plans, as fully fit for purpose.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>But participants’ assessments were much lower in terms of the delivery and execution of plans in three interrelated areas:</p>
<list id="list4-0886368712455609" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Employee communications and involvement</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Line manager ownership and application</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Delivering an integrated total rewards offer</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Despite all the pre-recessionary popularity of total rewards and best-place-to-work initiatives, as well as the gradual spread of flexible benefits plans in Europe, just 55% of participants agreed that their “reward plans are integrated within a total reward proposition/brand,” and more than a third disagreed. Although package flexibility and choice has progressed further in the United Kingdom than the rest of Europe, in a recent CIPD survey the number one reported reward risk, above even being unable to increase pay due to cost constraints, was that “employees don’t appreciate the value of their total reward offering.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0886368712455609">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Aon Hewitt has recently conducted a major survey of total rewards programs in 750 U.S.-based organizations,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0886368712455609">26</xref></sup> and the results are remarkably similar to our <italic>European Reward Fundamentals</italic>, with</p>
<list id="list5-0886368712455609" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>fifty-eight percent of participants aiming to drive employee engagement through their total reward programs, but</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>sixty percent describing their current employee engagement levels as low and two thirds feeling that they are steady or on a downward trend.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The U.S. study concludes that “the differentiating factor between the 150 high performing companies and the rest was not about the programme designs they focused on, but <bold>how</bold> the programmes are executed.”</p>
<p>These higher performing companies were more likely to</p>
<list id="list6-0886368712455609" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>have clearly defined reward goals and measure their effective delivery, with a greater use of employee engagement levels rather than purely costs as one of their major goals and success criteria, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>communicate and connect total rewards programs more effectively and extensively to their business managers and employees: 51% of employees in high-performing companies understand the value of their total rewards programs, compared with just one third in the remaining firms.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This balance of business alignment combined with employee understanding and engagement seems critical to the delivery of successful reward programs in the Austerity Era on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

<title>From Design to Delivery: Line Managers and Communications</title>
<p>The picture on line management engagement and employee communications and involvement on reward issues is similarly negative in our European Reward Fundamentals research<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0886368712455609">27</xref></sup> as our North American findings, except for the minority of high-performing employers here that also display above-average levels of employee engagement. The lowest effectiveness ratings in our European research were afforded by reward managers to</p>
<list id="list7-0886368712455609" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>line managers having the training and ability to execute reward programs effectively (55% effective/partly effective),</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the communications of rewards in the organization (52%),</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>employees understanding our reward plans to be competitive and appropriate (52%), and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>managers regarding our reward plans highly (49%).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As in the United States, we have found strong and mutually reinforcing relations between the perceived quality of line manger skills and reward communications, employee perceptions of pay and rewards and employee engagement levels. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0886368712455609">Figure 7</xref> shows the equivalent responses by employees in European companies displaying high levels of employee engagement to several of our standard engagement survey questions on pay and rewards. Employees in these firms display much higher levels of understanding about pay changes, better appreciate the value of their benefits and perceive stronger links between their pay and business results and performance than those working for other European employers.</p>

</fig>
<p>But these companies are the minority, and worryingly, other research studies as well as our own suggest that the picture has, if anything, worsened over recent years, despite the massive improvements in the quality and costs of communications technology available. Communications budgets have often been cut, and badly designed and poorly signposted web sites and intranets are simply not doing the job. Meanwhile, reductions in management training budgets and the removal of local, on-the-ground HR support, (replaced by distant HR service centres) have had a negative impact on the line’s “will and skill” to manage reward programs effectively, just when the messages themselves, of pay freezes, benefits cuts and no bonuses, have been getting more difficult to deliver.</p>
<p>Research among HR and reward managers by the Institute for Employment Studies<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0886368712455609">28</xref></sup> for example, found that</p>
<list id="list8-0886368712455609" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>fifty-six percent of reward professionals feel that their reward communications are not effective, despite significant progress in the communications technology used;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>forty-three percent don’t believe their employees understand how their pay links to performance;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>sixty percent saw line managers as the biggest barrier to effective communications; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>their biggest reward challenges were communicating the total value of the package to employees and convincing line managers to communicate reward policies effectively.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Similarly, in North America, one survey found that<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0886368712455609">29</xref></sup></p>
<list id="list9-0886368712455609" list-type="bullet">

<title>From Closed to Open, HR-Controlled to Line Manger–Owned Rewards</title>
<p>As in North America, the issue of pay transparency is much debated in Europe at present and not just in regard to executive pay, where the chair of the U.K. government’s Fair Pay Review, Will Hutton, wryly observed that “we need less disclosure and more transparency” for internal and external stakeholders. The European Court of Justice provides us with a legal definition of transparency which is that “the pay and benefits system should be capable of being understood by everyone.”</p>
<p>Hutton’s report<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0886368712455609">30</xref></sup> describes how the individualization of pay and emphasis on market- and performance-driven rewards in the past 20 years have driven higher levels of pay secrecy. To illustrate, research by the Equality and Human Rights Commission<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0886368712455609">31</xref></sup>found that</p>
<list id="list10-0886368712455609" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>twenty percent of organisations forbid or discourage employees from discussing their pay,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>forty-nine percent give staff no information beyond their own reward details,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>only 28% communicate pay bands, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>just 3% in the private sector share colleague pay details.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In a European workforce facing up to the most significant decline in their living standards since World War II, in which only a third currently regard their pay levels as fair and even fewer trust their senior leadership,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0886368712455609">32</xref></sup> improved reward communications is a critical underpinning of improvements in employee engagement and economic performance. The EHRC (Equality and Human Rights Commission) documents the benefits of transparency as a better employment brand to support recruitment and retention, improved employee perceptions of fairness and higher engagement levels, as well as smaller gender pay gaps.</p>
<p>The route to improvement seems relatively clear: the will and courage to take it much less so. An IRS survey of internal communications<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0886368712455609">33</xref></sup> found that those employers with a formal communications strategy were 4 times as likely to report that their HR and reward communications were effective, and 82% reported a positive impact on engagement as a result, compared with 48% with a less well-organized and resourced, “ad hoc” approach. But only 41% of the employers they surveyed had such a formal communications strategy, with the incidence of “ad hocery” having doubled since 2005.</p>
<p>Reward professionals have to have the courage to reverse this trend in their organizations, despite the “bunker-inducing” economic climate. How can we ever deliver Dickens’s “wisdom” in our workforce if our organizations display such “foolishness”?</p>
<p>They also need to take the initiative in developing line manger’s skills in this area and holding managers to account for effective reward communications with their staff. A variety of research studies highlight the role of line managers as the “missing link” in effective reward communications and more widely in converting HR and reward policies into engagement-inducing practice (see, e.g., Brown and Purcell<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0886368712455609">34</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>Aon Hewitt’s research in this area<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0886368712455609">35</xref></sup> highlights four critical requirements to addressing the line manager engagement and communications shortfall:</p>
<list id="list11-0886368712455609" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Ensuring that line managers themselves are enthusiastic and engaged, despite the operational pressures that many of them are currently under</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Showing them the evidence that enhanced employee engagement really does drive improved business performance</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Holding them accountable for their reward and people management responsibilities and assessing and rewarding them on that basis</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Providing them with the resources and support to play this role effectively</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Despite the state of the economy, I am much more positive on this score than I was 12 months ago, as I see more organizations recognizing the criticality of reward management communications and the role of line mangers in its effective delivery. Some recent examples of this in individual employers I have worked with include the following:</p>
<list id="list12-0886368712455609" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Developing and delivering new compulsory training modules for line managers in performance and reward management in a large public sector employer</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Involving line managers in developing the reward communications material for their staff following a major pay structure redesign exercise in a large utility, and then investing in training and coaching them in the communications of the changes</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>This firm also subsequently held “HR clinics” for line managers to deal with specific difficult issues that emerged, for example, for staff whose historic benefits had been frozen, and making communications positive to underperformers who would lose out in the new, more performance-based structure</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Another industrial company has made effective reward management a personal objective for all relevant managers and incorporated this into the objective setting and performance management process at all levels, including directors.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A professional services firm has designated a selected group of line managers as performance and reward advisers, who receive additional involvement and training and act as coaches to their management colleagues.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>This firm has also extended and improved the pay moderation processes for comparing and normalizing the distribution of performance ratings and awarding pay increases and bonuses, ensuring that awards are fair and consistent across all departments.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To ensure that any reward changes genuinely will improve performance and not be overly burdensome to manage, a drinks company has introduced a line management panel, with which any proposed changes to reward arrangements need to be discussed and consulted on before implementation.</p></list-item>

<title>Open Communications in Practice: An Example</title>
<p>A U.K. FTSE 250 real estate organization we worked with has reacted to the economic climate by moving away from “across the board” base pay increases and the absence of any formal incentive scheme and introducing a series of pay changes, including</p>
<list id="list13-0886368712455609" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>market data–driven and performance-based base pay increases and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>an incentive scheme based on individual and company performance.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>They recognized that success in delivering this more differentiated approach to pay management would require much more sophisticated line management skills in reward and people management and far more extensive employee communications.</p>
<p>Their approach to designing and implementing these changes included</p>
<list id="list14-0886368712455609" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>extensive consultation with line mangers and employee focus groups during the design phase of the work and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>developing a comprehensive employee communication strategy at the outset of the project, involving internal communications as well as HR staff.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Key components as the new approach was implemented included</p>
<list id="list15-0886368712455609" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>lunchtime presentations from business leaders, followed by distributing employee brochures, describing the basis of the new pay decision-making process, backed up by interactive materials on the company intranet;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>train-the-manager workshop sessions consisting of 50% presentation/explanation and 50% case study work, with 8 to 12 managers at each session, prior to the managers themselves explaining the new approach to their teams; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>follow-up “on-demand” coaching for managers as they went through the process of making individual pay decisions in the first cycle of the new approach.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Combined with a phased and well-resourced approach to implementation, the changes appear to have gone well, and business results, as well as employee attitudes, are now on a positive upward trend.

<title>Conclusion: Moving From the “Worst of Times” Back Toward the “Best of Times”</title>
<p>Although technically most of Europe is no longer in recession, growth is minimal, our economies weak and the outlook uncertain. Even the most optimistic forecasters predict that it will be at least another 1 to 2 years before Europe returns to its pre-recession levels of output and growth. Managing pay and rewards in the past 3 years has been incredibly difficult in many organizations, and I have seen levels of pay and benefits cuts and social deprivation that I never thought possible in my lifetime and that we may not have seen since Dickens’s era. I worry about the future for my kids when I see the business and reward approaches of some of our contemporary employers and European governments abandoning core tenets of the welfare state that I grew up with.</p>
<p>Turning this situation around presents the biggest challenge our political and business leaders will face in their lifetimes. INSEAD Professor Manfred Kets de Vries has spent a lifetime studying leaders and has shown how the key factor differentiating the most successful is that “their lives are in balance.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0886368712455609">36</xref></sup> In their psyche and their actions they are balanced—for at their extremes, even apparently positive behaviors such as drive and focus can become toxic and destructive.</p>
<p>Our political leaders are belatedly recognizing that they have been overly fixated on austerity and cost reduction and need to invest more in their human capital, their young people, their entrepreneurs and their small businesses—the source of future growth in our ever-more knowledge- and service-based economies.</p>
<p>The dangers of an extreme market and performance-driven approach to rewards were evident in the financial services sector in 2008, with the financial crash developing into global recession on both sides of the Atlantic. Schuster and Zingheim<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0886368712455609">37</xref></sup> brilliantly describe the disastrous combination of very high levels of variable compensation with an expensive, market-based arms-race on perks and benefits that developed in the sector. They conclude, “Had human resources and compensation been <italic>balanced</italic> [italics added] for both troubled and good times, we would not have taken such a powerful hit when the business began to collapse” (p. 12). There was a perfect strategic alignment of reward practices with the business and HR model, but it was a model that was fundamentally economically unsound and devoid of moral principles and any shred of social responsibility.</p>
<p>Schuster and Zingheim recommend, Dickens-like, that going forward we “consider both good and bad times,” rewarding “talent for balanced performance” and building “a balanced culture.”</p>
<p>In reward management now, we need to display similar leadership and courage to our political leaders. Making the case for general staff and moderated executive pay increases, new staff bonus plans and benefits preservation is really hard in our still–cash-strapped organizations. We cannot promise any magic-bullet, immediate solutions. But in this article, I have profiled a shift in the balance of approaches that successful organizations seem to be taking in rebuilding the employee engagement that is driving the recovery in their performance.</p>
<p>The shift is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886368712455609">Table 1</xref>. It is not a shift from one to the other, as the demands for cost-efficiency are as intense as ever. And as with any balance, move too far too fast in one direction and you risk everything tumbling down. But more organizations need to start and are starting to move in a more positive, investment- and growth-oriented direction, and more need to follow their example.</p>

<p>Investing in workers 100 years ago wasn’t easy either. One of the founding fathers of personnel management in the United Kingdom, Edward Cadbury, of the confectionary business that still bears his family name, explained his firm’s insistence on high-quality worker housing and benefits by describing profitability and employee welfare as “different sides of the same coin.”</p>
<p>Touring the company’s Bourneville plant at the height of the interwar depression, the playwright J. B. Priestley<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0886368712455609">38</xref></sup> was hugely impressed by the “magnificent recreation grounds, continuation schools, with medical attention, works councils, pensions.” He felt that this investment produced “definite and enormous gain” both for employers’ and employees’, “private profits” and for “social good.”</p>
