<abstract>
<p>How does linguistic recognition in the courtroom affect popular confidence in the justice system among minorities? The authors argue (a) the recognition of either a minority language and/or a third-party’s language (lingua franca) during judicial proceedings increases confidence levels but (b) the use of a lingua franca is more effective. This is because minorities are more likely to favor an arrangement that levels the playing field by having everyone speak a lingua franca (relative fairness) than one that allows them to use their own language in a courtroom that is otherwise dominated by the majority language (absolute fairness). Using original data measuring the linguistic recognition in the judiciary, the authors find a significant and robust relationship between languages of the court and popular confidence in the justice system.</p>

<p>How does linguistic recognition in the courtroom affect popular confidence in the justice system among minorities? Language is important. Without language, “all the similarity of common human nature is of no avail to unite [humans] in fellowship” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010414011434294">Augustine, 1871</xref>, pp. 310-311). It is a bond—arguably the “strongest and most lasting”—that unites men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0010414011434294">de Tocqueville, 1835/2002</xref>, pt. 1, chap. 2, p. 29). And it is “<italic>the</italic></p>
<p>[italics original]” marker that identifies “who is and is not a member of the group” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010414011434294">Brown &amp; Ganguly, 2003</xref>, p. 3). As such, a government’s choice to allow one language but not another is highly contentious. The fact that more than one out of every two post-1945 civil wars has involved language in some capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010414011434294">Liu, 2011</xref>) highlights the delicate nature of language recognition.</p>
<p>The choice of language recognition is especially pronounced in three areas: government services, elementary education, and mass media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0010414011434294">Fishman, 1989</xref>). Undoubtedly, the recognition of whose language can be used when and in what capacity in each of the “big three” has significant implications for how individuals perceive the government, the education system, and society at large. In this article, we focus on the judiciary. The rationale is twofold. First, as courts are a part of the government, judicial rulings can have implications for both education and media. For instance, the court can protect—or abet in the killing of—a marginalized language. Second, the judiciary is arguably the most accessible branch of the government to society at large; an average person will have more opportunity to access courts to resolve grievances. In fact, as Alexander Hamilton noted in Federalist 78, “Courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0010414011434294">Hamilton, Madison, &amp; Jay, 1898</xref>, p. 528). As such, the government’s choice to recognize which languages in the courtroom is a testament to the government’s larger priorities. We argue when people are denied the right to use certain languages in the courtroom, they are more likely to view the judicial procedure as “unfair.” This unfairness, in turn, makes them less likely to be confident in the justice system.</p>
<p>Confidence in the justice system is important because judiciaries have the duty to be the impartial interpreter of the law and an instrument for conflict resolution. Moreover, they are charged with upholding the rule of law in democratic countries. This often includes unpopular rights and liberties protections. Courts often do so without any enforcement mechanism, and thus the rule of law must be self-enforcing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0010414011434294">Caldeira &amp; Gibson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0010414011434294">Weingast, 1996</xref>). One mechanism for a self-enforcing judicial system is increased popular support. Support increases as awareness of the system and satisfaction with recent court rulings increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0010414011434294">Caldeira, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414011434294">Casey, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010414011434294">Gibson, Caldeira, &amp; Baird, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0010414011434294">Grosskopf &amp; Mondak, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0010414011434294">Scheb &amp; Lyons, 2001</xref>). And since some decisions can be unpopular, it is that much more important for courts to inspire public support. One potential mechanism is procedural fairness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010414011434294">Baird, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414011434294">Baird &amp; Gangl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0010414011434294">Tyler, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0010414011434294">Tyler &amp; Mitchell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0010414011434294">Tyler &amp; Rasinski, 1991</xref>)—which includes ensuring speakers of different languages equal access to the judicial system. If language affects confidence in the justice system, then which language is used in the courtroom can have important implications for the rule of law.</p>
<p>There are three types of linguistic recognition. The first type is the exclusive use of the majority language. In Bangladesh, for instance, Bengali is the only language of the justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0010414011434294">Mohsin, 2003</xref>). Likewise, in Thailand, all legal proceedings must take place in Thai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0010414011434294">Keyes, 2003</xref>). The second type recognizes a minority language. In Sri Lanka, for example, both Sinhalese and Tamil are permissible in the courtroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010414011434294">DeVotta, 2003</xref>). The third and final type employs a third-party’s language (<italic>lingua franca</italic>). A lingua franca is most often a colonial language (e.g., French), although it can also be a religious (e.g., Arabic) or a regional trading (e.g., Swahili) language. Note that the recognition of a lingua franca does not have to be mutually exclusive with the use of the majority and/or minority languages. In some instances, only a lingua franca is used (e.g., Indonesia); in other cases (e.g., Malaysia), both the majority language and a lingua franca are recognized; and still others allow for all three types of languages to coexist (e.g., Singapore).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414011434294">Figure 1</xref> shows the variation in language recognition in the courts, 1980–2000. We see majority language–exclusive justice systems are the most frequent both across countries and over time (59.12% in 1980, 64.74% in 2000). Linguas franca are more commonly employed than minority languages. In 1980, for instance, linguas franca were used in the judicial system 1.5 times more often than a minority language. This gap, however, has slowly narrowed. By 2000, 37.5% of the courts recognized at least one minority language, compared to the 41.5% that recognized a lingua franca.</p>

<p>In this article, we examine the relationship between the linguistic recognition in courts and the minority’s confidence in the justice system—at both the national and individual levels. We argue confidence levels are lowest when only the majority language is employed in the courtroom. In contrast, the recognition of either a minority language and/or a lingua franca increases confidence levels. The mechanism of interest here is procedural fairness. The use of a minority language can create a sense of fairness by allowing members of minorities to speak in their own voice. Just like members of the majority, speakers of a minority language have the constitutional right to use their own language in the courtroom. And when minorities speak in their own languages, they can communicate effectively without a linguistic barrier, and they can be tried fairly by a jury of peers. This is important as one of the most important causes of perceived procedural fairness is the perception that one’s voice is heard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0010414011434294">Lind, Kanfer, &amp; Early, 1990</xref>). But having one’s voice heard may not be enough if the majority language is still privileged. In contrast, the use of a lingua franca can level the playing field among users of all languages. Although the minority may face linguistic barriers, these barriers are applicable as well to speakers of the majority language. The use of a third-party neutral language can remove the symbolism of majority dominance from the proceedings, which can prevent a sense of relative deprivation. Given findings that people are more concerned about a relative sense of justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414011434294">Crosby, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414011434294">Folger, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010414011434294">Gurr, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0010414011434294">Lind et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0010414011434294">Stouffer, Suchman, DeVinney, Star, &amp; Williams, 1949</xref>), we expect confidence levels to the highest when linguas franca are employed.</p>
<p>The article proceeds as follows. We begin by reviewing the literature on the effects of linguistic heterogeneity, citing two broad concerns and the contributions that our article makes. We then explain the logic underlying our argument, drawing extensively on the works on procedural fairness. We test the effects of linguistic recognition using original data. This newly constructed language-in-judiciary variable measures whether minority languages and linguas franca are used in the courts. The results—at both the national and individual levels—indicate that, as expected, linguistic recognition matters. However, it is the recognition of a lingua franca that matters more for judicial confidence. We conclude by highlighting the normative implications of this article.</p>

<title>Effects of Linguistic Heterogeneity</title>
<p>The negative effects of ethnolinguistic heterogeneity are well documented: higher probabilities of democratic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414011434294">Boix, 2003</xref>), increased likelihoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414011434294">Boix, 2003</xref>) and longer durations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414011434294">Fearon, 2004</xref>) of civil wars, lower qualities of government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414011434294">Alesina, Devleeschauwer, Easterly, Kurlat, &amp; Wacziarg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0010414011434294">La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, &amp; Vishny, 1999</xref>), decreased levels of growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414011434294">Alesina et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414011434294">Easterly &amp; Levine, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0010414011434294">Posner, 2004</xref>), and—perhaps the most important for this article—less desirable citizenship behaviors. High levels of heterogeneity can decrease political discussions, organizational memberships, political interests, and interpersonal trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414011434294">Anderson &amp; Paskeviciute, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010414011434294">Delhey &amp; Newton, 2005</xref>). What explains this relationship?</p>
<p>One explanation is about the conflict over scarce resources. When resources are limited, the politics of distribution can be played out through electoral channels. Since politicians are “single-minded seekers of reelection” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010414011434294">Mayhew, 1974</xref>, p. 17), there is an incentive to maximize on credit claiming. This results in politicians overspending on targeted private goods and underspending on core public goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414011434294">Alesina, Baqir, &amp; Easterly, 1999</xref>). And when the said electoral channels are ineffective or absent, resource distribution can be determined by violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414011434294">Boix, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414011434294">Fearon, 2004</xref>). Alternatively, heterogeneity can matter because of psychological reasons. When there are threats from the out-group, members of the in-group respond by stereotyping and assigning the out-group to negative classifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010414011434294">Fearon &amp; Laitin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0010414011434294">Tajfel, 1982</xref>). These threats—whether actual or perceived—can be the result of cultural prejudices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0010414011434294">Gambetta &amp; Hamill, 2005</xref>), inequality levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010414011434294">Costa &amp; Kahn, 2003</xref>), and/or increasing minority presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0010414011434294">Oliver &amp; Wong, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0010414011434294">Quillian, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0010414011434294">1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Although heterogeneity is in of itself important, analyses that look only at the effects of heterogeneity are limited in at least two ways. First, linguistic heterogeneity – often considered exogenous –is in fact endogenous to the state. The state matters in “how heterogeneity is conceptualized and upon whom the heterogeneity is acting” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0010414011434294">Rudolph &amp; Popp, 2010</xref>, p. 87). At one extreme, states can constitutionally recognize minorities. The extent of this accommodation varies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010414011434294">Fox &amp; Flores, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010414011434294">Liu, 2011</xref>). At the other extreme, governments can pass policies that ban or limit the public display of minority identities—if not something worse. Romania’s Ceauşescu, for instance, closed Hungarian schools, banned the language in public, and killed a number of minority Hungarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414011434294">Gilberg, 1992</xref>, p. 293). Similarly, in Indonesia, in 1965 the Suharto-led military killed a number of Chinese who were believed to be communists. And after Suharto finally assumed power in 1968, he closed Chinese schools, prohibited all public displays of the Chinese culture, banned Chinese New Year, and required all Chinese minorities to change their surnames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010414011434294">Bertrand, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010414011434294">Minorities at Risk, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The second limitation of the extant literature is the theoretical emphasis on the majority–minority distinction and the subsequent testing using the Ethnolinguistic Fractionalization (ELF) measurement. The assumption is a zero-sum game: As the benefits accrued by one group increase, the benefits of the other group must by definition decrease. However, there are certain policies that do not evoke such arrangements. With languages, for instance, there is a third option in addition to the majority and minority languages: <italic>lingua franca</italic>. A lingua franca is a “language spoken widely and understood practically universally within the boundaries of a state, but this language is not associated as the mother tongue . . . within that state” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0010414011434294">Laitin, 2000</xref>, p. 151). Most often a lingua franca is a colonial language. In Timor-Leste, for instance, Portuguese—the colonial language—is a lingua franca. It is also the language of the court (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0010414011434294">Mydans, 2007</xref>). A lingua franca can also be a religious language (e.g., Arabic) or a regional trading language (e.g., Malay and Swahili). We see similar options with religious heterogeneity. Governments can recognize the majority religion (e.g., Buddhism in Thailand), multiple religions (e.g., Catholicism and Islam in the Philippines), or, alternatively, no one’s religion. When no one’s religion is recognized, the policy is secularism: the right to “religious freedom and . . . separation of religion and state” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010414011434294">Fox &amp; Flores, 2009</xref>, p. 1499). Since linguas franca and secularism can both breed a sense of fairness and are both viable policy options, it is important that these third options are included in analyses. Failure to take into consideration the effects of lingua franca and/or secularism biases the empirical findings.</p>
<p>By treating linguistic heterogeneity as exogenous, the literature (a) overlooks the fact that the state matters and (b) truncates subsequent analyses on how the state matters. We address both of these limitations by focusing on the language of the court. Governments choose from a menu of three languages: majority, minority, and/or lingua franca. Recall, combinations are possible. Since the choice of whose language can be used in the courtroom is highly contentious, we expect linguistic recognition to have an effect on confidence in the justice system among minorities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0010414011434294">
<title>Languages and Confidence</title>
<p>We argue confidence in the justice system among minorities is the product of procedural fairness, specifically, which language is used in the courtroom. Psychologists have on multiple occasions found people value procedures over outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414011434294">De Cremer, van Knippenberg, van Dijke, &amp; Bos, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010414011434294">Koper, Van Knippenberg, Bouhuijs, Vermunt, &amp; Wilke, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0010414011434294">Thibaut &amp; Walker, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0010414011434294">Tyler, Boeckmann, Smith, &amp; Huo, 1997</xref>). When authorities are polite, follow proper procedures, and treat people with human dignity, people are more likely to accept decisions and be satisfied with them—even when the outcomes in of themselves are not preferred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414011434294">Casper, Tyler, &amp; Fisher, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0010414011434294">Huo, Smith, Tyler, &amp; Lind, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0010414011434294">Tyler et al., 1997</xref>). Thus, when people feel respected, such as being allowed to speak their own language when airing grievances or defending themselves, they are more likely to have high levels of confidence in the judicial process.</p>
<p>But when governments recognize only the majority language, it renders the minorities to less “respect, importance, or worth . . . than [others]” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010414011434294">Horowitz, 1985</xref>, p. 220). This classification of minorities as second-tier citizens is more than mere symbolism. From a practical standpoint, if a minority cannot communicate effectively because of a linguistic barrier, she cannot be tried fairly by a jury of her peers. Any verdict handed down, however “fair,” is likely to be perceived as otherwise because of the process. As a result, minorities see the justice system as “unfair” and as another institution of majority dominance. The following hypothesis reflects this argument:</p>
<list id="list1-0010414011434294" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1:</italic> When the majority language is the only language of the court, there is low confidence in the justice system among minority-language speakers.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In contrast, a government can allow minority languages to be used in the courtroom. Implications are twofold. First, it acknowledges minority identity and grants them legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010414011434294">Horowitz, 1985</xref>). It minimizes perceptions of majority group dominance. Second, it entitles minorities to proceedings in their own language. As such, there are fewer problems with linguistic barrier. Regardless of the final verdict, the trial process is considered fairer from a minority standpoint. In aggregate, there is procedural fairness in <italic>absolute</italic> conditions. When minorities perceive their interests as being “descriptively represented” in the courts, they are more likely to view the justice system with increased legitimacy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0010414011434294">Scherer &amp; Curry, 2010</xref>). This discussion leads to the following hypothesis:</p>
<list id="list2-0010414011434294" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2:</italic> When minority languages are languages of the court, there is high confidence in the justice system among minority-language speakers.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Alternatively, governments can also recognize a lingua franca. Recall, linguas franca are third-party languages. As such, they connote less majority–minority power relations. A lingua franca is an instrument to breed procedural fairness in <italic>relative</italic> conditions. By employing a lingua franca, majority and minority speakers are equal in at least two respects. From a linguistic standpoint, even though minority speakers may not have the highest proficiency in the lingua franca, these challenges are not strictly theirs. Speakers of the majority language are just as likely to face linguistic difficulties with the use of a lingua franca. Likewise, from a symbolic standpoint, the use of a lingua franca can remove minority perceptions of ethnic chauvinism by the part of the majority. This in turn can breed a sense of shared ownership of the state, as opposed to a state dominated and represented by majority symbols (e.g., language). Whether it is linguistic or symbolic, we argue the use of a lingua franca can increase satisfaction with the judicial procedure, thereby increasing confidence in the justice system among speakers of the minority language. However, there is also evidence that people care more about relative deprivation than about their absolute conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414011434294">Crosby, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414011434294">Folger, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010414011434294">Gurr, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0010414011434294">Lind et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0010414011434294">Stouffer et al., 1949</xref>). As such, throwing minority speakers a “bone” and allowing their language to be used in the court may not be sufficient. Instead, what matters is the recognition of a lingua franca. The following hypotheses summarize our argument:</p>

<title>National-Level Research Design</title>
<p>The national-level sample includes all countries identified in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0010414011434294">World Values Survey (2010)</xref>. In all, there are 62 countries over three of the five waves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0010414011434294">1</xref></sup> The sample is cross-sectional. The unit of analysis is strictly <italic>country</italic>. Because some countries appear multiple times in the survey, we take the averages from each survey year. For instance, India appears in 1990, 1995, and 2001. We average across all three observation years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0010414011434294">2</xref></sup> Since the causal mechanism in our argument is about procedural fairness from the standpoint of minority-language speakers, we include only minority respondents in the sample. Furthermore, as there may be multiple minority languages in a country, we identify only those who speak the most populous minority language in each country. We estimate the model using ordinary least squares with robust standard errors.</p>

<title>Key Explanatory Variables: Language of Judiciary</title>
<p>The concept of interest is the language of the judiciary, specifically which language is recognized by the judge and jury. A language is considered “recognized” if it is the language of litigation, verdicts, and/or subsequent records. Fundamentally, an individual must have the legal right to use it without needing an interpreter’s services. A point warrants additional clarification. In some countries multiple languages (<italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic>) are legally recognized as languages of the judiciary. However, there is no requirement that the judge speak both <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic>. So when an <italic>x</italic>-speaking judge is presiding over a case where the defendant speaks <italic>y</italic>, the court can provide an interpreter and/or change the judge. Note that although the <italic>y-</italic>speaking defendant may employ the services of an interpreter, she or he <italic>can</italic> still use <italic>y</italic> in the courtroom as stipulated by law.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0010414011434294">3</xref></sup> In these cases, <italic>y</italic> is coded as a “recognized” language. In this article, we identify two types of language of the judiciary. They are as follows:</p>
<sec id="section5-0010414011434294">
<title>Minority language (t-1)</title>
<p>This is a dichotomous variable. If the most populous minority language in the country is not used in court proceedings, this variable is assigned a value of 0. Examples of this include Turkish in Bulgaria, Spanish in the United States, and Khmer in Vietnam. However, if the language of the most populous minority is permitted—as is the case with Hungarian in Romania, French in Canada, and Malay in Singapore—then the variable is assigned a 1. Given our expectations that the use of minority languages can breed a sense of procedural fairness in the absolute sense, we predict <italic>minority language</italic> will have a positive effect on confidence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0010414011434294">
<title>Lingua franca (t-1)</title>
<p>This is also a dichotomous variable. The variable takes on a value of 1 if a lingua franca is used in court proceedings. This is without regard to whether it is the exclusive language of the court (e.g., Indonesia), the only alternative to the majority language (e.g., Malaysia), or one of the many from which to choose (e.g., Singapore). A language is considered a lingua franca so long as it is not the mother tongue of any significant subset of the population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0010414011434294">4</xref></sup> Like <italic>minority language</italic>, a lingua franca is considered “recognized” if it <italic>can</italic> be legally used in the courtroom without any linguistic assistance. Given Hypotheses 3a and 3b, we expect <italic>lingua franca</italic> to have a positive effect on confidence levels.</p>
<p>The data for both variables are drawn from a mix of sources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0010414011434294">Jacques Leclerc’s (2010)</xref> database on language policies (<italic>L’aménagement linguistique dans le monde</italic>), which covers all countries, provided the majority of the information for most entries. For missing data and to check for validity, we used several additional secondary sources. The coding was done by multiple individuals. The intercoding reliability was no less than 0.884. Because effects of the language of the courts can take some time to materialize, we lag both variables by one year.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0010414011434294">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>Dependent Variable: Confidence in Justice System</title>
<p>In the World Values Survey, a question was asked about “confidence in the justice system.” Respondents were asked whether they were <italic>not at all</italic>, <italic>not very</italic>, <italic>rather</italic>, or <italic>very</italic> confident. Using this 4-point scale, where larger values equal higher levels of confidence, we construct two dependent variables. The first (<italic>mean</italic>) is strictly the confidence mean for the sample of all respondents who speak the most populous minority language at home. Means, however, do not take into consideration the variance in confidence levels. As such, we also look at the percentage of the same sample that responded <italic>rather</italic> or <italic>very</italic> confident (<italic>% positive</italic>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0010414011434294">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the association between language of the judiciary and confidence in the justice system.

<sec id="section8-0010414011434294">
<title>Control Variables</title>
<p>Inevitably, there may be other variables confounding the effects of the language of the court on confidence in the justice system among minorities. To test for this, we control for several variables based on prior theoretical expectations. They are as follows:</p>
<sec id="section9-0010414011434294">
<title>Democracy (t-1)</title>
<p>Democracy can matter for two reasons. Directly, people are more likely to be confident in their government and the judiciary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414011434294">Anderson &amp; Paskeviciute, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0010414011434294">Jamal &amp; Nooruddin, 2010</xref>). Indirectly, the level of social capital is higher in democracies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010414011434294">Inglehart, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010414011434294">Muller &amp; Seligson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0010414011434294">Putnam, 1995</xref>). This in turn can affect confidence levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010414011434294">Hetherington, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414011434294">Levi &amp; Stoker, 2000</xref>). As such, we expect a positive relationship between democracy and confidence in the justice system. To measure democracy, we draw from the Polity IV data set. We adopt the convention of combining the democracy (DEMOC) and authoritarian (AUTOC) scales into one single index, which ranges from −10 to 10, with 10 being the most democratic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0010414011434294">
<title>Linguistic fractionalization</title>
<p>We also include an indicator for linguistic heterogeneity. Here, we chose not to use the traditional ELF index. This decision was motivated by the number of inherent problems (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0010414011434294">Posner, 2004</xref>). One such problem is the conflation of language with other markers of ethnicity (e.g., religion). As an alternative, we use a strictly linguistic Herfindahl Index. The data source is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414011434294">Alesina et al. (2003)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0010414011434294">
<title>GDP per capita (t-1)</title>
<p>Wealth can also matter. There is consensus that confidence in the government is influenced by perceptions of the government’s economic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0010414011434294">Chanley, Rudolph, &amp; Rahn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414011434294">Espinal, Hartlyn, &amp; Morgan Kelly, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010414011434294">Hetherington, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0010414011434294">Keele, 2007</xref>; Mishler &amp; Rose, 1997). To the extent that wealth breeds confidence, we expect a positive relationship between GDP per capita and confidence in the justice system. We use data from the World Development Indicators.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0010414011434294">
<title>Civil liberties</title>
<p>The judicial system is in theory an impartial interpreter of the law. However, if civil liberties are restricted, procedural fairness is compromised. This in turn can lead to lower levels of confidence in the justice system. The data for civil liberties are from Freedom House. The index ranges from 1 (<italic>free</italic>) to 7 (<italic>not free</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0010414011434294">
<title>Economic differential</title>
<p>We also include a control for the economic status of the minority group. This allows us to identify whether countries with minority-favorable linguistic policies are also the countries where minority groups are systematically advantaged in a number of other ways. To measure economic differential, we use the Economic Differentials Index from the Minority at Risk (MAR) database. The index is a 7-point scale, ranging from −2 to 4, that measures whether a minority group is economically advantaged (−2) or extremely disadvantaged (4). The indicators in the measure include income, land or property, higher education, presence in commerce, presence in professions, and presence in official positions. Since only those at risk are included in the database, not all minorities identified by the World Values Survey appear in the MAR database. Examples of this include the French speakers in Switzerland. When a minority group is absent, I assign it a value of 0 (no socially significant differences).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0010414011434294">
<title>Extent of corruption</title>
<p>Corruption can matter. The ease and frequency to engage in corruptive behaviors can decrease confidence in the justice system. By definition, the court can no longer be an appropriate instrument for conflict resolution if judges and/or jurors can be bribed. Data for this control are from Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) score. The surveys used in compiling the CPI asked questions in line with the misuse of public power for private benefit, with a focus, for example, on bribe taking by public officials in public procurement. The CPI score ranges from 0 (<italic>highly corrupt</italic>) to 10 (<italic>highly clean</italic>). We expect <italic>extent of corruption</italic> to be positively correlated with the dependent variables of interest.</p>

<title>National-Level Empirical Evidence</title>
<p>The results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0010414011434294">Table 1</xref>. Recall, the sample includes only respondents who speak the most populous minority language at home. And although the World Values Survey does frequently ask “language spoken at home,” a number of countries were dropped from our sample for one of two reasons. In some countries (e.g., Argentina), the “language spoken at home” question was not asked. This simply does not allow us to differentiate between the majority and minority. In other countries (e.g., Denmark), all the respondents spoke the majority language. Since our theory is about perceptions of fairness from the perspective of the minority, these respondents were excluded. In all, the <italic>N</italic> was 20. Although this value is small, the results are nonetheless indicative.</p>

<p>The dependent variable in the first column is the mean level of confidence. A positive coefficient suggests higher levels of confidence in the justice system among the minority population. And conversely, a negative coefficient indicates lower levels of confidence. The interpretation for the second column is similar. Here, the dependent variable is the proportion of the sample that responded either “rather” or “very” confident in the survey.</p>
<p>The empirical evidence suggests the language of the court has a robust effect on confidence in the justice system. In both models, the recognition of a minority language has a positive effect (0.6960 and 0.4376). Put differently, minorities are more likely to view the judiciary favorably when they can use their language in the courtroom. Likewise, the recognition of a lingua franca has a positive and significant effect (0.9867 and 0.5319). In fact, a shift from not allowing the use of a lingua franca to allowing it in the courtroom can increase the mean confidence level from 2.31 to 2.59 and the proportion of positive responses from 43.2% to 55.8%. Taken altogether, this suggests procedural fairness does matter. As predicted, minorities respond positively when there is an alternate language in the courtroom.</p>
<p>Although both languages matter, recall Hypothesis 3b. We argue the recognition of a lingua franca has a greater effect since people care more about relative deprivation than about their absolute conditions. The results from additional tests lend validity to this claim. The coefficient for <italic>lingua franca</italic> is statistically larger than that for <italic>minority language</italic> at the .010 significance level.</p>
<p>Among the control variables, only GDP per capita is significant across both models. The coefficient, although small, is negative. Minorities in wealthy countries are less likely to be confident in the justice system than their counterparts in poorer states. We see a similar result as well with <italic>economic differential</italic>. Minorities who are economically disadvantaged are more likely to favor the courts than their wealthy counterparts. Although the results are weak, there is some evidence that wealth actually has a negative effect on confidence.</p>
<p>As expected, civil liberties matter. When people feel there is freedom of the press, speech, and assembly—and the court protects this freedom—they are more likely to view the institution favorably. It is interesting that neither democracy nor linguistic fractionalization is significant. It is possible that theoretically neither matters for confidence in the justice system. However, the more likely cause is empirical: Statistical significance can be a problem when there are only 20 observations. The fact that <italic>minority language</italic> and <italic>lingua franca</italic> are statistically significant in and of themselves is very telling. To ensure the results are not being driven by one or two outliers, we employ an alternate test where the unit of analysis is the individual respondent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0010414011434294">
<title>Individual-Level Research Design</title>
<p>We also employ an alternate individual-level analysis to test the effects of linguistic recognition on confidence levels among minorities. The sample this time includes <italic>all</italic> respondents who claim to speak a minority language. Recall, the previous national-level sample focused only on respondents who spoke the most populous minority language at home. With this expanded sample, there are in all 46,638 observations.</p>
<p>The two key variables of interest, <italic>minority language</italic> and <italic>lingua franca</italic>, remain dichotomous. If a respondent’s spoken-at-home language is recognized, <italic>minority language</italic> is assigned a value of 1. So, for instance, in Macedonia, Albanian, Romany, and Turkish are all recognized. As such, <italic>minority language</italic> is coded as a 1 for all respondents who claimed to speak one of these three languages at home. The coding for the other variable <italic>lingua franca</italic> remains unchanged: If a lingua franca is recognized in the courts, the variable is coded as a 1 for all respondents regardless of the language spoken at home.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0010414011434294">
<title>Dependent Variable: Confidence in Justice System</title>
<p>Although we employ the same measure from the World Values Survey, we construct the dependent variable slightly different for the individual-level analysis. Recall, in the survey, respondents were asked to rank their confidence on a 4-point scale, from <italic>not at all</italic> to <italic>very</italic>. We use this 4-point scale as the dependent variable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0010414011434294">6</xref></sup> Given our argument, we expect the coefficients for both <italic>minority language</italic> and <italic>lingua franca</italic> to be positive and the magnitude of the latter to be greater than that of the former.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0010414011434294">
<title>Control Variables</title>
<p>We include many of the same controls from the national-level test: democracy, linguistic fractionalization, GDP per capita, and civil liberties. We do not include economic differential for two reasons: measurement and data. First, the aggregate variable <italic>economic differential</italic> cannot effectively capture the inequalities in a country where there are both economically advantaged and disadvantaged minorities. Second, even if measurement were not an issue, there would still be concern over the data. The MAR data set does not include many of the linguistic minorities identified in the World Values Survey. Given these concerns, we do not control for economic inequalities at the national level. We do, however, control for the respondent’s social class, as indicated in the World Values Survey. Likewise, we do not include the national aggregate measure of <italic>extent of corruption</italic>. Although that measure captures the reality on the ground effectively, the World Values Survey also asks each respondent the extent of political corruption on a 4-point scale: <italic>almost no public officials engaged</italic> (1), <italic>a few are</italic> (2), <italic>most are</italic> (3), and <italic>almost all public official are engaged</italic> (4). We expect <italic>extent of corruption</italic> to be negatively correlated with the dependent variable of interest.</p>
<p>We introduce several additional national-level controls. The first is whether the country is a postcolonial state. The inclusion of this dummy is based on the premise that postcolonial states are more likely to recognize a lingua franca. We also take into account the type of legal system. Specifically, we identify whether the judicial system is civil law, common law, or religious law. The data for this variable are from the CIA World Factbook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010414011434294">Central Intelligence Agency, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the unit of analysis is now <italic>minority respondent</italic>, it is only appropriate that we also take into consideration individual-level factors. We include a set of demographic controls: gender, age, marital status, parental status, educational attainment, and the aforementioned social class. We also include for interpersonal trust. Research has shown interpersonal trust to be highly correlated with government confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414011434294">Anderson &amp; Paskeviciute, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010414011434294">Delhey &amp; Newton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0010414011434294">Jamal &amp; Nooruddin, 2010</xref>). Again, data are from the World Values Survey. Respondents were asked whether “most people can be trusted” (0) or “you need to be very careful in dealing with people” (1). Since a higher value for this variable indicates lower levels of trust, we expect <italic>interpersonal trust</italic> be negatively correlated with confidence.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0010414011434294">
<title>Individual-Level Empirical Evidence</title>
<p>The results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010414011434294">Table 2</xref>. The dependent variable <italic>level of confidence</italic> is the 4-point scale of confidence. Recall, smaller values on the dependent variable indicate less confidence in the justice system; and conversely, greater values suggest more confidence. The model is estimated using ordered logit with robust standard errors. The baseline model is presented in the first column. In the second column, standard errors are clustered by country, and in the third column, they are clustered by respondent. The empirical evidence supports our claim that linguistic recognition matters. The results for <italic>lingua franca</italic> largely mirror those from the national-level analysis: The recognition of a lingua franca in the courtroom has a positive and significant effect on confidence in the justice system among minorities. This is in line with Hypothesis 3a.</p>

<p>Sample: All respondents who speak a minority language at home. Robust standard errors reported in parentheses.</p>

<p>Several other results warrant further discussion. First, there is weak support for Hypothesis 2. The result in the baseline model suggests that when minorities can use their own language in court, they are more likely to view the procedure as “fair.” This “fairness,” in turn, increases confidence in the judicial process. Caution, however, must be exercised as this finding is sensitive to model specification. Once the standard errors are clustered—either by country or by respondent—the significance from the baseline model disappears.</p>
<p>Second, recall there is an additional argument that the effects of lingua franca recognition are more pronounced than those of minority language recognition (Hypothesis 3b). We see evidence of this in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010414011434294">Table 2</xref>. In the first column, both <italic>minority language</italic> and <italic>lingua franca</italic> are statistically significant and positive. However, the magnitude of the effects is not the same. A shift from no minority recognition to recognition can increase the likelihood of “rather” confident from 0.372 to 0.539. In contrast, the same shift for a lingua franca can increase the likelihood of “rather” confident from 0.287 to 0.539. The effects of the two languages are even more pronounced when we look at the second and third columns. When standard errors are clustered, only the lingua franca is statistically significant. Minority language recognition simply has no effect. Taken altogether, the results in these three columns lend support to the claim that people care more about relative deprivation than about their absolute conditions.</p>
<p>Third, among control variables, four at the national level are robust in their significance across model specifications. One is the effect of democracy. Respondents residing in democracies are less likely to be confident in the justice system than their counterparts in authoritarian regimes. One possibility is that in democracies, minorities are in principle accorded a political voice and recognition of their civil liberties. However, in democracies, minorities can also be subjected to a tyranny of the majority. So even with descriptive representation, this does not necessarily translate into substantive policies. As long as public opinion matters (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0010414011434294">Vanberg, 2005</xref>), the minority is effectively muted. But in contrast, in authoritarian regimes, dictators may deny minorities a voice in the political sphere. But in exchange, minorities are granted higher levels of substantive representation that are denied to their democratic counterparts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414011434294">Brown &amp; Liu, n.d</xref>.).</p>
<p>Another control variable of significance is linguistic fractionalization. As expected, but not evident from the national-level analysis, diversity has a negative effect on confidence. Regardless of whether the mechanism is intergroup conflict or out-group profiling, heterogeneity makes minorities more aware of their differences from the majority. This in turn has an effect on their confidence in the justice system. In contrast, when countries are plagued to a lesser extent by linguistic fractionalization, minorities are more likely to view judicial proceedings as fair.</p>
<p>As for the type of legal system, common and religious are the two of significance. Minorities are more likely to view the justice system with confidence when the legal system is governed by a common tradition. In contrast, minorities are less likely to see the courts in such favorable light when the system is dominated by a religion.</p>
<p>Of the remaining control variables, civil liberties, colonial legacy, and civil legal system are significant to varying degrees, but this significance is not robust across model specification. It is quite surprising that wealth has no statistical effect. This is in contrast to the results from the national-level model. In the previous model where the number of observations was small, <italic>GDP per capita</italic> was the only control variable significant in both model specifications. One possibility is that the positive effects of wealth are being picked up by the respondent’s social class control. An examination of said variable lends some validity to this claim. Respondents who indicated higher levels of social wealth are also more likely to view the justice system favorably. Likewise, people with at least a secondary education and/or who perceived minimal levels of corruption in the government services are also more likely to express high levels of confidence.</p>

<title>Alternate Hypothesis and Test</title>
<p>Given the cross-sectional nature of the sample, spurious correlations and omitted variable biases are possible. In the regressions, we lagged both <italic>minority language</italic> and <italic>lingua franca</italic> so that we could identify the effects of linguistic recognition from one period on the confidence in the next period. However, there is an alternate story for why we observed the effects that we do. It is possible that countries with many potentially mobilizing language groups have greater influence—either electorally through the legislature and/or physically through the threat of violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0010414011434294">7</xref></sup> This influence, in turn, leads to both preferable policy outcomes (recognition in the courts) and higher confidence levels in the state and government institutions (including the judiciary). To ensure this observed correlation is not spurious, we run another test. We begin by regressing both <italic>minority language</italic> and <italic>lingua franca</italic> on linguistic fractionalization (as measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414011434294">Alesina et al., 2003</xref>). Since we are not constrained by the World Values Survey sample here, we construct a larger time-series, cross-sectional data set where the unit of analysis is all <italic>country-years</italic>, 1980–2000. The <italic>N</italic> is now 1,126. We include a dummy to control for states that enter the sample post-1980 (<italic>new state</italic>). We estimate the model using logit.</p>
<p>The results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010414011434294">Table 3</xref>. The presence of many mobilizing minority groups has no bearing on language recognition. Among the control variables, only three are significant. First, increased wealth decreases the likelihood of a minority language being recognized. This result speaks to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0010414011434294">Lipset (1959</xref>, p. 84) who argued that with high levels of wealth, “tolerance norms” increase and cleavages become less salient. Second, new states are less likely to recognize a minority language. When governments try to build an “imagined community” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414011434294">Anderson, 1983</xref>), this may often involve the choice of monolingualism as it is the “most powerful [of all state simplifications]” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0010414011434294">Scott, 1988</xref>, p. 72). The third and final control variable of significance is the lagged dependent variable. This result is not shocking: Language policies do not change often. As such, recognition from the previous year is highly correlated to recognition in the subsequent year. Taken altogether, the lack of significance for <italic>linguistic fractionalization</italic> suggests although powerful minority groups may matter, they do not account for the correlation we have observed in this article.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>How does linguistic recognition in the courtroom affect popular confidence in the justice system among minorities? We argued the recognition of either minority languages and/or linguas franca can increase popular confidence in the justice system, although the mechanisms are different. By allowing minority languages and giving their speakers a voice in the justice system, this can create a sense of procedural fairness in absolute conditions. Speakers of both majority and minority languages have the constitutional right to air grievances and defend against charges without linguistic barriers. In contrast, linguas franca lead to the highest confidence among minorities. This may be because they breed relative perceptions of procedural fairness. Although minority speakers may encounter greater linguistic difficulties, these difficulties are shared by all. Furthermore, the use of a lingua franca can remove the symbolic notion of ethnic chauvinism and majority dominance. This, we argued, would create even higher levels of confidence in the justice system than simply giving minorities a chance to use their language. We tested this argument using original data. The newly constructed language-in-judiciary variable measures whether minority languages and linguas franca are recognized in the courts. The results at the national and individual levels indicated that although both languages have a positive effect on confidence, linguas franca have a greater impact.</p>
<p>These results have normative implications. First, minority language recognition is sometimes considered under the umbrella of civil rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0010414011434294">McColm, 1990</xref>). The position adopted by the European Union to require candidate countries to recognize minority languages (see the 1992 Charter for Regional or Minority Languages) highlights the normative nature of this issue. To deny a group the right to use its own language especially in the justice system effectively renders speakers of that language to second-tier status. However, this avenue is not necessarily the proper mechanism to ensure confidence specifically in the judiciary. It is not always about absolute fairness. What matters more is about the relative difference in how minority and majority speakers are treated. Minorities are more likely to trust the justice system when no group—especially the majority—is privileged.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although the emphasis in this article has been on the judiciary, there is good reason to believe the same mechanisms are at play as well with other government institutions. Normatively, confidence in other institutions is also important. Moreover, this study has implications for how to get minorities to be satisfied with political outcomes—which are often supported by only the majority. This is important because in a democracy, even minorities should accept outcomes that they do not support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0010414011434294">Tyler et al., 1997</xref>). Allowing people to use their own language or a common language could be crucial for encouraging political stability and could decrease the chances of ethnic conflict. This study suggests that government officials can help ameliorate problems associated with linguistic heterogeneity by recognizing certain languages.</p>
<p>Second, when it comes to drafting of constitutions or choosing institutions to mitigate ethnic conflict, the literature has been long divided between majoritarian institutions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010414011434294">Horowitz, 1985</xref>) and power-sharing consensus institutions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0010414011434294">Lijphart, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0010414011434294">Norris, 2008</xref>). The debate has revolved around how much recognition to accord. Specifically, what is the proper balance between (a) protecting minorities from “tyranny of the majority” and (b) protecting the majority from radical and violent minority demands? This article highlights the limitations of said debate. Instead, what may offer more promise is to focus on lingua franca recognition.</p>
