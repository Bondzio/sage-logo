<title>Evolving Concepts in the Pathogenesis of NMO and Related Syndromes</title>
<p>Lassmann H</p>
<p><italic>Center for Brain Research, Medical University of Vienna, Austria</italic></p>
<p>Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) has originally been seen as a variant of multiple sclerosis. In pathology, it has been defined as an inflammatory demyelinating disease that mainly or exclusively affects the optic system and the spinal cord. More recently, however, pathological features typical of NMO have been recognised, consisting of profound antibody- and complementmediated tissue injury and a particularly profound affection of perivascular tissue elements. These observations lead to the identification of autoantibodies in NMO patients, which turn out to be directed against the astrocytic water channel aquaporin-4. These antibodies are highly specific for NMO and can induce NMOlike tissue damage in vitro and in vivo. In vivo, however, brain inflammation induced by additional mechanisms is required to start the formation of lesions. Recent studies show that aquaporin-4 can also be recognised by autoreactive T-cells. These are sufficient to induce brain inflammation and allow the autoantibodies to damage nervous tissue. Indirect evidence shows that disease induction in NMO patients is associated with T-cell-mediated immune reactions, but it remains unresolved as to whether the disease is driven by an aquaporin-4 directed T-cell response. Ten to thirty percent of patients with clinically typical NMO are negative for aquaporin-4 autoantibodies. The high and variable percentage of these antibodynegative patients may in part be related to technical issues, such as the sensitivity of the aquaporin-4 antibody test. In addition, true antibody-negative patients may suffer from a disease which shares the same clinical features but has a different pathogenesis.</p>

<title>AQP4 Antibody-Positive Thai Cases: Clinical Features and Diagnostic Problems</title>
<p>Siritho S</p>
<p><italic>MS Clinic, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Thailand</italic></p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To evaluate the prevalence of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody in Thai patients with idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating CNS diseases (IIDCD) and to analyse the significance of the autoantibody to distinguish neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and other NMO Spectrum Disorders (ONMOSD) from other IIDCD, especially multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We cross-sectionally evaluated 135 consecutive patients with IIDCD seen at the MS clinic at Siriraj Hospital, Thailand, using accepted diagnostic criteria, and classified them into NMO, ONMOSD, optic-spinal MS (OSMS), classic MS (CMS), and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) in this order. Individual patients’ coded sera were tested for AQP4 antibody. The relationship between clinical diagnosis and AQP4 antibody serological status was then analysed.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Among the 135 patients, 53 (39.3%) were AQP4 antibody-positive. Although the AQP4 antibody-positive patients had features of NMO, such as female predominance, long cord lesions (&gt;3 vertebral bodies) and CSF-pleocytosis, only 18 patients (33% of 54) fully met Wingerchuk 2006 Criteria, with the exception of AQP4 antibodyseropositive status. We also detected some AQP4 antibody-positive patients in OSMS (4/7), CMS (11/46), and CIS (1/16). They had been misdiagnosed with MS since they often had brain lesions and never underwent spinal cord MRI examination or lacked long cord lesions.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> AQP4 antibody was highly prevalent (almost 40%) in Thai patients with IIDCD. Moreover, only one-third of AQP4 antibody-positive patients fully met Wingerchuk 2006 Criteria, and many were misdiagnosed with MS. A sensitive AQP4 antibody assay is required since the therapy of NMO is different from that of MS.</p>

<title>Neuromyelitis Optica in Singapore</title>
<p>Tan K</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, National Neuroscience Institute, Singapore</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) and its spectrum disorders (NMOSD), recurrent transverse myelitis (rTM) and recurrent optic neuritis (rON) are distinct from multiple sclerosis (MS) in pathogenesis, prognosis and treatment response. In Singapore, the estimated MS prevalence is 0.8 to 2 cases per 100, 000, but NMO prevalence is unknown.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We reviewed all patients diagnosed with NMO/NMOSD based on Wingerchuk 2006 criteria from the National Neuroscience Institute (NNI) Neuroimmunology Database and Tissue Repository seen between 1989 and June 2011. Forty-six (41 females, 5 males; mean age of onset 46.7 years [range 20–77]) out of 188 patients from the database were included.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Final diagnoses were NMO (n=27), single or rTM (n=12), single or rON (n=4) and brainstem or hemispheric involvement (n=3). Initial presentations were TM (n=21), ON (n=16), simultaneous opticospinal (n=4), brainstem (n=4), or hemispheric (n=1) attacks. Thirty-six patients (78.2%) had longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions at some point. Cerebrospinal fluid (n=26) mean white cell count was 39 cells/ul (range 0-360); oligoclonal bands were present in 12% (3/25) of patients. NMO-IgG seropositivity was 82.4% (28/34). Overall systemic autoantibody seropositivity was high: antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (47.5% [19/40]), anti-double-stranded DNA (16.7% [6/36]) and anti-Ro/La (22.5% [9/40]). Current treatments included azathioprine (n=15), methotrexate (n=9), mycophenolate mofetil (n=3), rituximab (n=1) and Interferon-beta (n=1); 12 patients had no disease-modifying treatment; 3 patients were deceased. Analysis of treated patients showed that median 8 PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts annualised relapse rate was significantly lower post-treatment than pre-treatment for both azathioprine (0.51 vs 2.41, p=0.001) and methotrexate (0.00 vs 0.74, p=0.008). Median EDSS remained stable after treatment: azathioprine (pre- 5.0 vs post- 4.25, p=0.56); methotrexate (pre- 6.5 vs post- 6, p=0.46).</p>

<title>Optic Manifestations of NMO</title>
<p>Tow S</p>
<p><italic>Singapore National Eye Centre, Singapore</italic></p>
<p>Monosymptomatic optic neuritis (ON) is not infrequently the first presentation in NMO as well as in multiple sclerosis (MS). The ON in NMO is often bilateral and is associated with severe visual loss with little or no improvement of vision following the initial attack. The patient may have a history of recurrent optic neuritis and a history of previous transverse myelitis. The visual field defects seen in NMO may help to raise suspicion of NMO in that the defects are more commonly altitudinal compared to those seen in MS. This is possibly the result of an ischaemic component in the underlying pathophysiology of NMO ON, the ON in MS. Retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness measured by optical coherence tomography has been reported to show substantial thinning in NMO eyes relative to both relapsing-remitting MS ON eyes and control eyes. Unaffected NMO eyes are not significantly different from control eyes. Identification of substantial RNFL loss – reportedly greater than 15 microns - after ON and particularly in unilateral ON in a non-MS patient should prompt consideration of NMO. Recognising the clinical manifestations of NMO ON at presentation and the findings of various ancillary investigations will increase clinical suspicion and thus facilitate the accurate diagnosis of NMO. This will then enable early treatment.</p>

<title>Connexins in Demyelinating Disorders</title>
<p>Masaki K, Kira J</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Neurological Institute, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO) are inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system. The discovery of anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody suggests that NMO is distinct from MS. Baló’s concentric sclerosis (BCS) is considered to be a rare variant of MS. Recently, we reported AQP4 loss without perivascular deposition of either activated complement or immunoglobulin in MS, NMO and BCS. Therefore, we propose auto-antibody-independent astrocytopathy as a common denominator in these conditions. However, it remains unknown as to how astrocytopathy induces secondary demyelination. In order to clarify the mechanism of secondary demyelination, we studied expression of connexins, which form gap junctions among glial cells and myelin and play critical roles for intercellular apposition and communication among these cells in MS, NMO and BCS.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We immunohistochemically evaluated autopsied specimens from 11 cases with NMO and NMO spectrum disorders (NMOSD), 5 with MS, 4 with BCS and 20 with other neurological diseases for astrocyte markers, namely, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), AQP4, Cx43 and megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cyst 1 (MLC1), as well as for oligodendrocyte/myelin markers. The latter includes Cx32, myelinassociated glycoprotein (MAG), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and oligodendrocyte-specific protein (OSP).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In BCS, despite the presence of numerous GFAP- and MLC1-positive astrocytes, Cx43 and Cx32, which connect astrocytes and myelin, were totally lost, even in OSP-, MOG- and MAG-positive preserved myelin layers. Furthermore, in the leading edges, Cx43 and AQP4 were completely absent despite the presence of GFAP, MLC1, Cx32, MOG, MAG, and OSP immunoreactivity. None of the 6 patients with Baló’s disease were positive for anti-AQP4 or anti-Cx43 antibodies. Two cases of MS and 6 cases of NMO also showed preferential Cx43 and AQP4 loss far beyond the demyelinated areas, irrespective of lesion staging, while vasculocentric deposition of immunoglobulins and complements were observed in 4 of the 6 NMO cases. By contrast, the rest (3 MS and 5 NMO cases) showed AQP4 and Cx43 preservation or upregulation even in actively demyelinating lesions, despite grave tissue destruction. Interestingly, in one NMO case, Cx43 loss apparently preceded to AQP4 loss in the active lesions. Perivascular lymphocyte cuffings consisting mainly of T cells without immunoglobulin or complement deposition, were seen in all active lesions of MS and BCS cases, and in more than half of NMO cases.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> We therefore consider that auto-antibody-independent connexin/AQP4 astrocytopathy can occur in MS, BCS and NMO, and be a common denominator in these conditions. Loss of Cx43 and AQP4 in the presence of other oligodendrocyte/myelin proteins in the leading edges suggests that auto-antibody-independent astrocytopathy may be a primary event leading to demyelination through disruption of astrocyte-oligodendrocyte/myelin interaction.</p>

<title>Origin and Homeostasis of Brain Microglia</title>
<p>Ginhoux F</p>
<p><italic>Singapore Immunology Network, Singapore</italic></p>
<p>Microglia are the resident macrophages of the central nervous system and are associated with the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative and brain inflammatory diseases; however, the origin of adult microglia remains controversial. We show that postnatal hematopoietic progenitors do not significantly contribute to microglia homeostasis in the adult brain. In contrast to many macrophage populations, we show that microglia develop in mice that lack colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) but are absent in CSF- 1 receptor-deficient mice. In vivo lineage tracing studies established that adult microglia are derived from primitive myeloid progenitors that arise before embryonic day 8. These results identify microglia as an ontogenically distinct population in the mononuclear phagocyte system and have implications for the use of embryonically derived microglial progenitors for the treatment of various brain disorders.

<title>What do Large-Scale Genetic Studies on MS tell us about the Mechanism?</title>
<p>Oksenberg JR</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, University of California at San Francisco, USA</italic></p>
<p>Extensive epidemiological data suggest that genetic variation is an important determinant of susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS). Population, family, and molecular studies provide strong empirical support for a polygenic model of inheritance driven primarily by allelic variants relatively common in the general population. The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) in chromosome 6p21.3 represents by far the strongest MS susceptibility locus genomewide, and was unambiguously identified in all studied populations. The primary signal arises from the HLA-DRB1 gene in the class II segment of the locus, with hierarchical allelic and haplotypic effects. Independent protective signals in the telomeric class I region of the locus have been described as well.</p>
<p>Over the last five years, large, multi-centre DNA collections have prospered and the development of new laboratory and analytical approaches has matured at a remarkable pace, allowing the pursuit of comprehensive ‘agnostic’ genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify and characterise the non-HLA genetic component of MS. The results of 8 modestly powered MS-GWAS have been reported, which enabled the identification of more than 20 risk loci. A recent multi-centre collaborative GWAS involving 9,772 cases of European descent collected by 23 research groups working in 15 different countries identified 29 additional novel susceptibility loci.</p>
<p>Although the effect of any given predisposing variant is modest, the possibility exists that multi-faceted gene-gene and/or geneenvironment interactions could substantially increase the contribution of some variants to the overall genetic risk. In addition, susceptibility genes may be subject to epigenetic modifications, which greatly increase the complexity of MS inheritance. We will discuss ongoing efforts to fully characterise the repertoire of genes that predispose to MS and modulate its presentation. The functional characterisation of even a moderate genetic effect by a known gene or group of genes on MS pathogenesis could help elucidate fundamental mechanisms of disease expression and yield important therapeutic opportunities.</p>

<title>Genetic Studies of MS in India</title>
<p>Pandit L</p>
<p><italic>Centre for Advanced Neurological Research, Nitte University, Mangalore, Karnataka, India</italic></p>
<p>The association between Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and disease susceptibility alleles has been studied extensively in Europeans and migrant European populations but the role of these genes in Asians, especially from the Indian subcontinent, has received almost no attention. The HLA allele frequencies found in this population and the patterns of correlation (linkage disequilibrium) between these alleles are substantially different from those seen in other more extensively studied ethnic groups underscoring the potentially informative nature of a study of these genes in Asians. A few small serological studies involving the class I genes were performed in the 1980s and an association was found with HLA-B12. Subsequent analysis of the class II HLA genes was performed in a limited number of patients and revealed the expected association with the European susceptibility haplotype DRB1*1501.</p>
<p>Recent efforts have focused on evaluating the role of established non-MHC disease susceptibility loci in the Indian population. Fifteen MS loci outside the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region that were previously identified and validated with MS susceptibility through genome-wide association and replication studies in white populations were studied in patients and unrelated controls. Despite the low power of the study, nominal associations were seen, especially with interleukin-7 receptor alpha (IL7RA) and C-type lectin domain family 16-(CLEC16 A-) associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and the risk allele frequencies in Indian and white MS patients were comparable for most SNPs typed. These preliminary observations suggest a commonality in disease susceptibility genes for both Indian and white populations.</p>

<title>Genetic Studies of MS in Chinese &amp; Australians</title>

<p><italic><sup>1</sup>Department of Neurology, MS Center, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China; <sup>2</sup>Centre for Neuromuscular and Neurological Disorders, University of Western Australia, and Department of Neurology, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre, Perth, Western Australia</italic></p>
<p>MS is a common neurological disease which affects about 1/1000 Caucasians and 1/10,000 Asians. The causes of MS are largely unknown, although it is clear that genetic and environmental components play an important role.</p>
<p>It has been well-established that HLA on chromosome 6P21.3 accounts for about 50% of the overall MS genetic risk. Extensive studies support the notion that genetic susceptibility for MS among Asians may be largely similar to that in white populations. For example, HLA-DRB1*1501 was also associated with MS in Chinese, although the risk may be lower than that in Western populations. On the other hand, a few studies have also indicated that a difference in genetic association does exist. For example, the protective alleles identified in Chinese (HLA-DR9) differ from those in Caucasians (HLA-DR4). As epistasis among HLA class II alleles, both at the diplotype and haplotype level rather than with only individual alleles, is important in determining the risk for MS, future studies focusing on epistasis will therefore be particularly important to find out the key determinants of MS risk in the Chinese population.</p>
<p>Genetic effects on MS have been extensively investigated in a MS cohort from Western Australia. HLA-I and HLA-II genes have been strongly associated with MS susceptibility and clinical phenotypes, such as age of onset, OCB positivity and disability. Furthermore, polymorphisms in a number of non-HLA genes (APOE, IL-7R, CLEC-16, TYK2, IRF5, CTL-A, CD58) and interactions with HLA alleles have also shown significant modifying effects on disease susceptibility.</p>
<p>10 PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts</p>
<p>The rare influx of “foreign genes” and the use of disease-modifying treatments provide fewer “contaminated” cases for studying the effect of genes (resistant genes in particular) on Chinese MS patients. In future, a cross-ethnicity (Mongloid vs Caucasoid) transmission linkage study would be helpful to identify risk/resistant alleles and haplotypes in this population.</p>

<title>Genetic Background for Recent Increase of MS in Japanese</title>
<p>Isobe N, Kira J</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Neurological Institute, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Japan</italic>.</p>
<p>In 2004, we established the South Japan Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Genetics Consortium with the largest Japanese sample size to reveal the genetic background of MS in southern Japan. The SNP-based association analysis of HLA locus revealed that the SNP rs422951 in <italic>NOTCH4</italic> was independently associated with MS. This association was independent from the positivity of <italic>HLADRB1* 1501</italic>, which is the most susceptible allele in the Northern European population. When we analysed the genetic background of neuromyelitis optica (NMO)/NMO spectrum disorders (NMOSD) and non-NMO/NMOSD MS in comparison with healthy controls (HCs), the positivity of <italic>HLA-DRB1*0405</italic> was significantly higher in non-NMO/NMOSD MS cases than in HCs, while <italic>HLA-DRB1*0901</italic> were less common in both NMO/NMOSD cases and non-NMO/ NMOSD MS cases compared to HCs. The SNP in <italic>IL-7RA</italic>, which was one of the biggest susceptibility genes in Northern European population, was also confirmed to be significantly associated with Japanese non-NMO/NMOSD MS. However, the susceptibility was only confirmed in those with <italic>HLA-DRB1*0405</italic> in our study. Patients with <italic>HLA-DRB1*0405</italic> had fewer brain MRI lesions and milder clinical forms as shown in the Progression Index and EDSS score, compared to those without <italic>HLA-DRB1*0405</italic>. Among NMO/ NMOSD cases and non-NMO/NMOSD MS cases, the percentages of non-NMO/NMOSD MS cases have been increasing in the younger generation, especially in those with <italic>HLA-DRB1*0405</italic>. Although this change was not exactly conclusive at the time of the latest nationwide survey, intensive research in this field is needed to prevent future increase in MS patient numbers. In conclusion, <italic>HLA-DRB1*0405</italic> and genes associated with <italic>HLA-DRB1*0405</italic> have a key role in the pathogenesis of MS in Japanese.</p>

<title>New Diagnostic Criteria for MS: 2010 Revisions</title>
<p>Fujihara K</p>
<p><italic>Department of Multiple Sclerosis Therapeutics, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan</italic></p>
<p>The International Panel on Diagnosis of MS met in May 2010 in Dublin for a third time to reexamine requirements of dissemination in space (DIS) and time (DIT) and to focus on the application of the McDonald Criteria in pediatric, Asian and Latin American populations. The newly adopted MRI criteria of DIS (based on Swanton et al, 2006, 2007) and DIT (based on Montalban et al, 2010) are simpler but more sensitive and retain high specificity as compared with the previous criteria. Moreover, a single MRI may establish both DIS and DIT in some circumstances. The criteria of primary progressive MS (PPMS) were also revised based on the new criteria for DIS. Most cases of pediatric MS start with relapsing–remitting disease, and PPMS is exceptional in children. In children suspected of monophasic ADEM, the new criteria for DIS and DIT should not be applied on initial MRI, since the disease can meet MRI criteria. Follow-up of clinical course and MRI is required in such patients. Although the McDonald Criteria have been widely used in Asia and Latin America, they have not been fully validated, and cases of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) or NMO spectrum disorders are relatively common in these regions. NMO should be separated from MS because of its different clinical course, prognosis, and underlying pathophysiology, as well as poor response to some disease-modifying drugs for MS. Thus, a careful work-up including a validated anti-aquaporin-4 antibody test is important in patients suspected of having NMO or NMO spectrum disorders.</p>

<title>Emerging Therapies and Optimising Treatment in Demyelinating Disorders</title>
<p>Carroll W</p>
<p><italic>Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Australia</italic></p>
<p>The goal of any treatment depends on a number of factors but particularly on the state of the disease in the individual concerned, the efficacy of available treatments and the willingness of both patient and clinician to proceed with an appropriate option. Broadly, treatment goals may be listed as preventative, curative or symptomatic.</p>
<p>In the two decades since the pivotal Betaferon trial, the treatment and understanding of CNS idiopathic demyelinating disease has advanced considerably. From disease-modifying therapies to biologics and now oral therapies, the twin goals of the early institution of effective treatment and adherence to therapy are now both recognised and facilitated by clinicians and demanded by patients. Furthermore, the treatment options for clinicians, funding bodies and governments are broadening, with decisions now having to satisfy a range of clinical, social and economic criteria. The arrival of oral therapies and the broadening therapeutic targets will be reviewed. From sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators, to co-stimulatory molecules, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective pathways, the reintroduction of immunosuppressants with or without stem cells, and the possibility of enhancing endogenous reparative processes, the range of therapies is being extended. While only few will eventually find a major role in the management of MS, they have given both clinicians and people with MS new hope that the disease can be controlled, and at the very least have the disability deferred until newer therapies become available. This review will concentrate on newly introduced treatment, those presently used in trials and on monitoring treatment response.</p>

<title>Clinical Trial Results of Emerging New Disease-Modifying Therapies for MS in Japanese</title>
<p>Saida T</p>

<p>The effects of treatment in patients with MS in Japan needed to be verified, since there are genetic and metabolic differences between ethnic groups. MS in East Asia, as compared to western countries, is of low frequency and includes a large proportion of patients with NMO, if not excluded properly. The past controlled clinical trials in Japan explored the followings: Mizoribine for 3 years, with negative results; IFN-beta-1b for 2 years, with positive results; IFN-beta 1a for 6 months, with positive results; Gamma-globulin infusion for 2 years, with negative results.</p>
<p>In a recently completed randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study of Fingolimod (FTY720), a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, 171 patients with relapsing MS were randomised to receive once-daily fingolimod 0.5 mg or 1.25 mg, or matching placebo for 6 months. NMO was excluded by the absence of MRI long cord lesions extending over 3 vertebral segments. Higher proportions of patients were free of Gd+ lesions at months 3 and 6 with fingolimod 0.5 mg (70%, <italic>p</italic>= 0.004) and 1.25 mg (86%, <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.001) than with placebo (40%). The annualised relapse rate over 6 months was significantly reduced vs placebo by 49% and 58% for fingolimod 0.5 mg and 1.25 mg, respectively. Adverse events included transient bradycardia and atrioventricular block at treatment initiation and elevated liver enzyme levels. This study provides Class I evidence that fingolimod reduces inflammatory brain lesion activity and relapse rate compared with placebo in Japanese patients with relapsing MS, consistent with the established effects of fingolimod in Caucasian patients.</p>

<title>Optimization of Treatment for NMO</title>

<p>Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that preferentially affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. In Asia, NMO has long been considered a subtype of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, recent clinical, pathological, immunological, and imaging studies have suggested that NMO is distinct from MS. It is now widely accepted that NMO is a B-cell-mediated disease associated with anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody. The discovery of this diseasespecific antibody facilitates early recognition of NMO and of a broader spectrum of manifestation of NMO. In this context, the new concept of NMO spectrum disorder (NMOSD) which may reflect CNS AQP4 autoimmunity was introduced,.</p>
<p>Current treatment strategies are not evidence-based because randomised controlled trials are difficult to perform due to cost, ethics and rarity of disease. However, recent advances in our understanding of the disease may lead to better treatment strategies. High-dose IV corticosteroids are widely employed as first-line treatment of acute attacks, whereas therapeutic plasmapheresis is applied upon corticosteroid failure. For longterm relapse prevention, immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, and mitoxantrone are recommended rather than the immunomodulatory agents used for MS. I will discuss the current treatment options for NMOSD and introduce our experience of repeated treatment of rituximab based on the assessment of peripheral circulating memory B-cells and rescue therapy using mitoxantrone.</p>

<title>Treatment of LESCLs with Special Reference to IFNβ Responsiveness in CMS with LESCL and NMO with LESCL</title>
<p>Tsai CP</p>
<p><italic>Neurological Institute, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, and National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background and Purpose:</bold> Recent reports have shown that interferon-beta (IFN-β) treatment may not be effective in Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO), since long spinal cord lesion is a special characteristic of NMO, and spinal cord lesion itself is crucial in the disability scale. It is also under consideration if poor responses to IFN-β are related to the spinal cord lesion or to the NMO disease entity itself. We retrospectively evaluated spinal cord involvement in Taiwanese patients with conventional multiple sclerosis (MS) and NMO as well as their correlation between MRI, AQP4 autoantibodies and response to IFN-β treatment.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Seventy consecutive MS and NMO patients were involved. Among them were 49 MS and 21 NMO patients from the Special clinic for MS at Taipei VGH treated with IFN-β from 2002-2008 who were enrolled in this retrospective study.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Spinal cord lesions were present in 57.1 % (28/49) of conventional MS cases. Among them, 16.3% (8/49) cases presented with spinal cord lesions longer than 3 vertebral segments LSCL, 40.8% (20/49) cases presented with spinal cord lesions shorter than 3 vertebral segments SSCL. IFN-β treatment showed response in 69.3% (34/49) of all MS cases, in which response rates were 76.1% (16/21) in MS without spinal cord lesions, 37.5% (3/8) with LSCL and 75% (15/20) with SSCL. In NMO patients, all 8 patients with positive AQP4 autoantibodies showed no response to IFN-β treatment whereas only 23% (3/13) showed response with negative AQP4 autoantibodies. The total response rate for NMO is 14.2% (3/21).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Spinal cord lesions are common in MS patients in Taiwan. Poor responses to IFN-β treatment may be found both in MS and NMO patients with LCL. However, NMO patients had worse response to IFN-β treatment compared to MS patients with LCL, which showed that other than long spinal cord lesion, is a crucial structural defect. The NMO disease entity itself is another critical issue due to its pathophysiology in which some factors facilitated by IFN-β treatment may also play an important role in the poor response of IFN-β treatment in NMO. 12</p>

<title>Environmental Influence on MS</title>
<p>Taylor B</p>
<p><italic>Menzies Research Institute Tasmania, Australia</italic></p>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex disorder that has significant intra and inter-personal variability with multiple factors contributing to its aetiology and progression. This includes particular environmental and genetic factors.</p>
<p>It has long been recognised that the prevalence of MS is not evenly distributed around the world, with prevalence increasing with latitude in genetically at-risk populations. This observation has raised the distinct possibility that onset of MS is influenced by geography with the most likely aetiological candidates being personal UVR exposure and vitamin D. Other factors known to be associated with onset of MS include prior exposure to the Epstein Barr Virus, cigarette smoking, gestational history, and potential effects of the “Hygiene Hypothesis”. These factors are also involved in the progression of MS from onset and are all amenable to modification by direct public health initiatives.</p>
<p>There are many unanswered questions that need to be addressed to understand how these factors interact with one other and with a person’s underlying genetic make-up. This includes the role of gene-environment interactions and epigenetics.</p>
<p>This presentation will explore these interactions and propose a series of mechanisms by which these various factors may interact.</p>

<title>Herpes Viruses and Genetic Epistasis in MS</title>

<p>The risk of multiple sclerosis is conferred by multiple factors that interact to promote CNS-specific autoimmune responses, although their influence on the formation and evolution of this immunological environment may be temporally distinct. In this context, genetic epistasis can reflect the influence of interacting host genetic factors (particularly notable in relation to the development of adaptive immunity), as well as the influence of environmental factors (such as vitamin D exposure) and endogenous factors (such as innate immunity) on gene expression and post-translational modification of proteins. There is also an increasing appreciation that viruses, and particularly the herpes virus family that have co-evolved with the adaptive immune system throughout human evolution, provide an additional source of genetic epistasis by interacting with host genes and proteins to establish niches that allow for persistent infection. In this presentation, these issues will be discussed in relation to the major genetic and environmental risk factors for multiple sclerosis, including a role for herpes virus infection in disease pathogenesis.</p>

<title>Vitamin D Deficiency and Increase of MS Prevalence in Iran</title>
<p>Etemadifar M</p>
<p><italic>Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran</italic></p>
<p>Isfahan province in Iran is globally well-known for its high prevalence of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Fifteen years ago according to the north-south MS gradient hypothesis, Isfahan has been expected to be a low-risk area with a prevalence of less than 5/100,000. In the last decade, serial population-based studies by Isfahan MS society (IMSS) increased our knowledge about MS epidemiology in our province. The first IMSS study was performed between 2004 and 2005 reporting a period prevalence of 35.5/100,000. This report put Isfahan as a medium to high-risk area. In 2006, a more comprehensive study reported a period prevalence of 43.8/100,000. A final study was performed in 2010 reporting a period prevalence of 73.3/100,000 between April 2003 and July 2010, and an incidence rate of 9.1/100,000 in 2009. According to this report, Isfahan was named one of the regions with the highest-risk of MS in the Asian continent. MS prevention is limited in controlling environmental risk factors where vitamin D deficiency plays a major role. The risk of development of MS, as well as disease severity, has been associated with vitamin D in a variety of studies. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is high in a sunny city—Isfahan— especially among women and the younger populations. The increasing prevalence, incidence and sex ratio of MS in Isfahan thus could in part be attributed to the vitamin D deficiency in the province.</p>

<title>HTLV-1 Infection and Development of Demyelinating Diseases</title>
<p>Umehara F</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Nanpuh Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan</italic></p>
<p>Human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) has been associated with chronic progressive dis¬ease of the CNS, and termed as HTLV-I associated myelopathy (HAM)/tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP). Diagnostic criteria for HAM/TSP include positive anti-HTLV-I antibody in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid, and high HTLV-I proviral load in PBMCs. Neuromyelitis optica (Devic’s syndrome) is a severe idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating disease that selectively affects optic nerves and spinal cord, typically spares the brain, and generally follows a relapsing course. Recent reports support a pathogenic role in neuromyelitis optica (NMO) for the aquaporin-4 (AQP4)–specific autoantibody (NMO-IgG). Although both HAM/TSP and NMO involve the spinal cord, complications of both HAM/TSP and NMO have never been reported.</p>
<p>We report on patients with NMO associated with HTLV-I infection. These patients were found to have recurrent myelitis with or without optic neuritis. Laboratory examination revealed positive anti-HTLV-I antibody in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid and high HTLV-I proviral load in PBMCs. We analysed clinical, radiographic and immunovirological features of these cases.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We hypothesise that NMO in these cases may be linked to HTLV infection.</p>

<title>Characterising the Spectrum of Inflammatory Demyelinating Disorders in Children in Singapore</title>
<p>Thomas T, Ling SR, Chan DWS</p>
<p><italic>Neurology Service, Department of Paediatric Medicine, KK Women’s &amp; Children’s Hospital, Singapore</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> We characterise the range of acute and recurrent inflammatory demyelinating disorders at a tertiary children’s hospital in Singapore.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective case series of children presenting with Optic Neuritis (ON), Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and Transverse Myelitis (TM) between January 2003 to June 2011.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 47 children, 22 presented with ON, 18 with ADEM, and 7 with TM. Mean age was 9.9 (range 3-18) years, with a female to male ratio of 1:0.81. Twenty six (55%) were Chinese, 10 (21%) Malay, 10 (21%) Indian and 1 (3%) of mixed descent. All patients improved with high-dose methylprednisolone. Three patients had recurrent demyelination. Two had multiple sclerosis (MS): (i) an 11-yearold girl with first ADEM episode followed by two Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) episodes over the past 4 years. She had opted against prophylactic treatment, despite having an EDSS of 2 (mild learning difficulties) and she continues to accrue clinically silent brain lesions, and (ii) a 6-year-old girl who recently presented with bilateral optic neuritis with silent brain lesions, and new brainstem lesions on follow up MRI (EDSS 1). A 16-year-old boy also had Multiphasic ADEM, with insufficient diagnostic criteria for MS. Of the remaining patients, 21 with ON regained good visual function, 1 of 16 with ADEM had epilepsy, and 2 of 7 with TM needed prolonged urinary catherisation.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Optic neuritis and ADEM are common presentations of acute demyelination in Singapore children. In our cohort, 3 out of 47 (6%) had recurrent demyelination, with 2 diagnosed as MS.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> In spite of MS having been diagnosed in Mongolia during the last 40 years, there has been a lack of information regarding geographical distribution and also difficulties in differentiating MS from other demyelinating diseases.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To determine the prevalence rate of MS in populations of Ulaan Baatar (UB) City.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> To study the morbidity of MS in Mongolia using statistical data; to determine the prevalence rate of MS using hospital-based design and following the “door-to-door” methods.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> MS morbidity analysis of five-year statistical data (2003- 2007) showed an average of 178 per 100000; morbidity level in both rural and urban settings was 7.0 per 100000; among them 43% were patients in the 30-40-year-old age group. According to our study, the prevalence rate of MS in UB City for a population of 100,000 above the age of 16 was 10.3; Rate of prevalence in females is 4 times higher than in males (15.8 vs 4.2); the highest prevalence rate in females was in the 40-49 year-old age group (31.3); in males it was in the 50-59 year-old age group (14.9). It is shown by the disease dominating middle-aged women and older men (p&lt;0.05). In our clinical study of 67 MS patients, the mean age was 41.79±8.76. The age at onset ranged from 18-50 years (31.5±9.2 for females; 37.3±9.7 for males).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The average morbidity rate of MS in Mongolia by statistical analysis from 2003-2007 data was 7.0 per 100,000 people; with a female-tomale ratio of 2:1. The prevalence rate of MS in adult populations of Ulaan Bataar for 100,000 people was 10.3; with a “chi”-square for females that was 4 times higher compared to males.</p>

<p><italic><sup>1</sup>Central Hospital for the SSC of the Ministry of Justice, Ulaan Baatar, Mongolia; <sup>2</sup>Health &amp; Science University Mongolia</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Although MS has been diagnosed in Mongolia for the past 40 years, much difficulty has been encountered in diagnosing MS clearly from other demyelinating diseases.</p>
<p>Objective and Methods: To determine the clinical characteristics of manifestations and correlating to MRI-findings using case-observed methods.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Sixty-seven MS patients with main clinical forms of cerebrospinal (55 patients – 82.1%), pure cerebral (4 patients – 6.0%) and pure spinal – (8 patients – 11.9%). Clinical course was relapsing-remitting in 39 patients (58.2%); secondary-progressive in 12 patients (17.9%); progressive-relapsing in 13 patients (19.4%), and primary-progressive in 3 patients (4.5%). The most common locations of first attacks were the pyramid system – 46.3%, visual pathway - predominantly causing damage to the optic nerve – 43.3%, followed by the spinal cord - 37.3%, opticspinal - 20.9% and brainstem – 10.3%. Pyramid, sensory and vision-dissociated symptoms were also reported in 77% of patients, and paroxysmal symptoms in 67% of patients. The MRI scan performed in 34 patients 50.7% determined dissemination-in-time 10(29.4%) and in-space 18(53%). On MRI scans in T2-weighted images, 16 hyper-intense lesions within the periventricular white matter were found (56.3%); 3 lesions in area pons and cerebella (5.95%); 13 lesions in spinal cord white matter (30,4%) and 2 lesions in nervous opticus tract (7.45%).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The main clinical forms were cerebrospinal (82%) and opticospinal, which formed more than half of the cases, in which relapsing-remitting (58%) and progressive-relapsing courses (19%) predominated. The relapsing and progressing course of the disease was directly determined by clinical symptoms and MRI scan findings of dissemination-in-time and in-space of existing lesions. As MS can be asymptomatic, it was found that MRI-findings were positive (11.8%) even when clinical manifestations disappeared.</p>

<p><italic>Director of Nursing and Faculty Member, Islamic Azad University of Boroujerd, Iran</italic></p>
<p><bold>Aim and Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis is one of the most common chronic neurologic diseases that affect motor and sensory functions.The disease is of unknown etiology and is more common in the 20-40 year-old age group. This study has been conducted to determine the epidemiology of multiple sclerosis in Boroujerd, Iran.</p>
<p><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> A descriptive study was conducted in 145 people (45 males and 100 females). These cases were members of the local multiple sclerosis society and Boroujerd residents. Data collection was conducted with a questionnaire and analysis done by SPSS 15.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Disease was more common in the third decade of life. Ratio of women to men was 2:2. The mean age of patients was 31± 6/2, 63% had university education, 78% resided in the city and 66% were married. Visual problems were reported in 47.3%. Sensory problems were reported in 36.4% and were the most common early symptoms.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Multiple sclerosis was more common in young adults, married people, those who resided in the city and those who received up to university education. With more studies conducted on this group we will be able to have a better understanding of the etiology of multiple sclerosis.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Prenatal and perinatal factors are believed to contribute to the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the mode of delivery, as a perinatal factor, affects susceptibility to MS.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> MS patients were recruited from the MS registry of the Isfahan Multiple Sclerosis Society (IMSS). Patients were asked for their mode of delivery and that of their healthy siblings through a specially designed questionnaire. Pre-term or post-term deliveries were excluded.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> This study included 1606 samples (516 MS patients and 1090 controls). The results indicated that the subjects who were born by cesarean section had a significant risk of MS (OR 2.052; p=0.005). There was a significant MS risk for females who were born by cesarean section (OR 1.972; p=0.033), while this risk was not significant for males (OR 2.208; p=0.067).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> It appears that that vaginal delivery as a perinatal factor may protect against MS. However, further largescale studies are required to confirm these results.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Infection with the bacterium <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> has a reported role in many disease conditions. However, it is relatively unclear if it has any association with the autoimmune, demyelinating condition Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Two conflicting viewpoints currently dominate the literature. A study in a Japanese cohort describes a lower <italic>H. pylori</italic> seroprevalence in Conventional Multiple Sclerosis (CMS) patients than in Optico-Spinal Multiple Sclerosis (OSMS) patients or controls (Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2007), suggesting a possible difference in prevalence according to disease phenotype. Conversely, a Greek study reports a greater rate of infection in MS overall (Kountouras <italic>et al</italic>, 2007).</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> In order to conclusively elucidate any correlation, enzyme-linked immunoassay was performed on serum from 551 patients with CMS from the Perth Demyelinating Diseases Database and 299 carefully selected community-based controls. Such numbers represent a much larger study than the Japanese (N=105) or Greek (N=29) cohorts.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The <italic>H. pylori</italic> seropositivity was found to be considerably lower in CMS patients than in controls, both overall (13.2% vs 21.4%) and in the subgroup which were age- and sex-matched (15.1% vs 21.4%).</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> This may suggest a possible protective role for <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in MS. Alternatively, such findings may indicate that <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection is a surrogate marker for the “hygiene hypothesis”, a theory which postulates that infection in early life is essential to prime the immune system and thus prevent allergic and autoimmune conditions in later life (Cremonini &amp; Gasbarrini, 2003). Further analyses will explore <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection with clinical, imaging and laboratory phenotypes.</p>

<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Chung-Ang University Hospital, Chung-Ang University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea</italic></p>
<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The initial demyelinating lesions in the optic nerve, PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts 15 spinal cord and brainstem coincide with silent brain lesions, and have been thought to be significant in clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) suggestive of early MS. However, the study on initial demyelinating brain lesions, without optic neuritis or myelitis, has not been clearly investigated. We aim to study radiologic features and the prediction of relapse in patients with initial demyelinating brain lesions.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We investigated patients with initial demyelinating lesions in brain magnetic resonance image (MRI), who were hospitalised and followed-up. Between 2005 and 2010, 22 patients were enrolled, and we recorded demographic data, laboratory and radiologic studies, and follow-up results.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 22 patients, 12 patients (54.5%) experienced a second clinical event showing additional demyelinating lesions in the brain (5 patients), spinal cord (6 patients) or optic nerve (1 patient), and were diagnosed as clinically definite multiple sclerosis. In particular, among 12 patients with initial demyelinating lesions in the cerebrum, 7 patients were found to have a second demyelinating attack during follow-up periods.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study identified that the initial demyelinating brain lesions including brainstem, cerebellum and cerebrum are also predictive of a relapse, suggestive of early MS, and early therapy may be needed for protection against disease progression.</p>

<p><italic>Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) is the first demyelinating event contributing to the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS). Incidence of conversion to MS depends on the population, duration of follow-up and therapeutic intervention. Information from countries with low prevalence of MS is lacking.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To evaluate the incidence and factors predicting a risk of conversion to MS in Thai CIS patients.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective observational study on 348 patients attending the MS Clinic at the Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Mahidol University between January 1997 - June 2010 was done. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of CIS upon first clinic visit were included. Information regarding presenting symptoms, signs, investigations, particularly their baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics and results of cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands (CSF-OCB) as well as treatment, was reviewed. In each case, conversion to MS according to the revised McDonald criteria 2005 was evaluated at 6, 12 and 24 month interval. Those with a follow-up period of less than 6 months, an interval of more than 24 months from initial symptoms to first clinic visit, no brain MRI prior to conversion to MS or baseline MRI done later than 24 months after onset, were excluded.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Out of 72 CIS patients, 42 patients were eligible. At 6, 12 and 24 months, 42, 31 and 19 patients were evaluated, respectively. The clinical presentations were optic neuritis (18 patients, 43%), transverse myelitis (12 patients, 28.5%), brainstem (7 patients, 16.7%), cerebral (1 patient, 2.2%) and multifocal presentations (4 patients, 9.5%). At 24 months, 9 CIS patients (21.4%) developed MS, 5 of which converted in 6 months. Using Barkhof criteria, predictor of conversion to MS was a presence of at least 9 T2-weighted lesions at baseline (Odds ratio: 9.3; 95% Confidence Interval: 1.5-58.0; P=0.022). No statistical significance was seen with other criteria. Nine patients had positive CSF-OCB, 4 of which developed MS within 2 years, whereas 1 in 22 patients with no OCB developed MS within the same period.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The overall conversion rate in Thai CIS patients was 21.3%. Presence of MRI abnormalities and CSF-OCB was associated with a higher risk.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> There are no prospective data regarding clinical isolated syndrome (CIS) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) in Taiwan. Objective: To observe the progression of CIS to MS (based on 2005 McDonald criteria), and determine anti-aquaporin-4 IgG antibody status, in Taiwanese patients.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients experiencing CIS regardless of MRI findings within 2 years were eligible for study inclusion. Baseline patient demographic data and anti-aquaporin-4 IgG antibody status were collected; neurological and ophthalmological evaluations were performed at study commencement and every four months thereafter. The average observation period was 11.6 months (min: 0.6; max: 24.7).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 154 patients were enrolled from 6 medical centres in Taiwan. Patients were mostly female (76.6%, n=118); average age was 38.7 years. The most frequent clinical observations on enrolment were optical neuritis (46.1%) and myelitis (31.2%). On first interim analysis, 17 subjects had experienced a second clinical relapse during the study period. Five (29.4%) patients had anti-aquaporin-4 IgG antibodies. First event comprised myelitis for 41% of patients and supratentorial lesions for 29% of patients. The up-to-date rate of conversion to MS was 11.0% and the average conversion time was 279.9 days from the first event. At baseline, 10 subjects (6.5%) were positive for anti-aquaporin-4 IgG antibodies; 4 (40.0%) of these developed a second clinical event.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Interim analyses from this first prospective, observational study of patients with CIS in Taiwan suggest a high incidence of opticospinal MS and/or neuromyelitis optica. Patients with positive anti-aquaporin-4 IgG antibodies were more likely to experience a second event within 2 years.</p>

<title>Multiple Sclerosis in Sri Lanka and a Regional Comparison 16 PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts</title>
<p>Senanayake B</p>
<p><italic>Institute of Neurology, National Hospital of Sri Lanka Colombo, Sri Lanka</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Like in most parts of Asia, Multiple sclerosis (MS) is uncommon in Sri Lanka. We reported the first cases in 2001 though few cases were diagnosed even prior to that. However over the last decade we have seen a significant increase in clinically definite MS cases in Sri Lanka identified by neurologists. This could be attributed to widening availability of MR facilities, expansion of neurological services and greater awareness about the condition especially amongst the medical community.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Clinical characteristics of 35 Sri Lankan MS cases were descriptively analysed. This is the largest series of MS cases in this country. All patients were diagnosed by a board-certified Consultant Neurologist using the revised McDonalds criteria.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Only 4 patients lived in a MS-prevalent country (US, Canada, Germany, Australia) for a long period, but that was in adulthood. All other patients have lived only in Sri Lanka. Caucasian ancestry was found only in one patient. There was no family history of MS reported in any patient. Average age at onset was 29.86 years (youngest 15 years, oldest 45 years). Patients were predominantly female (87%). Pyramidal and sensory involvement was found in 73% of the patients and the optic nerve was involved in 70% of them. Half (50%) had bladder involvement. Cerebellar symptoms were seen in 53%. Epilepsy and tremor were seen in only 6.6%. Significant fatigue was reported by 36.6% and pain by 26.6%. Devic’s type was seen in only 3.3% cases. The type of MS at the time of evaluation was relapsing remitting in 50%, secondary progressive in 26.6%, primary progressive in 20% and primary relapsing in 3%. MR brain was performed in all patients. 94% (33/35) satisfied MR brain criteria (Barkof) for MS. Periventricular /Dawson’s fingers (100%), Corpus Callosal (67.8%), Cerebellar (26.6%), Brain stem (40%), T1H Black holes (36.6%). GAD enhancement was performed in 65.7% (23/35) and 11/23 had active enhancing lesions. Spinal imaging had been performed only in 62.8% (22/35) patients and 17/22 had cord lesions. Only 67.5% (23/35) were subjected to lumbar puncture. Oligoclonal bands (OCB) were seen only in 5/23. Serum NMO-Ig G was tested in 2 patients with significant cord lesions. NMO-IgG was positive in one (at Mayo Clinic US) Visual evoked responses were abnormal in 16/22. High dose IV methyl Prednisolone had been used in 93.3% patients. Interferon beta (Rebif) was initiated in 5/35 patients. One patient in the series received Natalizumab in the US. Only 50% of the patients were fully independent at the time of evaluation. 26.6% were mostly confined to a wheelchair with an EDSS score of 7.5-8. 23.3% were walking with constant unilateral or bilateral support using sticks or walkers (EDSS 6-7). Most patients on wheel chairs have had symptoms for up to as many as 27 years.</p>
<p><bold>Comparison with regional data:</bold> We compared our data with 2 similar descriptive analyses from Northwest India and Pakistan. The age at onset, sex distribution, clinical characteristics and type of MS and level of disability were found to be very similar in all 3 series.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Western-type MS is the predominant form of MS in Sri Lanka and in the region. Devic’s type MS was uncommon in the Indian, Sri Lankan and Pakistani series. Although low OCB positivity in CSF could be a regional characteristic (similar in regional studies), poor detection methods used could have contributed to these results. In Sri Lanka only gel electrophoresis method is used. Iso-electric focusing (IEF) method is still not available. Even in India, IEF has yet to be perfected. However, the level of disability found was fairly high in our series and in the Pakistani series, indicating that the South Asian MS cases were not relatively benign compared to those in the west. The lack of funding for disease modifying drugs (DMDs) could also have contributed to the high level of disability.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Western-type MS with typical clinical characteristics and investigative findings occur amongst the native populations of Sri Lanka and other South Asian countries. We did not see any specific clinical characters to differentiate patients in our series or in the regional series from those in the west. Given the level of disability in MS, early detection and initiation of DMDs where appropriate is necessary.</p>

<title>Prevalence of Depression in Patients with Relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis</title>
<p>Iranmanesh F</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran</italic></p>
<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Several studies have reported high rates of depression in multiple sclerosis (MS) with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 50%. The objective of the present study was to ascertain the rate of depression in a group of MS patients in our country and to analyse the relationship with depression, gender, age and duration of illness.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> This prospective study was performed on 75 patients with relapsing-remitting MS admitted to Aliebne-Abitaleb Hospital in Rafsanjan (south of Iran). Frequency of depression, according to DSM-IV criteria, as well as demographic data were registered and analysed by chi squared test.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Among the patients 62/7% were female. 29/7% of patients suffered from depression. The frequency of depression was significantly higher in women than men (P-value&lt;0.01). There was no significant relation between depression and age and duration of illness.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Generally, our results show that depression is prevalent in patients with relapsing-remitting MS in our society, and this is more prominent among women. Early diagnosis and treatment can help to improve quality of life of these patients.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> For reasons as yet undetermined, the prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) has rapidly increased in Japan in the last 40 years.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To explore the relationship between the frequencies of susceptibility <italic>HLA</italic> class II alleles in Japanese MS patients and the patients’ year of birth.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> DNA was obtained from 146 PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts 17 MS patients who met the 2005 revised McDonald criteria but not the neuromyelitis optica (NMO) or NMO spectrum disorders criteria, and 367 healthy controls (HCs). <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> and <italic>-DPB1</italic> were genotyped by PCR-sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Compared with HCs, the frequencies of <italic>DRB1*0405</italic> (<italic>pcorr</italic>=0.0026, odds ratio (OR)=2.203) and <italic>DPB1*0301</italic> (<italic>pcorr</italic>=0.0011, OR=3.686) were significantly higher in MS patients, while those of <italic>DRB1*0901</italic> (<italic>pcorr</italic>=0.0003, OR=0.279) and <italic>DPB1*0401</italic> (<italic>pcorr</italic>=0.0294, OR=0.247) were significantly lower. Patients with <italic>DRB1*0405</italic> showed a significantly earlier age at onset, a longer disease duration, a lower Expanded Disability Status Scale score, a lower Progression Index and a lower frequency of brain magnetic resonance imaging lesions that met the Barkhof criteria than patients without this allele. In MS patients compared with HCs, the proportion of patients with <italic>DRB1*0405</italic> successively increased with advancing year of birth (p=0.0013). Among individuals without <italic>DRB1*0405</italic>, was significantly more common (<italic>pcorr</italic>=0.0059, OR=2.776) and <italic>DRB1*0901</italic> was less common (<italic>pcorr</italic>=0.0110, OR=0.295) in MS patients than in HCs.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> <italic>HLA-DRB1*0405</italic> is a susceptibility allele for MS in Japanese. The frequency of <italic>HLA-DRB1*0405</italic>-positive MS patients showing a younger onset age and a benign course has recently increased in Japan. This may account for the increased MS prevalence.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Genome-wide surveys have demonstrated that the human leukocyte antigen (<italic>HLA</italic>) class II genes are related to multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility. Moreover, the interleukin 7 receptoralpha chain (<italic>IL7RA</italic>) gene polymorphism rs6897932 has been found to be associated with susceptibility to MS in Caucasians and Japanese.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To determine if there is an interaction between rs6897932 and the <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> alleles in Japanese MS patients.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> DNA was obtained from 139 MS patients who met the 2005 revised McDonald criteria but did not fulfill the criteria for neuromyelitis optica (NMO) or NMO spectrum disorders, and 241 healthy controls (HCs). The alleles were genotyped by TaqMan® real-time fluorescence PCR. <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> alleles were genotyped by PCR-sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The frequencies of the C allele and the CC genotype of rs6897932 were higher in MS patients than in HCs (89.21 vs. 80.71%, <italic>p</italic>=0.0022, odds ratio (OR)=1.98; and 78.42 vs. 64.32%, <italic>p</italic>=0.0040, OR=2.02, respectively). Among the <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> alleles, the frequency of <italic>DRB1*0405</italic> was significantly increased in MS patients compared with HCs (<italic>pcorr</italic>=0.0036, OR=2.359) while the frequency of <italic>DRB1*0901</italic> was significantly decreased in MS patients compared with HCs (<italic>pcorr</italic>=0.0026, OR=0.303). Compared with <italic>DRB1*0405</italic> non-carriers without the CC genotype, the odds ratio for MS was significantly increased in <italic>DRB1*0405</italic> carriers with the CC genotype (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001, OR=4.53), but was not increased in <italic>DRB1*0405</italic> carriers without the CC genotype or <italic>DRB1*0405</italic> non-carriers with the CC genotype.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Our SNP-based association study of the <italic>HLA</italic> region revealed that the missense mutation rs422951 in <italic>NOTCH4</italic> was highly significantly associated with idiopathic demyelinating diseases in Japanese. <italic>NOTCH4</italic> is located approximately 0.4 Mb telomeric of the <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> gene and <italic>NOTCH4</italic> functions in antiangiogenesis.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To clarify the association of the minor allele of <italic>NOTCH4</italic> rs422951, G, in neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and non-NMO multiple sclerosis (MS) in Japanese.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> 191 non-NMO MS patients who met the revised McDonald criteria, 73 NMO patients who fulfilled the revised Wingerchuk’s criteria, and 330 healthy controls (HCs) participated. rs422951 was genotyped by a Genotyping BeadChip (Illumina, Inc.) for 516 samples and sequencing for the other 170 samples. The results of 92 samples genotyped by both methods were identical.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The minor allele frequencies of rs422951 were 11.5% in non-NMO MS, 17.2% in NMO, and 24.7% in HCs. The frequency was significantly lower in non-NMO MS patients compared with HCs (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001, odds ratio=0.40). The genotype frequencies of AG or GG were 21.5% in non-NMO MS, 31.5% in NMO, and 42.9% in HC. This was also significantly lower in non-NMO MS patients compared with HCs (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001, odds ratio=0.35). This protective association between the minor allele of this SNP and non-NMO MS was independent of the positivity of <italic>HLA-DRB1*1501</italic>.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The missense mutation rs422951 in <italic>NOTCH4</italic>, or other variant(s) in strong linkage disequilibrium with this SNP, confer resistance to non-NMO MS patients in Japanese.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is regarded as distinct from multiple sclerosis (MS). However, it is unknown whether the genetic backgrounds of both diseases are completely different or whether certain genetic backgrounds can contribute to the positivity for anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibodies in NMO patients.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To determine the <italic>HLA</italic> class II genetic backgrounds of NMO and MS.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> 121 cases who completely or partially fulfilled the 2006 revised NMO criteria were enrolled as NMO/NMO spectrum disorder (NMO/NMOSD) patients, while 146 patients who met the revised McDonald criteria but were not included in the NMO/NMOSD group were classified as non-NMO/NMOSD MS patients. Genotyping of <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> and <italic>HLA-DPB1</italic> in the patients and 367 healthy controls (HCs) was conducted by PCR-SSOP.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Compared with HCs, both NMO/NMOSD and non-NMO/ NMOSD MS patients had a significantly lower frequency of <italic>HLADRB1* 0901</italic> (<italic>pcorr</italic>&lt;0.0001 for both), whereas NMO/NMOSD patients had a significantly higher frequency of <italic>HLA-DRB1*1602</italic> (<italic>pcorr</italic>=0.0129) and <italic>HLA-DPB1*0501</italic> (<italic>pcorr</italic>=0.0019). Non-NMO/ NMOSD MS patients had significantly higher frequencies of <italic>HLADRB1* 0405</italic> (<italic>pcorr</italic>=0.0045), <italic>DPB1*0301</italic> (<italic>pcorr</italic>=0.0013), and significantly lower frequencies of <italic>DPB1*0401</italic> (<italic>pcorr</italic>=0.0185). Among NMO/NMOSD patients, the significant susceptibility conferred by <italic>HLA-DRB1*1602</italic> and <italic>HLA-DPB1*0501</italic> was found in the anti-AQP4 antibody-positive (but not in the antibody-negative) NMO/NMOSD population, while the significantly protective effect of <italic>HLA-DRB1*0901</italic> existed for both subgroups.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In Japanese, <italic>HLA-DRB1*0901</italic> is a protective allele, or is in linkage disequilibrium with resistant genes in both NMO and MS, irrespective of the presence or absence of anti-AQP4 antibodies. The susceptibility genes appear to vary according to the disease phenotype and anti-AQP4 antibody status.</p>

<p><italic>Department of Neurology, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) are both chronic neuro-inflammatory diseases believed to arise from complex interactions of environmental and genetic factors. Recently, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) of interleukin-2 and 7 receptor alpha genes have been identified as new susceptibility alleles of MS in several genome-wide association studies. However, similar research in NMO is rare.</p>
<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate the association of the IL2RA SNP rs2104286, rs12722489 and IL7RA SNP rs6897932 with MS and NMO patients in China.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> The frequencies of three SNPs were examined in southern Han Chinese MS cases (n=67), NMO cases (n=45) and controls (CTLs, n=133) using sequencing-based typing method. Pearson Chi-square tests were performed to compare the genotype frequencies among groups.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The frequency of G allele of IL2RA SNP rs12722489 was higher in NMO patients than in CTLs (<italic>Puncoor</italic>=0.024, <italic>pcorr</italic>=0.048, OR:2.089, 95%CI:1.125- 3.881). For the IL2RA SNP rs12722489, the frequency of G allele was higher in MS patients than NMO patients (<italic>Puncoor</italic>=0.047), but there was no statistical significance after Bonferroni-Dunn correction (Pcorr=0.094, OR:1.455, 95%CI:0.740-2.857). For the IL7RA SNP rs6897932, there was no significant difference among the three groups.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The G allele of IL2RA SNP rs2104286 correlates with risk of NMO in southern Han Chinese.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> The interleukin 7 receptor alpha single nucleotide polymorphism Thr244Ile (rs6897932) was identified as a multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility-modifying polymorphism in genomewide and gene scan studies, mainly in populations in western countries. <bold>Objective:</bold> To investigate the association of interleukin 7 receptor alpha rs6897932 and rs3194051 with MS in populations from Central Anatolia, Turkey.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 92 unrelated caucasian patients (71women, 21men) and 88 unrelated, ethnically matched healthy controls (48 women, 40 men) were included in the study. Genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP polymerase chain reaction.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> We found no significant difference in genotype or allele frequencies for rs6897932 (C/T) (p=0.145) and for rs3194051(A/G) between controls and patients with MS from Central Anatolia (p=0.146). MS patients and normal individuals have been differentiated statistically for polymorphism in comparison with education status (higher levels among MS patients (p=0.044), chemical threats (higher in MS patients) (p=0.009), familial involvement (higher in MS patients (p=0.038) and consumption of carbonhydrated daily foods (higher in MS group) (p=0.046) and fatty foods (higher in MS group) (p=0.02).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> It is known that demographics as well as environmental factors play a substantial role in MS development, as well as in a population genetic background. The results of this study indicate that other types of genome variants should be required for the development and/or progression of MS, which may vary among populations.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Genome-wide association studies have identified non-HLA genes that have concomitant, although modest, effects on MS susceptibility.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> The frequencies of 16 previously reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 10 genes (APOE, ICAM-1, CTLA-4, IL-2RA, IL-7R, CLEC-16A, CD58, TYK2, IRF5, STAT3) were examined in Caucasian MS cases (n=350) and controls (n=498) from Western Australia. Fisher exact tests and case-control logistic regression analyses were performed with adjustment for gender and HLA-DRB1 carriage.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> For the IL-7R I356V (rs3194051) SNP, presence of the major allele was associated with increased risk (adj OR 2.3, P=0.024). ApoE R176C (rs7412) was associated with increased risk among DRB1*1501- negatives only (adj OR 2.6, P=0.0005). An interaction (P=0.002) between IL-7R T244I (rs6897932) and an intronic CD58 variant (rs2300747) indicated a protective effect specific to their combined inheritance (adj OR 0.44, P=0.013). Similarly, the combination of an intronic CLEC-16A SNP (rs6498146) and CTLA-4 T17A (rs231775) was protective (adj OR 0.52, P=0.004; interaction P=0.012), but specific to females. The minor TYK2 P1104A (rs34536443) SNP and an intronic IRF5 variant (rs4728142) major SNP were individually protective (adj OR 0.13, P=0.005; adj OR 0.51, P=0.002), with a combined effect that matched the individual IRF5 effect (OR 0.50, interaction P=0.012).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The present findings indicate that a number of non- HLA SNPs in APOE, IL-7R, CLEC-16, TYK2, IRF5, CTLA-4 and CD58 genes have significant modifying effects on MS risk, confined within HLA- or gender-defined groups in some cases. The finding of interactions between SNP effects also supports their putative role as modifiers of common disease susceptibility pathways.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Genetic susceptibility to multiple sclerosis is strongly HLA-associated, including multiple Class I and II HLA associations in addition to the dominant influence of HLA-DRB1*15:01. These effects may be population-specific and may also be influenced by linkage disequilibrium within extended haplotypes.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To investigate risk-modifying effects of Class I HLA allele carriage among Caucasian Western Australian (WA) MS cases and matched controls.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> High-resolution sequencebased HLA-A/B/DR typing was performed in a NATA-accredited tissue typing laboratory. We examined Class I HLA associations in Caucasian WA MS cases (n=350) and Bone Marrow Donor controls (n=498) using logistic regression models incorporating potential interaction and linkage disequilibrium effects.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> HLA-A*02, HLA-B*44 and HLA-B*57 alleles were independently protective in the absence of HLA-DRB1*15:01 (adj OR=0.38, 0.31 and 0.42 respectively, P&lt;0.001, P&lt;0.001 and P=0.037), but had no detectable influence among HLA-DRB1*1501carriers (all OR &gt;0.7, P&gt;0.2). HLA-B*08 was protective only among HLA-DRB1*07 carriers (adj OR=0.11, P=0.004). Increased risk associated with HLA-A*03 and HLA-B*07 in univariate analysis (OR=1.37 and 1.87; P=0.05, P&lt;0.001) was attributable to linkage with HLA-DRB1*15:01 (adj P&gt;0.1). HLA-B*55 remained an independent risk factor (adj OR=3.10, P=0.05), while HLA-B*27 increased risk only among HLA-DRB1*15:01 carriers (adj OR=8.03, P=0.056).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We confirm the dominant risk effect of HLA-DRB1*15:01, but also note significant risk reduction associated with HLA-A*02, B*44 and B*57 alleles among HLA-DRB1*15:01-negative individuals. HLA-B*27 may further increase risk among HLA-DRB1*15:01 carriers, while the protective effect of HLA-B*08 was specifically within a HLADRB1* 07 context. These findings further support the important effects of heterogeneous HLA-restricted immune responses in conferring susceptibility to MS.</p>

<p><italic><sup>1</sup>Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore; <sup>2</sup>Department of Neurology, National Neuroscience Institute, Singapore</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica with its spectrum of disorders (NMO/NMOSD) are central nervous system demyelinating disorders, now generally regarded as distinct diseases. At present, comparisons between these two groups have yet to be performed in Singapore.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To characterise the demographical, clinical, radiological and serological features and treatment of MS and NMO/NMOSD patients in Singapore.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively reviewed MS and NMO/NMOSD patients from the National Neuroscience Institute (NNI) Neuroimmunology Database and Tissue Repository seen between 1989 and 2010.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Sixty-two patients (33 MS vs 29 NMO/NMOSD; mean follow-up 66.3 months [range: 4-256]) were analysed. NMO/ NMOSD patients had higher female preponderance (86.2% vs 66.7%, p=0.08) and higher mean age of onset (48.7 years [range: 22-66] vs 33.6 years [range: 19-57], p&lt;0.0001). Most common initial presentation was transverse myelitis in both MS (n=20/33) and NMO/NMOSD (n=12/29). Brain MRI scan at onset fulfilling Barkhof criteria was more common in MS (47.6% [10/21] vs 19.2% [5/26], p=0.06). More NMO/NMOSD patients had longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (75.9% [22/29] vs 37.5% [9/24], p&lt;0.01). Fewer NMO/NMOSD patients tested positive for cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands (13.0% [3/23] vs 68.2% [15/22], p&lt;0.001) while more NMO/NMOSD patients tested NMO-IgG positive (85% [17/20] vs 0% [0/14], p&lt;0.0001). Amongst patients on treatment, more MS patients were on interferon (71.4% [10/14] vs 4.8% [1/21], p&lt;0.0001). Amongst surviving patients, more NMO/NMOSD patients were on immunosuppressants (77.8% [21/27] vs 42.4% [14/33], p&lt;0.01). Twenty-five patients (19 MS; 6 NMO/NMOSD) were not on disease-modifying treatment.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Differences in demographical, clinical, radiological and laboratory profiles between MS and NMO/NMOSD patients in Singapore are consistent with published data.</p>

<title>Cognitive Profiles of Multiple Sclerosis and Neuromyelitis Optica Patients in Singapore</title>
<p>Ng A, Chin R, Kandiah N, Tan K</p>
<p><italic>National Neuroscience Institute (NNI), Department of Neurology, Singapore</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> A proportion of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients may have cognitive deficits causing personal, social and occupational dysfunction. Little is known about cognition in neuromyelitis optica (NMO) patients.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To characterise the cognitive profile of MS and NMO patients in Singapore.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients were recruited from the NNI Neuroimmunology Clinic from March 2011. A cognitive battery and self-rated scales for fatigue, apathy, anxiety and depression were correlated to demographic and clinical information.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Sixteen patients (11 MS[mean age=40.6 years]; 5 NMO[51.4 years]) were analysed. MS compared to NMO patients had higher average years of education (14.2 vs 13.0 years) and disease duration (55.7 vs 45.2 months), but similar disability (EDSS 1.5). Amongst MS patients, 7 (63.6%) reported memory difficulties and attention deficits, 8 (72.7%) language complaints and 6 (54.6%) slow processing speed. Amongst NMO patients, 3 (60%) reported memory difficulties, attention deficits and language complaints and 2 (40%) slow processing speed. Cognitive scores across groups were similar for MMSE (29.3 vs 28.6), MoCA (27.1 vs 28.4), Digit-Span (18.9 vs 17.4) and Digit Cancellation (24.0 vs 29.2). MS patients were slower on timed tasks: Colour Trail 1 (81.4 s vs 55s), Colour Trail 2 (138.7 s vs 92.8s) and Maze Task (14.8 s vs 11.4s). Both groups rated 5 on Fatigue Severity Scale; MS 30.1 vs NMO 29 on Apathy Evaluation Scale; MS 8.4 vs NMO 6.4 on anxiety sub-score and MS 5.5 and NMO 4.8 on depression sub-score of Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Based on analyses of a small sample, cognition in MS and NMO patients were not significantly different except that MS patients were slower in timed tasks. Recruitment and testing are ongoing.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> It was the aim of this study to determine the prevalence of anti-aquaporin 4 antibody (anti-AQP4 Ab) and long spinal cord lesions in neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and multiple sclerosis (MS) patients in Taiwan. Asia has a relatively high rate of NMO compared with MS. Anti-AQP4 Ab is an important marker for NMO worldwide, but serological data and clinical profiles of NMO patients in Taiwan have not been reported.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> This retrospective study compared the clinical symptoms, demographics, spinal cord lesion length and AQP4 Ab status of 34 patients with NMO with 34 patients diagnosed with conventional MS.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Our NMO patients were predominantly middle-aged women (median age 45 years), exhibited many relapses (1.0/ year) and displayed a higher Expanded Disability Status Scale score (4.75) compared to conventional MS patients. NMO patients exhibited long spinal cord lesions as detected by MRI. Forty-one percent of the NMO patients had detectable anti-AQP4 Ab. The Expanded Disability Status Scale score was significantly higher in PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts 21 AQP4 Ab- NMO patients.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The prevalence of AQP4 Ab in a Taiwanese NMO group was 41%. Long spinal cord lesions and detection of AQP4 Ab helped differentiate NMO patients from MS patients. Long spinal cord lesions with the anti-AQP4 Ab test may allow for earlier diagnosis of NMO and may improve therapeutic decisions.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Optic neuritis (ON) can be the heralding manifestation of multiple sclerosis (MS) or neuromyelitis optica (NMO). Anti-aquaporin-4 IgG (AQP4 IgG) is highly specific and moderately sensitive for diagnosis of NMO.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> This study was designed to assess (i) the rate of seropositivity for AQP4 IgG, and, (ii) short term outcome of patients presenting with single isolated ON (SION).</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A cohort of 41 consecutive patients experiencing unilateral SION (not fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for MS or NMO) was recruited prospectively. Blood sampling was carried out immediately after the diagnosis of ON and NMO–IgG was tested qualitatively, using indirect immunofluorescence kits. After primary clinical/paraclinical investigations, patients were followed for a short period (at least eighteen months).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The seroprevalence amongst initial ON cases was 9.7% (4/41). The short-term conversion rate to MS and NMO was estimated to be about 7.3% and 4.9 % respectively. The short-term conversion rate to NMO in initially seropositive patients was 50% (2/4), which was greater (p =0.034) than that for the whole cohort (4.9%, 2/41).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> AQP4 IgG seropositive SION patients are more likely to convert to NMO in comparison to the overall SION population.Such early differentiation between MS and NMO can influence early therapeutic decisions.</p>

<p><bold>Aim:</bold> To study the prevalence of NMO-IgG in patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO), transverse myelitis (TM), optic neuritis (ON) and multiple sclerosis (MS), in comparison with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients from 7 tertiary hospitals* were recruited with serum collection between July 2009 to December 2010. All diagnoses were according to standard criteria and collection of serum was in quiescent phase after written consent.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 64 patients were recruited, with 43 patients with demyelinating diseases and 21 patients with connective disease. 12 patients were NMO-IgG positive and 52 were negative. NMO-IgG +ve NMO-IgG -ve NMO 5 4 5/9 55% ON 4 6 4/10 40% TM 2 9 2/11 18% MS 0 13 0/14 0% Demy dis 11 32 11/43 26% SLE 1 7 1/8 13% SS 0 6 0/6 0% RA 0 7 0/7 0% Total 1 20 1/21 5%</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> The prevalence of NMO-IgG is 55% in NMO patients which is slightly low probably due to serum collection in quiescent phase. The prevalence is 40% in ON patients and 18% in TM patients in Hong Kong. ON patients with positive NMO-IgG tended to have more bilateral involvement or worse vision. TM patients with positive NMO-IgG tended to be chair-bound. NMO-IgG is useful in diagnosing NMO and may also help to select patients with poor prognosis for active intervention. * (Caritas Medical Centre, Kwong Wah Hospital, Prince of Wales Hospital, Princess Margaret Hospital, Palmela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Yan Chai Hospital)</p>

<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To evaluate the prevalence of NMO- IgG in patients suffering from recurrent optic neuritis and transverse myelitis and to study their characteristics.</p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuromyelitis optica (Devic’s disease) is an idiopathic, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. It was previously regarded as a variant of multiple sclerosis (MS). Patients with Asian ancestry are more predominantly affected. There are few studies regarding neuromyelitis optica (NMO) conducted in Hong Kong to characterise this particular population.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective study of 14 patients with optic neuritis and transverse myelitis in different local hospitals and with NMO-IgG titer checked. We identified a total of 11 NMO patients and their data were compared with the MS groups.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> There are 8 patients and 6 patients who tested seropositive and seronegative for NMO-IgG respectively. 22 PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts The seropositive group was seen to have longer segment of cord involvement (p=0.024) and poorer functional outcome when compared to the seronegative group. The NMO group was noted to have more patients with long segment of cord involvement, more patients with MRI brain not satisfying MS Barkhof criteria and also poorer functional outcome.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> NMO-IgG seropositive rate was up to more than 70% in NMO patients but non-existent in the non-NMO group. Thus, NMO-IgG is a useful marker for NMO. Long segment of spinal cord involvement is a distinguishing feature of NMO.</p>

<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To study the clinical features of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody-positive male patients.</p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an inflammatory disease of the CNS characterised by recurrent attacks of severe optic neuritis (ON) and transverse myelitis (MT). Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody is exclusively detected in the sera of NMO and more than half of cases are positive for AQP4 antibody. Female predominance is remarkable in NMO, so only few male patients were included in previously conducted studies. We report the clinical, laboratory and MRI characteristics of AQP4 antibody-positive male patients.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Serum samples were collected across Japan from 2007 through 2011 and tested at Tohoku University with the HEK-293 lineage cell transfected with AQP4 gene-based indirect immunofluorescence assay. Clinical data were reviewed together with the antibody results. Among a total of 1635 AQP4 antibody-positive Japanese patients, we identified 153 male patients, but we excluded two patients missing clinical information.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean age of onset in male patients was 48.6 years (range 3 – 86; median = 51). All patients were Japanese, with a female:male ratio of 10.7:1. ON was present in 80 patients (52.9%), while 137 (90.7%) had TM, 32 (22.5%) had hiccups and 27 (19.3%) had nausea. At the time of testing, only 69 (45.6%) patients had both ON and TM attacks required to fulfil the Wingerchuk’s 2006 revised NMO diagnostic criteria. The mean number of relapses was 3.29 with disease duration of 5.6 years (range 0 – 34; median 2) and median EDSS was 5.5. Brain MRI abnormalities were found in 36 (30.4%) and brainstem lesions were present in 23 patients (15.2%). Cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands were positive only in 4 patients (5.3%). From those 50 patients on whom we performed AQP4 antibody titration and other autoantibodies analyses, median AQP4 antibody titers were 1:1024 (range 1:4 – 1:262144); SS-A and SS-B were positive in 8 and 2 patients respectively (16% and 4%), and thyroglobulin antibody was detected in 6 patients (12%).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In our large series of AQP4 antibody-positive patients, 9.35% were males. Male patients appear to be older at onset compared to female patients and AQP4 antibody titers are commonly found at high levels in these patients.</p>

<title>Neuro-ophthalmological Manifestations of Neuromyelitis Optica in Asian Patients</title>
<p>Tan XL, Lim SA</p>
<p><italic>Department of Ophthalmology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) is a rare acute demyelinating disease that attacks the optic nerves and spinal cord in a selective manner. NMO has a poorer visual prognosis, as compared to Multiple Sclerosis (MS).</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> We report four patients with diagnosed NMO who presented with a variety of neuro-ophthalmological complications and outcomes. Methods: A review of the follow-up, subsequent management and outcomes of the neuro-ophthalmological complications of four patients with NMO.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The patients presented with a myriad of symptoms of varying severities. The most common manifestation is that of optic neuropathy. 1 patient also had extra-ocular movement abnormalities. Visual outcome was variable, ranging from complete recovery to no perception of light. Initial treatment with IV corticosteroids had varying success, with 2 patients undergoing further plasmapheresis.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The pathophysiology of neuro-ophthalmological manifestations in NMO is thought to be due to acute demyelination with subsequent axonal loss, leading to severe and sometimes irreversible neurological impairment. Distinguishing NMO from MS carries prognostic and therapeutic implications. Ophthalmologists need to have a high index of suspicion of NMO in women who present with recent onset of neuro-ophthalmological manifestations.</p>

<title>Intractable Pruritus in Neuromyelitis Optica</title>
<p>Xiao L, Qiu W, Lu Z, Wang Y, Li R, Hu X</p>
<p><italic>MS Clinical Research Center, Department of Neurology, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> NMO is an immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system, mainly involving the optic nerve and spinal cord. It was recently reported that NMO-IgG, an antibody in NMO, was an entity dependent of MS. Paroxysmal symptoms such as pruritus were often reported in patients with MS, but rarely reported in NMO.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To investigate the clinical characteristics of pruritus in NMO, and explore the underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective review of NMO cases between 1995 and 2011 from the Demyelinating Disease Database in Third Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University was done. All medical notes with documented “pruritus” or “itching” were extensively studied.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Seven (7/64) patients with relapsing NMO (RNMO) complaining of intractable, persistent and severe pruritus were identified in our database. It was clinically found that the itching area was larger than the skin segments innervated by the affected spinal cord in the individual. Pruritus was the onset symptom in one case. In other cases, it happened during the course of the disease, which accompanied relapses of optic neuritis or myelitis. The serum NMO-IgG was positive in five cases. Spinal cord MRI PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts 23 showed longitudinally extensive cord lesions in all cases, and periaquductal lesions in the middle brain were found in two cases. In all of the seven cases, pruritus was partially or completely relieved after being treated with high-dose steroids, carmazepine, and/or gabapentin.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Pruritus is not a rare incidence in NMO. Pruritus in NMO may be different from that in MS. If the mechanism of pruritus in NMO is related to the NMO-IgG antibody, an investigation may be warranted.</p>

<title>Assessment of Clinical Characteristics, Prognosis and Conversion to Neuromyelitis Optica in First-Episode Acute Myelitis: A Retrospective Study of 31 Cases</title>
<p>Kim SY</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Ulsan University Hospital, Korea</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Acute myelitis (AM) consists of extremely heterogeneous conditions such as infections, paraneoplastic syndrome, multiple sclerosis (MS), and neuromyelitis optica (NMO). Based on a Korean multi-center MS registry, the proportion of patients with NMO have been increasing due to the development of measurement techniques of anti-aquaporin-4 (anti-AQP4) antibody or NMO-IgG, and changing physician perceptions of opticospinal MS into NMO.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To identify the clinical characteristics and risk of development of NMO in Korean patients with AM.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> First episodes of AM were retrospectively identified in a single institution. Information regarding demographics, clinical status, laboratory work-up, magnetic resonance imaging of the spine and brain, and electrophysiological assessment were collected. Patients were classified into three groups, depending on their clinical course: monophasic AM, recurrent AM, and NMO (including NMOSD). We compared various clinical, laboratory and radiological features between groups.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 31 patients with first-ever AM, 11 (35.5%) were men, 15 (48%) experienced clinical relapse and mean segmental length of spinal cord involvement was 4.93. Eight (25%) out of 31 patients were finally diagnosed as NMO or NMOSD over a mean follow-up period of 45 months. 4 patients (one with recurrent myelitis, one with monophasic myelitis, and two with NMO) were seropositive for anti-AQP4 antibodies. NMO and NMOSD occurred predominantly in female patients compared to monophasic and recurrent AM. In the NMO group, the mean onset age was 43.5±11.8, which was significantly younger than the monophasic (43.5±1.8) and recurrent (43.8±14.1) group (p=0.018). Also, the mean longitudinal involvement segment of spinal cord on T2-weighted images was 7.29 and was significantly longer than that with the monophasic (3.25±1.125) and recurrent (6.43±2.936) groups (p=0.015).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In Korean patients with first-episode AM, the mean length of spinal cord involvement was longer than three vertebral columns with a high conversion rate to NMO. Factors such as being female, young age of onset, and longer involvement of longitudinal segment of spine, are also associated with conversion to NMO.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) predominantly affects women of childbearing potential. Therefore, how pregnancy affects the clinical course of NMOSD is an important issue.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To investigate the influence of pregnancy on NMOSD.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> 190 women with NMOSD from 7 referral hospitals in 4 different countries were enrolled. All patients were seropositive for anti-aquaporin-4 antibody. We performed a survey to investigate their gravidity, parity, and the number of relapses during the two years before pregnancy, each trimester of pregnancy, and 0-3, 3-6, and 6-12 months after delivery, respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Fourteen out of 190 enrolled patients developed the first symptoms of NMOSD during pregnancy (3 patients) or within a year after delivery or abortion (8 and 3 patients, respectively). Twenty six patients experienced 40 pregnancies after the onset of NMOSD: 26 deliveries and 14 abortions (1 was spontaneous and 13 were artificial). There was a pre-term delivery, however, there were no stillbirth or birth defects. For the 26 deliveries from informative pregnancies, the annual relapse rates (ARR) during each period were as follows: 24-12 months before pregnancy (0.38); 12-0 months before pregnancy (0.38); 1st trimester of pregnancy (0.15); 2nd trimester of pregnancy (0.31); 3rd trimester of pregnancy (0.46); 0-3 months after delivery (1.8); 3-6 months after delivery (1.4); and 6-12 months after delivery (0.62). The ARR increased significantly during the 1st and 2nd trimesters after delivery. Seventy three percent of delivery resulted in relapse during the first postpartum year.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Pregnancy and delivery may negatively influence the clinical course of NMOSD.</p>

<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Hallym University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Acute partial transverse myelitis (APTM) may be the first clinical manifestation of multiple sclerosis (MS), or relapsing myelitis, or remain a monophasic event. Identification of risk factors associated with relapse is important, as prognostic information might help to guide management. In comparison with longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), longitudinally short transverse myelitis (LSTM) is a syndrome showing short spinal cord lesions on MRI that involves less than three vertebral segments. It is not fully understood in terms of clinical features, MRI findings, and risk 24 PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts factors for relapse in Korea.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively defined clinical, laboratory and neuroimaging factors in patients with first-ever LSTM predictive of relapses.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> We identified 41 patients with a first-ever LSTM admitted to our institution from January 2005 to December 2009. The follow-up period ranged from 10 to 126 months (mean followup 30 months). LSTM remained a monophasic event in 21 patients (51.2%), with conversion to MS occurring in 15 patients (36.6%) and recurring as relapsing myelitis in 5 patients (12.2%). Factors associated with relapse in LSTM patients according to logistic regression analysis were onset age, expanded disability status scale (EDSS) on the last clinical visit and brain MRI abnormalities.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Onset age, EDSS on the last clinical visit, and brain MRI abnormalities are predictors of relapse in LSTM patients. These findings may have therapeutic implications for patients with LSTM.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> With accumulating evidence supporting pathogenetic roles of neuromyelitis optica immunoglobulin G (NMO-IgG) or antiaquaporin 4 antibody (AQP4 Ab) in neuromyelitis optica (NMO), NMO seropositivity is now considered to be a core defining feature of disease beyond a mere disease marker. Being highly specific but only modestly sensitive, NMO seropositivity cannot serve as a sole diagnostic parameter. Clinical or radiological features should be incorporated together as in current Mayo Criteria. A series of clinical and radiological characteristics of NMO are well-known, but rarely assessed in terms of its role in predicting NMO seropositivity in real practice.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We gathered predefined clinical and radiological data of consecutive patients evaluated for diagnosis of NMO in a single center and analysed their association with NMO serological status.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Out of a total of 153 consecutive patients were recruited (male:female ratio 1:2.36; mean age of onset, 36.2±7.5; 33 patients fulfilling either 1999 or 2006 Mayo Criteria), Twenty-three patients (15% of total cases; M:F, 1:6.7; mean age of onset, 38.8±13.9) were seropositive for NMO-IgG/AQP4 Ab. Forty-one percent of NMO patients (14 out of 32) were seropositive for NMO-IgG/AQP4 Ab. After multivariate logistic regression, factors associated with seropositivity were being female (odds ratio, OR=4.9), comorbid autoimmune or malignant disease (OR=5.2), longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesion (OR=4.8), and bilateral simultaneous optic neuritis (OR=7.8). Absence of CSF oligoclonal bands (OR=0.9), negative brain MR at onset (OR=1.6), and severity of optic neuritis or transverse myelitis did not have significant associations.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Although diagnosis of NMO is currently reached by a combination of clinical, radiological, and serological parameters, they seem to have different discriminative power. Accordingly, complementary clinical and radiological features should be weighted differently in the diagnosis of NMO.</p>

<p><bold>Objective:</bold> We investigated CSF findings and follow-up imaging features of acute transverse myelitis (ATM) patients in a local general hospital in South Korea to look at prognosis of ATM.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> From January 2000 to December 2010, 21 patients were registered at the department of Neurology of National Health Insurance Corporation Ilsan Hospital in South Korea. The CSF findings on admission and follow-up MRI imaging study were reviewed and analysed.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 21 ATM patients with CSF and follow-up MRI study were enrolled. Thirteen patients were male. Age ranged from 21 years to 63 years with an average age of 48 years. The location of lesions on MRI was cervical spine in 11 patients, thoracic spine in 9 patients and lumbar spine in 1 patient. The follow-up period of MRI study was from 3 month to 48 months, with an average of 10 months. The WBC cell count of CSF study on admission was classified as: group A (&gt; 5), B (1 to 4 inclusive), C ( 0 ). Among the 5 patients in group A, the MRI lesions of 1 patient disappeared, 1 patient showed much improvement, 2 patients showed some improvement, and 1 patient whose WBC count was 35, resulted in aggravation. For the 8 patients of groups B and C, almost all showed much or some improvement.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We reviewed the clinical features of ATM. About 57% of patients showed very good prognosis and 33% moderately good prognosis. However, about 10% of patients showed poor prognosis. The WBC count of CSF study may give some information about prognosis.</p>

<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Hallym University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) is a syndrome with extensive spinal cord lesions on MRI, involving three or more vertebral segments. It is rare in patients with typical multiple sclerosis (MS) in Western countries and is also regarded as a characteristic feature of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) in Western countries or recurrent myelitis in Korea. In contrast, longitudinally short transverse myelitis (LSTM), a syndrome showing short spinal cord lesions on MRI that involves less than three vertebral segments, is not fully understood in terms of clinical features, laboratory findings, and MRI findings in Korea.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively analysed patient demographics, clinical impairment at the last clinical visit, ancillary tests including CSF, MRI, and evoked potentials of Korean patients with LSTM or LETM.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> We identified 63 patients with first-ever transverse myelitis admitted to our institution from January 2005 to December 2009. The follow-up period ranged from 8 to 126 months (mean followPACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts 25 up 30 months). LSTM (n=41) showed less severe disability than LETM (n=22) (ie. lower expanded disability status scale (EDSS) on the last clinical visit, 2.4 vs 4.9, P &lt; 0.05). There were different distributions of clinical course, such as more MS cases (36.6%) in LSTM and less MS cases (13.6%) in LETM (P &lt; 0.05). In the MRI features, LSTM showed more limited lateral or posterior patterns (68.3% vs 9.1%), less contrast enhanced lesions (58.5% vs 95.4%), no low signal in T1-weighted images (0% vs 13.6%) compared to those of LETM (P &lt; 0.05).</p>

<title>Comparison between Idiopathic and NMOassociated Longitudinally Extensive Transeverse Myelitis (LETM)</title>
<p>Yi SE, Kim DH, Joo IS</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Korea</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> LETM is a syndrome with extensive spinal cord lesions spanning three or more vertebral segments on spinal cord MRI. Although many reports have found that LETM is a characteristic feature of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) in Western countries, the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with LETM are unclear in Korea.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> We classified patients with LETM by etiology and compared the various clinical, laboratory and radiological features between the etiological groups.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> After reviewing medical records and MRIs, we identified 58 patients with LETM who had been admitted to Ajou University Medical Center between 2002 and 2010.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 58 patients with LETM, 33 (56.9%) were male and 23 (39.7%) experienced clinical relapse. Depending on the etiology, idiopathic LETMs were most common (35, 60.3%) and NMO or NMO spectrum disorders (NMOS) were second most common (14, 24.1%). There was a remarkable predominance of men in the idiopathic group compared to the NMO or NMOS group. (p=0.00). The NMO or NMOS group had much longer involvement than the idiopathic group (10.4±6.1 and 5.7±3.9 respectively). Autoimmune antibody was more frequent in NMO or NMOS (p=0.001), but high levels of IgE and toxocara canis IgG were more frequent in idiopathic LETM (p=0.002). Idiopathic LETMs tended to relapse at the same site of the previous lesion, while NMO-related LETM did not.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> There is a big difference between idiopathic and NMO-associated LTEM. The findings that IgE and toxocara canis levels were increased in idiopathic LETM suggest the possibility of a new categorical entity.</p>

<title>The Iron Deposition Pattern of Multiple Sclerosis detected using Susceptibility- Weighted Imaging</title>
<p>Xu HB, Wang YH, Zhu CJ</p>
<p><italic>Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical School, Huzhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease with unclear etiology until recently. Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) and abnormal iron deposition have been proposed as possible mechanisms. The aim of this study was to demonstrate iron deposition by means of susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) in several gray nuclei and in the lesions.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Seventeen MS patients ranging from 15 to 48 years old were recruited, with a mean age of 29. A set of images using fully flow-compensated, three-dimensional, high-resolution, gradient-echo SWI sequences were collected. We evaluated iron in the following structures: substantia nigra, red nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen, caudate nucleus, thalamus and pulvinar thalamus. The measured values were compared to iron content threshold in these structures derived from our 42 normal volunteers ranging from 11 to 58 years old, with a mean age of 37.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 17 cases, 10 patients (59%) had at least one structure with abnormally high iron content. This abnormality is mostly seen in the SN and PT. The connectivity between the iron-containing lesions and a peripheral vein could be seen in 5 lesions of 4 patients in mIP imaging.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The abnormal iron deposition seen in some gray nuclei and the lesions of most MS patients provides further evidence of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency as a proposed mechanism of MS.</p>

<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Sixty-five adult patients with ADEM (n = 17), NMO (n = 23), and MS (n = 25) who had at least a demyelinating event and brain stem lesions on MRI were enrolled. Morphological features of brain stem lesions on MRI among these diseases were assessed.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Patients with ADEM had more brain stem lesions than patients with NMO (3 [1–6] vs 1 [1–5], P &lt; 0.001) and MS (3 [1–6] vs 2 [1–3], P &lt; 0.001). Lesion size in patients with MS was significantly smaller than that in patients with ADEM (8.0 [5.0–17.0] vs 10.0 [8.0–26.0] mm, P = 0.009) and NMO (8.0 [5.0–17.0] vs 12.0 [3.0–17.0] mm, P = 0.001). Patients with ADEM had a higher frequency of midbrain lesions than patients with NMO (94.1% vs 17.4%, P &lt; 0.001) and MS (94.1% vs 40.0%, P &lt; 0.001); patients with NMO had a lower frequency of pons lesions than patients with MS (34.8% vs 84.0%, P &lt; 0.001) and ADEM (34.8% vs 70.6%, 26 PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts P = 0.025); and patients with NMO had a higher frequency of medulla oblongata lesions than did patients with ADEM (91.3% vs 35.3%, P &lt; 0.001) and MS (91.3% vs 36.0%, P &lt; 0.001). On the axial section of the brain stem, the majority (82.4%, 14/17) of patients with ADEM showed lesions on the ventral part; the brain stem lesions in patients with NMO were typically located in the dorsal part (91.3%, 21/23); and lesions in patients with MS were found in both the ventral (44.0%) and dorsal (56.0%) parts. The lesions in patients with ADEM (100%) and NMO (91.3%) had poorly-defined margins, while lesions of patients with MS had well-defined margins. Brain stem lesions in patients with ADEM were usually bilateral and symmetrical (82.4%, 14/17), while lesions in patients with NMO (13.0%, 3/23) and MS (8.0%, 2/25) were asymmetrical or unilateral.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Brain stem lesions showed various morphological features among adult patients with ADEM, NMO, and MS. The different lesion locations may be helpful in distinguishing these diseases.</p>

<p>Dai YQ, Wang YG, Qiu W, Lu ZQ, Wu AM, Bao J, Hu XQ</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO) are both inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system. NMO was once considered one of the subtypes of MS, but recent evidence support NMO as an independent disease entity.</p>
<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate if MS is distinct from NMO on imaging features.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> The MRI data of 92 MS and 57 NMO patients were retrospectively analysed. All data were analysed by SPSS 16.0. P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Cranial lesions were found in 33 (57.9%) NMO patients and 89 (96.7%) MS patients (P&lt;0.001), but most cranial lesions in NMO patients were not consistent with MS lesions. There were few lesions with typical NMO features in both groups. Spinal cord lesions were found in 55 (96.5%) NMO patients and 29 (59.2%) MS patients (P&lt;0.001); spinal cord lesions were much longer in NMO patients, and more linear lesions were found in NMO patients.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Typical MS lesions were important in distinguishing the two diseases.</p>

<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To study the characteristics of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in Thai patients with seropositive aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Fifty-three Thai patients attending Siriraj Hospital MS Clinic with positive anti-AQP4 antibody (Sendai’s technique) were retrospectively studied. The available brain and spinal MRI findings in the hospital archive system were reviewed by 2 neuroradiologists and finalised by consensus. Clinical data and MRI findings were also analysed.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Thirtythree patients with available MRI were included. There were 32 brain MRI and 27 spinal MRI (26 with brain MRI) for the analysis. The mean age was 42.7 years old (range 17-81); 31/33 were female. Clinical diagnosis was as follows: Neuromyelitis optica:- NMO (9 cases), high risk NMO (8 cases), Multiple sclerosis:- MS (8 cases; 5 relapsing remitting MS, 1 primary progressive MS, 1 progressive elapsing MS and 1 opticospinal MS) and Sjögren syndrome (2 cases). At the time of data analysis, diagnosis was inconclusive in 5 cases. The interval from an attack to the imaging study varied from 1 day to 5 years. Follow-up MRI was done in 13 cases, mostly with more than 3 months interval. For brain MRI, 50% fulfilled Barkhof’s criteria, 25% showed corpus callosum involvement, 12.5% had brain atrophy and 15.6% had negative findings. Nodular pattern of T2 lesions were found in most cases and 13 cases (40.6%) had only nodular lesions. The remaining 43.7% had either confluent, patchy, or mixed pattern of T2 lesions. Brain lesions typical of NMO were found: Subependymal third/ fourth ventricle (37.5%), subependymal lateral ventricle (28.1%), and medullary lesions extending to the cervical cord (18.8%). Extensive hemispheric lesions and corticospinal tract lesions were found in 12.5% and 15.6% of patients, respectively. There were 43.8% patients with nonspecific pattern. Most lesions had cloudlike enhancement and vasogenic edema. For spinal cord MRI, gadolinium enhancement was performed in all but one case. Negative findings were found in 4 cases (14.8%) and positive in 23 cases (85.2%). Among the positive cases, 47.8% had one T2 lesion and 52.2% had more than one lesion, mostly at the thoracic cord. There were 15 cases (57.7%) with enhancing lesions, 5 cases (18.5%) with cord swelling, and 18 cases (66.7%) with long extensive lesion (more than 3 vertebral body). There were 13 cases (48.1%) with central cord location on axial plane, 5 cases (21.3%) with peripheral location, and 5 cases (21.3%) with mixed pattern. When comparing patients who fulfilled Barkhof’s brain criteria with those who did not, no significant difference was found between their spinal lesions. Typical NMO brain lesions were significantly associated with clinical diagnosis (p&lt;0.05) but not with length of spinal cord lesion.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> MRI findings in Thai patients seropositive for anti-AQP4 antibody had high incidence of typical brain NMO lesion as well as long extensive cord lesion as described in other Asian countries.</p>

<title>Brain MRI Findings of Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders: The Relationship with Antiaquaporin-4-antibody</title>
<p>JH Min, BJ Kim, KH Lee</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Samsung Medical Center, Sunkyunkwan University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> The spectrum of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) has been widened to include high-risk syndromes such as recurrent/ bilateral optic neuritis and longitudinal extensive myelitis (LEM), with the discovery of a specific serologic marker for NMO, NMO-IgG. Several brain lesions characteristic of NMO are also found in NMOSD. We investigated the relationship between characteristic brain lesions and anti-AQP4 in NMOSD.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively collected data from patients with LEM, who visited our tertiary hospital, from 2004 to 2010. Thirty-eight PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts 27 (M:F=15:23; mean age, 40.9±13.7 years) patients, who showed lesions in more than 3 vertebral segments in spinal cord MRI were analysed for clinical, serological and brain MRI findings. Anti-aquaporin-4 antibody (anti-AQP4) was measured by the cellbased assay.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Brain lesions characteristic of NMO were more frequently found in anti-AQP4-positive patients compared to seronegative patients; lesions involving corticospinal tracts (32% vs 6%), large extensive hemispheric lesions (32% vs 13%), corpus callosal lesions surrounding lateral ventricles (27% vs 6%), periependymarl lesions adjacent to the 4th ventricle (32% vs 13%) and cervicomedullary lesions (18% vs 6%) were found, but there were no statistical significances. Hypothalamic/thalamic lesions were not found in seronegative patients, although four seropositive patients had those lesions.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study suggests that brain lesions characteristic of NMO could not discriminate anti- AQP4-positive and –negative LEM. Further large-scale prospective studies are needed to elucidate the role of brain MRI in NMOSD.</p>

<p>Zhong XN, Wang HH, Bao J, Li R, Long YM, Lu ZQ, Dai YQ, Qiu W,Hu XQ</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Previous studies indicate a marked association of serum NMO-IgG with spinal cord LESC lesions and linear lesions. However, a comparative results of spinal cord MRI features, including LESC lesions and linear lesions, between NMO-IgG positive and negative patients remain unknown.</p>
<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To analyse the relationship between anti-aquaporin-4 antibody status and spinal cord MRI features of NMO-IgG patients.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Clinical data and spinal cord MRI scans of 52 Chinese NMO patients were reviewed. 8 patients were NMO-IgG negative in both serum and CSF, while 44 were NMO-IgG positive. Clinical and spinal cord MRI data were compared between NMO-IgG positive and negative patients.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The NMO-IgG negative group had more males as seen in a higher sex ratio (male/female) (p=0.014). On axial MRI, lesions in the NMO-IgG negative group were mostly located in the peripheral cord (50.0%), a result which was significantly different from that with the NMO-IgG positive group in which central lesions (54.5%) were more common (p=0.051). LESC lesions were common in both NMO-IgG negative and NMO-IgG positive group, and seen more frequently in the NMO-IgG negative group (p= 0.33). No linear lesions were found in NMO-IgG negative patients, while the NMO-IgG positive group had significantly more linear lesions (47.7%) (p=0.016). The percentages of LML, LMSL and LSL linear lesions in the NMO-IgG positive group were 27.3%, 11.4% and 9.1%.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> NMO-IgG negative patients may have different clinical characteristics compared to NMO-IgG positive patients. Diagnosis of NMO cannot be excluded even when NMO-IgG negativity and non-specific spinal lesion occur. Further characterisation of the precise actions of anti-AQP4 antibodies in anti-AQP4 antibody-positive NMO patients, and searches for other autoantigens may shed light on the pathogenesis of NMO.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily of proteins has a pivotal role in the organisation and function of the immune system. The TNF superfamily ligand LIGHT (TNFSF14) has been identified as an important co-stimulatory molecule expressed primarily on activated T cells and immature dendritic cells. LIGHT interacts with the receptors herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβR) and decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) leading to a wide variety of immune responses, including T cell co-stimulation, apoptosis, allograft rejection and chronic inflammation. The role of LIGHT in human inflammatory diseases is still largely unknown.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> In this study we examined LIGHT and HVEM expression in patients with the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> We found elevated plasma LIGHT levels in untreated MS patients at relapse, but these tended to decrease in the remission stage. Moreover, there was increased LIGHT mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of MS patients at relapse.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This is the first time LIGHT expression has been found to be dysregulated in MS patients, suggesting that LIGHT may play an important role in the pathogenesis of T cell-mediated inflammation and autoimmunity.</p>

<title>CD4+CXCR5+T Follicular Helper Cells may be involved in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
<p>Zhong XN, Wang HH, Dai YQ, Feng M, Xu W, Cheng C, Lu ZQ, Qiu W, Hu XQ</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Growing evidence suggests that CD4+T cells and B cells are involved in pathogenetic mechanisms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Treatment targeting B cells therefore provides benefits in MS. However, the relationship between the activation of CD4+T helper lymphocytes and B cells is still unclear. CD4+CXCR5+T follicular helper (Tfh) cells have recently been described as a novel subset of CD4+T helper lymphocytes and play an important role in T-B cell cooperation.</p>
<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To analyse the role of Tfh cells in the pathogenesis of MS.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> 16 consecutive patients with MS before and after a five-day high-dose IV methylprednisolone (IVMP) treatment and 11 controls (CTLs) were enrolled. Tfh cells counting was performed using flow cytometry, and serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-21 were measured by ELISA.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The count of Tfh cells in MS patients before treatment was markedly higher than treatment after IVMP (17.88 vs 13.24, P=0.004) and control group (17.88 vs 12.22, P=0.023). Serum IL-6, IL-21 28 PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts before treatment was higher than CTLs, and decreased after treated with IVMP.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Tfh cells may play an important role in the pathological mechanism of MS.</p>

<p><italic>Department of Neurology, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO) are both inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system. NMO was once considered a subtype of MS, but recent evidence support NMO as an independent disease entity.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To distinguish MS from NMO by comparing inflammatory and immune indicators. Methods: The clinical data of 92 MS and 57 NMO patients were retrospectively analysed by SPSS 16.0. P value&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In the acute stage, the value of ESR and CRP were higher in NMO patients (P=0.046 and P=0.001 respectively). There were 6 patients (8.2%)and 45 patients (80.4%)in the MS and NMO groups presenting positive results of NMO-IgG (P&lt;0.001). Three MS patients and 9 NMO patients had concomitant autoimmune diseases (P&lt;0.001); 14 MS patients and 14 NMO patients had other serum autoantibodies (P&lt;0.001). WBC counting and protein were higher in the CSF of NMO patients (P=0.019).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> NMO patients had a stronger inflammatory reaction and a higher frequency of concomitant autoimmune diseases and autoantibodies. NMO is therefore considered an independent disease.</p>

<p><italic>Department of Neurology, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China</italic></p>
<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate the clinical significance of oligoclonal bands (OCBs) for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) in China.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> 687 patients with neurological diseases were divided into 5 groups- 116 patients in MS group, 80 cases in neuromyelitis optica group (NMO), 97 cases in other demyelinating diseases group, 72 cases in other inflammatory neurological diseases group (IND) and 322 cases in noninflammatory neurological diseases group (NIND). Cerebral spinal fluid OCBs were detected in 687 patients using isoelectric focusing and avidin biotin-peroxidase complex technique. The results were compared among the 5 groups.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> OCB positive rate was 30.17% in MS group, which was lower than in other reports, 20.00% in NMO group, 18.56% in other demyelinating diseases group, 18.06% in IND group, and 2.17% in NIND group. OCB positive rate in MS group was higher than that in other groups; there was no significant difference in the frequencies of positive OCBs between NMO, other demyelinating diseases and IND; OCB positive rate in NIND group was the lowest.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> OCB positive rate is low in MS patients in China It is necessary to find more sensitive cerebral spinal fluid indicators for diagnosis.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) and Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) are inflammatory and demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). NMO and MS have some pathological and immunological differences which set them apart, moreover antiaquaporin 4 IgG (AQP4) is highly specific for NMO and can help in differentiating the two entities. NK cells are supposed to play a role in the pathophysiology of MS, but their role in NMO remains unknown. Objectives: To study the prevalence of different subpopulations of NK cells among MS, NMO (considering the AQP4 IgG status) and healthy individuals.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Four groups of patients were enrolled: (i) naive to treatment MS patients (n=28), (ii) NMOIgG positive NMO (n=12), (iii) NMO-IgG negative NMO (n=15) and (iv) age and sex-matched healthy controls (n=30). Peripheral blood was collected and PBMCs were isolated for FACS analysis. We used CD16, CD56 and CD3 staining. We gated for cells with the following phenotypes: CD3-CD56 bright, CD3-CD56 dim, CD3-CD16 bright and CD3-CD16 dim cells.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Our results showed that there is no significant difference for the expression of CD56 bright between MS, NMO+ and NMO- but all three groups had significantly lower levels compared to HCs (p&lt;0.0001). The mean percentage of CD16 dim cells was significantly higher only in MS group against healthy controls (p&lt;0.0001) and not in any other comparison. For CD56 dim the only significant difference was higher levels among MS group against healthy controls (p=0.001). For CD16 bright cells, MS patients had significantly higher percentage of cells compared with healthy controls and NMO (p&lt;0.0001).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We report for the first time, on the differences between NMO (considering NMO-IgG status), MS and healthy controls in terms of CD16 and CD56 expression on NK cells as measured by flow cytometry. Our results show no differences between NMO-IgG positive and negative patients and some differences between MS and NMO patients. These results may shed light on the distinct pathophysiology of MS and NMO.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> It has been reported that cytokines play an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> The PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts 29 aim of this study was to evaluate the serum levels of interleukin (IL) -18, IL-23 and IL-17 in Chinese patients with MS.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We compared the serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-18, IL-23 and IL-17 in 39 patients with MS and 39 healthy controls matched with sex and age. Serum cytokines were measured by FlowCytomix, a kind of cytometric bead-based assay. Correlations between the serum levels of the three cytokines and disability (expanded disability status scale, EDSS), disease duration, current age and age at onset were examined.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Serum concentrations of IL-18, IL-23 and IL-17 were significantly higher in MS patients than in healthy controls. There were no significant differences in the three cytokine levels between female and male healthy controls, while serum IL-18 level was observed to be significantly higher (P = 0.049) in male MS patients than in female MS patients. No significant correlations were observed between any of the three cytokine levels and EDSS, disease duration and current age. However, IL-23 was found to be negatively correlated with age at onset in male MS patients (rs = -0.775, P = 0.041).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data suggest that IL-18, IL-23 and IL-17 may be involved in the pathogenesis of MS. However, the relationships of the three cytokines and clinical characteristics of MS need to be further investigated.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system. Interleukin-32 (IL-32) is a new cytokine with pro-inflammatory immune responses in rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases. IL-32 is a cytokine that induces IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8 and other cytokines. These cytokines are associated with the pathophysiology of NMO.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To define the role of IL-32 in the pathogenesis of NMO, we examine IL-32α levels in patients with NMO and myelitis.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Relapsing NMO patients testing seropositive for NMO antibody, who fulfilled Wingerchuk et al.’s criteria, and patients with one episode of myelitis were included in this study. We measured serum IL-32α levels of patients with NMO and myelitis using a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique and compared results with that of normal controls.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> There were 5 patients with NMO (mean age: 48.00 ± 13.29 years), 9 patients with myelitis (48.33 ± 17.12 years) and 7 healthy controls (42.71 ± 17.58 years) in our study. Serum IL-32α levels in the NMO patients (35.95 ± 28.98 pg/mL) were significantly higher than those in the healthy controls (8.00 ± 5.08 pg/mL, p=0.042). There was no significant difference in serum IL-32α levels between the patients with myelitis (25.28±25.29pg/mL) and controls (8.00 ± 5.08 pg/mL, p=0.101). There was no statistical difference in serum IL-32α levels between NMO and myelitis patients (p=0.317).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> IL-32 induces IL- 6, which is an inducer of humoral immune responses and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of NMO. Our study suggests the possibility of IL-32 contributing to pathogenesis or immunoregulation of myelitis and NMO.</p>

<title>Systemic Autoantibody Profile of Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder Patients in Singapore</title>
<p>See AXY<sup>1</sup>, Peh WM<sup>1</sup>, Tan K<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><italic><sup>1</sup>Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore; <sup>2</sup>Department of Neurology, National Neuroscience Institute, Singapore</italic>.</p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and its spectrum of disorders (NMOSD) have been associated with systemic inflammatory disorders, in particular Sjogren’s syndrome (SS) and systemic lupus erythromatosus (SLE). Some neurological manifestations in these conditions bear high resemblance to those of NMO/NMOSD.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To characterise the SS/SLE autoantibody profile and its impact on clinical characteristics of NMO/NMOSD patients in Singapore.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively reviewed patients from the National Neuroscience Institute (NNI) Neuroimmunology Database and Tissue Repository who fulfilled diagnosis for NMO/NMOSD and underwent SS/SLE autoantibody evaluations, and compared autoantibody seropositivity to clinical characteristics.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Thirty-seven patients (32 female, 5 male; 24 NMO, 13 NMOSD) were analysed. Overall systemic autoantibody seropositivity was high: anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) (48.6% [18/37]), anti-double stranded DNA (17.6% [6/34]) and anti-Ro/La (22.2% [8/36]). The most common ANA titre and pattern observed was 1:640 (n=8) and “speckled” (n=7). Of those tested for NMO-IgG, 88.5% (23/26) were positive; 50% (13/26) of these patients tested positive for other systemic autoantibodies. Female preponderance was noted in patients with concomitant NMO-IgG and SS/SLE autoantibody seropositivity (59.1% [13/22] female vs 0% [0/4] male, p=0.0957). Mean age at index NMO/NMOSD attack was no different with or without SS/SLE autoantibodies positivity (46 v 46 years, p=1.00). Eight patients (23.1%) fulfilled diagnostic criteria of both NMO/NMOSD and SS/ SLE (nSS=6; nSLE=1; nSS&amp;SLE=1).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> NMO/NMOSD and systemic inflammatory diseases are commonly presented in the same patient and not mutually exclusive. Concomitance may influence the clinical course of NMO/NMOSD. Further analysis on the impact of systemic inflammatory diseases on NMO/NMOSD disease severity is being performed.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Despite considerable portions of patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) being reported to 30 PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts have co-existing anti-Ro autoantibody, the predictive value of anti- Ro antibody positivity for anti-aquaporin 4 autoantibody (anti-AQP4 antibody) test results among overall populations with demyelinating disease of central nervous system (CNS) is still unclear.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Clinical characteristics and test results for serum anti-AQP4 and anti-Ro antibody were assessed in 103 patients who were diagnosed as having demyelinating disease of CNS. Patients with anti-Ro antibody were also evaluated for meeting the diagnostic criteria for Sjogren’s syndrome (SS). Sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values of anti-Ro antibody positivity for anti-AQP4 antibody test result were measured.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Among 103 patients, 17 patients had serum anti-Ro antibody, 6 patients met the diagnostic criteria for Sjogren’s syndrome, and 23 had serum anti-AQP4 antibody. The positive predictive values and specificity of positive anti-Ro antibody test results for positive anti- AQP4 antibody test results were 76.5% and 95%, respectively. More than half (54%) the patients with both anti-Ro antibody and anti-AQP4 antibody did not meet the diagnostic criteria for SS.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Presence of anti-Ro antibody in patients with CNS demyelinating disease had relatively high positive predictive value as well as high specificity for positive results for anti-AQP4 antibody testing, regardless of presence or absence of symptoms/signs of SS. Further studies for the common mechanisms of these two autoantibodies might contribute to reveal their common pathogenic roles in neuromyelitis optica or SS.</p>

<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To examine anti-myelin antibodies in sera from patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and evaluate their clinical relevance.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We measured the titre of antibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, proteolipid protein, and myelin basic protein in frozen serum samples obtained from patients with NMO and NMO spectrum disorder (n = 17), multiple sclerosis (n = 21), other neurological diseases (n = 39) and normal controls (n = 30).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Frequency of anti-myelin antibodies in NMO patients (29%) was significantly higher than those in normal and disease controls (0%). CSF cell count correlated with the titre of anti-myelin antibodies. The presence of the antibodies did not correlate with the scores of the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), however, all patients with high titre of antibodies against myelin-antigens were scored more than 4.5 in EDSS. The antimyelin antibodies-positive group patients had other autoantibodies significantly more frequently than the negative group patients (mean 2.80 ± 1.60 versus 0.50 ± 0.96, P = 0.037 in Welch test).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Myelin antibodies may be useful markers to predict severe clinical course or poor prognosis in NMO patients as well as other autoantibodies and overlapping autoimmune diseases.</p>

<p><italic>Department of Neurology1 and Biochemistry2, AIMS, Kochi, India</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Low serum Vitamin D level has had an increased association with a risk of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Recent studies have also revealed that vitamin D lowers the risk of MS. Similarly, a higher rate of vitamin B12 deficiency has been seen in people with MS than in those without the disease. There has been no published data on the levels of these vitamins in the Indian population with MS. Hence, we decided to undertake this study to correct these deficiencies as it may have therapeutic benefits and would be very important in our country where very few patients can afford firstline disease-modifying drugs.</p>
<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To study serum vitamin D and B12 levels in patients with confirmed diagnosis of MS in the Indian population.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty-six patients (23 females and 3 males) with diagnosis of MS by modified McDonalds criteria attending the MS clinic in Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre (AIMS), Kochi, India, were enrolled in this single centre study. Serum vitamin D (25-OH) and B12 (cyanocobalamin) levels were measured in by electrochemiluminescence and chemiluminescence methods respectively in our biochemistry lab. An age-matched control group of 200 patients who did not have a diagnosis of MS and who were not on treatment for any vitamin D &amp; B12 deficiencies were included.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Out of 26 patients, 23 were females. The mean age of the study group was 32.6 ± 10.2 years. Out of these patients, 22 patients had diagnosis of RRMS, 2 had SPMS and 2 had clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Mean vitamin D (25-OH vitamin D) levels in study patients were 15.28 ± 6.7 ng/ml (range 20-32 ng/ml) and 18.58± 7.74 ng/ml in the control group. In our study group 76.9% had vitamin D levels of less than 20ng/ml compared to 65.5% of the control group. Mean vitamin B12 level was 539 pg/ml (range 189-883 pg/ml) with 38.2% having levels lower than 300pg/ml, which was closer to the lower limit of the normal range.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Serum vitamin D levels were low in the study population whereas B12 levels were within normal range. Our study was done on a small number of patients. However, it has revealed a trend towards low Vitamin D and normal B12 values in Indian MS patients.</p>

<p><italic>Department of Neurology, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China</italic></p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To determine the relationship between homocysteinemia (Hcy) and multiple sclerosis (MS) by conducting a meta-analysis and to find a possible mechanism.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> An extensive search for published studies up to May 2011 was performed in the electronic databases. Articles were identified using the Medical Subject Heading terms “hyperhomocysteinemia”, “homocysteine” and “multiple sclerosis”. The methodological quality of internalised literatures were valuated, screened and heterogeneity tested. The data were synthesised and analysed by meta-analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts 31 Twelve studies were included in this review, and involved 1420 subjects consisting of 804 patients and 616 contro. A meta-analysis showed that homocysteine levels in MS were higher than those in controls (standardised mean difference 0.91, 95% CI:0.51-2.01) The analytical result of sensitivity was coherent with the results of the meta-analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients with MS were found to have raised homocysteine levels, which may contribute to the pathological course of MS.</p>

<p>Iranmanesh F, Gadari F.</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran</italic></p>
<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Multiple sclerosis is one of the most prevalent diseases and is potentially debilitating to the nervous system. Some recent studies have shown the possible role of iron and TIBC in the course of the disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of serum iron and TIBC in patients with MS and to compare the results with a control group in Rafsanjan.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> In this study, serum iron and TIBC were determined in 30 patients with MS and compared with 30 healthy persons, whom were matched for age and sex. Data were analysed with software SPSS17 and statistical descriptive methods (mean- percentage, SD), T-test and ANOVA tests.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean age of both groups was 35.2. Mean levels of iron in serum of patients was 85.17 ± 38.39 mg/dl, and in the control group was 91.73± 27.90 mg/dl. Mean serum TIBC in patients was 352/23 ± 57/16 mg/dl and in the control group was 348 ± 78/65 mg/dl.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> There was no significant relationship between serum levels of iron and TIBC in the course of MS.</p>

<p><bold>Objective:</bold> Increasing awareness has been drawn to the kynurenine pathway (KP in multiple sclerosis (MS), for which abnormal levels of KP metabolites have been found. The KP may be involved in neurological deficit in two aspects: firstly, it has been shown that the first rate-limiting enzyme of the KP, Indoleamine, 2-3 dioxygenase (IDO), is involved in the immune regulation of inflammatory processes in the brain; and/or secondly, metabolites from the KP are associated with neurodegeneration. We hypothesise that the progression of MS is likely to be associated with the dysregulation of the KP metabolism.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Our studies involved quantifying levels of several KP metabolites in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients with early and late stages of diagnosis using HPLC and GC/MS. These patients had not received any medications known to interfere with the KP at the time of sample collection.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> We found that IDO is upregulated at all stages of MS compared to healthy controls. We also observed an increased production of excitotoxin, QUIN in MS patients compared to controls, implying abnormal alteration to the KP metabolism. Furthermore, QUIN was also present in active lesions of human MS postmortem brain tissue suggesting involvement in neurodegeneration in MS progression.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> All the above data suggests the significant involvement of KP metabolism in MS progression and the potential use of these metabolites as biomarkers to assess the severity of MS progression.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Kynurenine pathway (KP) is a tryptophan catabolic pathway that has been found to be dysregulated in multiple sclerosis (MS). Several metabolites of the KP have been implicated in both neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration of MS progression. Hence, full understanding of this pathway is essential in analysing its therapeutic involvement in MS progression.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced mice were treated with three KP modulators. Clinical disease severity was assessed and post-mortem end point analyses were performed by RT-PCR, HPLC &amp; GCMS for metabolomic profiles of the KP in the treated mice.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The clinical severity in EAE mice treated with the KP modulators was significantly reduced when compared with untreated mice (n=6/group). This phenomenon is associated with manipulation of the KP leading to the rectification of the dysregulated pathway.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> The results further support that dysregulation of the KP is likely to be involved in the progression of EAE and MS. Thus we suggest that the involvement of KP metabolites may have therapeutic implications in MS pathogenesis.</p>

<p><bold>Objective:</bold> Resistance exercise training is a useful method for improvement of motor function in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The aim of this study was to determine if a resistance training and vibration program has any effect on hormones in female with mild to moderate MS.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A controlled study was done in Isfahan from November 2010 to December 2010. Twenty-four female MS patients aged 27-45 years, with EDSS 2-4, were enrolled. The case group (n = 12) exercise program, consisted mainly of resistance 32 PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts training and vibration. The programme was conducted three times a week for 8 weeks and results compared with those of subjects in the control group (n = 12) that received no intervention. Serum samples of FSH, LH, estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, prolactin and cortisol were obtained before and after the end of protocol, during the 8-10 days of the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Descriptive statistics and co-variance were used in data analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> There were no significant differences between both groups with respect to changes in level of FSH (p=0.63), LH (p=0.27), estradiol (p=0.18), and progesterone (p=0.08), but a significant increase in level of testosterone (p=0.03) and prolactin (p=0.02) and also a significant decrease in level of cortisol (p=0.00), (P &lt; 0.05) were seen.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> As neuroprotective hormones, testosterone and prolactin have an important role in improvement of motor function in MS patients. In addition, decreased levels of the stress hormone cortisol after this type of exercise also demonstrate the positive effects of testosterone and prolactin in MS patients.</p>

<title>Evoked Potentials in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
<p>Ko KF, Lau WY, Cheng WK, Kwan MC, Yip LK, Yiu KP</p>
<p><italic>Department of Medicine, Kwong Wah Hospital, Hong Kong</italic></p>
<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Abnormalities detected with evoked potentials may appear characteristic enough, if not specific, for diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS). The distribution of pathologic lesions in oriental MS may be different from that of Caucasians. Against this background, the study evaluated the usefulness of evoked potential among Chinese subjects. Methods: Seventeen Chinese patients with MS treated in Kwong Wah Hospital of Hong Kong from June 2004 to June 2009 were entered in the study. Fifteen were women (mean age, 33.9; range, 17-57 years) and two were men (mean age, 35; range, 29-41 years). Visual evoked potentials (VEPs), brainstem evoked potentials (BAEPs), and median and tibial somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were performed in all subjects. Results: Fourteen (82%) patients had either an absence of VEP or prolonged P100 latency, (mean 133.7 (range 112-188.5) ms). The amplitude of the VEPs for prolonged P100 latencies was 1.7-12.9 uV, with a mean of 6.2 uV. BAEP abnormalities were detected in 8 patients, with 2 (25%) patients having increased I-III interpeak latency (IPL), 5 (62.5%) patients having increased III-V IPL, and 1 (12.5%) patient having increased I-III IPL, III-V IPL and I-V IPL. Tibial SEP was abnormal in 11 (65%) patients, and median SEP was abnormal in 7 (41%) patients. Conclusions: While abnormalities could be detected in the three modalities of evoked potential, VEP had proved useful in the detection of optic nerve lesions.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> The REbif FLEXible dosing in early Multiple Sclerosis (REFLEX) study aimed to assess the efficacy of two dosing frequencies of subcutaneous (sc) interferon (IFN) β-1a, 44 µg, in patients with a first clinical demyelinating event (FCDE).</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To report efficacy and safety findings of REFLEX.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients (FCDE suggestive of MS; ≥2 clinically silent brain lesions on T2 MRI) were randomised 1:1:1 to sc IFN β-1a 44 µg, 3 times weekly (tiw) or once weekly (qw; plus placebo twice-weekly for blinding), or placebo tiw for ≤24 months. Primary endpoint: time to McDonald MS (2005); main secondary endpoint: time to CDMS; other secondary endpoints included MRI and relapse outcomes.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 517 patients were randomised (171 tiw, 175 qw, 171 placebo). Baseline characteristics were similar across treatment groups. Over 2 years, both dosing frequencies of IFN β-1a delayed McDonald MS versus placebo: risk reductions were 51% (tiw; p&lt;0.001) and 31% (qw; p=0.008), with tiw more effective than qw (29%; p=0.009). IFN β-1a also delayed CDMS versus placebo (tiw, p&lt;0.001; qw, p=0.002). Over the double-blind period, sc IFN β-1a significantly reduced the number of combined unique active lesions; reduction versus placebo: 81% (tiw), 63% (qw), both p&lt;0.001. Proportions of relapse-free patients at 2 years were: 70.2% (tiw), 70.9% (qw) and 53.8% (placebo). No new/unexpected adverse events were reported.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> SC IFN β-1a 44 µg tiw and qw significantly delayed both McDonald MS 2005 and CDMS versus placebo, and showed benefits on clinical and MRI outcomes. Adverse events were within the well-established safety profile.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> The adjusted formulation of subcutaneous (SC) interferon (IFN) β-1a was developed free from serum-derived products to reduce immunogenicity and local reactivity.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To summarise studies investigating the efficacy, immunogenicity and tolerability of the serum-free (SF) formulation of SC IFN β-1a. Methods: A Phase IIIb study compared tolerability and immunogenicity of SF SC IFN β-1a three times weekly (tiw) in relapsing MS patients with historical data on the non-SF (NSF) formulation. MRI efficacy of the SF formulation tiw was assessed in relapsing–remitting MS patients in the IMPROVE study. TRANSFER assessed patient satisfaction during transition from NSF tiw to SF tiw. REFLEX assessed the efficacy of tiw or once-weekly (qw) SF formulation in patients with a first clinical demyelinating event (FCDE) suggestive of MS.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The Phase IIIb study demonstrated that PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts 33 immunogenicity was lower and local tolerability improved overall with the SF versus the NSF formulation. In IMPROVE, SF IFN β-1a reduced the number of combined unique active lesions versus placebo. Patient satisfaction was not affected by transition between formulations in TRANSFER. In REFLEX, the 2-year cumulative probability of McDonald MS (2005) was significantly lower with SF IFN β-1a tiw (62%, p&lt;0.001) and qw (75%, p=0.008), versus placebo (86%).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Collectively, these data suggest that SF SC IFN β-1a tiw is efficacious in patients with an FCDE or MS, with improved overall immunogenicity and local tolerability versus NSF. Efficacy of the qw frequency has also been demonstrated in patients with an FCDE. No new or unexpected safety issues were observed.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> In the treatment era, no definitive long-term data on the effects of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) on survival in multiple sclerosis (MS) are available. Objective: To assess the longterm effects of interferon beta-1b (IFNβ-1b) 250 µg (Betaferon®) every other day on mortality in patients with MS.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> The 21-Year Long-Term Follow-Up (21Y-LTF) study sought to identify the vital status of original IFNβ-1b clinical trial participants on an average 21.1 years after randomisation. The median time patients received randomised treatment in the original trial was 3.8 years (maximum 5.1 years) before open-label use of licensed DMTs. The primary outcome variable of this pre-planned analysis was allcause mortality. Patients were analysed by their original treatment assignment at randomisation using the log-rank test of Kaplan- Meier curves.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The vital status of 98.4% (366/372) of patients was identified, with 81 recorded deaths (22.1% 81/366). Original randomisation to IFNβ-1b 250 µg was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality over the 21Y-LTF period compared with placebo (hazard ratio=0.532, <italic>P</italic>=0.0173). Relative to placebo, the hazard ratio of death was reduced by 46.8% among patients originally randomised to IFNβ-1b 250 µg. Similar results were seen when comparing IFNβ-1b 50 µg with placebo.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Data from the 21Y-LTF study show a large and clinically important survival benefit for initial IFNβ-1b treatment versus placebo. While the near-complete ascertainment of this longest follow-up of any MS therapy strengthens the findings, this study should be replicated in another patient cohort, if feasible, with additional work to understand the biological basis for this finding.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Frequent self-injection of established disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) for MS could be a barrier to treatment adherence. RebiSmart™, an electronic autoinjection device for subcutaneous (SC) administration of interferon (IFN) β-1a, features a concealed needle, adjustable comfort settings and injection log.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To review studies evaluating patient satisfaction and treatment adherence with RebiSmart™.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> An international, 12-week, Phase IIIb user trial assessed suitability of RebiSmart™ in 106 patients with relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) who had received SC IFN β-1a during the prior ≥6 weeks. A 12-week, Phase IV UK study assessed ratings of RebiSmart™ from 63 RRMS patients. Two Phase IV studies assessed treatment adherence: BRIDGE (12-week Italian study; 120 RRMS patients who switched to SC IFN β-1a using RebiSmart™, from another DMD/injection system); MEASURE (ongoing, 96-week Canadian study in relapsing MS patients).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In the user trial at week 12, 71.6% of patients found RebiSmart™ ‘suitable’/‘very suitable’ for self-injection; most rated the device features as ‘useful’/‘very useful’ (80.8–95.2% by feature) and device functions as ‘easy’/‘very easy’ (95.2%). RebiSmart™ was liked by 91.5% of patients in the UK study, and was rated as ‘easy’/‘very easy’ to use by 96.6%. Treatment adherence, as recorded by RebiSmart™, was high: 87.5% of patients during the BRIDGE study and 92.3% at 24 weeks in MEASURE had ≥80% adherence.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> RebiSmart™ was well-received and considered beneficial by patients with relapsing MS, reflected by high rates of treatment adherence recorded objectively by the device’s injection history log. Such effects on adherence may improve clinical outcomes.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Treatment with fingolimod resulted in a significant reduction of brain volume (BV) loss versus placebo.</p>
<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We evaluated the effect of fingolimod on the percentage brain volume change (PBVC) in RRMS patients stratified by baseline inflammatory activity status in the FREEDOMS study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients receiving once-daily fingolimod 0.5mg (n=425), 1.25mg (n=429) or placebo (n=418) for 2 years were stratified by baseline gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesion status (presence Gd+, n=482 or absence Gd-, n=782) that was obtained using the Structural 34 PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts Image Evaluation of Normalised Atrophy method at baseline and months 6, 12 and 24.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Overall BV decreased more rapidly in Gd+ vs. Gd- patients. PBVC for Gd+ patients on fingolimod 0.5mg was comparable to placebo after 6 months (-0.51% vs -0.54%, p=0.09) and 12 months (-0.89% vs. -0.97%, p=0.16), but significantly lower after 24 months (-1.33% vs -1.90%, p=0.01). For Gd- patients on fingolimod 0.5mg, a slower rate of decline in BV was observed versus placebo at 6 months (-0.05% vs 0.23%, p=0.01), 12 months (-0.26% vs -0.47%, p=0.06) and 24 months (-0.55% vs -0.98%, p=0.002). The PBVC reduction was not significant between months 6-12; however, significant for months 12-24 compared to placebo irrespective of Gd status (Gd+, -0.51% vs -0.92%, p&lt;0.001; Gd-, 0.28% vs -0.53%, p=0.002).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Fingolimod significantly reduced PBVC irrespective of baseline inflammatory activity. The significantly slower decline in BV as early as 6 months in Gd- patients, overall (months 0-24) and during months 12-24 (both Gd+ and Gdpatients), demonstrates that fingolimod effects on PBVC can occur early and are continuous during treatment.</p>

<title>Discontinuation of Natalizumab in Multiple Sclerosis - Outcome with Different Therapeutical Approaches</title>
<p>Haas J, Richter S, Stewin F, Chatzopoulos M</p>
<p><italic>Jewish Hospital Berlin, Teaching Hospital of Charite, Germany</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Since 2006, natalizumab has been licensed in Germany for relapsing – remitting MS as second-line therapy or as first-line after severe relapses. Since 2006, 237 (8.8%) MS patients out of 2651 who started with natalizumab have been in our hospital. At present, 90 patients have discontinued due to different reasons.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> In our database MSDOC, baseline data and the course of the disease have been documented prospectively.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Reasons for discontinuation include patient decision (n=42), side effects (n=11), neutralising antibodies (n=3), secondary progressive course (n=7), ongoing disease activity (n=19), testing positive for JC virus antibodies, 24-month treatment (n=5) and pregnancy (n=3). Depending on the course of disease, therapeutical recommendations were: a free interval concerning a new immunmodulatory therapy (n=64), immediate deescalation with glatirameracetate (n=8), interferon-β (n=7) or immunoglobulins (n=11). In the case of ongoing activity after an interval of at least one month, an escalating therapy with plasmapheresis (n=3), mitoxantrone (n=5), rituximab (n=1), alemtuzumab (n=1), ciclophosphamide (n=2) or a recent switch after a 3-month natalizumab-free interval to fingolimod (n=10) was recommended.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Concerning the therapeutical free interval, our first data revealed a three-fold higher risk for relapses in patients without deescalating therapy in the first six months after stopping natalizumab. Further analysis will be done.</p>

<title>Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Iranian Multiple Sclerosis Patients</title>
<p>Harirchian MH, Sahraian MA, Hosseinkhani A</p>
<p><italic>Tehran University of Medical Science, Iran</italic></p>
<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most frequent neurological cause of disability in young adults. Present therapeutic strategies for MS reduce inflammation, but are not effective in the progressive phase of the disease. Many MS patients worldwide use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments to help control their MS and treat their symptoms and some of them report some benefit from these therapies. We evaluated the frequency of CAM usage in patients referred to our MS clinic.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> 119 definite MS patients took part in our cross-sectional investigation and filled our questionnaire. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Sixty percent of patients agreed with usage of CAM. Forty-two percent of patients have used CAM during their disease; of these 41% and 18% reported some benefit, or worsening of their disease respectively and 41% believed that there was no change. These methods of treatment have been used more frequently in highly-educated patients. Yoga was the most frequent CAM that was used and oxygen therapy has been reported as the most beneficial.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Low efficacy, side effects or cost of the approved drugs for MS could be the cause of acceptance of the CAMs by patients. Further research about the efficacy of single CAM therapies on the special outcomes such as quality of life; symptom severity; relapse rates; and disease progression could be done.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease that can lead to both sensory and motor dysfunction and thus contributes to problems with balance, coordination, postural control, and walking mechanics. During the last decade there has been powerful evidence showing the advantages of exercise in different aspects of lives of MS patients.</p>
<p><bold>Aim:</bold> To evaluate the effectiveness of 8- week resistance training on motor function, muscle strength, balance and perceived disability in male patients with MS compared to a control group.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> 20 individuals affected by MS (all male) (mean ± SD, age: 34.05±7.8y; BMI: 67.83±11.5 kg/m2 EDSS score: 2.94±1.5) were recruited from the volunteers in the Iranian MS Society. The patients were randomised either to the exercise group (group E) or to the control group (group C). For eight weeks, group E participated in a three times-weekly resistance-training programme (both upper and lower extremities) with 24-hour rest between consecutive exercise sessions, while group C was advised not to change their physical activity habits. All initial measures (including EDSS, balance, muscular strength, and functional mobility) were re-evaluated at the end of programme. Subjects could continue using MS diseasemodifying drugs.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Two subjects of the exercise group left the programme for personal reasons. Another 8 subjects completed the programme (16 sessions) with no MS-related exacerbations or other complications. There was significant change in all aspects of Ambulatory Function [<italic>10-metre timed walk test</italic> (p=0.082), <italic>Three minutes step test</italic> (p=0.001), <italic>Timed Up and Go test</italic> (p=0.009)], PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts 35 Muscular Strength (p=0.000), and Disease Progression (due to EDSS) (p=0.014). However, no significant change was seen in “Balance” which compared two groups (p=0.407).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The resistance training programme was well-tolerated in MS patients and may be an effective intervention strategy for improving functional ability and muscular strength in moderately affected persons with RRMS.</p>

<title>Effects of Adjunct Low-dose Vitamin D on Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Progression: Preliminary Findings of a Randomised, Placebocontrolled Trial</title>
<p>Shaygannejad V, Ashtari F, Janghorbani M</p>
<p><italic>Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (IUMS), Isfahan Neuroscience Research Center (INRC), Iran</italic></p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> The aim of this preliminary study was to evaluate the effect of low-dose oral vitamin D in combination with current disease-modifying therapy on the prevention of progression of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A phase II double-blind placebo-controlled randomised clinical trial conducted between October 2007 and October 2008 included 50 patients, with confirmed RRMS (aged 25 to 57 years) and normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. They were randomly allocated to receive 12 months of treatment with either escalating calcitriol doses up to 0.5 µ g/day or placebo combined with disease-modifying therapy. Response to treatment was assessed at eight-week intervals. Primary and secondary outcome measures were number of relapses and changes in mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In both groups, the mean relapse rate decreased significantly (P&lt;0.001). In the 25 patients treated with placebo, the mean (SD) EDSS increased from 1.70 (1.21) at baseline to 1.94 (1.41) at the end of the study period (P&lt;0.01). After 12 months, the vitamin D group appeared to have fewer relapse events compared to control. Average EDSS at the end of the trial did not differ between groups (mean difference, -0.31; 95% CI, -0.94, 0.32).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Adding low-dose vitamin D to routine disease modifying-therapy is safe. The mean EDSS score was significantly higher in the placebo group. A larger phase-III multicentre study of vitamin D in RRMS is warranted to better assess the efficacy of this intervention.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients are common and potentially very disabling. Furthermore, therapeutic response to anti-cholinergic drugs is often poor. Good clinical efficacy of injections of botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) into detrusor muscle in patients with OAB symptoms after spinal cord injury has been proven. However, actual experience with this treatment in MS patients is rare.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To evaluate efficacy and tolerability of injections of BTX-A into detrusor muscle in MS patients with OAB symptoms not responsive to routine anticholinergic therapy.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> 12 women with MS were selected for the treatment with injections of BTX-A into detrusor muscle. Previously, all of them had been unsuccessfully treated with at least two different anti-cholinergic drugs. Before the treatment, the voiding diary containing episodes of urgencies, frequencies and incontinence was evaluated. EDSS score of the patients and disease course were also evaluated. BTX-A was injected directly into 40 different sites of muscle tissue of detrusor, 10 IU into each site. The voiding diary with the same parameters as before treatment was also evaluated 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 months after treatment. Urodynamic parameters – maximal cystometric capacity and detrusor filling pressure were also obtained in the same periods.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The voiding diary data indicate excellent clinical efficacy of injections of BTX-A into detrusor muscle with notable decrease of episodes of urgencies, frequencies and incontinence in all periods of evaluation up to 12 months compared to the same parameters before treatment. The duration of efficacy of treatment was at least 12 months with some decrease at month 15 after therapy. Urodynamic parameters – maximal cystometric capacity and detrusor filling pressure were also notably better for up to at least one year after therapy.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We consider treatment of OAB symptoms in MS patients unresponsive to routine anticholinergic therapy, with injections of BTX-A into detrusor muscle, highly effective and safe.</p>

<title>The Challenges of Initiation of Therapy and Sources of Funding in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis and other Demyelinating Disorders at a Single Tertiary Referral Center in Malaysia: A Prospective and Retrospective Look</title>
<p>Viswanathan S, Puvanarajah SD, Rafia MH</p>
<p><italic>Kuala Lumpur Hospital Malaysia, Malaysia</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> The management of patients with Multiple Sclerosis and other demyelinating disorders continues to be challenging.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is part of an ongoing prospective cross-sectional study collecting registry data from 2005 to 2011 which assesses challenges of initiating treatment looking at patient willingness to start treatment, accessibility, availability and sustainability of treatment and sources of treatment: Governmental, nongovernmental, self-funded or insurance. Diagnostic and therapeutic challenges were not addressed.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Out of 120 patients, 80% were females and 20% were males, with 58.3% Malay, 18.3% Chinese, 21.0% Indians and 1.7% others, with a mean age of 31.1 years and 70% with Classical Western MS. 30% of patients had Neuromyelitis Optica /Neuromyelitis Optica spectrum disorder. Types of therapies included interferons, toxantrone, azathioprine, mychophenolate mofetil IV IG and rituximab. Out of 86 patients with MS, just over 50% were on treatment, with a third not on treatment. Of these, 13% were not keen on treatment. More than 90% of patients with NMO were on treatment with 3 patients not on treatment due to lack of response and having passed away. Amongst the causes of reluctance for treatment were needle 36 PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts phobia, fear of being a financial burden to the family, reluctance to accept the diagnosis, fear of side effects and dependence on therapy as well as social belief in traditional alternative therapy. Amongst the 87% who started therapy, drop-out rate was 15%, due to lack of continued funding, increased side effects such as depression, increased spasticity, allergic reactions, intolerable flulike symptoms, poor compliance and lack of response. Fundingwise, most patients were supported by the Kuala Lumpur Hospital Pharmacy drug quota, governmental ministries, Ministry of Health Patient Assistance Fund (32%) and various nongovernmental organisations. With regard to sustainability of treatment, more than two-thirds had therapy interruption due to a 6-monthly renewal process and to a lesser extent, following side effects and lack of patient-perceived effectiveness or lack of response clinical response, with increased relapse rate.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Management of MS in Malaysia involves unique issues with regard to initiation of therapy, accessibility, continuation and sustainability of treatment. A better mechanism towards improving patient awareness and treatment is needed.</p>

<title>Efficacy of Plasmapheresis for the Treatment of Acute Attacks of Neuromyelitis Optica</title>
<p>Kim SH, Kim WJ, Li XF, Kim HJ</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Research Institute and Hospital of National Cancer Center, Korea</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> The anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody mediated autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) suggests a possible role for plasmapheresis (PLEX) in patients with NMO.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To evaluate the efficacy of PLEX for acute attacks of NMO and its relation with anti-AQP4 antibody levels.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We reviewed 19 patients with NMO (n=12) or NMO spectrum disorder (NMOSD, n=7) who were treated with PLEX for acute attacks that failed to respond to high-dose steroid therapy. Primary outcome was functional improvement at 6 months and secondary outcome were the changes in anti-AQP4 antibody levels following PLEX.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The median age at the time of PLEX was 41 years with median disease duration of 3.6 years. The median interval from the index attack to PLEX was 18 days. PLEX was followed by significant improvement in 84% of patients after 6 months. Anti- AQP4 antibody levels declined after PLEX in 83% of seropositive patients, consistent with clinical response. Other patients who sustained high levels of anti-AQP4 antibody following PLEX did not show significant clinical improvement. The decline of anti- AQP4 antibody after PLEX or seronegative status before PLEX was associated with functional improvement of 6 months after PLEX (OR = 3.0; 95% CI, 0.606-14.864; p=0.033).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data suggest that PLEX is a useful rescue therapy for acute attacks of NMO when steroid therapy is insufficient. PLEX is effective in lowering anti-AQP4 antibody levels, which appears relevant to therapeutic efficacy.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Although oral prednisolone (PSL) and other immunosuppressants are widely used for the prevention of relapses in neuromyelitis optica (NMO), the ideal treatment has yet to be established.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To analyse direct effects of immunosuppressants on peripheral B cells of NMO patients, especially concerning immunoglobulin (Ig) production.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Purified B cells of NMO patients were stimulated with IL-6, BAFF, IL-10, and IL-15, and cultivated for 7 days. B cell viability and the ratio of differentiated Ig-secreting cells (ISC), defined as CD27-high, CD38-high positive B cells, were measured by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur®). Total IgG in supernatants was measured by ELISA. Direct effects of PSL, mycophenolic acid (MPA), azathioprine (AZP), mizoribine (MZB), and cyclosporine (CySA) on B cell differentiation and antibody production were analysed in vitro.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> PSL decreased cell viability but increased the ratio of ISC. MPA decreased all parameters, B cell viability, the ratio of ISC (p&lt;0.05), and IgG production. AZP decreased only the ratio of ISC and IgG production. MZR mildly decreased only the ratio of ISC. CySA decreased only the ratio of ISC and IgG production.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Stimulating B cells with the four cytokines increased B cell viability, induced B cell differentiation into ISC, and increased antibody production. Immuno-suppresants directly inhibited the effects of these cytokines on B cells. Among them, MPA seemed to be most effective in suppressing B cell differentiation, leading to autoantibody production.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an inflammatory disease characterised by severe optic neuritis and transverse myelitis, and is often accompanied by severe motor and sensory disability. The Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in NMO has not been evaluated in detail.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To evaluate the HRQoL in NMO.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We evaluated the HRQoL of 22 consecutive patients with NMO at the outpatient clinic of Tohoku University Hospital by Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), Euroqol 5D (EQ-5D) and Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis (FAMS). Thirty seven patients with consecutive Multiple Sclerosis (MS) were also analysed as controls. The definition of NMO was set as patients who met Wingerchuk 2006 criteria or who were anti-aquaporin-4 antibody-positive. The definition of MS was as per McDonald Classification 2005.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> SF-36 scores were lower both in NMO and MS than Japanese- Norm in all domains. In comparison between NMO and MS, the SF-36 scores were lower in NMO than in MS in all domains. After PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts 37 Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting age, gender, onset age and DSS scores, the difference was significant only in Bodily Pain (p=0.03). The HRQoL scores in all 5 domains in EQ-5D and in 5 out of 6 domains in FAMS were lower in NMO than in MS.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study suggests that the overall HRQoL in NMO is lower compared to that in MS. Pain-related HRQoL, in particular, was also found to be low. We should pay attention to pain as much as physical function. Relieving pain may improve the HRQoL in NMO.</p>

<p><italic><sup>1</sup>Department of Medical Genetics, and <sup>2</sup>Division of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterised by variable and unpredictable clinical trajectory. The prognosis of MS is commonly believed to be less favourable in Asian patients, in part due to the relatively high frequency of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) in this patient subgroup. Few studies have quantified disability progression of MS and NMO in Asian patients.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> Here we describe long-term disability outcomes of MS and NMO in Asian patients at a Canadian MS Clinic.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression modeling in a cohort of Asian MS and NMO patients who were seen at the MS Clinic at the University of British Columbia Hospital (Vancouver, Canada) between January 1980 and March 2011. We examined the effect of several covariates on time to Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 6.0, including sex, age of onset, and course at onset.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> We identified 76 patients with a diagnosis of definite or probable MS (<italic>n</italic>=60) or NMO (<italic>n</italic>=16) at last follow-up. Median time to EDSS 6.0 was 18 years, and survival at 10 and 20 years of follow-up was 72.6% (95% CI, 53.5-91.7%) and 40.6% (95% CI, 1.3-79.9%), respectively. Exclusion of definite NMO cases did not alter overall survival outcomes. Later age at onset was associated with poorer prognosis (hazard ratio, 3.3 [95% CI, 1.1-9.5], <italic>p</italic>=0.03).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data suggest that disability progression of MS and NMO in Asians is relatively brisk, and that unfavourable clinical outcomes in this patient subgroup are likely due to factors beyond the relatively high fraction of NMO in this population.</p>

<title>Prognosis of Patients with Acute Myelitis; A Single Hospital-based Retrospective Analysis</title>
<p>Chang JH, Kim BJ</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Korea University Medical Center, Korea</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Acute myelitis (AM) may be the initial presentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) or neuromyelitisoptica (NMO). Therefore, predicting conversion risk to MS or NMO is one of many key considerations in the management of patients with AM. <bold>Objective:</bold> To identify the clinical and laboratory variables in patients with first-ever AM that predict relapses or conversion to NMO or MS.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We selected patients for the last five years who met the following criteria; (1) patients who were admitted to our hospital for myelitis as first-ever inflammatory disorders in the central nervous system, (2) at least 1 follow-up visit at our centre 24 more months after the onset of symptoms. We reviewed medical records to collect data related to demographics, clinical features, and ancillary tests including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and evoked potentials. The prognostic values of all variables were analysed for conversion to MS or NMO.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 31 patients with idiopathic AM, 5 patients (mean age 32.6 years) converted to MS (3 women) or NMO (2 women), and 26 (18 men and 8 women, mean age 45.0 years) remained monophasic. Mean follow-up time was 6.1 years. Female gender (<italic>p</italic>=0.008) and dissemination in space on MRI by MAGNIMS criteria (<italic>p</italic>=0.029) were associated with conversion to MS or NMO. There were no significant differences in age of onset, clinical characteristics, CSF findings, spinal MRI or evoked potentials between patients who converted to MS or NMO and those who did not.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Brain lesions and being female with AM may be risk factors in the development of MS or NMO.</p>

<title>Protective Effect of Combined Treatment with Ulinastatin and Methylprednisolone in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</title>
<p>Shu YQ, Yang Y, Wang YG, Qiu W, Dai YQ, Lu ZQ, Li Y, Hu XQ</p>
<p><italic>MS Center, Department of Neurology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with oligodendrocyte loss, myelin destruction and axonal damage as the main pathological hallmarks. Recently, increasing evidence has demonstrated that combination therapies produce a more favorable clinical outcome compared to monotherapy in MS treatment. Ulinastatin (UTI) could effectively and widely suppress various proteases, as well as have anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptosis and immuno-modulatory effects. Methylprednisolone (MP) has been recommended as a standard drug in MS therapies. However, it is unclear if combination treatment with UTI and methylprednisolone could result in a protective effect in MS.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To investigate the protective effect of combined treatment with UTI and MP on myelin sheaths and oligodendrocytes in an MS model—experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into an UTI treatment group (group U), an MP treatment group (group P), a combined treatment group with UTI and MP (group (U+P)), a normal saline treatment group (group S), and a normal control group (group N), with 8 patients in each group. EAE was then induced with MOG35-55 peptide in groups U, P, U+P and S. Treatment was started on day 12 post-immunisation. UTI (250,000U/kg/per), MP (30mg/ kg/per), and UTI (250,000U/kg/per) + MP (30mg/kg/per) were 38 PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts intraperitoneally injected in groups U, P, and U+P respectively. Groups S and N mice were intraperitoneally administered 0.1ml saline per mouse at the same time. Demyelination was evaluated by Solochrome cyanin staining. Expressions of CNP, MBP, proNGF, p75, and iNOS proteins were detected by western blotting.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The clinical scores of groups U, P, and U+P were lower than those of group S (p&lt;0.01). The scores of demyelination in groups U and U+P were all significantly lower than that of group S (p&lt;0.05). Compared with group S, the expressions of CNP and MBP in cerebral cortex in groups U and U+P were each significantly increased; expressions of proNGF, p75 in the cerebral cortex of groups U, P, U+P were each significantly decreased (p&lt;0.05). The expression of iNOS in the cerebral cortex of groups U, P, U+P and N were lower compared to group S, though the difference between group S and N proved to be statistically significant (p&lt;0.05).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Combination treatment of UTI with MP was shown to protect against oligodendrocytes apoptosis and to promote remyelination in EAE. The underlying mechanism is possible through down-regulating proNGF, p75 and iNOS expression, suggesting that combination therapy is a potential novel treatment in MS.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Macrophages are important effector cells involved in the pathogenesis of demyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS). Inhibition of macrophage recruitment in the CNS of MS patients has become a new focus of research, which may contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To develop an effective macrophage migration inhibitor, the present study aimed to investigate the regulation and contribution of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and soluble VEGF receptor-1 (sFlt-1) (1-3) to human monocytic THP-1 migration.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Ad-sFlt-1/FLAG, a recombinant adenovirus carrying the human sFlt-1(1-3) (the first three extracellular domains of FLT-1, the hVEGF receptor-1) gene, was constructed. L929 cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus and then stained for immunofluorescent assay. The expression of sFlt-1 was detected by ELISA. The Corning® Transwell® Filter Inserts containing PET membranes with pore sizes of 3 µm were used as an experimental model to simulate THP-1 migration. Five VEGF concentrations (0, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 ng/mL), four concentrations of sFlt-1(1-3)/FLAG expression supernatants (0.1, 1, 10 and 100 ng/mL), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) (10 ng/mL) were used to test the ability of THP-1 cells to migrate through PET membranes.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Human sFlt-1(1-3) gene was successfully recombined into Ad-sFlt-1/FLAG. sFlt-1(1- 3) was expressed in L929 cells transfected with Ad-sFlt-1/FLAG as detected by ELISA and immunofluorescent staining. THP-1 cell migration increased with increasing concentrations of VEGF, whilst cell migration decreased with increasing concentrations of sFlt1(1- 3)/FLAG. sFlt1 (1-3)/FLAG had no effect on the migration of THP-1 cells induced by MCP-1.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study demonstrated that VEGF is able to elicit a migratory response in THP-1 cells, and that sFlt-1(1-3) is an effective inhibitor of THP-1 migration towards VEGF.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is characterised by severe optic neuritis and transverse myelitis. A disease-specific autoantibody against aquaporin-4 (AQP4), mainly expressed in astrocytic foot processes, was found in the sera from patients with NMO. It is considered that NMO-IgG can act on the complementmediated cytotoxicity against astrocytes in vitro. However, there is controversy about whether the astrocyte is damaged mainly by antibody or by complement, and the influence of complement inhibitory protein.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To clarify the effect of complement against astrocytes in culture treated with NMO-IgG.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Purified IgG were obtained from 5 patients with AQP4 antibodypositive NMO, 3 with multiple sclerosis (MS), and 3 healthy controls. Confluent primary human astrocytes were incubated with the IgG. After removing unbound IgG, the cells were further cultured with either human or rabbit complement, with or without heat inactivation. We observed the cytotoxicity using propidium iodide (PI) system and LDH assays.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> With non-heated rabbit complement in addition to NMO-IgG, the cell bodies and nuclei started to swell. These changes were relatively weak with human complement. Remaining adherent cells treated both with NMO-IgG and rabbit complement were mostly positive for PI, which were significantly higher than those with NMO-IgG and nonheated human complement. LDH assays confirmed these results. AQP4 antibody-negative IgG in MS patients or controls did not induce the above-described changes.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Complement is involved in the pathogenesis of NMO, but there are different effects of complement in various species, probably due to complement inhibitory proteins.</p>

<title>Two Cases of Post Vaccination Optic Neuritis/Multiple Sclerosis; Coincidence or Causative?</title>
<p>Lim SA</p>
<p><italic>Department of Ophthalmology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Several case reports of the onset of optic neuritis/ multiple sclerosis shortly after vaccination have suggested that there may be a causal link between the two events.<sup>1,2</sup></p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> We present two cases of optic neuritis after vaccination (influenza and hepatitis A). Despite the initial temporal relationship to the vaccination, both have suffered relapses of optic neuritis making it appear more likely that the vaccination was just coincidental PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts 39 instead of causative.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective case series.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Two patients developed optic neuritis after vaccination. One patient who is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive has been described by Huang et. al.3 He developed optic neuritis 12 days after hepatitis A vaccination. However on longer follow-up, he developed multiple sclerosis 3 years after the initial episode of optic neuritis. The other is a patient initially thought to have multiple sclerosis and was on Rebif, who developed optic neuritis 5 days after influenza vaccination. She has since suffered multiple relapses of optic neuritis in the affected eye as well as transverse myeliltis, and has now been diagnosed with neuromyelitis optica and treated with rituximab and azathioprine.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These two cases add to the collection of case reports on the controversial topic of whether vaccination is related to optic neuritis and other demyelinating syndromes. On longer follow-up, it appears that for our two patients, the events were likely coincidental. Whether causative or not, patients who develop optic neuritis post-vaccination may be at risk of demyelinating syndromes years after the initial event.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Neurologic manifestation rarely occurs as the initial symptoms of Sjögren Syndrome (SS).</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> We present a case of probable SS mimicking Multiple Sclerosis.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We reviewed the chart and imaging data of the patient.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A 46-year-old female presented with relapsing and remitting visual loss and weakness for 12 years. She had been diagnosed with MS at a university hospital in 2001 and has been treated with interferon beta 1b (INF-β1b) since 2004. She visited our clinic in 2009 to take her prescription of INF-β1b but rejected serologic testing. In less than a year, she was admitted presenting with decreased visual acuity in the right eye. McDonald criteria were fully satisfied with the symptoms, brain and spinal MRI findings, CSF study and electrophysiologic testing, but autoimmune markers were markedly elevated. History was retaken carefully and she had mild symptoms of dry eye and dry mouth. There were no abnormalities in Shirmer test and salivary gland scan. Lip biopsy was not performed because the patient did not agree to the procedure. She was diagnosed with probable SS with neurologic manifestation and recuperated after steroid therapy.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In so far as MS is a diagnosis of exclusion, one should carefully check all possibilities of other systemic disorders.</p>

<title>A Case of Multiple Sclerosis with High Anti–Ro Antibody</title>
<p>Lee JY</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Korea</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Anti-Ro/SSA antibody is characteristic of Sjögren’s Syndrome, although it is non-specific and can be detected in multiple sclerosis with a frequency range of 1.6%-7%. It is unclear as to what treatment is adequate to prevent relapses is unclear for patients with multiple sclerosis with high anti-Ro antibodies, who do not meet the international criteria for the diagnosis of Sjögren’s Syndrome.</p>
<p><bold>Case:</bold> In March 2010, a 50-year-old woman presented with a tingling sensation in both legs. Spine MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) showed high T2 signal intensities in the upper thoracic cord. She was treated conservatively by a neurosurgeon. In December 2010, she was admitted for 3 days due to diplopia. Brain MRI revealed high signal intensities on T2 weighted images involving the right pontine tectum and right cerebellar peduncle. Oligoclonal band was found to be negative in CSF and serum. Serum anti-aquaporin 4 antibody was found to be negative. The titre of anti Ro was 205.3 EU. Schirmer’s test was 1 mm in 5 minutes on both eyes. Salivary scintigraphy showed normal uptake and excretory functions of salivary glands. Lip biopsy showed normal salivary gland without significant inflammation. Her symptoms improved completely after steroid pulse therapy. She was then treated with low-dose steroid and azathioprine to prevent relapses.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We report on a patient with multiple sclerosis with high anti-Ro antibodies, treated with low dose steroids and azathioprine. Further study is needed concerning adequate treatment to prevent relapses for patients with multiple sclerosis with high anti-Ro antibodies, who do not meet the international criteria for the diagnosis of Sjögren’s Syndrome.</p>

<title>Can it still be Multiple Sclerosis if there are Seizures?</title>
<p>Sim LE, Tan K</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is infrequently associated with seizures even though it is predominantly a white matter disease.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To report a case suggestive of primary progressive MS, in which seizures developed 4 years after the initial presentation.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A case report and literature review of seizures in MS. <bold>Case:</bold> In 2007, a 41-year-old man presented with diplopia from left abducens palsy and right hemiparaesthesia, followed by left hemiparesis 1 month later. Brain MRI showed T2 hyperintensities in the pons and bilateral periventricular white matter and corpus callosum with patchy enhancement. He was diagnosed with MS after exclusion of autoimmune and infectious aetiologies; and treated with pulsed steroids and Interferon-beta for a year, but was subsequently lost to follow-up. He developed partial seizures with secondary generalisation in January and May 2011, and was treated with carbamazepine. On re-evaluation, his neurological function had been deteriorating progressively without relapses in the past 4 years. Currently he has severe cognitive deficits (Mini mental state examination 2/28), cerebellar dysarthria, generalised hypertonia and hyperreflexia with pyramidal weakness. Repeat brain MRI showed cerebral and cerebellar atrophy and symmetrical T2 hyperintensities in the white matter and cortically, with multifocal patchy enhancement. Repeat CSF analysis was positive for oligoclonal bands. An extensive autoimmune, infectious and 40 PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts metabolic work-up for mimics of MS was unremarkable. He was treated with another course of pulsed steroids which did not result in clinical improvement.</p>

<title>Upbeat Nystagmus due to Unilateral Small Pontine Lesion: Unusual Oculomotor Finding in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
<p>Lee TK, Park JY, Kim TE, Sung KB</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University, Soonchunhyang, Korea</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Patients with multiple sclerosis are commonly subjected to ocular motor disturbance due to its multifocal nature and predilection for the brainstem and cerebellum which are essential regions for the accurate control of eye movement. Primary position upbeat nystagmus (UBN) has been reported in extensive bilateral damage to the ventral tegmentum, medial longitudinal fasciculus in pons, anterior vermis, dorsal medulla, and brachium conjunctivum. UBN due to unilateral pontine lesion was rarely reported and might involve the crossed fibre of the ventral tegmental tract in the paramedian upper pons.</p>
<p><bold>Case:</bold> A 49-year-old woman presented with right peripheral facial palsy, vertigo and gait ataxia. The ocular motor test showed nystagmus with a linear slow phase beating upward and counter-clockwise from the patient’s view. The brain MRI demonstrated a well-defined demyelinating lesion in the right caudal dorsolateral pons encompassing the superior vestibular nucleus and its vicinity and multiple plaques in the periventricular white matter compatible with Barkhof criteria.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This case, contrary to previous theories, suggests that even a unilateral caudal pontine lesion might cause UBN if it involves the SVN and its vicinity.</p>

<title>A Case of Multiple Sclerosis Presenting as Lateral Rectus Palsy: A Case Report</title>
<p>De Jose J, Licup G</p>
<p><italic>Department of Internal Medicine, Iloilo Mission Hospital, Philippines</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis is caused by cumulative axonal loss leading to progressive and irreversible neurological disability. It has variable symptomatology, mostly manifesting as neurologic disturbances. Ophthalmologic manifestations that are commonly found in MS include diplopia, nystagmus and optic neuritis. We report a case of multiple sclerosis presenting as lateral rectus palsy.</p>
<p><bold>Case:</bold> A 42-year-old female admitted because of headache triggered by looking at the left and left lateral rectus palsy. Upon consultation with an ophthalmologist and neurologist, she was initially managed as ischemic stroke. However, the patient eventually complained of numbness on the right side of the face and was readmitted. The patient is a known hypertensive with good drug compliance. PE findings were normal. Neurological examination showed left lateral rectus palsy. Sensory examination revealed sensory deficit of 20% at the right side (by touch). Results showed small T2 and FLAIR hyperdensities in the pons and bifrontal paraventricular areas compatible with demyelinating disease. There are also small non-enhancing T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities that are iso- to hypointense on T1 scan in the left side of the pons and bifrontoparietal and paraventricular areas.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This case is an example of the variety of manifestations that a certain disease can produce, even in its rarest form – an abducens nerve palsy as a presenting symptom of multiple sclerosis.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Weakness or numbness in one limb is the initial symptom in about half of patients with multiple sclerosis but the pain is usually classified as an uncommon sensory symptom. Pain of unclear origin on limbs cannot be ignored because of the possibility of neurologic disease. Case: A 56-year-old male patient referred from the department of orthopedics complaining of left hip pain. A slow progression of left hip pain was reported, from the initial complaint 6 months ago. However, no hip joint problem was found and the patient was in conservative management with the diagnosis of chronic osteoarthritis. On neurological examination, left leg weakness (grade IV) was checked. We planned tests for lumbar and cervical spine MRI, brain MRI, SEP, EMG and NCS to differentiate the possible causes of left leg monoparesis and pain. Results of lumbar spine MRI were normal, but multifocal enhancing lesions of C1-C3 and C5-T1 levels and suspicious lesions suggestive of multiple sclerosis in the right frontal subcortex and right lower pons were observed in the cervical spine and brain MRI, respectively. CSF study showed that the IgG index was increased and the oligoclonal band was positive. Using the McDonald criteria, the patient was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.</p>

<p>Joseph JP, Chinnasami S, Rafia H</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Hospital Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system and typically involves white matter lesions. Tumefactive MS are lesions which mimic tumours and can be difficult to diagnose as both can present with contrast enhancement and edema. We report 2 cases of demyelinating disease with tumefactive lesions from our centre.</p>
<p><bold>Case 1:</bold> A 19-year-old man diagnosed with a central nervous tumour and was scheduled for a procedure. Prior to the biopsy, a contrast enhanced CT scan of the brain was done to localise the tumour. However, the lesion was no longer visible and the patient later developed optic neuritis, transverse myelitis and brain lesions which were suggestive of Relapsing Remitting MS. He was commenced on Beta-Interferon.</p>
<p><bold>Case 2:</bold> A 21-year-old woman who had one episode of optic neuritis followed by a tumour-like lesion. MRI showed typical demyelinating lesions. There were no symptoms or signs of raised intracranial pressure. The patient refused a brain PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts 41 biopsy and was scheduled to start Beta-Interferon.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Tumefactive demyelinating lesions can be a diagnostic challenge, as they are atypical features found in some MS patients.</p>

<title>Early Electrophysiological Changes Indicative of Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
<p>Yamazaki M, Warabi Y, Nagao M, Shimizu T, Matsubara S</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Tokyo Metropolitan Neurological Hospital, Tokyo, Japan</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Clinical and electrophysiological findings indicative of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) are occasionally observed in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> We report the electrophysiological changes consistent with CIDP in a 34-year-old woman with MS, and discuss the early electrophysiological manifestations of CIDP in MS. <bold>Case:</bold> We follow up with a 34-year-old woman who presented with paraparesis and elevated myelin basic protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 13 years ago. One year ago, she experienced a clinical relapse and developed demyelinating lesions in the medulla oblongata, cervical cord, and thoracic cord. Oligoclonal immunoglobulin G bands were detected in the CSF, but the results for serum anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies were negative. The patient was diagnosed with MS, and interferon beta-1b therapy was initiated. Two weeks before presentation, the patient developed left footdrop. Manual muscle strength testing of the left anterior tibial muscle showed grade 4 weakness.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> On admission, a nerve conduction study showed prolonged compound muscle action potential (CMAP) duration in both peroneal nerves; asymptomatic conduction block and temporal dispersion of CMAP in the right tibial nerve; conduction velocity slowing of F waves in the right tibial nerve; and slight sensory nerve conduction velocity slowing in the right sural nerve. Brain and spinal cord MRI indicated no new MS plaques. IV methylprednisolone therapy was not effective in treating her footdrop.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings indicate that in patients with MS, CIDP might start with demyelination of the peroneal nerves. It might then progress asymptomatically to demyelination of the tibial and sural nerves.</p>

<title>Trigeminal Somatosensory Evoked Potentials In Multiple Sclerosis: A Case Report</title>
<p>Lee TJ</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Gimhae Hansol Hospital, Gimhae, Korea</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> There are diverse symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS). Among symptoms of MS, facial numbness is vague and easily overlooked. A patient diagnosed as MS was presented with selective involvement of the right trigeminal nerve. The abnormality of the right trigeminal nerve was found in the trigeminal somatosensory evoked potential (TSEP). The presumed diagnosis of MS was subsequently confirmed by MRI showing evidence of demyelinating disease.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> We report a case of MS presenting as unilateral facial numbness having abnormality of TSEP and emphasise the clinical usefulness of TSEP in the diagnosis of MS.</p>
<p><bold>Case:</bold> A 56-year-old man presented with numbness in the right cheek area. One day later, the area of facial numbness was widened to the right forehead and around the mouth. On neurological examination, right facial hypoesthesia and cerebellar ataxia were detected. On TSEP, the right trigeminal nerve stimulation did not show wave formation. However, left trigeminal nerve stimulation showed normal wave formation and normal latency. Brain MRI revealed high T2 signal intensities in right brachium pontis with T1 focal enhancement suggestive of demyelinating lesion. He was treated with IV methylprednisolone 1g for 5 days. Facial numbness and ataxia improved over several days. Unfortunately, because he did not visit the outpatient clinic, follow-up brain MRI was not performed.</p>
<p><bold>Results and Conclusions:</bold> TSEP may be useful in the diagnosis of MS presenting as facial numbness.</p>

<title>Interferon-Beta-1b Induced Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia in a Patient with MS: A Case Report</title>
<p>Saeidi M</p>
<p><italic>Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Iran</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> The first treatment in MS approved by FDA in 1993 was INFβ-1b. While most patients with MS benefit from the immunomodulatory effects of this interferon, some autoimmune disorders such as hepatitis may be induced or aggravated by this treatment. A case of INFβ-1b induced autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHA) is reported in this paper.</p>
<p><bold>Case:</bold> A 26-year-old lady diagnosed with RRMS 11 months ago who had been treated with Betaferon was seen in the MS clinic of Quaem Hospital of Mashhad, Iran, because of a 3-day history of icterus and fatigue. Her disease had started 13 months ago with left optic neuritis. We started INFβ-1b after recovery with pulse therapy. The patient was doing well until the visit, complaining of fatigue and icterus. Physical examination showed pale conjunctive and icteric sclera without organomegaly or lymphadenopathy.</p>
<p><bold>Laboratory tests showed:</bold> Total bilirubin: 8.5 mg/dl, Direct bilirubin: 0.4 mg/dl, SGOT: 24 IU/L, SGPT: 27 IU/L, Alkaline phosphatase: 140 U/L, LDH 819 IU/L, HbsAg : Negative, Anti HCV ab: Negative, Indirect Coomb’s test; Positive, Direct Coomb’s test: Positive.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> We ruled out other causes of AHA by laboratory tests and clinical examination and hematologic consultation. This is the second report of INFβ-1b induced AHA in MS patients.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Alanoglu et al. reported the first case of INFβ-1b induced AHA in a 31-year-old male patient who had received INFβ-1b for two years. We started prednisolone (1 mg/kg) with gradual tapering and discontinued Betaferon. Recovery then occurred after 2-3 weeks.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> To prevent the recurrence of multiple sclerosis, interferon (IFN) is usually used in the long term. The side effects commonly observed are transient flu-like symptoms such as muscle pain, chills, and headaches. We describe a patient with relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis who developed acute thigh muscle pain and swelling during IFNβ-1b treatment. It was revealed that his rhabdomyolitic symptoms were due to intramuscular haematoma.</p>
<p><bold>Case:</bold> A 36-year-old man with a history of prior symptoms in April 2008 was diagnosed as having relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, supported by oligoclonal bands in the CSF, and multifocal recurrent spinal cord lesions on MRI. Treatment with 250µg IFNβ- 1b by subcutaneous injection every other day was initiated in September 2008 after three exacerbations with paraparetic gait disturbances. Sixteen months after initiation of IFN treatment, he suddenly developed acute right thigh pain, swelling and weakness. He denied any trauma, strenuous physical exercise, or febrile illness. Upon neurological examination, right proximal lower limb weakness (MRC 3/5) with swelling and tenderness were found. Laboratory findings showed a moderate increase in the concentration of creatine kinase at 1753 IU/L (reference range: 55-215 IU/L). Thigh MRI revealed intramuscular haematoma in the right hamstring muscles and color Doppler scan found a bleeding arterial vessel from the muscle layer to the subcutaneous layer on the right posterior thigh. Femoral arteriography revealed tortuous and tangled vessel branches of the deep femoral artery but no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or any vascular anomalies. Blood coagulation lab and CBC were normal. Under conservative management, muscle swelling and pain disappeared after 2 months. Betaferon treatment was restarted and continued.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of spontaneous intramuscular haematoma mimicking rhabdomyolysis associated with IFN treatment. Creatine kinase activity should be measured when a patient complains of severe myalgia suggestive of rhabdomyolysis. Moreover, clinician should keep in mind the possibility of intramuscular bleeding.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> We report a case of rituximab infusion in a Relapsing- Remitting Multiple Sclerosis patient who had mild transient infusion related adverse events compared to more severe reactions in ongoing clinical trials.</p>
<p><bold>Case:</bold> A 56-year-old woman on Interferon therapy for the last 4 years with 8 relapses despite compliance. There were no adverse events during infusion such as hypotension, bradycardia and shortness of breath. There was however, a mild adverse event of transient flushing of the face observed by the managing physician and the resident pharmacist, but not felt or noticed by the patient herself. This occurred 12 hours post-infusion during the first infusion (Day 1) but not during the second (Day 15) infusion. No other significant side effects were observed during these infusions.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our first rituximab patient had a mild transient infusion-related adverse event observed during the first 24 hours of treatment in comparison to the current ongoing clinical trial, in which more severe adverse events were reported.</p>

<title>Neuromyelitis Optica Co-existing with Sjögren’s Syndrome and Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis: A Case Report</title>
<p>Lu ZQ, Qiu W, Zhang BJ, Hu XQ</p>
<p><italic>Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Department of Neurology, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) may coexist with Sjögren’s Syndrome. Methylprednisolone has been used for treatment of NMO and multiple sclerosis while erythropoietin (EPO) has recently shown efficacy in treating multiple sclerosis. <bold>Case:</bold> A female patient with concomitant NMO, Sjögren’s Syndrome and distal renal tubular acidosis. Serum aquaporin 4-IgG was positive. An imbalance of T helper 17/regulatory T cells (Th17/Treg) was detected. IV methylprednisolone could not halt her clinical deterioration. She was then given two courses of EPO at 20,000 IU for three consecutive days for each course. She started to show steady neurological improvement from day 17 of EPO treatment, and the laboratory test demonstrated a down-regulated Th17/ interleukin-23 system and up-regulated Treg cells. One month later, she had minimal residual right-sided weakness and was able to ambulate without assistance. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging showed a reduction of the spinal cord lesion.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our report implies that the Th17/Treg system may have a role in the pathogenesis of NMO and that EPO therapy may be efficacious in the treatment of patients with NMO.</p>

<p><italic>Department of Ophthalmology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) have been reported as overlapping disorders that co-exist in some patients.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We report a case of a 56-year-old lady who presented with right-sided optic neuropathy and headache.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Clinical examination revealed visual acuity of the right eye as light perception and hyperaemia of the right optic nerve. MRI showed enhancement of the right intraorbital optic nerve and bilateral perineural enhancement. No other white matter lesions were found. Raised antibody levels were found for the following: NMO-IgG, antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor and anti-Ro antibody. Cerebrospinal fluid was negative for oligoclonal bands. On further questioning, she complained of dry eyes and dry mouth for 12 years. Schirmer’s test was positive (&lt;4 mm). She was started on systemic steroids with subsequent plasmapheresis. However, there was no improvement in the right eye.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our patient fulfils the criteria for both primary SS and NMO. Studies have shown that a higher percentage of SS patients have NMO PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts 43 and NMO-IgG positivity compared to other autoimmune diseases. NMO-IgG is associated with disease relapse. It is suggested that all patients with NMO be screened for autoimmune disorders and aggressive treatment be commenced after.</p>

<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Keimyung University School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Sjögren’s Syndrome may occasionally have signs of central nervous system involvement, mimicking multiple sclerosis. We report a case of Sjögren’s Syndrome who had multiple relapse of central nervous system involvement with use of interferonbeta.</p>
<p><bold>Case:</bold> A 46-year-old woman was admitted with right visual disturbance and had been on immunomodulating therapy with interferon-beta for multiple sclerosis. Her first neurological symptom was bilateral optic neuritis at the age of 40. Two months after the first optic neuritis, she developed myelitis involving the cervical spinal cord and was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Interferonbeta treatment was started, but she experienced 6 more relapses of optic neuritis and suspicious myelitis over the next 3.5 years until diagnosis of Sjögren’s Syndrome. Interferon-beta treatment was stopped and she had no more recurrence of optic neuritis and other signs of central nervous system involvement for 18 months.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Sjögren’s Syndrome and other neurological disorders should be considered in the case of multiple sclerosis not responsive to interferon-beta treatment.</p>

<title>Two Cases of NMO-IgG-positive Clinical Spectrum: Atypical Clinical Presentation resembling Multiple Sclerosis</title>
<p>Cho YN, Park HJ, Shin HY, Choi YC</p>
<p><italic>Departments of Neurology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is traditionally characterised by recurrent attacks of optic neuritis and myelitis without brain involvement. After the detection of NMO-IgG Antibody, recent studies revealed that patients with NMO frequently had brain MRI abnormalities. We described two NMO-IgG-positive patients with clinical features resembling multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p><bold>Case 1:</bold> A 28-year-old woman presented with facial palsy and dysarthria. MRI revealed medullary lesion and spinal cord lesion from the first to the fifth cervical vertebrae. After two years, she developed visual blurring and diplopia with MRI findings showing frontal subcortical lesion. She tested seropositive for NMO-IgG antibodies (Ab). Thereafter, she showed right-side weakness and urinary incontinence. We found new lesions in the corpus callosum, temporal lobe, pons and medulla.</p>
<p><bold>Case 2:</bold> An 8-year-old girl admitted for diplopia and seizure. Brain MRI revealed multiple lesions in medulla and bilateral parietal white matter. After three years, she complained of shoulder and neck pain. MRI showed a spinal lesion from the second to the sixth cervical vertebrae. After two years, she developed excessive daytime somnolence. We found a hypothalamic lesion. She complained of leg numbness despite interferon use. MRI showed a spinal lesion from the eleventh to the twelfth thoracic vertebrae. She was then found seropositive for NMO-IgG Ab.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We experienced two NMO-IgGpositive patients with recurrent brain lesions. NMO-IgG antibody positivity has been relatively more common in Asian countries than in Western populations. Therefore it is important to remember the possibility of NMO spectrum disease in patients with recurrent CNS inflammatory disease.</p>

<p><italic><sup>1</sup>Department of Neurology, Chonbuk National University, Korea; <sup>2</sup>Research Institute of Clinical Medicine, Chonbuk National University Hospital, Korea</italic></p>
<p><bold>Case:</bold> We report a 56-year-old woman whose initial presenting symptom of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) was intractable vomiting. Initial evaluations were normal for severe vomiting, including clinical assessment, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, computed tomography of the abdomen and neurologic examination. Three months after onset of vomiting, patient showed a two-week history of right upper limb paresthesia and rapidly progressing weakness. Cervical MRI showed homogeneous high signal intensity lesions in the 4th - 6th cervical cord without contrast enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (17 cells/L), normal protein (44 mg/dL) and negative oligoclonal bands. Aquaporin-4 antibody was positive. The diagnosis was autoimmune transverse myelitis, and was treated with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids, resulting in marked recovery. Three months later, the patient developed bilateral and corticosteroid-responsive optic neuritis. Almost simultaneously with recovered optic neuritis, she complained of dizziness, headache and diplopia. Examination revealed bilateral medial gaze limitation and brain MRI showed longitudinal high signal intensity lesions in the paramedian medulla oblongata including area postrema and bilateral medial thalamus. Clinical, radiologic and laboratory findings were compatible with neuromyelitis optica (NMO).</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Intractable nausea/vomiting is a rare symptom of NMO as an isolated clinical manifestation of early disease or preceding symptoms before optic neuritis or transverse myelitis. Recently, pathologic abnormalities in the caudal medullae at the floor of the fourth ventricle and area postrema were reported in 40% of patients with NMO. This implies that clinical episodes of intractable nausea/ vomiting/hiccups are frequent or that it could be a pathomechanic phenomenon in NMO patients. Furthermore, selective loss of AQP4 was the unifying neuropathologic characteristic in all NMO lesions found in the medullary floor of the fourth ventricle and area postrema. Intractable vomiting, a novel clinical symptom in NMO involving the medullary floor of the fourth ventricle and area postrema, might be a feature further distinguishing NMO from MS.</p>

<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Daegu, Korea</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and NMO spectrum disorders (NMOSD) are autoimmune inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system. The majority of patients with NMO and NMOSD have a recurrent disease course. Benign course of longterm remission without maintenance immunosuppressive therapy has been rarely reported.</p>
<p><bold>Case:</bold> A 31-year-old female presented with progressive paraparesis, sensory disturbance and urinary incontinence for 2 weeks. Nine years ago, she had a history of paraparesis, bilateral sensory loss below umbilicus and urinary incontinence. Without any specific treatment, her symptoms had improved over 4 months and she had been relapse-free. Spine MRI showed a cervicothoracic (cervicomedullary junction ~ T3) longitudinally extensive, centrally located lesion with cord swelling. Brain MRI revealed multiple lesions in thalamus, middle cerebellar peduncle, and adjacent to the third and the fourth ventricles. Antiaquaporin- 4 antibody was positive.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We report a case of NMOSD which had a benign course with long-term remission without immunotherapy. Further longitudinal follow-up is needed to elucidate whether she continues to have a benign course or develop noteworthy disability after long-term remission.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease characterised by fluctuating muscle weakness, caused by impaired neuromuscular transmission. Patients with MG can present other autoimmune diseases in association, such as hypo or hyperthyroidism. The association of MG with demyelinating disease is rare and has been described before. Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that preferentially affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. NMO-IgG/ anti-aquaporin 4 antibody (AQP4-Ab) is considered as a specific diagnostic marker for NMO.</p>
<p><bold>Case:</bold> We report on a 69-year-old woman who presented left optic neuritis, several years after the diagnosis of MG. She had no thymoma. Her VEP revealed delayed P100 latency in left eye. Brain MRI showed no specific findings of classical multiple sclerosis or NMO. The serum anti-AQP4-Ab titer was positive (0.271). After methylprednisolone pulse therapy, her blurred vision did not improve, but with plasmapheresis, there was slight vision recovery.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> The coexistence of NMO and MG is very rare, but further investigation of the association between these diseases is needed.</p>

<p><italic><sup>1</sup>Department of Neurology and <sup>2</sup>Department of Pathology, National Cancer Center, Korea; <sup>3</sup>Department of Neurology, Dongguk University Ilsan Hospital, Korea</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Advances in the understanding of central nervous system (CNS) aquaporin-4 (AQP4) autoimmunity have promoted the recognition of diverse clinical presentations that are beyond the traditional view of neuromyelitis optica (NMO). We describe a patient who developed isolated brain abnormalities as an initial manifestation of CNS AQP4 autoimmunity spectrum disorder.</p>
<p><bold>Case:</bold> A 54-year-old woman presented with right-sided hemiplegia that began 2 days ago. One day after symptom onset, she underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at another hospital, and extensive hemispheric lesions suspicious of brain tumour were observed. However, no malignant cells were found in a stereotactic brain biopsy, so she was referred to our hospital. The extensive white matter lesion on brain MRI revealed high signal intensity on T2-weighted images and an increase of apparent diffusion coefficient values with faint enhancement. Although the patient had no history of optic neuritis or myelitis, we performed a serum anti- AQP4 antibody test based on unique localisation and configuration of brain lesions which were considered characteristic of NMO brain lesions. Serum anti-AQP4 antibody was positive. High-dose steroid treatment was not effective, but hemiplegia was markedly improved by plasmapheresis. A neuropathological study revealed demyelination and loss of AQP4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein with relatively preserved neurofilaments. Perivascular infiltration of macrophages with thickened hyalinised vessels was also observed.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This suggests that CNS AQP4 autoimmunity can present with isolated brain abnormalities and provides evidence for expanding the clinical spectrum of NMO.</p>

<p><italic><sup>1</sup>Department of Neurology, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Korea; <sup>2</sup>Department of Neurology, Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Korea</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a destructive, inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterised by selective involvement of the spinal cord and optic nerves. On the contrary, classical multiple sclerosis (MS) has typical brain lesions with various manifestations fulfilling multiple criteria. However, some cases with demyelination in the central nervous system are particularly difficult to classify under the diagnostic categorisations and have limits in therapeutic considerations. We present a patient of recurrent brainstem encephalitis with supra-tentoreal lesions suggesting NMO spectrum disorder (NMOSD) showing good responses to steroid pulse therapy in each acute stage.</p>
<p><bold>Case:</bold> A 45-year-old man was admitted with recurrent hiccups, blurred vision, headache and preceding flu-like symptoms. His history included several similar symptoms 32 months ago and he was managed symptomatically in accordance with the impression of aseptic meningitis. His symptoms were dramatically improved with each short-term course of high-dose steroid therapy each time. PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts 45 He had no history of optic neuritis or myelitis. Brain MRI showed extensive high signal changes of midbrain and pons in T2-weighted image (fluid attenuated immersion recovery) without enhancement in T1-weighted image. There were several small lesions in supratentoreal white matter along with corticospinal tracts without enhancement. Oligoclonal band IgG and myelin basic proteins were negative from acute stage cerebrospinal fluid. Anti-aquaporin-4 IgG antibody was negative from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and IgG index was within normal limits (0.66). His symptoms and signs disappeared with a course of high-dose steroid therapy and remitted for three years with interferon-beta treatment until the appearance of brainstem and cerebellar atrophy.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> NMOSD and MS can show diverse pattern of manifestations in neurological examination and image studies. Sometimes, we meet difficult cases in diagnosis and make plans due to lack of typical signs or laboratory evidence. We emphasise that long-term observation is important in interpreting such a case.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Alexander Disease (AD) is a rare white matter disorder that predominantly affects infants and children, and is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding glial fibrillary acidic protein <italic>(GFAP)</italic>. Adult-onset AD (AOAD) can manifest as wide clinical variability, although pseudo-bulbar signs, ataxia, spasticity, and associated atrophy of the medulla and upper cervical cord are common. Conversely, neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an inflammatory disease with involvement of the optic nerve and spinal cord and relative sparing of the brain.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A 45-year-old Korean man with a single episode of optic neuritis and right-sided spastic hemiparesis was enrolled. Brain and spinal cord MR images were undertaken. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using standard protocols and used as a template to amplify the full <italic>GFAP</italic> coding region.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Cervical MRI showed abnormal irregular hyperintense lesions in the right cervical and medullar oblongata with focal enhancement. Direct DNA sequence analysis of the <italic>GFAP</italic> coding region unveiled a heterozygous G-to-A substitution at nucleotide 883(c.883G&gt;A), which predicts replacement of an aspartic acid with asparagine at codon 295 (p.Asp295Asn). This novel genetic variation was not found in 200 normal controls.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This was a case of AOAD initially misdiagnosed as having an inflammatory myelitis including NMO and thus inappropriately treated by immune-suppressant or modulation therapy. This was because the clinical and radiological phenotype in AOAD may be broad and diverse. Therefore, a genetic investigation of the <italic>GFAP</italic> gene should be considered if definite evidence for the diagnosis of NMO cannot be obtained.</p>

<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Japan</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Recent reports indicate that the corpus callosum, dorsal portion of the medulla and hypothalamus are vulnerable regions involved in NMO. We present a patient showing multiple lesions in these areas, initially suspected to have NMO without opticomyelitis, that eventually led to an unexpected diagnosis of intracranial germinoma.</p>
<p><bold>Case:</bold> A 29-year-old man complained of daytime hypersomnia. Brain MRI showed multiple lesions in the corpus callosum, dorsal portion of the medulla and right basal ganglia (hypothalamus and globus pallidum). NMO-IgG status was negative and CSF analysis including orexin was unremarkable except for an elevated IgG index. Three cycles of IV high-dose corticosteroid followed by plasma apheresis did not induce any response. Furthermore, syncope due to orthostatic hypotension, intractable hiccups and nystagmus developed. After prednisolone initiation, no additional neurological deficits were observed. Seven months after the initial presentation, follow-up brain MRI showed a tumour in the pineal gland and lesions of dorsal portion of the medulla appeared enlarged with contrast enhancement. Betahuman choroid gonadotropin was elevated in the serum and CSF. Histological examination of the pineal gland lesion yielded a diagnosis of germinoma with inflammatory cell infiltration. After radiotherapy of the craniospinal axis, pineal tumour and contrastenhancing lesions disappeared.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our case demonstrates an extremely rare manifestation of an intracranial germinoma initially mimicking the brain abnormalities of NMO with corresponding symptoms such as hypersomnia and intractable hiccups. Leptomeningeal dissemination of germinoma cells was supposed to have been the pathogenesis prior to the development of pineal tumour.</p>

<p><italic><sup>1</sup>Department of Ophthalmology, Khoo Teck Phuat Hospital, Singapore; <sup>2</sup>Department of Ophthalmology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> The ocular manifestations of demyelinating optic neuritis often overlap with other ophthalmic conditions and can create a diagnostic challenge.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To discuss the similarities and differences between posterior scleritis and optic neuritis.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective case report.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A 30-year old female patient presented to us with sub-acute left eye pain and redness. Examination revealed red desaturation and optic disc swelling in the affected eye. Colour vision, by Ishihara testing, and visual fields were normal and her visual acuity was 6/6 bilaterally. Of note, there was no relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), uveitis, retinal detachment or choroidal effusion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of patient’s brain showed prominent enhancement 46 PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts of left optic nerve sheath with thickening of posterior globe surface. Based on the above findings, we reached a differential diagnosis including optic neuritis and posterior scleritis. In this case, optic neuritis was less likely in view of patient’s red eye, intact colour vision and visual fields, absent RAPD and thickened posterior globe surface on MRI. Diagnosis of posterior scleritis was confirmed by orbital ultrasound, showing posterior scleral thickening and fluid in tenon capsule. Investigations for associated systemic conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, were negative. Our patient was treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids, and she recovered well from the episode.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Posterior scleritis and optic neuritis have overlapping symptoms and clinical features. We highlight the need for careful history, examination and investigations to make an accurate diagnosis.</p>

<p>Shin BS, Kim DH, Oh SY, Kim YH</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Jeonbuk National University Medical School, Jeonju, Korea</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Rhombencephalitis is a potentially fatal inflammatory process involving the brain stem and cerebellum in which bacteria and virus are the most common offending agents. It is often difficult to diagnose on the basis of clinical and laboratory findings.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> We report an unusual case of cryptogenic necrotising haemorrhagic rhombencephalitis that showed progression from rhomencephalone to diencephalone.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A 51-year-old woman admitted to our hospital with severe headache and fever was diagnosed with viral meningitis, based on CSF findings and meningeal irritation signs. After two days of conservative treatment, she developed dysarthria and partial bilateral third nerve palsy. During the five days, her neurologic signs progressed to coma. On serial MRI, findings showed encephalitic lesions that were found initially in rhombencephalone and extended to diencephalone with haemorrhagic necrosis. The culture of CSF did not confirm etiology such as Listeria monocytogenes. After treatment with steroid and IV immunoglobulin, she recovered her mental status but presented locked-in syndrome.</p>
<p><bold>Results and Conclusions:</bold> We report an unusual case of progressive ascending haemorrhagic necrotising encephalitis.</p>

<title>Delayed Transverse Myelitis After Treatment of Toxocariasis</title>
<p>Minn YK</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Hallym University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Toxocariasis is well-known cause of eosinophilic transverse myelitis. Most cases of Toxocariasis myelitis develop with high antibody titre and eosinophilia. Post-infectious encephalomyelitis such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is reported after viral infection. However, it is not known if parasitic infection can cause post-infectious demyelinating disease.</p>
<p><bold>Case:</bold> A 49-year-old woman visited our hospital due to progressive left leg sensory change. Her spinal MRI showed high signal cord edema in T3-T5 segment in T2-weighted imaging. In peripheral blood, WBC count was 4.840/ml (eosinophil 5.4%) and IgE concentration was 196.3 IU/ml. WBC count in CSF was zero and protein level was 61 mg/dl. IgG index was 0.72 and no oligoclonal band was observed. CSF ELISA for Toxocariasis was negative. She was admitted 2 months ago due to eosinophilia. She had been diagnosed with toxocariasis and was treated with albendazole.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Toxocariasis infection can be associated with the incident because of the relationship between toxocariasis and delayed transverse myelitis.</p>

<title>Left Third Nerve Palsy and Bilateral Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia in a Patient with Colon Cancer: Rare Clinical Manifestation and Non-invasive Diagnostic Approach in Multifocal Inflammatory Leukoencephalopathy</title>
<p>Song HS, Lee HW, Kim YW</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and levamisole have been used in adenocarcinoma of colon for adjuvant therapy. These can rarely induce a demyelinating disease of the brain such as multifocal inflammatory leukoencephalopathy (MIL).</p>
<p><bold>Case:</bold> A 45-year-old woman had taken 12 weeks of 5-FU and levamisole treatment for moderately differentiated Stage IIIb adenocarcinoma of the caecum after right hemicolectomy. On admission she revealed nearly complete ptosis, mydriasis and impairment of adduction, supraduction and infraduction on the left eye and also showed partial adduction deficit of the right eye. On both lateral gazes each eye showed abducting nystagmus. Brain MRI revealed a lesion of midbrain tegmentum and multiple cerebral white matter lesions. Diffusion tensor image (DTI) and Positron Emission Tomography– Computed Tomography (PET-CT) scan were taken. PET-CT presented decreased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake of brain stem and multiple white matter lesions. DTI revealed decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) value and diffusivity of the left midbrain compared with those of the contralateral side. Disruption of tract was also observed in 3D-tractogram. After cessation of 5-FU and levamisole administration, methylprednisolone was injected intravenously. Five weeks later, eye movement was fully recovered.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this case, the lesion involving left oculomotor nerve fascicles and both neighboring medial longitudinal fascicles (MLFs) were responsible for left third nerve palsy with bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia. We report a rare neuro-ophthalmologic finding in a patient with MIL.</p>

<p><italic><sup>1</sup>Department of Neurology, Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Daegu, Korea <sup>2</sup>Departments of Neurology, Eulji University Hospital, Eulji University School of Medicine, Daejeon, Korea</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Secondary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma is uncommon. Brain MRI findings of CNS lymphoma typically show single or multiple periventricular lesions with homogeneous PACTRIMS 2011 Programme &amp; Abstracts 47 enhancement. However, it is associated with a large spectrum of radiological presentations and can simulate demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica.</p>
<p><bold>Case:</bold> A 67-yearold man presented with progressive paresthesia and numbness in both legs for 15 days. He had a history of left leg weakness dating back to 9 months ago. Brain MRIs showed multiple confluent white matter lesions with spontaneous improvement on followup study. Spine MRI was unremarkable. CSF study revealed mild pleocytosis and elevated protein level. He was treated with high-dose steroid pulse therapy and azathioprine. However, two months later, paraparesis was developed. Follow-up brain MRI was unremarkable except for an asymptomatic new lesion in the right parietal subcortical white matter. Brain biopsy results were suggestive of a demyelinating lesion. Four months later, his symptoms were aggravated and did not improve in spite of plasma exchange. Follow-up spine MRI showed lumbar cord lesion with diffuse enhancement on cauda equina. Fluoro-2-deoxy-Dglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed multiple hypermetabolic lesions on lymph nodes. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was diagnosed after lymph node biopsy.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We report a case of secondary CNS which involved diffuse large B cell lymphoma presenting as mimicking demyelinating disease. If the clinical course of patient with CNS inflammatory demyelinating disease has progressed with poor response to immunotherapy, CNS lymphoma should be considered.</p>

<p>Cho JY, Hwang SI, Cho YJ</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, Ilsan Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Korea</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> The spectrum of idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating disorders is usually classified based on the clinical course and lesion distribution. Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis is a rare demyelinating disease characterised by an acute onset, rapidly progressive course and high mortality.</p>
<p><bold>Case 1:</bold> A 37-year-old man presented with acute onset of headache, fever and vertigo. Initial MRI revealed focal hemorrhage in left middle cerebellar peduncle and left medulla. Antibiotics, antiviral agents and anti-tuberculous therapy were administered under the impression of infectious disease of central nervous system based on the results of a CSF study. Despite these treatments, his symptoms progressed over the next several days. On follow-up MRI, focal hemorrhage in the right cerebellum was newly developed, however initial hemorrhagic lesion was resolved. Stereotactic biopsy revealed fragments of myelin in macrophages suggesting demyelination. After steroid therapy for one month, left limb ataxia, headache and fever were improved.</p>
<p><bold>Case 2:</bold> A 42-year-old woman was admitted due to sudden hypesthesia and ataxia in her right limbs. Seven days later, weakness of the right limbs and face with dysarthria developed. One month after the first symptoms, high fever was observed. On neurological examination, she was unresponsive to voice or noxious stimuli. CSF examination showed pleocytosis (2,100 per microliter) but no evidence of microorganism. Brain image revealed new lesions in bilateral frontal lobes with genu of corpus callosum. A stereotactic biopsy showed perivascular mononuclear inflammatory cells with macrophages and perivascular hemorrhage. Luxol fast blue and Bodian staining confirmed the demyelination.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We report two cases of acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis.</p>

<title>A Case of Guillain-Barré Syndrome followed by Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis associated with Influenza Vaccination during Postpartum Period</title>
<p>An JY, Shim DS, Lee KS</p>
<p><italic>Department of Neurology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea</italic></p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) are thought to be rare major neurologic complications after infection or vaccination. Young adult cases have been rarely reported after vaccination.</p>
<p><bold>Case:</bold> A 29-year-old woman with both GBS and ADEM after influenza vaccination during postpartum period. Patient presented with 2 weeks history of progressive ascending weakness and a tingling sensation in both hands and feet. She had given birth 6 weeks ago, and 4 weeks after childbirth, had received an influenza vaccine. Two weeks later, she developed weakness of the lower extremities. Absent DTR in all extremities, history of progressive ascending weakness, albuminocytologic dissociation in the cerebrospinal fluid, and electromyographic findings of a demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy were compatible with diagnosis of GBS. Four weeks after IV immunoglobulin treatment, weakness improved enough to walk. Six weeks after onset of symptoms of GBS, patient re-visited an ER because of aggravated weakness in both legs (MRC grade I) and sensory level (C7), voiding difficulty, facial weakness and diplopia. Brain and cervical spine MRI showed multiple brain lesions and intramedullary cervical spinal cord lesions. After a diagnosis of ADEM, steroid pulse therapy was administered for 5 days and improvement of symptoms was seen.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> It has been known that patients with autoimmune diseases are affected during the postpartum period. This may be due to changes in immunomodulatory effects. Vaccination during postpartum period may predispose patient to postvaccination-associated GBS and ADEM.</p>
