<title>Background:</title>
<p>Approximately 1.4 million or 13% of all children who die each year could be prevented with widely-available vaccines.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0017896911419343">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>We examined if women’s empowerment improved child immunization using data on 1,056 mothers with young children from Nepal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0017896911419343">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The study utilized the 2006 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey, a nationally-representative sample of 10,793 women from 8,707 households across Nepal. We selected all mothers with first child between the ages of 12 and 23 months at the time of interview. This resulted in a sample of 1,056 mothers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0017896911419343">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Among the measures of women’s empowerment, mothers’ education was significantly associated with child immunization. The odds of being fully immunized for children of mothers with secondary education were 5.91 times the odds for children of mothers without any formal education. Other measures of women’s empowerment – women’s age at birth of first child, gap in age between spouses, women’s knowledge about sexually-transmitted diseases, their role in intra-household financial, health and mobility decisions, and their perceptions toward wife beating – were not associated with child immunization. Among control variables, mothers who received antenatal care were 3.31 times as likely to immunize their children as mothers who did not receive any antenatal care. Other such barriers to health service use such as cost of care, distance to health services, and quality of health services were not significant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0017896911419343">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>To improve child immunization, Nepal should strengthen its antenatal care services. Additionally, over 56% of mothers in Nepal had no formal education; to improve child health in the long run, the country should focus on education of women and girls.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Of the 130 million children born annually, nearly 12 million, younger than five years of age, die each year; over 75% of these deaths occur in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911419343">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896911419343"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896911419343">3</xref></sup> Approximately 1.4 million child deaths could be prevented annually with widely-available vaccines against Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT), poliomyelitis (OPV), and measles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911419343">4</xref></sup> In 1974, World Health Organization (WHO) initiated the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) to increase vaccination rates of children against BCG, DPT, OPV and measles. Ten years later, WHO declared that children can be fully protected by eight required vaccines: one dose of BCG, three doses of DPT, three doses of OPV, and one dose of a measles virus-containing vaccine, all to be dispensed within the first year of a child’s life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896911419343">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911419343">6</xref></sup> Timing of vaccination is critical: BCG is given right after birth or first clinical contact within eight weeks; DPT and Polio vaccines are dispensed at six, 10 and 14 weeks, and measles vaccination is given between nine and 12 months of child’s life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911419343">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since 2000, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization has been consolidating all the resources aimed at immunizing children to strengthen the mandate of the EPI. Additionally, in 2002, the Millennium Development Goals called for a global reduction of under-five child mortality rate by two thirds by 2015, from the base year 1990.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911419343">7</xref></sup> Developing countries, on their part, have improved their health infrastructure, trained a large number of health care providers and disseminated health education information through mass media communication strategies and community health workers and volunteers. Consequently, the mortality of children under five years of age has declined from 11.9 million in 1990 to about 7.7 million in 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911419343">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911419343"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911419343">10</xref></sup> Millions of children, however, continue to be exposed to such diseases as polio because of incomplete vaccination or delayed completion of vaccination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911419343">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911419343">12</xref></sup> Many mothers in developing countries do not see the connection between immunization and prevention of diseases; some believe that vaccination is for sick children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896911419343">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911419343">14</xref></sup> In this paper we examine if women’s empowerment increases child immunization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0017896911419343">
<title>Conceptual framework</title>
<p>We begin with a premise that women’s empowerment – in terms of their socioeconomic status, reproductive health status and their relative position within the gender system – is central to improving child health. Nobel laureate, Amartya Sen proposed capabilities approach to development and argued that nations should be judged based on their citizens’ capabilities to exercise their full potential so that each person may realize his/her maximum functioning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911419343">15</xref></sup> Martha Nussbaum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911419343">16</xref></sup> identifies gender inequality as the most important barrier to development; with examples of women from India, she explaines how women’s full potential is undermined due to unequal power structures between gender. Naila Kabeer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896911419343">17</xref></sup> urges that the process of women’s empowerment must improve their socio-economic status, health status and power within the gender system. Some of the widely-used indicators of socio-economic empowerment include women’s education, income and employment; indicators of reproductive health empowerment include women’s knowledge about sexually-transmitted diseases and their ability to decide when to get married, when to have children, and how many children to have; and indicators of women’s relative position or exercise of power within the gender system include their ability to make decisions at the community level, financial and purchasing decisions for small and large items at the household level, and their ability to exercise mobility choices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896911419343">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911419343"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896911419343">20</xref></sup> Using many of these measures of women’s empowerment, we hypothesize that an increase in women’s empowerment will increase their children’s vaccination.</p>
<p>In addition, according to Andersen’s behavioural model of health service use, service utilization is a function of three sets of individual characteristics: predisposing and enabling characteristics to use health services, perceived and evaluated need for health care services, and personal health practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896911419343">21</xref></sup> In this paper, we controlled for some of the indicators of predisposing, enabling, need, and health risk behaviour before examining the effect of women’s empowerment on child immunization in Nepal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0017896911419343" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>We analyzed the 2006 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) that interviewed a nationally-representative sample of 10,793 women between the ages of 15 and 49 from 8,707 households across Nepal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0017896911419343">22</xref></sup> The Survey asked child immunization questions to 4,182 mothers who had given birth in the past five years. As the eight vaccines were to be dispensed within 12 months of age, we selected only the mothers whose first child was 12–23 months of age. This resulted in a sample of 1,112 mothers. Of these, 1,056 women answered questions about vaccination status of their children. We used these 1,056 women in our analysis.</p>
<sec id="section9-0017896911419343">
<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>We utilized five dichotomous dependent variables. They included whether or not a child had received (confirmed by immunization card or mother’s reports):</p>
<list id="list1-0017896911419343" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Full immunization – coded as 1 if a child was immunized with all eight doses of vaccines (one dose of BCG, three doses of DPT, three doses of Polio vaccine, and one dose of measles vaccine); otherwise the variable was coded as 0.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>BCG immunization – coded as 1 if a child had received one dose of BCG vaccine; otherwise the variable received a value of 0.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>DPT immunization – received a value of 1 if a child had all three doses of DPT vaccines; otherwise it was coded as 0.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Polio immunization – received a value of 1 if a child had three recommended doses of Polio vaccines; otherwise the variable received a value of 0.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Measles immunization – received a value of 1 if a child had one dose of vaccine against measles; otherwise it was coded 0.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0017896911419343">
<title>Independent (empowerment) variables</title>
<p>A set of women’s empowerment variables included women’s age at birth of first child, age gap between husband/partner and herself, women’s formal education, their knowledge about sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), their attitude toward wife beating and their role in intra-household financial, health care and mobility decisions. Age at birth of first child was a continuous variable. Age gap was calculated by subtracting a mother’s age from her husband or partner’s age. Education included three dummy variables: no formal education, primary education (one to five years of schooling), or secondary and above (sixth grade and beyond). Women who had heard <italic>about STD or AIDS</italic> were coded as 1 and those who had not were coded as 0. Attitude towards wife beating was constructed by combining responses to five items: sometimes a husband is annoyed or angered by things that his wife does. In your opinion, is a husband justified in hitting or beating his wife in the following situations: (1) If she goes out without telling him?; (2) If she neglects the children?; (3) If she argues with him?; (4) If she refuses to have sex with him?; (5) If she burns the food? If the answer was ‘yes’ to any one of these items, the variable was coded 1, otherwise it was coded 0. Financial, health and mobility decisions variable included the responses to the following items: (1) Who usually makes decisions about health care for you?; (2) Who usually makes decisions about making major household purchases?; (3) Who usually makes decisions about making purchases for daily household needs?; (4) Who usually makes decisions about visits to your family or relatives? If women made decisions or if their opinion was considered in making decisions in any one of these items, they were coded as 1; otherwise they were coded as 0.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0017896911419343">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>A list of predisposing, enabling, needs and health risk behaviour variables were controlled. Predisposing variables included age, gender of household head, caste, and religion. Age was a continuous variable measured in years. Household head was coded as 1 for female and 0 for male. Caste and ethnicity was dummy coded into three variables: (1) Chhetri and Brahmin (generally economically privileged); (2) occupational caste; and (3) indigenous (Newar, Gurung, Magar, Tamang/Sherpa, Rai/Limbu, Muslim/Churaute, Tharu/Rajbanshi, Yadav/Ahir, other hill origin, and other terai origin). Religion was coded as 1 for Hindu and 0 for other (Buddhist, Muslim, Christian, and other).</p>
<p>Enabling variables included ecological region, development region, household’s wealth index and five barriers to health service use. Ecological region included three dummy variables: mountain, hill and Terai. Development region included five dummy coded administrative regions: eastern, central, western, mid-western and far-western development regions. For wealth index, the NDHS 2006 data classified households into five wealth categories: poorest, poorer, middle, richer and richest using a wide range of household asset data including ownership of a number of consumer items ranging from a television to a bicycle or car, as well as dwelling characteristics, such as source of drinking water, sanitation facilities and type of material used for flooring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0017896911419343">22</xref></sup> We recoded this variable into two dummy variables – poor and not poor class. The poor class combined the poorest and the poorer and the not poor class included the rest of the categories: middle, richer and the richest. For barriers to service use, we utilized the following questions: ‘many different factors can prevent women from getting medical advice or treatment for themselves. When you are sick and want to get medical advice or treatment, is each of the following a big problem or not?’ The sub-questions include: <italic>getting money needed for treatment; the distance to the health facility; concern that there may not be any health provider; concern that there may not be a female health provider; concern that there may be no drugs available; having to take transport; not wanting to go alone; and concern about security</italic>. Women who answered affirmatively to <italic>money or cost of health</italic> care being a big problem were coded as 1 and those who answered otherwise were coded as 0. If distance was a big problem they were coded as 1; otherwise they were coded as 0. For <italic>quality of health facility</italic> women who expressed concern that there may not be any health provider or a female health provider or prescription drugs, were coded as 1; all others were coded as 0. If <italic>transportation to a health facility</italic> was a big problem, the variable transportation was coded as 1; otherwise it was coded as 0. Finally, a variable security was constructed to represent if women indicated a big concern of having to go alone or were concerned about their security (yes = 1; else = 0).</p>
<p>Needs variables included women’s health and their use of pregnancy and birth-related services including their <italic>anemia status</italic>, whether or not they received <italic>antenatal care</italic>, and whether or not they delivered at a health facility. <italic>Anemia</italic> was measured at four levels: 1 = ‘severe’ to 4 = ‘not anemic.’ We recoded this variable (anemic = 1; not anemic = 0). Women who did not use any <italic>antenatal services</italic> during pregnancy were coded as 0 and those who made at least one visit were coded as 1. Women who <italic>delivered at a health facility</italic> were coded as 1, and those who gave birth at home were coded as 0.</p>
<p>Health-risk behaviour captured women’s <italic>smoking behaviour</italic>; women who smoked cigarettes, pipes, used tobacco, snuff or other tobacco-related products were coded as 1; otherwise they were coded as 0.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0017896911419343">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>We conducted weighted descriptive and logistic regression analyses using STATA. Missing values were imputed using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Multiple Imputation for continuous data, a method considered to produce the least biased estimates for categorical variables in logistic regression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896911419343">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896911419343">24</xref></sup> We included all the variables used in our analyses to produce imputation estimates for missing values. For our final estimates, we used the average of 10 imputations, which is known to be 95% efficient even if 50% of information were missing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896911419343">24</xref></sup> Imputed values were used in logistic regression without rounding, as several authors have found this approach to cause less estimation bias than rounded data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0017896911419343">25</xref></sup> Results of imputed and observed data were similar implying that there were no unusual patterns in imputed data. The model with BCG vaccination as a dependent variable was dropped; as BCG was given right after birth, it perfectly correlated with another independent variable, delivery.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0017896911419343" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the children, 17% had not received the recommended eight vaccines. Seven per cent, 11%, 9% and 15% of all children had not received complete doses of BCG, DPT, polio, and measles shots respectively (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0017896911419343">Table 1</xref>). On average, women were four years younger than their husbands, and were 19 years of age at the birth of their first child. Almost a third of these mothers had not heard about STDs or AIDS and 56% lacked formal education. About 22% of the women thought that it was appropriate for husbands to beat their wives if they did not follow the instructions of their husbands and 56% were involved in financial, health care, and mobility decisions.</p>

<p>To assess the correlation between women’s empowerment and child vaccination, the latter was regressed on the former, controlling for other characteristics (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0017896911419343">Table 2</xref>). Of the five indicators of empowerment, education was significantly associated with child immunization in all models. Compared to children of mothers without education, children of those with secondary education were 5.91 times as likely to receive all eight vaccinations, 4.32 times as likely to receive all three doses of DPT, 6.56 times as likely to receive all three doses of polio, and 8.20 times as likely to receive vaccination against measles. Other indicators of empowerment – age at birth of first child, age gap between spouses, women’s knowledge about STDs/AIDS, their opinion towards wife beating and their ability to make financial, health, and mobility decisions – were insignificant.</p>

<p>Among the control variables, compared to children of mothers who did not use antenatal care, children of mothers who used antenatal care were 3.31 times as likely to have received all eight vaccinations, 3.87 times as likely to have received all doses of DPT, 3.80 times as likely to have received polio vaccines, and 3.45 times as likely to have received measles vaccine. Additionally, children from privileged caste had higher odds of being vaccinated than those from an occupational caste. Interestingly, distance to health facility, cost of care, quality of care, security of care and transportation to health facility were insignificant in predicting child immunization.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>Death of millions of children is preventable through low-cost prevention and treatment measures including routine immunization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911419343">7</xref></sup> Yet a substantial number of children in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa do not receive these life-saving vaccines in time. In this paper we examined if women’s empowerment increased child vaccination. In the discussion that follows, we analyze some of the key findings.</p>
<p>First, women’s education was positively associated with child immunization. Mothers with secondary education understood the value of vaccination and were almost six times as likely to follow through the complete doses of immunization compared to their counterparts without any formal education. A strong correlation between mothers’ education and child vaccination was consistent with previous literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0017896911419343">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0017896911419343">27</xref></sup> A study comparing child mortality and mothers’ education data from 219 countries concluded that between 1970 and 2009 there were about 8.20 million fewer deaths among children younger than five years, of which 4.20 million deaths (51.2%) were averted due to improvements in educational attainment in young women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0017896911419343">28</xref></sup> The reason for such a strong positive relationship between education and health service use is not well understood. The conventional explanation is that schooling increases an individual’s cognitive, verbal, and mathematical abilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0017896911419343">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0017896911419343">30</xref></sup> It provides an individual with skills to acquire and decode new information that is critical to understand and assess the benefit of using health care services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0017896911419343">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0017896911419343">32</xref></sup> Another explanation is that education stimulates non-cognitive changes, including changes in attitudes, values, and behaviour.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0017896911419343">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0017896911419343">34</xref></sup> Women with formal education appreciate the value of deadlines, self-reliance, and have the decision-making skills, all of which play central role in health service use. Evidence shows that educated women are more likely to delay their marriage and motherhood, have fewer children, proactively seek treatment for disease prevention for themselves and for their children, and initiate child immunization and follow through until all doses of vaccines are dispensed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911419343">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0017896911419343">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0017896911419343"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0017896911419343">37</xref></sup> However, 56% of women in Nepal lack formal education. Thus, girls’ education should be contextualized within broader public health strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0017896911419343">36</xref></sup> For instance, countries that want to eradicate polio may not be able to do so without women and girls’ education.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0017896911419343">37</xref></sup> In countries where the education level of women is very poor, even when informed, women become passive users of child vaccination and may not follow through with all doses. To create a well-informed demand among mothers for vaccines that can protect their children against life-threatening diseases, the best evidence shows that we should focus on the education of women and girls.</p>
<p>Second, among the control variables, women’s use of antenatal care and child vaccination were correlated. This was not surprising given that countries with improved women’s health were also the ones with lower infant mortality rates. For example, pregnant women with poor nutrition and who were underweight were more likely to give birth to infants that were also underweight. Reaching out to pregnant women continues to be a challenge in countries like Nepal where women’s use of prenatal, delivery and postnatal care services is pitifully low, needing more proactive measures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0017896911419343">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Third, previous studies indicate that cost of health care, quality of care, and distance to health facility are barriers to child immunization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911419343">14</xref></sup> Our study, however, did not find these to be the barriers to child immunization after controlling for women’s empowerment variables. Nepal’s expanded primary health care centres with outreach programmes, mobile teams and increased vaccination coverage may have overcome these barriers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0017896911419343">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, this study has a number of limitations. First, we focused on compliance to four vaccines against BCG, DPT, polio and measles. The international health organizations now recommend that children receive several additional vaccines including Hepatitis B and A, MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine), Japanese Encephalitis, Typhoid, Meningococcal AC, and Hib (Haemophilus influenza type b).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911419343">14</xref></sup> More vaccines are in the recommended pipeline. Future studies should include compliance to these additional vaccines. Second, delayed vaccinations are known to expose children to various diseases. We did not examine the proportion of children that were immunized on a delayed schedule. Finally, we only examined the vaccination of the first born child. Future studies should examine if there is any connection between the adherence to vaccination of first child and subsequent children.</p>
<p>In spite of these limitations, our study overcomes at least one weakness noted in earlier studies. Previous studies that utilized official reports of child immunization have questioned their validity in assessing immunization coverage. For example, a study analyzing data from 45 countries between 1990 and 2000 concluded that officially-reported child vaccination coverage was higher than the results derived from household surveys in these countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0017896911419343">39</xref></sup> Another study from Nepal found that the official record of immunization was overestimated by 31% for BCG, 44% for DPT, 155% for polio, and 71% for measles vaccination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0017896911419343">40</xref></sup> These studies recommended that the household surveys were more credible measures of child vaccination coverage than official reports that relied on the information recorded by service providers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0017896911419343">39</xref></sup> We used household survey data; thus our results are more reliable than studies that used official records.</p>
