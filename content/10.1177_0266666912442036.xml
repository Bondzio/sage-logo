<title>Arab Parliamentary Libraries Network established</title>
<p>The first regional meeting of Arab parliamentary libraries was held at the Arab Institute for Parliamentary Training and Legislative Studies in Beirut, Lebanon, Jan. 19–20, and attended by librarians and research staff from the parliaments of Algeria, Bahrain, Djibouti, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates. The participants laid the groundwork for the creation of the new Arab Parliamentary Libraries Network (APLN), drafting the Network’s constitution, electing the Network’s executive committee, and devised a plan of action for future development. </p>

<title>FAIFE Spotlights</title>
<p>FAIFE Spotlights focus on urgent events and give a fresh analysis of freedom of speech issues. Spotlights are written by FAIFE Committee Members, the Chair or other experts in order to draw attention to an emerging situation. Recent spotlights include the following:</p>

<title>Policing the Internet is not a Job for a Corporation. Hanna Nikkanen</title>
<p>In light of recent legislation in the US (SOPA and PIPA), and a decision in the Netherlands that orders Dutch ISPs to block access to the Pirate Bay website, this new FAIFE Spotlight by Finnish journalist Hanna Nikkanen is very timely. In it, she explores the dangers of threatening private companies with fines if they do not enforce strict bans on access to copyrighted material – and points how that when complying with such rulings these companies will almost certainly interpret the law in a more restrictive manner than necessary in order to protect themselves from the financial consequences of not doing so. The end result is that punishing the providers of communications infrastructure for making available copyright-violating material instead of the actual culprits will end up exposing innocent internet users to side effects that infringe on their basic rights – such as restrictions on freedom of speech.</p>

<title>The problem of blasphemy and defamation of religion laws. Paul Sturges</title>
<p>Precisely on the day the first words of this Spotlight were written, a newspaper story reported that in a court in Tomsk, Siberia, state prosecutors have filed a case seeking to ban the Bhagavad Gita on the grounds that it is extremist and insults non-believers. At the same time, Hare Krishna members have demonstrated against this outside the Russian consulate in Kolkata and in the Indian parliament ministers have called the case an insult to Lord Krishna. (Guardian, 2011) What is happening here? To a detached observer, it seems to be that in Tomsk we have an official move to censor a religious document on the grounds that it is offensive to believers in other religions, and maybe also an incitement to mistreatment of some kind directed at those believers. At the same time we have in Kolkata an attempt to prevent this on the grounds that the legal process is an insult to a possibly mythological, but certainly long dead, object of religious devotion. There may also be an implication here that the process is a threat to believers.</p>

<title>Jordan to be centre of Arab science e-network</title>
<p>
<italic>Farah Atyyat. 23 January 2012</italic>
</p>
<p>Jordan has been chosen to be the ‘brain’ of an Arab science network that, it is hoped, will get scientists across seven countries talking and collaborating with each other. The country will become the hub of new regional science collaborations and the launch pad for projects to get research institutes within countries much better connected through broadband Internet. Jordan's role was announced in the first annual meeting of the Arab States Research and Education Network (ASREN) in Amman last month (12–14 December).</p>
<p>The Amman conference also called for the acceleration of the third phase of the EUMEDCONNECT project, which connects nations' research and education networks. The first and second phases of EUMEDCONNECT, which began in 2004, concentrated on linking Mediterranean researchers with their European counterparts, with the third phase extending this connectivity to Arab countries.</p>
<p>ASREN's member countries are Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Palestine, Syria and Tunisia. The initiative was launched in December 2010 under the patronage of the League of Arab States, the Talal Abu-Ghazaleh Organization and the UN Global Alliance for ICT and Development (UN-GAID).</p>

<title>Software apps for African farmers win prizes</title>
<p>
<italic>Gilbert Nakweya. 8 February 2012</italic>
</p>
<p>The increasing use of software applications (widely known as apps) in solving Africans' problems has been highlighted by the three winning entries of the Apps4Africa: Climate Challenge contest. The regional competition encourages participants to address local climate change challenges through the development of web-based and mobile applications in the East African region.</p>
<p>The first prize, worth US$15,000, was awarded to Grainy Bunch, a national supply chain management system which monitors the purchase, storage, distribution and consumption of grain across Tanzania. It was followed by the Mkulima Calculator team from Kenya, who won US$7,000 for an application designed to help farmers know when to plant crops and how to select suitable crops for a particular location using climate and weather data. Agro Universe, a mobile and web-based application from Uganda, took the third prize of US$3,000. The contest was supported by the US Department of State.</p>

<title>Creating stronger links</title> <p>

</p>
<p>At the heart of the value chain concept is the idea of farmers, traders, processors and distributors working to produce and deliver goods and services to consumers, adding value at each stage. The difference between this and a traditional marketing chain is that value chain activities are coordinated, with considerable collaboration throughout the process. ICT developments are moving so fast that it is difficult to predict how value chains will be using them in the coming years. However, we must be wary of being totally seduced by what technology has to offer. ICTs are only as good as the information they communicate.</p>

<title>The value of communication</title> <p>
<italic>Bjorn Furuholt and Edmund Matotay</italic>
</p>
<p>Improved access to cell phones has resulted in great changes through the entire cycle of farming life and along every link of the value chain. More than any other technology, cell phones have spread at a breathtaking rate in developing countries. The immense potential that mobile technology has for development cannot be over-emphasized. Our educated guess is that mobile technology will quickly grow to make the Internet affordable even for poor people in rural Africa, helping them to become citizens of the Global Village in the near future.</p>

<p>A project to improve environmental conditions for farmers in West Africa is developing a voice-based market information system. The Web Alliance for Regreening in Africa intends to develop the system further to create a speech-operated world wide web. Voice-based services may bring new opportunities for people to exchange information about regreening activities, or about prices at the local market, about health or legal issues, local news or about music and entertainment. </p>
