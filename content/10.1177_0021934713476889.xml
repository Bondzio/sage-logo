<abstract>
<p>Utilizing a comparative and historical perspective, we interrogate claims of progress focusing on low-wage Black and White women workers from 1970 to 2000. We begin by offering a historical perspective on occupational segregation by race and gender, which informs the evaluation of low-wage Black women’s occupational progress. We then situate Black women’s occupational attainment since 1970 within the larger context of labor market restructuring, which fundamentally changed the occupational landscape. We find no evidence that industrial and occupational upgrading among low-wage Black women, particularly in the South, from 1970 to 2000 narrowed the racial wage gap among low-wage women. The wage gap between low-wage Black and White women declined because of larger changes in the American economy, which reduced the quality of those jobs, eroding the wage advantage that White women in the white-collar service sector once enjoyed.</p>

<p>Inaccurate perceptions plague Black women in the labor market. They are conceived of either as professionals who are “widely thought to have advanced and even surpassed White women and Black men due to affirmative action” or as “nonworking welfare queens” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021934713476889">Harley &amp; the Black Women and Work Collective, 2002</xref>, p. 9). In truth, both depictions are false. The vast majority of Black women are neither professionals nor members of the “undeserving” poor. Black women work in large numbers, constitute a large segment of the working poor, and face occupational choices that are restricted by their race and gender. Evaluating recent claims of progress for Black women requires that we study the experiences of Black women who fall in the large territory between well-paid professionals and the nonworking poor. Evaluating Black women’s progress also demands that we adopt a comparative approach. Black women’s occupational restriction occurred in tandem with an expansion in opportunities for White women, so an examination of their progress must consider the experiences of White women as well. By failing to consider the question of Black women’s progress in tandem with that of White women, our understanding has remained incomplete.</p>
<p>Finally, evaluating Black women’s progress requires that we incorporate a historical perspective that considers the severity of their occupational restriction and the historical basis for their division from White women. Occupational sex segregation has historically meant that Black and White women were limited to the same secondary segments of the labor market; but racial discrimination confined Black women to jobs that were dirty, unskilled, and insecure, while preserving jobs that were clean, semiskilled, and steady for White women. The extent to which this historical relationship between Black and White women’s work has been eroded rather than maintained is a key yardstick of progress.</p>
<p>In this article we interrogate claims of Black women’s progress by adopting a comparative and historical perspective focusing on Black and White women workers from 1970 to 2000. We begin by offering a historical perspective on occupational segregation by race and gender, which informs the evaluation of low-wage Black women’s occupational progress. We then situate Black women’s occupational attainment since 1970 within the larger context of labor market restructuring that fundamentally changed the occupational landscape. We conceptualize progress in terms of two related questions—progress for whom and progress to what—and argue that occupational attainment must be evaluated alongside earnings attainment to gain a full picture of labor market progress.</p>

<title>Historical Relationships of Domination and Subordination</title>
<p>From the fall of slavery to the dawn of the civil rights era, many aspects of American labor changed. Blacks were transformed from coerced laborers to free laborers. Conceptions of women’s work expanded from domestic service to include manufacturing, trade, and clerical occupations, as well as the teaching and nursing professions. Agricultural labor decreased in its importance due to the rise of the industrial factory, and increasing industrialization made some occupational roles obsolete. However, during this period of transformation, Black women’s labor remained conspicuously unchanged.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021934713476889">Table 1</xref> illustrates the stubbornly tenacious nature of discrimination. Domestic service was the core of Black women’s work since they were largely excluded from desirable jobs in the professions, clerical work, and the factory. Nearly 40% of Black women were employed as domestic servants in 1960, more than were employed after Emancipation in 1870, while the majority of White women had long departed. Black women’s limited occupational opportunity is all the more damning given their longer tenure in the labor market. It was customary for White women to leave the labor force upon marriage, but this custom did not extend to Black women both by necessity and choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021934713476889">Katzman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021934713476889">Landry, 2000</xref>). Hence, the severely limited occupational picture for Black women represents their lack of choices over the life course, while the majority of White working women were young and unmarried. Across all occupational categories the majority of Black women in 1960 labored in roles similar to those performed nearly a century earlier, whereas the occupational distribution of White women changed significantly over this time. While race and gender were central to defining labor roles at the turn of the century, the intersection of race and gender led to a circumscribed opportunity structure for Black women that facilitated their exploitation for decades afterward.</p>

<p>Occupational discrimination in America was the de facto and de jure standard. In the tobacco industry, for instance, historical patterns of racial domination and subordination were re-created in the new industrial setting. Blacks were restricted to “heavy or manual jobs” in part of the factory, “while whites monopolized the mechanical and supervisory parts of the process in cigarette departments” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021934713476889">Janiewski, 1990a</xref>, p. 763). However, both race and gender intersected, creating divergent work roles for Black and White women. Nearly all Black women employed in the tobacco industry in the 1920s and 1930s were “confined to the prefabrication department where they performed the ‘dirty’ jobs—sorting, cleaning, and stemming tobacco”; White women “had cleaner jobs in the manufacturing and packing department as they caught, inspected, and packed the tobacco” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021934713476889">Jones, 1990</xref>, p. 808).</p>
<p>Other employers, such as those in the textile industry, made no attempt to integrate their workforce even on an unequal scale; instead, they recruited White women exclusively promising White southerners that “work in the mills would not subject young women to degrading conditions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021934713476889">Janiewski, 1990b</xref>, p. 789). The tobacco industry faced similar constraints when employing White women, deploying them only in work roles that were suitable for “respectable ladies,” while no such constraint applied to the use of Black women’s labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021934713476889">Janiewski, 1990a</xref>, p. 763).</p>
<p>In the meatpacking industry, concentrated in Chicago over this same period, discrimination was so pervasive it was taken for granted. Black women were retained only for their reliability during labor strikes and their “willingness to do the dirty work,” which other women would not do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021934713476889">Herbst, 1932</xref>, p. 75). White women were engaged in finishing roles, such as preparing sliced bacon since public scrutiny deemed only White hands as suitable for handling the meat. But even this rationale is subterfuge since no reason was needed to prohibit the employment of Black women, as the following passage illustrates:
<disp-quote>
<p>Sliced bacon is one of the products in which the firm takes great pride; no expense is spared in its manufacture and distribution. Visitors, including all foreign guests and personal friends of the management, are always taken to the room in which the bacon is handled. The walls are painted white and the workers are clad in white. The employment secretary could find no other reason for excluding Negroes than that the picture might seem prettier to visitors if it were all white. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021934713476889">Herbst, 1932</xref>, p. 76)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This degree of blatant discrimination was common across industries until it was vociferously challenged in 1964. Prior to this smaller victories had been due to union intervention or civil suits, particularly after the desegregation victory of <italic>Brown v. Board of Education</italic> in 1954 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021934713476889">Honey, 1999</xref>, pp. 150-154). Evelyn Bates, a Black woman who had worked as a factory worker for Firestone tire manufacturing, describes the change as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>The integration of jobs happened after the Supreme Court decision in ’54. Before that, Black womens couldn’t be on the beads or nothing like that. Only thing a black woman could do in Firestone was sweep, work on the line doing heavy work like I was talking about, work up on the belt sweeping, where all that lampblack was, or clean the restrooms as a maid. They had a few black womens up in the cafeteria, on the black side. The white worked on the white side. That’s all a black woman could do before they integrated the jobs. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021934713476889">Honey, 1999</xref>, pp. 104-105)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Across industries the degree of discrimination by race and gender was consistent, yet “the lowest wages and worst working conditions in industry were often preferable to domestic work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021934713476889">Newman, 1990</xref>, p. 939). These types of occupations, unskilled industrial jobs or domestic service, characterized the occupational opportunities for the majority of employed Black women through 1960.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1960, Black women began to enter modern occupations, such as nonhousehold service and clerical work, which had long been mainstays of White women’s employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021934713476889">Branch, 2011</xref>). The new opportunities deriving from the Civil Rights Act notwithstanding, Black women were initially relegated to “low-paying, low-status jobs in the clerical and service occupations,” mirroring historical patterns of racial stratification among women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021934713476889">Fosu, 1993</xref>, p. 68). By the 1980s, Black women’s concentration in the nonhousehold service sector exceeded that of White women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021934713476889">Harley &amp; the Black Women and Work Collective, 2002</xref>, p. 9), and the degree of segregation they experienced within the service sector diminished as all low-skill service jobs decreased both in wages and in prestige. Evidence of economic progress among Black women workers in the form of reduced occupational segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021934713476889">Hewitt, 2000</xref>), narrowed earnings gaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021934713476889">Ihlanfeldt &amp; Sjoquist, 2000</xref>), and rising median earnings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021934713476889">Browne &amp; Tigges, 2000</xref>) is particularly strong in the South, where Black women workers historically faced the gravest barriers to labor market equality. Ostensive indications of progress notwithstanding, the question remains to what extent and in what ways these trends together indicate progress for Black women workers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0021934713476889">
<title>Defining Progress: Progress for Whom? Progress to What?</title>
<p>Given the severity of Black women’s historical occupational restriction, how should we define Black women’s progress? If we simply analyze change over time, comparing pre-1964 to the present, we persist in the unilateral tradition of examining Black women’s progress in isolation. Black women’s occupational restriction occurred in tandem with an expansion in opportunities for White women, so an examination of their progress must compare their experiences to those of White women. Rather than focus on change among professional and skilled laborers, we focus on the subset of workers, both Black and White, for whom the question of progress is perhaps most pertinent, low-wage workers.</p>
<p>Domestic service, the single largest occupational category in which Black women were represented through 1960, gradually became obsolete over the next 30 years. This necessitated a shift in Black women’s occupational placement but not necessarily their advancement. We must rethink the implications of occupational attainment in light of a changing structure of industrial and occupational opportunities to determine whether low-wage Black women simply traded one devalued labor market position for another.</p>
<p>We must also situate low-wage Black and White women’s experiences in the larger context of American labor market restructuring. The proliferation of the service sector, decline of manufacturing, and increase in the returns to education have significantly altered, if not erased, the path for semi- and unskilled workers to exit poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021934713476889">Morris &amp; Western, 1999</xref>). Southern labor markets were unique in adding service and manufacturing jobs during this period, improving opportunities, but the relatively good fortunes of southern low-wage workers in the 1970s were not sustained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021934713476889">Hartshorn &amp; Ihlanfeldt, 2000</xref>). The overall economic picture that emerges from these changes is bleak for all low-skill and low-wage workers, but particularly for Black women, the majority of whom had only recently escaped low-wage jobs in 1970 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021934713476889">Horton, Allen, Herring, &amp; Thomas, 2000</xref>). We need to examine occupations and earnings in tandem as indicators of progress. Inasmuch as Black women have traded historically bad jobs such as domestic service for contemporary bad jobs in the nonhousehold service sector, we cannot define such movement as true progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021934713476889">Kalleberg, Reskin, &amp; Hudson, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the post–civil rights era of greater occupational access for Blacks coincided with near universal decline in the opportunities available to low-wage workers. Black women were among the last hired, even in good economic times. Did their occupational marginalization shift over time? Historically employers were explicit in their preference for White labor, which made Black women laborers of last resort. While illegal in the post–civil rights era, employer preferences still influence the allocation of workers to jobs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021934713476889">Kaufman (2002)</xref> found that in the absence of a skill constraint, “employers meet employment needs by hiring their preferred group” consistent with the queuing perspective (p. 565).</p>
<p>Queuing theory suggests that within the labor force, employers order workers according to their desirability/attractiveness in what is referred to as a labor queue. The ordering of the groups is not random but coincides with other structures in society such as race and gender. A labor queue determines how occupational opportunity will be distributed. “The best jobs go to the most preferred workers, and less attractive jobs go to workers lower in the labor queue; bottom-ranked workers may go jobless, and the worst jobs may be left unfilled” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021934713476889">Reskin &amp; Roos, 1990</xref>, p. 30). However, a “mismatch” between the number of prospective workers from a particular group and corresponding level of jobs can cause an occupation’s composition to change, granting formerly excluded groups access to desirable jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021934713476889">Reskin &amp; Roos, 1990</xref>, p. 34).</p>
<p>While it is not possible to directly measure the labor queue, measuring the share of the labor force that is women, Black women, and immigrant women enables us to tap into queuing dynamics. The queuing perspective predicts a positive association between the labor force share of women and racial earnings inequality because when the supply of desirable “sex-typed” jobs exceeds the availability of corresponding male workers, employers are forced to use women workers, increasing earnings inequality and competition among low-wage women.</p>
<p>In contrast, the queuing perspective predicts a negative association between Black women’s labor force share and racial earnings inequality because when the supply of desirable “racially typed” jobs exceeds the availability of corresponding White workers, employers are forced to use workers lower in the labor queue, granting Black women workers access to “White women’s jobs” and decreasing the earnings differences between White and Black women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021934713476889">Kaufman, 2002</xref>). Finally, we control for immigrant women’s labor force share since their presence in the labor market will likely affect the queuing dynamics we aim to observe. To the extent that the data observed confirm our hypotheses as to the racialized and gendered labor practices of employers, Black women’s progress remains elusive.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0021934713476889">
<title>Data and Measures</title>
<p>Data for this study are drawn from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) 1% sample for 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021934713476889">Ruggles et al., 2009</xref>). The sample is restricted to metropolitan residents aged 18 to 64 who reported nonzero earnings; both full- and part-time workers are included. The data were constructed by aggregating individual-level observations to the metropolitan level, and each metropolitan labor market is measured at four points in time. Since these are U.S. Census Bureau data, individuals are not repeated across time, prohibiting the analysis of individual-level earnings growth and decline. Aggregating to the metropolitan level allows us to overcome this limitation and observe trends in local labor markets’ low-wage earnings levels. The resulting sample consists of 80 metropolitan areas (<italic>N</italic> = 80 metropolitan statistical areas [MSAs] × 4 years = 320) and is biased toward large metropolitan areas, particularly those large enough in 1970 to be identified by the census.</p>
<p>Low-wage workers are defined as those workers whose hourly earnings fall at or below the 10th percentile. This is a conservative measure of low-wage work insofar as many workers with hourly earnings above the 10th percentile experience material hardship, but the measure has the benefit of pinpointing the types of work that Black women have traditionally dominated and which have undergone the most dramatic transformation, allowing us to interrogate the changing relationship between labor market positions and rewards.</p>
<p>Census respondents are not asked to estimate their hourly earnings, so we perform a series of calculations to approximate hourly compensation. Respondents estimate their total wage and/or salary income for the previous year as well as the number of weeks worked and usual number of hours worked per week. These variables were used to estimate hourly earnings, which are adjusted for inflation by converting to 2002 dollars using the Consumer Price Index research series (CPI-U-RS $2002). Outliers (i.e., those earning less than $0.50 or more than $100 per hour in 1989 dollars) were trimmed, following the procedures described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021934713476889">Mishel, Bernstein, and Shierholz (2009)</xref>.</p>
<p>We begin by examining trends in low-wage Black and White women’s labor force participation, reliance on low-wage work, and industrial and occupational employment with a focus on regional variation to demonstrate how late industrial development and large numbers of Black women workers distinguish southern labor markets. We then turn to a multivariate analysis in which metropolitan area is the unit of analysis, and the White-Black racial wage gap among low-wage women is the dependent variable.</p>
<p>We construct this variable by identifying Black and White women whose earnings fall below the national 10th percentile, calculate their average hourly earnings in each metropolitan area, and compute the ratio of White and Black women’s earnings. The racial wage gap among low-wage women is a good indicator of Black women’s progress because it captures a dimension of labor market rewards with clear implications for Black women’s material well-being, while maintaining the focus on comparing low-wage White and Black women’s experiences, allowing us to ask whether changes in Black women’s industrial and occupational employment truly amount to progress.</p>
<p>We use multilevel modeling to examine the wage gap between low-wage White and Black women in each metropolitan labor market in each year. The purpose of the models is to determine whether and to what extent industrial and occupational changes improve Black women’s wages relative to White women’s, which would reduce the low-wage racial wage gap. Black women’s industrial employment is measured as their share of local employment in 11 industry groups: agriculture; manufacturing; transportation-communication; wholesale trade; retail trade; finance, insurance, real estate; business services; repair services; entertainment services; professional services; and public administration. Black women’s occupational employment is measured as their share of local employment in 7 occupational categories: professional, managers, owners, nonmanagerial white collar (NMWC), skilled blue collar, semi- and unskilled blue collar (SUBC), and operatives.</p>
<p>In order to observe the effects of changing industrial and occupational attainment on the wage gap, we first model the racial wage gap among low-wage women as a function of labor force composition and human capital, controlling for labor market population size (ln) and the local unemployment rate. We expect the composition of the labor force to affect the racial wage gap through the differential allocation of workers to jobs when labor force composition shifts across metropolitan areas, enabling or restricting the ability of employers to act on their preferences to fill jobs that are often typed by gender and race (see queuing hypotheses above). Hence, we measured labor force composition three ways, as the share of local employment composed by Black women, women, and immigrant women.</p>
<p>Next we consider the effects of Black and White women’s educational attainment on the racial wage gap among low-wage women. We operationalize educational attainment for each group as the share of working-age adults in each labor market who are White or Black women with high school, some college, and at least college education; less than high school education is the omitted category. We expect increased educational attainment among White women to increase the racial wage gap among low-wage women and increased educational attainment among Black women to lower it.</p>
<p>We use growth curve analysis with hierarchical linear modeling to examine the determinants of each metropolitan area’s low-wage racial wage gap among women in each year. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0021934713476889">Equations 1</xref> through <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-0021934713476889">4</xref> summarize the multilevel model used to evaluate the effects of Black women’s industrial and occupational employment on the low-wage racial wage gap for women:</p>

<p>The intercept in these models can be interpreted as the White-Black racial wage gap among low-wage women in an average metropolitan labor market in 1970. Slope coefficients capture time, or the rate of growth, in this wage gap for an average MSA from 1970 to 2000. We allow the estimate of low-wage women’s racial wage gap in 1970 (intercept) and its change from 1970 to 2000 (slope) to vary across southern and non-southern metropolitan areas because the historical inequalities and late economic development that mark southern labor markets as outliers through 1970 subside dramatically over the 30-year period under study.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021934713476889">Figure 1</xref> shows a significant decline in the share of Black women workers who fall in the 10th earnings percentile, from nearly 25% in 1970 to less than 15% in 2000. Although the low-wage share of Black women workers declines steadily across the 30-year period, the most dramatic improvement is seen in the 1970s. In contrast, the low-wage share of White women changed only slightly from approximately 15% in 1970 to about 10% in 2000. White women’s concentration in low-wage work marginally increased in the 1970s, dropped slightly in 1980s, and declined most sharply in the 1990s.</p>

<p>These national trends mask significant regional variation. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021934713476889">Table 2</xref> shows Black and White women’s rates of labor force participation and low-wage work in 1970 and the change in those rates through 2000, by region. Black women’s labor force participation rates were higher than White women’s in all regions in 1970, but by 2000 White women’s labor force participation rates exceeded Black women’s in every region except the South. This is notable since the increase in White women’s labor force participation rates did not accompany an increase in their low-wage share, which actually declined over this period.</p>

<p>White women’s concentration in low-wage work is comparable across regions, varying from 11.6% in the Northeast to 15.7% in the South in 1970, and converging at about 10% in all regions by 2000. While Black women’s low-wage share varied significantly across regions; more than 35% of Black women workers were low-wage workers in the South in 1970, compared with 16% to 20% in other regions. By 2000, the share of Black women who were low-wage workers declines by about 5 percentage points in the Northeast, Midwest, and West, while the South shows a dramatic 22.6 percentage point reduction. It is clear that Black women were more heavily concentrated in low-wage work than White women in each region throughout this time period, but the gap between White and Black women’s low-wage representation does narrow considerably by 2000, particularly in the South.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021934713476889">Table 2</xref> also shows, in italics, low-wage Black and White women’s average hourly earnings in 1970 and the change in their hourly earnings from 1970 to 2000, by region. Low-wage Black women earned about $4.11 per hour in the Northeast, South, and West in 1970, but only $4.00 per hour in the Midwest. While low-wage Black women’s earnings decrease in the Northeast, Midwest, and West by between $0.05 and $0.13 per hour from 1970 to 2000, they are stable in the South. Low-wage White women earned $4.46 in the Northeast, $4.43 in the South and Midwest, and $4.40 in the West in 1970 and saw their wages fall by $0.14 to $0.21 per hour by 2000. Looking at the ratio of low-wage White and Black women’s wages we see that low-wage White women have a moderate hourly earnings advantage over low-wage Black women in each region in 1970, earning $1.08 for every dollar Black women earn in the Northeast and South, $1.11 in the Midwest, and $1.05 in the West. The gap decreases slightly ($0.02 to $0.05) in the Northeast, South, and Midwest from 1970 to 2000 but is stable in the West. This marginal narrowing of the racial wage gap among low-wage women is mainly a product of White women’s earnings falling.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021934713476889">Table 3</xref> compares the industrial employment of low-wage Black and White women by region. Two industry groups are of particular interest: retail trade and personal services. Looking first at retail trade, low-wage Black women workers are significantly less concentrated in retail than low-wage White women in each region in 1970: Between 10% and 15% of low-wage Black women work in retail in 1970 compared with roughly 30% of low-wage White women workers. By 2000, more than 25% and about 35% of low-wage Black and White women, respectively, work in this sector.</p>

<p>Even more dramatic convergence is seen in low-wage White and Black women’s reliance on work in personal services, with particularly significant racial convergence in the South. While between 8% and 15% of low-wage White women were engaged in personal services work in 1970, the comparable figures for low-wage Black women ranged from about 35% in the Northeast, Midwest, and West to 46.9% in the South. Low-wage Black women dramatically reduced their reliance on personal services work in all regions from 1970 to 2000, with less than 10% of both White and Black low-wage women workers remaining in this field by 2000.</p>
<p>This pattern of dramatic racial and regional convergence is also seen in the occupational characteristics of low-wage White and Black women workers. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0021934713476889">Table 4</xref> shows the occupational employment of low-wage Black and White women by region in 1970 and change in this figure from 1970 to 2000. Across regions, 25% to 33% of low-wage White women worked in SUBC jobs in 1970, compared with 51% to 70% of low-wage Black women in the Northeast and South, respectively. By 2000, low-wage Black women remained somewhat more reliant on SUBC jobs than low-wage White women, but the gap narrowed considerably.</p>

<p>As low-wage Black women workers left SUBC jobs over this 30-year period they moved primarily into NMWC employment, which largely consists of clerical and retail sales positions. In 1970, low-wage Black women were severely underrepresented in white-collar work, particularly in the South, where only 12.8% were NMWC workers (compared with 23.7%, 21.9%, and 29.6% in the Northeast, Midwest, and West, respectively). By contrast about 40% of low-wage White women worked in NMWC jobs in each region in 1970. As low-wage White women slightly reduced their concentration in NMWC employment over the following 30 years, low-wage Black women’s access to NMWC work increased significantly. By 2000 about 40% of both White and Black low-wage women worked in this occupational group across all regions.</p>
<p>These dramatic industrial and occupational changes do suggest that there has been substantial progress for Black women, particularly in the South. However, to fully assess progress we need to determine the relationship between the industrial/occupational shifts and earnings inequality in the multivariate analysis. Hence, we model the ratio of low-wage White and Black women’s hourly earnings, or the low-wage racial wage gap among women, from 1970 to 2000, as a function of industrial and occupational attainment using growth curve analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0021934713476889">Table 5</xref>).</p>

<p>In Model 1 we see that low-wage White women earned about $1.12 an hour for every dollar low-wage Black women earned in the average metropolitan labor market in 1970. Low-wage White women’s hourly earnings advantage declined mildly, by about $0.05 per decade, with the rate of decline slowing at the end of the period.</p>
<p>In Model 2 we consider whether the racial wage gap among low-wage women varies across southern and non-southern labor markets in 1970 (intercept), and whether its growth from 1970 to 2000 (year and year-squared slope terms) varies across southern and non-southern labor markets. We do not see significant variation in the low-wage racial wage gap among women across southern and non-southern labor markets, but one aspect of Model 2 is of interest. When we control for southern region, the year growth term becomes nonsignificant, suggesting that part of the significant decline in the wage gap observed in Model 1 was actually due to regionally specific dynamics. In Model 3 we introduce our control variables. The local labor market unemployment rate and population size (ln) are both nonsignificant.</p>
<p>In Model 4 we consider the relationship between labor force composition and the racial wage gap among low-wage women. The first thing to note is that controlling for labor force composition clarifies the intercept and trend (year and year-squared terms) in these models. Controlling for labor force composition yields a higher predicted level of racial wage inequality among low-wage women in 1970 ($1.22), and we see a larger and highly significant nonlinear trend. The racial wage gap declines in the 1970s to about $1.08, continues to decline to about $1.02 by 1990, then increases slightly to $1.04 in 2000. There is no significant variation across southern and non-southern labor markets in the 1970 racial wage gap level or in the trend from 1970 to 2000.</p>
<p>Model 4 shows that Black women’s share of the labor force exerts a small but significant ($0.01) negative effect on the racial wage gap, consistent with our hypothesis, suggesting there is slightly less racial wage inequality among low-wage women in labor markets where there are large numbers of Black women in the labor force. There is also a significant positive relationship between women’s share of the labor force and the racial wage gap among low-wage women, consistent with a queuing perspective. For each percentage point that women’s share of the local labor force increases, we estimate a $0.02 increase in the racial wage gap. We observe no significant relationship between the labor force share of immigrant women and the racial wage gap.</p>
<p>In Model 5, we consider Black women’s changing human capital levels, which significantly lower levels of racial wage inequality in southern labor markets in 1970 ($1.22 in non-southern labor markets compared with $1.16 in southern labor markets). Although Black women’s educational levels do not exert a significant influence on the wage gap, their effects appear to be indirect. Controlling for Black women’s educational attainment explains much of the negative relationship we observed between the wage gap and Black women’s share of the labor force in Model 4. We suspect that as Black women increased their levels of education from 1970 to 2000 it became more difficult for employers to act on racialized and gendered preferences, granting Black women access to a wider array of jobs and eroding the negative effect initially observed. The labor force share of women continues to exert a significant positive effect on the racial wage gap among low-wage women: Each percentage point increase in women’s labor force share increases the racial wage gap among low-wage women by $0.02.</p>
<p>In Model 6, we consider White women’s human capital levels. Again, while the indicators of White women’s education levels are not themselves significant, holding White women’s educational attainment constant yields a higher predicted level of racial wage inequality in 1970 than previous models ($1.29) and a slightly sharper rate of decline (slope) from 1970 to 2000.</p>
<p>In Models 7 and 8 we examine the effects of Black women’s changing industrial and occupational employment on the wage gap between low-wage White and Black women. Overall we find that occupational attainment tells us more about the racial wage gap and Black women’s progress than industrial attainment, suggesting that occupational categories better summarize Black women’s changing employment than industrial categories. While descriptive statistics tell us that low-wage Black women transitioned from concentration in personal service industries into retail and professional/related service industries during this period, these trends appear to matter little for the racial wage gap among low-wage women. By contrast, the correlated occupational change illustrated by Black women’s movement from SUBC jobs to NMWC jobs from 1970 to 2000 significantly increases the racial wage gap among low-wage women. For each unit increase in Black women’s NMWC employment there is a $0.06 increase in the wage gap. Hence, Black women’s entry into occupations formerly dominated by White women did not improve their earnings vis-à-vis White women.</p>
<p>Controlling for Black women’s occupational attainment also clarifies a number of other relationships examined in Model 8. Much of the negative South intercept effect that was significant in previous models is explained, suggesting that variation in Black women’s occupational attainment across southern and non-southern labor markets accounted for the lower racial wage gaps we predicted in southern labor markets in 1970. In other words, if the South had not been such an outlier in terms of Black women’s occupational attainment in 1970—with 70% of southern low-wage Black women concentrated in SUBC jobs compared to about 50% elsewhere—we would have actually observed the same levels of racial wage inequality there, as compared with the lower levels of racial wage inequality in the South predicted by the previous multivariate models. We now see no significant influence of Black women’s labor force share, but the positive association between women’s labor force share and racial wage inequality among low-wage women remains significant. Finally, controlling for Black women’s occupational attainment reveals that as the local share of adults who are Black women with at least a college degree increases, racial wage inequality among low-wage women increases.</p>

<title>Conclusion: Progress and Enduring Disadvantage for Low-Wage Black Women</title>
<p>In this article we have argued that evaluating labor market progress for Black women requires adopting a historical and comparative perspective that situates Black women’s employment in the larger contexts of their severely restricted opportunity before the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the broad-reaching labor market changes after 1970. Toward that end, we have examined low-wage Black women’s work experiences and earnings from 1970 to 2000 in comparison with the work experiences and earnings of low-wage White women in order to understand changing dynamics of racial disadvantage among low-wage women.</p>
<p>Drawing on the historical experiences of Black women workers, we argued that one key measure of progress is the extent to which the division of labor between Black and White women workers no longer follows the dirty-clean, invisible-visible, blue collar–white collar divide. By this measure, the descriptive statistics in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021934713476889">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021934713476889">3</xref> show signs of real progress. Through 1970 low-wage Black women were heavily concentrated in SUBC work, particularly in personal and household services. But from 1970 to 2000 Black women moved from these notoriously race-gender-typed jobs into NMWC jobs, particularly in retail services, that had long been the exclusive domain of White women. The work experiences of low-wage Black women converge with those of low-wage White women from 1970 to 2000 for the first time in their labor histories. This convergence is particularly dramatic in the South, where low-wage Black women’s restricted opportunity was most severe through 1970.</p>
<p>Comparing low-wage Black and White women’s labor market experiences yields a picture of significant occupational progress that erodes the traditional racial division of labor among women, but that delivers few of the economic advantages formerly associated with White women’s labor market privilege. The multilevel analysis indicates that the wage gap between low-wage White and Black women does narrow from $1.12 in 1970 to $1.07 in 2000. But the narrowing racial wage gap that we observe reflects sharp earnings losses for low-wage White women nationwide, mild losses for low-wage Black women in the Northeast, Midwest, and West, and stable earnings for low-wage Black women in the South. Furthermore, our analysis of queuing dynamics suggests that when able to do so, employers are still drawing on arcane racialized and gendered labor practices to allocate workers to available jobs.</p>
<p>We find no evidence that industrial and occupational upgrading among low-wage Black women from 1970 to 2000 narrowed the racial wage gap among low-wage women. The wage gap between low-wage Black and White women declined because of larger changes in the American economy, which reduced the quality of those jobs and eroded the wage advantage that White women in the white-collar service sector once enjoyed. Increasing reliance on white-collar work and declining wage gaps among low-wage White and Black women therefore represent a certain degree of progress for Black women, but the larger story that we see unfold from 1970 to 2000 is really one of stagnant or declining wages for all low-wage workers. We thus conclude that low-wage Black women workers have, in the post–civil rights period, experienced real progress, but concurrent labor market changes altered the terrain of economic security and made their hard-won progress tenuous at best.</p>
