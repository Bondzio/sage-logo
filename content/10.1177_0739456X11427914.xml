<abstract>
<p>We investigate whether the design of the built environment encourages walking above and beyond individuals’ attitudes toward walking. With data from a regional travel survey, we use regression analyses to examine differences in neighborhood walking trips among residents with positive and negative attitudes toward walking. The results show that built and social environment factors have a differential impact on walking trips depending on a person’s walking attitudes. Therefore, strategies to promote positive walking attitudes should be pursued in tandem with land use policies to encourage neighborhood walking.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>After decades of automobile dominance in suburban America, walking is back in style. For a multitude of reasons, an interdisciplinary group of scholars and practitioners have converged on the notion that walkable neighborhoods are once again desirable. Architects profess the potential for urban design to create a stronger “sense of community” and a “sense of place” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0739456X11427914">Calthorpe 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0739456X11427914">Duany and Plater-Zyberk 1991</xref>). Some transportation planners attest to the reduction in automobile travel by those living in more pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods. These transportation planners claim that well-designed, compact neighborhoods can shorten the length or reduce the number of automobile trips, induce individuals to shift from automobile use to alternative forms of transportation, or encourage individuals to relinquish automobiles altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0739456X11427914">Boarnet and Crane 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0739456X11427914">Crane 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0739456X11427914">Ewing and Cervero 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739456X11427914">2010</xref>). Public health professionals have measured the health benefits from an increase in physical activity for those living in pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0739456X11427914">Frank and Engelke 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0739456X11427914">Frank et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0739456X11427914">Saelens, Sallis, and Frank 2003</xref>). The physical compactness of walkable neighborhoods also align with environmentalists’ desires to reduce the impact of development on the natural environment. This recent convergence of support for walkable neighborhoods has steered the direction of research away from questions about the benefits of walking toward determining which factors encourage more walking.</p>
<p>While there is broad-ranging consensus about the positive benefits of walking, scholars are less certain about the factors that promote walking in neighborhoods. Is it the built environment, social environment, or lifestyle attitudes that can explain why some individuals walk more than others? More vexing to scholars studying this question is the challenge of disentangling which of these factors has a greater influence on walking behavior. One of the key questions emerging from this literature is whether the design of the built environment encourages more walking above and beyond individuals’ attitudes toward walking or their predisposition to walk. In other words, can physical design of neighborhoods encourage people to walk even if they hold negative attitudes toward walking?</p>
<p>We examine this question using survey information from 2,125 residents of eight neighborhoods in the South Bay area of Los Angeles County, California. We compare individuals who have positive attitudes about walking to individuals who have negative attitudes toward walking to determine whether physical or social environments differentially affect walking trips in their neighborhood center, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. While there have been quite a few studies that have examined the relationship between attitudes, physical environment, and social environment, very few studies have examined the relative importance of all three sets of factors. Moreover, Los Angeles area residents are notorious for their autocentricity and, therefore, this study may provide for a more stringent test of the influence of the physical and social environments on walking behavior.</p>
<p>This article is organized as follows. First, we will give a review of the literature, focusing on how the built environment, crime and neighborhood safety, and individual attitudes affect walking behavior. We will then present the methodology of our research, followed by a summary and discussion of empirical results and some policy implications.</p>

<title>Neighborhoods and Walkability</title>
<p>Much of the recent shift from auto-oriented to pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods can be credited to the New Urbanist (or neotraditional) design movement that emerged in the 1990s. New Urbanist designs call for more pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods that include elements such as narrower streets, tree-lined sidewalks, shallow setbacks, front porches, corner grocery stores, and a town center that houses civic buildings, retail shops, and public open spaces. There is evidence that these neighborhoods encourage more walking than other, more traditionally suburban, neighborhood developments .<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0739456X11427914">1</xref></sup> This urban design theory sparked a host of empirical studies testing the relationship between urban form and travel behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0739456X11427914">Boarnet and Crane 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0739456X11427914">Boarnet et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0739456X11427914">Cervero and Kockelman 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0739456X11427914">Chatman 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0739456X11427914">Handy 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0739456X11427914">1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0739456X11427914">Handy, Cao, and Mokhtarian 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0739456X11427914">Kitamura, Mokhtarian, and Laidet 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0739456X11427914">Krizek 2003</xref>).

As such, we will only review the literature on the factors influencing walking behavior.</p>

<title>Built Environment and Walking</title>
<p>Influenced in part by the New Urbanism movement, several studies have focused on the relationship between urban form and walking and how land use patterns affect pedestrian behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0739456X11427914">Badoe and Miller 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0739456X11427914">Cao, Mokhtarian, and Handy 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0739456X11427914">Crane 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0739456X11427914">Greenwald and Boarnet 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0739456X11427914">Lee and Moudon 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0739456X11427914">Rodríguez and Joo 2004</xref>). Many of these studies have relied on travel data from the National Household Travel Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739456X11427914">Agrawal and Schimek 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X11427914">An and Chen 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0739456X11427914">Boer et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0739456X11427914">Ferdous et al. 2011</xref>) as well as regional and metropolitan travel surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0739456X11427914">Boarnet et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0739456X11427914">Cervero and Gorham 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0739456X11427914">Crane and Crepeau 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0739456X11427914">Handy 1996b</xref>). Recent attention has been given to studying walking behavior for different subgroups of the population, including school children, the elderly, disabled persons, immigrants, and other sociodemographic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0739456X11427914">Blumenberg and Evans 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0739456X11427914">Boarnet et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739456X11427914">Dumbaugh and Frank 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0739456X11427914">Hess 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0739456X11427914">Kerr et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0739456X11427914">McDonald 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0739456X11427914">McMillan 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0739456X11427914">Zhu et al. 2011</xref>).The link between walking and physical activity and health has also been highlighted in recent research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0739456X11427914">Boarnet, Greenwald, and McMillan 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0739456X11427914">Frank and Engelke 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0739456X11427914">Frank et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0739456X11427914">Frank et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0739456X11427914">Lathey, Guhathakurta, and Aggarwal 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0739456X11427914">Saelens, Sallis, and Frank 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0739456X11427914">Sallis et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0739456X11427914">Zhu and Lee 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The results from these studies have shown a fairly strong link between the built environment and walking behavior. In particular, the proximity of retail and commercial land uses has been attributed to an increased number of walking trips. Paired case studies by Handy and her colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0739456X11427914">Cao, Mokhtarian, and Handy 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0739456X11427914">Handy 1996</xref>a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0739456X11427914">Handy and Clifton 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0739456X11427914">Handy, Clifton, and Fisher 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0739456X11427914">Handy, Cao, and Mokhtarian 2006</xref>) have shown that the proximity to neighborhood businesses is a robust predictor of walking trips. Several other studies have also found that residents living in or near commercial or mixed-use areas took more frequent walking trips than those who did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0739456X11427914">Boarnet et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0739456X11427914">Frank and Pivo 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0739456X11427914">Joh et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0739456X11427914">Krizek 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0739456X11427914">Shriver 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Numerous studies have also shown that street and sidewalk connectivity is correlated with walking behavior (for a recent review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739456X11427914">Ewing and Cervero 2010</xref>). In a study of twelve neighborhoods in the Puget Sound region, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0739456X11427914">Moudon et al. (1997)</xref> found that pedestrian activity was higher in neighborhoods with direct pathways and a more complete system of pedestrian facilities (e.g., block size and sidewalk length). Other studies have shown a correlation between street geometry and walking trips, with higher rates of walking trips reported in neighborhoods with traditional gridiron street patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0739456X11427914">Cervero and Duncan 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0739456X11427914">Saelens, Sallis, and Frank 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0739456X11427914">Handy, Cao, and Mokhtarian 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The quality of the pedestrian environment, such as the presence of street lighting, benches, landscaping, trees, and other amenities has also been cited as a factor by some as a determinant of walking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0739456X11427914">Forsyth et al. 2008</xref>). However, the empirical evidence suggesting this link has been weaker than the correlation between walking and proximity to neighborhood businesses or connectivity. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0739456X11427914">Handy (1996b)</xref> found that differences between traditional and modern neighborhoods in terms of walking quality did not seem to affect the choice to walk. In addition, studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0739456X11427914">Cervero and Kockelman (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0739456X11427914">Kitamura, Mokhtarian, and Laidet (1997)</xref> showed that walking quality was not the most robust indicator for determining walking trips and appeared to matter mainly for nonwork trips and not commute trips.</p>
<p>While these studies show considerable evidence that built environmental factors matter for walking behavior, the question still remains: to what extent? Despite the large body of literature on this topic, the question of which characteristics of the built environment have the strongest association with walking is still under debate. Part of the reason, we believe, is the limited scope of these studies: while nearly all control for socioeconomic variables, very few studies include social environmental or attitudinal factors in their analyses of walking behavior, which may explain the propensity to walk more strongly than built environment factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0739456X11427914">Handy 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Crime, Safety, and Walking</title>
<p>While earlier studies have primarily focused on the relationship between the built environment and crime, exemplified by the concepts of Jane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0739456X11427914">Jacobs’s (1961)</xref> “eyes on the street” and Oscar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0739456X11427914">Newman’s (1972)</xref> “defensible space” emphasizing the importance of pedestrian-scale environments that promote opportunities for informal community surveillance, an increasing number of studies have examined the relationship between crime and walking behavior (for a review of the literature, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0739456X11427914">Loukaitou-Sideris 2006</xref>). Built environment characteristics have been cited as key factors for promoting and mitigating crime in urban settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0739456X11427914">Block and Block 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0739456X11427914">Loukaitou-Sideris et al. 2001</xref>). Several of these studies have found that criminal activity tends to be concentrated in specific nodes or “hot spots” in the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0739456X11427914">Nasar and Fisher 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0739456X11427914">Loukaitou-Sideris 1999</xref>), including bus and rail transit stations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0739456X11427914">Liggett, Loukaitou-Sideris, and Iseki 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0739456X11427914">Loukaitou-Sideris 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0739456X11427914">Loukaitou-Sideris, Liggett, and Iseki 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of recent studies have examined the impacts of crime on walking and physical activity for certain sociodemographic groups, including minority adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0739456X11427914">McDonald 2008</xref>) and the elderly population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0739456X11427914">Satariano et al. 2010</xref>). McDonald’s cross-sectional study of walking behavior for minority adults in Oakland, California, showed a significant negative association between violent crime and amount of daily walking activity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0739456X11427914">Satariano et al. (2010)</xref> found that elderly persons who perceived their neighborhood to be unsafe spent less time walking than those who viewed their neighborhoods as safe. These findings suggest that crime rates impact walking trip rates and duration.</p>
<p>While many studies have focused on objective measures of crime, other studies have analyzed subjective measures of crime, such as fear and perceptions of neighborhood safety, on walking behavior. Fear of crime, while not synonymous with actual crime, often affects one’s decision to walk. While fear can be shaped by actual reported incidences of crime through media reports and accounts from victims, fears are often shaped by one’s perception of the environment and its safety, which may or may not correlate with actual crime rates. Studies have also shown that fear and perceptions of crime vary across sociodemographic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0739456X11427914">Day 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0739456X11427914">Koskela and Pain 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0739456X11427914">Ortega and Miles 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0739456X11427914">Pain 2001</xref>). For instance, women, especially those of minority groups, are more likely to avoid walking at night due to concerns over personal safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739456X11427914">Atkins 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0739456X11427914">Ross 2000</xref>). While this may suggest that the gap between perceived risk and actual risk of crime may be larger for women and minority groups, these perceptions nevertheless are likely to have a highly negative impact on walking, even in neighborhoods with low actual crime rates.</p>
<p>While studies have shown that both objective and subjective measures of crime affect walking behavior, the results have been inconsistent in terms of which set of measures has a stronger negative impact on walking trips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0739456X11427914">Foster and Giles-Corti 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0739456X11427914">Oh et al. 2010</xref>). Further research would be needed to separate associations between actual and perceived crime and walking activity. Nevertheless, the results from these studies generally point to the conclusion that improving neighborhood safety is the key to promoting more walking trips. A 1994 survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Transportation found that the majority of respondents would walk more if safety was not an issue, and other studies have also shown that perceived safety is an important environmental quality for walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0739456X11427914">Bauman et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0739456X11427914">Hawthorne 1989</xref>). For example, in a walking study based in Ontario, Canada, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0739456X11427914">Hawthorne (1989)</xref> found that safety from crime was one of the strongest factors for walking. Therefore, these studies suggest that actual and perceived crime, shaped by built environment and social factors, have a strong impact on walking behavior.</p>

<title>Attitudes and Walking</title>
<p>The role of individual attitudes in shaping travel behavior has often been overlooked in the travel behavior literature because of methodological difficulties in assessing personal attitudes. However, researchers have begun to acknowledge this gap and a number of recent empirical studies have incorporated attitudinal factors in their analyses of travel behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0739456X11427914">Cao 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739456X11427914">Cao, Handy, and Mokhtarian 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0739456X11427914">Frank et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0739456X11427914">Handy, Cao, and Mokhtarian 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0739456X11427914">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0739456X11427914">Joh et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0739456X11427914">Khattak and Rodriguez 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0739456X11427914">Kitamura, Mokhtarian, and Laidet 1997</xref>). With respect to walking behavior, some have suggested that attitudinal factors may be a stronger determinant of walking than built environment factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0739456X11427914">Kitamura, Mokhtarian, and Laidet 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0739456X11427914">Bagley and Mokhtarian 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0739456X11427914">Handy, Cao, and Mokhtarian 2005</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0739456X11427914">Handy (1996b)</xref> found that the quality of the walking environment did not appear to affect the choice to walk, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0739456X11427914">Moudon et al. (1997)</xref> reported high walking trip rates in neighborhoods that have been rated low in terms of pedestrian accessibility. While both studies did not include attitudinal variables in their analyses, their results suggest that built environment factors may not be as important for individuals who are strongly motivated to walk. This line of research points to the need to factor in individual attitudes in shaping decisions to walk.</p>
<p>Although there is a general consensus among scholars that attitudes should be measured, there are methodological challenges to doing so. The ideal research method would involve a study of individuals moving from an auto-oriented neighborhood to a pedestrian-oriented neighborhood and measuring the individual’s attitudes toward travel before and after the move. This methodology would address questions about causality and residential self-selection bias. As with much social science research, it is rare that an experimental design of this nature is feasible with human subjects in the real world. But there have been several recent studies that have helped us learn more about these questions regarding attitudes and self-selection (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0739456X11427914">Cao, Mokhtarian, and Handy 2009a</xref>, for a recent review of these studies). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0739456X11427914">Handy, Cao, and Mokhtarian’s (2005)</xref> paired case study of traditional and suburban neighborhoods in Northern California revealed that differences in travel behavior across these two types of neighborhoods were largely attributable to attitudinal factors rather than built environment characteristics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739456X11427914">Cao, Handy, and Mokhtarian (2006)</xref> investigated this question in their case study of pedestrian trips in Austin, Texas. They analyzed pedestrian trips (strolling trips and pedestrian shopping trips) and found that residential self-selection affected both types of trips, but especially for pedestrian shopping trips. However, the results also showed that the built environment did have a separate effect for certain types of walking trips, such as shopping trips, which appear to suggest that the built environment still matters. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0739456X11427914">Schwanen and Mokhtarian’s (2005)</xref> study of mismatched urban and suburban residents in the San Francisco Bay area further support this notion, which seemed to show that the built environment had less of an impact on urban residents (i.e., those who preferred to walk did) than for suburban residents (i.e., those who preferred to walk often had little choice but to drive). In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0739456X11427914">Chatman (2009)</xref> argues that the effects of residential self-selection does not appear to bias the effects of the built environment as much as others have suggested and therefore should not be considered a major factor in explaining differences in travel behavior.</p>
<p>While most of these studies have shown that observed patterns of walking behavior can be attributed to built environment factors in addition to some residential self-selection, few studies have included attitudinal measurements for walking behavior and no studies to date have segmented the walking population by positive and negative attitudes toward walking. Thus, we use this novel approach to shed light on the existing literature and to determine how attitudinal dispositions influence walking behavior above and beyond the effects of the built and social environments.</p>

<title>Study Areas and Data</title>
<p>The neighborhoods selected for this study are located in the South Bay area of Los Angeles County, which is situated in the southwestern portion of the Los Angeles basin, stretching from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to the Palos Verdes Peninsula. With a population of more than 1 million, it is one of the most racially and ethnically diverse regions in the United States, containing fifteen incorporated cities and several unincorporated communities, including small portions of the city of Los Angeles. In the South Bay area as a whole, there is almost an even proportion of non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, African Americans, and Asians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0739456X11427914">U.S. Census Bureau 2000</xref>); however, the racial and ethnic makeup varies widely across the neighborhoods in the study. For example, the majority of whites and Asians are concentrated in the communities bordering the Pacific coast such as El Segundo, Hermosa Beach, Redondo Beach, and Torrance, while Hispanic and African American populations tend to be concentrated further inland in the cities of Gardena, Hawthorne, and Inglewood.</p>
<sec id="section7-0739456X11427914">
<title>Study Areas</title>
<p>Eight neighborhoods in the South Bay area were selected for our study: four “center” neighborhoods and four “corridor” neighborhoods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0739456X11427914">2</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0739456X11427914">Figure 1</xref> shows the location of these neighborhoods in the South Bay area. The “center” and “corridor” terms refer to the spatial layout of the neighborhood—the center neighborhoods have a cluster of commercial development in the center (typically the historic downtown and/or civic center) while corridors have commercial development concentrated along an arterial corridor. The selection of these neighborhoods was the result of a lengthy site-selection process to compare two different geometries with commercial concentrations surrounded by residential land uses. In general, the vintage of the center neighborhoods are older than the corridor neighborhoods, dating from the pre–World War II era. They have relatively compact development and grid street patterns. The corridor neighborhoods are more typical of suburban neighborhoods built during the postwar period and typically comprise of strip mall developments along a major arterial. All study areas (except Pacific Coast Highway)were divided into inner and outer rings corresponding to census block group boundaries, with the inner ring boundary approximately one-quarter mile from the center or arterial corridor and the outer ring approximately one-half mile.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>This study relies primarily on travel survey data from 2,125 households in the eight South Bay study areas (South Bay Travel Survey).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0739456X11427914">3</xref></sup> This 155-question, primarily web-based survey asked questions about trip purpose, mode choice, and trip distance in addition to questions about attitudes and perceptions about walking and safety in the respondent’s neighborhood. Data from the travel survey was merged with other publicly available data sources, including the 2000 U.S. Census data, 2006 crime data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the infoUSA database (including NAICS code at the six-digit level, employees, and sales), and GIS parcel data maps obtained from the Los Angeles County Assessor’s Office. Built environment data were also derived from mapping software and satellite imagery from Google Maps.</p>
<p>Understanding the sample limitations such as low survey response rates (e.g., Hawthorne) and small sample sizes (e.g., Inglewood), we attempted to determine whether respondents of the survey were different from the general population in the South Bay area. To do so, we compared the demographic characteristics of survey respondents with neighborhood residents in each of the eight study neighborhoods (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0739456X11427914">Table 1</xref>). Comparing the survey data with the census data suggests that whites tend to be overrepresented, while Hispanics and African American populations appear to be underrepresented. However, this discrepancy may be due to survey respondents who declined to state their race or ethnicity, which in most study areas was comparable to the gap between census and survey proportions for whites. While we acknowledge that the underrepresentation of minority populations limits our ability to compare attitudinal differences within sociodemographic groups, we believe that the analysis of attitudinal differences across the entire sample, the focus of this study, would be robust because of its relatively large sample size.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>We use regression analyses to analyze differences in walking behavior for individuals with positive attitudes toward walking and those with neutral or negative attitudes toward walking. To compare these groups, the sample was stratified into two groups based on attitudinal differences, hereafter referred to as “high-walk” and “low-walk” attitudes. A walking attitude index was constructed based on an additive measure of three attitudinal questions from the South Bay travel survey. For each question, respondents were asked to rate on a 5-point ordinal scale (5 = <italic>very important</italic>; 4 = <italic>important</italic>; 3 = <italic>neutral</italic>; 2 = <italic>rather unimportant</italic>; 1 = <italic>not at all important</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0739456X11427914">4</xref></sup> The median attitude index value of 10 was used as the threshold for stratifying the sample into high-walk and low-walk groups. Therefore, respondents who scored 10 or higher on the attitude index were included in the high-walk sample, while those who scored 9 or lower on the scale comprised the low-walk sample, with index scores ranging from 5 to 15.</p>
<p>We tested six regression models to examine the relative strength of social environment (violent crime rates and attitudes toward neighborhood safety) and built environment measures for high-walk and low-walk respondents from our sample of eight neighborhoods. While our site selection process included center and corridor neighborhoods, the focus of this paper is on using the survey data to compare crime, attitude, and built environment factors across the entire sample of neighborhoods; therefore, we do not make a distinction between center and corridor neighborhoods in our regression analysis. Walking behavior, the dependent variable, is a count measure of the number of individual walking trips taken by the respondent in his or her neighborhood center as reported in the one-day travel diary. Neighborhood center is defined in the travel survey as the area within a ten-minute walking distance (approximately one-quarter-mile radius) from the respondent’s residence. Therefore, this measure captures neighborhood walking trips taken for a variety of trip purposes, including work and school trips in addition to nonwork trips (e.g., meals, personal shopping and services, and entertainment and recreational trips).</p>
<p>Since the dependent variable is count data, negative binomial regressions were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0739456X11427914">Cameron and Trivedi 1998</xref>). The negative binomial regression models were constructed in which sets of variables were included additively with each subsequent model. For both high- and low-walk groups, the first model contains sociodemographic variables in addition to a control dummy variable based on whether persons live in the inner or outer ring of the neighborhood. The second model includes sociodemographic and social environment variables along with the inner ring variable. Finally, built environment variables are added in the third model (full model). For all regression models, standard errors were clustered by study area since the crime and built environment variables take on the same value within each study area (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0739456X11427914">Moulton 1990</xref> for further discussion).</p>
<p>The sociodemographic variables used in our models are typical of those found in the travel behavior literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0739456X11427914">Handy, Cao, and Mokhtarian 2006</xref>). These include race and ethnicity, gender, age, household income, employment status, children in the household, and foreign-born status. All of the sociodemographic variables are dichotomous variables. However, the age category was stratified into four groups (younger than 26, 26 to 40, 41 to 65, and older than 65) and household income was stratified into three income brackets (less than $35,000, $35,000-$75,000, and greater than $75,000).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0739456X11427914">5</xref></sup></p>

<p>The next set of variables included in our models are social environment (SE) variables, which includes a measure of violent crime rates and a measure of individual perceptions about crime and neighborhood safety. The violent crime rate data, obtained from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (2006), measures violent crime rates for the respective cities where the study areas are located and is defined as the number of violent crimes per 100,000 persons. Violent crimes constitute the following criminal offenses: murder, manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. The neighborhood safety attitude variable is obtained from a survey question designed to gauge how much importance respondents placed on being able to walk safely in their neighborhood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0739456X11427914">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The models also included three variables measuring the built environment (BE): neighborhood businesses per acre, intersection density, and percentage of four-way intersections. These variables were aggregated from census block groups comprising each study area. The data for neighborhood businesses were obtained from the infoUSA database and measure the concentration of neighborhood businesses within each study area. Neighborhood businesses were defined to be local population-serving retail and service establishments, categorized by six-digit NAICS codes (refer to the Appendix section in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0739456X11427914">Boarnet et al. 2011</xref> for definition of neighborhood businesses). We also included two measures of street connectivity: intersection density (intersections per square mile) and the percentage of four-way intersections for each study area. These were calculated from GIS parcel data maps in addition to mapping software and satellite imagery from Google Maps. These BE variables are typically used in studies examining how the “3 Ds” (density, diversity, design) affect travel behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0739456X11427914">Cervero and Kockelman 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0739456X11427914">Lee and Moudon 2006</xref>). While land use mix is also a common BE variable in the literature, we did not include it in our analysis because we selected neighborhoods with similar land use mixes (all eight study areas comprise of commercial centers and corridors surrounded by mostly residential land uses).</p>
<p>In addition to these variables, we also include a dummy control variable for residents living in the inner and outer ring to control for the possibility that proximity to the neighborhood commercial center would encourage more walking. The inner ring comprises the area closest to the center (approximately ¼ mile radius) while the outer ring comprises the area beyond the ¼ mile radius, roughly between ¼ and ½ mile from the center. The exact boundaries for the inner and outer rings were based on 2000 Census block group boundaries.</p>

<p>Summaries of the overall measures of walking behavior, by study area, are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0739456X11427914">Table 3</xref>. The number of per person walking trips per day ranged from a low of 0.083 in Inglewood to a high of 0.276 in Riviera Village. The percentage of respondents walking in their neighborhood center ranged from 8.18 percent in Artesia Boulevard to 53.13 percent in Riviera Village. On average, center neighborhoods reported a higher number of daily individual walking trips (0.191 walking trips) than corridor neighborhoods (0.073 walking trips). In addition, 47.32 percent of respondents from center neighborhoods reported walking in their neighborhood center while only 24.41 percent of respondents living in corridor neighborhoods reported walking. These findings appear to support New Urbanist assertions that people tend to walk more in traditional mixed-use neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0739456X11427914">Handy 1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0739456X11427914">Crane 1996</xref>).</p>

<p>Based on our sample of the four center neighborhoods, El Segundo had the highest percentage of high-walk residents (62.79 percent) while Inglewood had the lowest (42.86 percent). High-walk residents comprised the majority in two center neighborhoods (El Segundo and Riviera Village). On average, the proportion of high-walk residents in center neighborhoods was slightly higher (53.97 percent) than low-walk residents (46.03 percent).</p>
<p>Among the corridor neighborhoods we sampled, high-walk residents made up the majority with the exception of Pacific Coast Highway, where low-walk residents outnumbered high-walk residents by a 2:1 ratio. Overall, however, the proportion of high-walk residents to low-walk residents in the corridor neighborhoods was nearly identical to the proportion for center neighborhoods (53.71 percent high-walk, 46.29 percent low-walk).</p>
<p>It is notable that despite differences in land use characteristics and geometries, the share of high-walk versus low-walk residents is remarkably similar across center and corridor neighborhoods in the South Bay area of Los Angeles County. This suggests that self-selection was not a major factor in determining the residential location for these residents, since we would expect a higher proportion of high-walk residents in more pedestrian oriented mixed-use neighborhoods if residential self-selection was occurring. However, the proportion of high-walk to low-walk residents within neighborhood type was similar, suggesting that there were other factors aside from the built environment influencing attitudes.</p>

<p>Across sociodemographic categories, the proportion of high-walk respondents was higher than low-walk respondents except for whites and the elderly (persons greater than 65 years of age). Comparing high-walk and low-walk attitudes across racial and ethnic groups, Hispanics reported the highest share of high-walk respondents (77.56 percent), followed by “other race” (69.44 percent), African Americans (61.04 percent), Asians (60.58 percent), and whites (48.16 percent). Among the age and income categories, persons aged 26 to 40 and those earning less than $35,000 a year had the largest proportion of high-walk respondents (60.20 and 56.98 percent, respectively). Other sociodemographic categories (e.g., employment status, households with children, and foreign-born status) also reported a larger share of high-walk versus low-walk respondents. Whites and elderly persons were the only sociodemographic groups that had a greater share of low-walk respondents (51.84 and 63.21 percent, respectively).</p>
<p>For social environment variables, residents with high-walk attitudes tend to live in neighborhoods with slightly higher violent crime rates than low-walk respondents. This suggests that individuals with high-walk attitudes did not live in neighborhoods that were necessarily safer (i.e., lower violent crime rate) and perhaps may be more tolerant of higher crime rates than those with low-walk attitudes. With respect to neighborhood safety attitude, high-walk individuals appeared to show a slightly higher concern for neighborhood crime rates than low-walk individuals.</p>
<p>In terms of the built environment variables, the results show differences for high- and low-walk individuals. Individuals with high-walk attitudes tended to live in neighborhoods with higher concentrations of neighborhood businesses, slightly higher percentage of four-way intersections, and higher intersection density than those with low-walk attitudes. Both residents living in the inner ring closer to the neighborhood center as well as those living in centers had significantly higher proportion of high-walk individuals than low-walk individuals, with roughly two of three inner-ring residents and slightly more than half of center residents having favorable attitudes toward walking.</p>
<p>In addition to the variables included in our regression models, we also compared individual walking trip rates between high-walk and low-walk individuals. As expected, individuals with high-walk attitudes took more walking trips than individuals with low-walk attitudes. However, one could argue that high-walk attitudes could be proxying for low-income status, since low-income status is often correlated with less driving. While we included dummy variables in our models to control for income, we also compared differences in vehicles per licensed driver between high- and low-walk individuals. The results show that vehicle ownership rates between high- and low-walk individuals were nearly identical, suggesting that high-walk attitude is not proxying for limited car availability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0739456X11427914">7</xref></sup></p>

<p>For individuals with positive attitudes toward walking, sociodemographic characteristics were generally not a significant predictor of walking trip rates, with the exception of households with children, which were associated with fewer walking trips after controlling for social environment and built environment factors. African Americans and Asians also took fewer walking trips, but they were significant at the 5 percent level in Model 1 only. Social environmental variables (violent crime rates and perceptions of neighborhood safety) were significant only in Model 2, and lose statistical significance in Model 3 after built environment variables are added. With respect to built environment factors, the concentration of neighborhood businesses was the only variable that was robust, correlated with an increased number of walking trips. In addition, there were no significant differences in walking trip rates between inner-ring and outer-ring residents after controlling for social and built environment factors.</p>
<p>For persons with negative walking attitudes (refer to Models 4 through 6 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0739456X11427914">Table 7</xref>), there were many more factors that predicted individual walking trips. Most of these factors had a negative impact on walking trip rates. In terms of sociodemographic characteristics, females, persons of “other race,” foreign-born, and persons younger than 26 years of age took fewer walking trips after controlling for social environment and built environment factors. The only sociodemographic group that was correlated with more walking trips was the age 26-40 group (this is the only variable that had statistically significant positive coefficients). Among social environment factors, violent crime rate was the most robust, having a strongly negative impact on walking trips. However, attitudes toward neighborhood safety, indicating the importance of reducing crime for neighborhood travel, did not appear to have a significant impact on walking. Built environment factors did not appear to have much of an impact on walking trips for individuals with negative attitudes toward walking, with the exception of intersection density, which was correlated with fewer walking trips. Furthermore, there was no significant difference (at the 5 percent level of significance) for walking trip rates between inner-ring and outer-ring residents.</p>
<p>To summarize the key findings from the regression results, we can observe the following differences between individuals with positive and negative attitudes toward walking based on our sample of South Bay Area residents.</p>
<list id="list1-0739456X11427914" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>In terms of built environment effects, having nearby destinations to walk to (i.e., neighborhood businesses) generates increased walking trips among those with positive attitudes but does not appear to have a significant impact for those with neutral or negative attitudes.

<list-item><p>In terms of social environment effects, walking trip rates for high-walk individuals were less affected by violent crime rates than low-walk individuals. Attitudes about neighborhood safety were less robust than the crime rate for the low-walk group.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Therefore, the results suggest that certain social environment and built environment factors have a differential impact on high-walk and low-walk individuals, after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0739456X11427914">8</xref></sup></p>

<title>Sensitivity Tests</title>
<p>To investigate the robustness of our models, a series of sensitivity tests were conducted. The primary concern was the possibility of correlation between walking attitude and built environment characteristics. With the former being the discriminating variable, it is important that the attitude measure isolate the effect of attitude on walking rather than proxy for neighborhood destinations. Therefore, we modified our regression models by (1) using different thresholds for high-walk and low-walk respondents, (2) an alternative attitudinal index, and (3) controlling for possible correlation between the attitudinal indices and the built environment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0739456X11427914">9</xref></sup> The signs and significance of the built environment and crime rate variables were, in virtually all cases, the same as those shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0739456X11427914">Tables 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0739456X11427914">7</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0739456X11427914">10</xref></sup> Full results are available on request from the lead author.</p>

The results were largely unchanged when adding the “vehicles per licensed driver” variable, and “vehicles per licensed driver” was not significant in the regressions. We also performed multicollinearity tests for the built environment and attitudinal variables, and found only weak correlation between the built environment and attitudinal variables (<italic>r</italic> = 0.02-0.39), with the exception of neighborhood businesses and intersection density, which showed fairly high correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.67).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>These results reveal key insights about how the social and built environment impact walking behavior for individuals with positive and negative attitudes toward walking. With respect to social environment factors, violent crime rates appear to have a stronger impact on walking trips than attitudes toward neighborhood crime and safety. Individuals with neutral or negative attitudes toward walking were much more deterred by crime rates than those with positive attitudes after controlling for built environment measures such as neighborhood destinations or street connectivity. Furthermore, our results show that certain sociodemographic groups within the high-walk and low-walk group were more likely to walk than others. For instance, among high-walk individuals, households with children were less likely to walk than others, while for low-walk individuals, women and “other race” persons reported fewer walking trips. While the negative impact of crime on walking for certain sociodemographic groups (such as whites and females) has been cited in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0739456X11427914">Liska, Lawrence, and Sanchiroco 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0739456X11427914">Pain 2001</xref>), very few of these studies, if any, differentiate by walking attitudes.</p>
<p>In terms of built environment impacts, the presence of nearby neighborhood businesses had a stronger positive impact on walking trip rates for high-walk individuals than those with low-walk attitudes. This suggests that having nearby destinations to walk to matter more to residents with positive attitudes, and that not all residents equally take advantage of nearby shopping and service opportunities, even if they live in a walkable neighborhood such as Riviera Village. While other studies have shown that providing nearby shopping opportunities and neighborhood businesses generate walking trips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0739456X11427914">Boarnet et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0739456X11427914">Handy and Clifton 2001</xref>), our study illustrates that neighborhood destinations matter most to those who prefer to walk. On the other hand, traditional street connectivity measures (intersection density and the percentage of four-way intersections) did not have much of an impact on walking after controlling for crime rates and perceptions of neighborhood safety for high-walk persons, while intersection density had a negative impact for low-walk individuals. While this may be anomalous to the South Bay region, it could also indicate pedestrian safety concerns and the shortage of mid-block and signalized pedestrian crossings in the area. However, a more detailed inventory of built environment features would be needed to gain such insights, which could be conducted in a future study using an audit tool such as the Irvine-Minnesota Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0739456X11427914">Day et al. 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on these results, we can infer that while the built environment and social environment matter for walking, attitudinal bias affects walking trips. Planning scholars and practitioners have largely focused on urban design strategies to promote walking (i.e., how to create or retrofit neighborhoods to make them more pedestrian friendly) while strategies to promote a more positive walking attitude have received far less attention, primarily because of the complexity of attitudinal factors in shaping walking behavior. While a detailed analysis on the explanatory factors that account for differences in walking attitude is beyond the scope of this paper, we offer the following explanations. First, individuals with positive attitudes toward walking may have been shaped from previous experiences of living in a pedestrian oriented setting, may have acquired a habit of walking from an early age (e.g., from walking to school), or were influenced by family members and friends to adopt a more active lifestyle. Cultural and societal factors may also play a role in influencing walking attitude, illustrated by the prevalence of walking and bicycling in many European countries, and supported by the common perception that Europeans tend to be more “green conscious” and more physically active than their American counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0739456X11427914">Bassett et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0739456X11427914">Pucher and Dijkstra 2003</xref>). Second, individuals with neutral or negative attitudes toward walking may not have walked much as a child, had unpleasant walking experiences in the past due to poor social and built environments, or prefer a more sedentary lifestyle. While it is unclear from our data what factors were most influential for shaping positive and negative attitudes for walking, we can observe that these attitudinal biases have a notable impact on how residents viewed their social and built environment with respect to walking.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Planning for sustainable and healthy communities has arguably become the dominant paradigm for urban and community planners in the twenty-first century, with the promotion of walkable communities and walking behavior as its primary thrusts. However, planning scholars and practitioners have largely focused on urban design–oriented solutions to promote walking, such as improving the streetscape and promoting mixed use. The result of these efforts has usually been a modest increase in walking trips, while not necessarily reducing automobile trips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0739456X11427914">Crane 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0739456X11427914">Ewing and Cervero 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739456X11427914">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0739456X11427914">Joh et al. 2008</xref>). While pursuing these policies is generally a desirable goal, they may not lead to a positive impact on walking trip rates for individuals who have negative attitudes toward walking. Therefore, we should pursue a multipronged approach of improving the built and social environment, as well as promoting positive walking attitudes.</p>
<p>Based on the evidence from our study, we can see that the built environment matters more for those with positive attitudes. Individuals who enjoy walking will walk even more if there are interesting places to walk to. In contrast, the built environment does not appear to have much of a positive impact on those with negative attitudes. For those with negative attitudes, the focus should be on changing attitudes to emphasize the benefits of physical activity and to encourage walking. While this is a certainly a challenging task, it should be an equally important policy goal for urban planners, as investments in “retrofitting” neighborhoods to be more pedestrian oriented are likely to yield greater dividends in terms of increased walking trips as individuals adopt more positive attitudes. Hence, the built environment will have a greater impact on walking as we see a shift in individual walking attitudes.</p>
<p>However, what about the role of self-selection? If planners and policy makers are successful in changing people’s attitudes toward walking, would they choose to relocate to a neighborhood that more closely matches their preferences for walking? Some may, perhaps, but we believe that the majority will not. Based on our results, there is little evidence to indicate that self-selection based on walking preferences is occurring in the South Bay area, as the split between high- and low-walk respondents is closely balanced between center and corridor neighborhoods, and nearly two-thirds (65.0 percent) of the residents from our sample survey have lived in their current residence for at least 6 years. This is especially the case in California because of its unique property tax structure (Proposition 13) that discourages residents from selling their homes to relocate. Another reason supporting the notion that most existing residents choose not to relocate is because neighborhoods with good pedestrian environments typically command a premium in terms of home prices and rents, making such places unaffordable to a large segment of the market. While this may be due to many of these communities being located in expensive housing markets such as San Francisco and Washington, D.C., it could also be reflective of the lack of supply of such neighborhoods, due to zoning regulations that limit compact development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0739456X11427914">Levine 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>While our study clearly shows differences in walking behavior based on attitudinal disposition, the question of what factors shape attitudes about walking is an important one that merits further research. Can attitudes be shaped simply through increased education about walking? Or are attitudes about walking primarily shaped through past experiences related to walking? While various attitudinal theories have been proposed by scholars in an attempt to explain travel behavior, our understanding of the role of attitudes on travel, especially with respect to walking, remains limited. Therefore, the direction of future research should focus on measuring how individual attitudes are shaped—for instance, what factors lead to one adopting a positive or negative walking attitude—as well as how these attitudes translate into actual travel behavior.</p>

<p>New Urbanist theory also posits a reduction in automobile use, but the empirical findings to support this are quite mixed depending on how automobile use is operationalized. For a complete review of studies that examine the relationship between the built environment and automobile travel, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0739456X11427914">Saelens and Handy (2008)</xref>.

All study area names represent the city where they are located, with the exception of Riviera Village (located primarily in Redondo Beach) and PCH (located in Torrance). All center neighborhoods (with the exception of Riviera Village) are centered on the downtown/civic center district of their respective cities, while corridor neighborhoods are centered on a commercial strip along a major arterial highway.</p></fn>

<p>The South Bay Travel Survey was funded by the South Bay Cities Council of Governments and the Southern California Association of Governments, and was conducted in three phases, annually, from 2005 to 2007. Study areas were added in phases due to limited year-to-year funding. Phase I included Riviera Village, Torrance Old Town, Inglewood, and Pacific Coast Highway. Phase II surveyed residents in El Segundo and Artesia, and Phase III included Gardena and Hawthorne. The survey was primarily web-based and response rates varied from 3.8 percent in Hawthorne to 11.9 percent in El Segundo.</p></fn>

<label>5.</label>
<p>Age was stratified into four groups that correspond to the following age segments: youth (25 or younger), young adults (26-40), middle-aged adults (41-65), and the elderly (older than 65). Income was stratified into three groups to represent low (less than $35,000), moderate ($35,000-$75,000), and high income (greater than $75,000). Note that the average household income for the South Bay neighborhoods is approximately $75,000.</p></fn>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-0739456X11427914">

<p>We added vehicle ownership (vehicles per licensed driver) in our regression models as a robustness test, and found no significant difference in the results. Therefore, we did not include it in our final models. In addition, we were concerned about correlation between the income and auto ownership variables.</p></fn>

<label>8.</label>
<p>We also tested for differences in the coefficients of key variables from the high- and low-walk models. We approached this by testing for interaction effects for two key SE and BE variables: crime rate and neighborhood business density. This was conducted by pooling the entire sample and interacting crime and business density with a high-walk dummy variable, where 1 = high-walk and 0 = low-walk. We regressed walking trips on all sociodemographic, SE, and BE variables and added two interaction variables for crime and business density using OLS regression. The regression results showed a positive and statistically significant coefficient (<italic>t</italic> statistic = 2.50) for the interacted neighborhood businesses variable, suggesting that persons with high-walk attitudes generally have walking behaviors that are more responsive to the presence of nearby destinations. The interaction term for crime, however, was not statistically significant (<italic>t</italic> statistic = 0.04), indicating that differences in the coefficients for high- and low-walk with respect to crime may be due to sampling error.</p></fn>

<p>On the latter point, we constructed a measure of attitudes that is orthogonal to the most important built environment variable. Note that one of the questions in the attitude index asked respondents how important it was to be able to “walk to nearby stores and restaurants.” To ensure that the attitude variable did not reflect, e.g., how many places one could walk to, we regressed the attitude measure on the number of neighborhood businesses and then took the residual, which by construction is correlated with attitudes but orthogonal to the number of neighborhood businesses—in other words, the residual is the attitude variable purged of any correlation with neighborhood businesses. We then stratified the sample into high- and low-walk based on the residual from that first-stage regression. The basic form of this test involved running a first-stage regression of the form</p>

<p>These three sensitivity tests gave eight different alternative tests that mirrored the regressions reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0739456X11427914">Tables 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0739456X11427914">7</xref>. In all of the sensitivity tests, violent crime was negatively associated with walking among persons with low-walk attitudes, and neighborhood businesses per acre was positively associated with walking among persons with high-walk attitudes. In addition, in only one instance was neighborhood business density positively associated with walking among persons with low-walk attitudes and in two instances neighborhood businesses were negatively associated with walking among persons with low-walk attitudes. These disagreements with the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0739456X11427914">Tables 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0739456X11427914">7</xref>, in three of thirty-two variables, are similar to what would occur by chance if the null hypothesis of no disagreement with the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0739456X11427914">Tables 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0739456X11427914">7</xref> is true.
