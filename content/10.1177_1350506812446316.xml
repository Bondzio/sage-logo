<p><bold>Special issue: Race and anti-race in Europe Editors: Gail Lewis and madeleine kennedy-macfoy</bold></p>
<p><italic>How do processes of racialisation operate in Europe and through what intersections with gender and other key axes of differentiation, for example ethnicity or religion?</italic></p>
<p><italic>Which social, cultural or demographic groups are convened under the sign of race and with what consequences in different parts of Europe?</italic></p>
<p><italic>How is race ‘done’ and ‘undone’ through forms of everyday gendered practice?</italic></p>
<p><italic>Is there a “consolidated vision” of race across Europe or is this vision fragmented in local, regional or national contexts?</italic></p>
<p><italic>How is it given meaning, divested of its meaning, made relevant or irrelevant within diverse constituencies and across different institutional sites?</italic></p>
<p><italic>What, if any, are the connections between race/anti-race and the securitisation agenda in the current global conjuncture?</italic></p>
<p><italic>How and where are feminists outside and inside the academy responding to the multiple dynamics of race and racialising processes across the whole of Europe?</italic></p>
<p><italic>What are the consequences for feminist organising and theory building if we cannot, or dare not talk about, research or analyse race and subsume it under ethnicity. Or simply fail to take it into consideration?</italic></p>
<p>These are among the questions we hope to address in this Special Issue of the <italic>European Journal of Women’s Studies</italic>. They can be contextualised in relation to the emergence of two seemingly contradictory developments: racialised discourses have become increasingly prominent among political elites across Europe, yet for many in continental Europe, including some feminists, race is viewed as something that need no longer be discussed or named. This is in part due to a growing belief that in our contemporary times many, if not all, Western countries are not only non-racist (in their ideologies, policies and practices), but also inherently <italic>anti</italic>-racist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350506812446316">Lentin, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This claim is supported by a number of related socio-political events and academic developments that have taken place in the global north over the last sixty to seventy years. These include, firstly, reluctance, following the fascist nadir of the first half of twentieth century European histories, to give credence to a belief in biological racial differences between humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350506812446316">Gullestad, 2004</xref>). Secondly, and related to the legacy of early 20<sup>th</sup> Century Nazism, during the 1990s, academics pointed to a discursive shift from ‘old’ (biological) to ‘new’/‘neo’ (cultural/ideological) race-thinking and racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350506812446316">Barker, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350506812446316">Taguieff, 1990</xref>). A move that can be linked to a turn towards what many view as a conceptual and non-essentialist alternative to race: ethnicity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350506812446316">Hall, 1988</xref>). Thirdly, within feminist scholarship, the return to intersectionality as a key object of enquiry and category of analysis has been seen as encompassing race as a key constituent of gendered experience and identity. Fourthly, far-reaching civil and political changes were triggered by the 9/11 attacks in New York City, in Madrid in 2004, London in 2005, which led to a focus on ‘the religion-line’ as ‘the problem of the twenty-first century’, to paraphrase Du Bois.</p>
<p>Lastly, the debate over multiculturalism, including its assumed consequences for women, has become increasingly intense. Legislation has been enacted in a number of European countries to govern religious dress codes for women and regulate religious architecture. In addition, the trend towards ever more restrictive immigration and citizenship laws continues a pace, and is accompanied by a focus on social and communal ‘cohesion’ in countries like France, Britain, the Netherlands and Belgium. Simultaneously in other parts of Europe, there are calls for a recommitment to multiculturalism, for example, by the Norwegian Prime Minister after the Breivik shootings in July 2011. From this perspective, multiculturalism is purported to express a set of European values, made manifest in numerous instances of lived intercultural contact in local communities all across Europe.</p>
<p>Against this background, community-based practitioners and academy-based researchers equally grapple with the questions that the issues of race and anti-race generate and which continue to be in urgent need of engagement, including within feminist constituency itself.</p>
<p>We invite submissions addressing these concerns, including but not limited to the questions above.</p>
<p>All articles will be subject to the usual review process. Articles should be prepared according to the guidelines for submission on the inside back cover of the journal or at the worldwide web address: [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www2.lse.ac.uk/genderInstitute/journals/EJWS/Home.aspx">http://www2.lse.ac.uk/genderInstitute/journals/EJWS/Home.aspx</ext-link>]. Articles should be submitted online to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/ejw">http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/ejw</ext-link> by 30 September 2012.</p>
