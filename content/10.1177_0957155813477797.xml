<abstract>
<p>From 1983 on, following the Marche pour l’égalité et contre le racisme, the question of racial advocacy in France occupied centre stage. A new generation of activists had entered the public sphere, for the most part the children of immigrants, and they drew attention to social exclusion and marginalisation. These changes occurred in a political climate that had witnessed not only the first post-war electoral victory for the Socialists but also significant inroads by the Front National. France now struggled to reconcile calls for a ‘droit à la différence’, egalitarian principles, and an inclusive multiculturalist society with increasingly vocal and powerful critics who saw in this discourse evidence of rising factionalist (communitarian) tendencies and threats to Republican ideals and values. These different perspectives served to mobilise an impressive array of often competing advocacy associations, organised according to gender, race, religion and so forth, while the foundations of a security-based discourse that has survived into twenty-first-century France were laid, built around a fear of Islam, lawless <italic>banlieues</italic>, and a misunderstanding of immigration history that continues to predispose individuals to xenophobia.</p>

<p>France discovered its identity as a country of immigration at the beginning of the 1980s. The first urban uprisings were widely covered by the media and marked the emergence into the public sphere of the descendants of postcolonial immigration. The ruling Leftist government of the day declared the rehabilitation of the Republic’s forgotten <italic>banlieues</italic> a priority. Thus for the first time in French history the integration of those initially labelled ‘immigrant youth’ and later the ‘beur’ became a public policy concern. From the urban uprisings outside of Lyon to those in the Paris region, from the ‘beur’ movement to the emergence of ‘l’Islam de France’, from the struggles of organisations against hate and security-based crimes to those opposed to mass deportations and ‘la double peine’ (imprisonment followed by deportation),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0957155813477797">1</xref></sup> a new politically conscious generation asserted itself by reiterating its demand for recognition and equality.</p>
<p>At the time, many thought that the birthplace of the Rights of Man was poised to lance the festering boil of its own history, especially in the wake of the Marche pour l’égalité et contre le racisme, a kind of ode to a multicultural France, which brought together some 100,000 people in Paris on 3 December 1983. However, merely a generation later, problems associated with the <italic>banlieues</italic> persist to the extent that immigration has taken on a dimension akin to a radical split – a ‘postcolonial rupture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957155813477797">Bancel et al., 2010</xref>) separating fully fledged citizens from those relegated to a second-class citizenship. Faced with the social disdain that consistently banishes the heritage of the immigration movement to the rubbish dump of collective memory, the <italic>banlieue</italic> or ‘visible minority’ movement seemed at an impasse in the eternal focus on their precarious status inscribed in a longer history of misunderstandings. While chronicling public rejection, lack of recognition, and the historical discrimination inherent in French politics, this article aims to restore some of the foundational events that have marked the history and experiences of those whom history has generally forgotten.</p>
<sec id="section1-0957155813477797">
<title>Chronicles of a history lived on the margins</title>
<p>France is proud of its social model which has allowed identities to be conceived within a class-based society structured around work. The social state has thus guaranteed the representation and interests of various groups. Of course, the groups we have in mind are institutional, not those vagabonds of the lumpenproletariat, as immigrants have come to be characterised in the class struggle. Despite the massive employment of foreign labour for a period spanning over a century, France never saw itself as a country of immigration, and no one ever imagined that the country’s guest workers would one day become citizens. Even within the large family of blue-collar workers, these immigrants were at best considered distant relatives, at times even the black sheep in the family. The original exclusion of these workers from France’s collective memory seems to have condemned them to an eternal invisibility – to a space where there are no rights, a space somewhere between asylum and expulsion, outside political decision-making.</p>
<p>And yet, current events tell a different story. For the past 25 years, immigration has been at the heart of public debate. The various crusades of the Front National have played a role in this, but their positions point to a much broader crisis in French society that has triggered a kind of paralysis in the face of the challenge made to previously accepted national and political boundaries. Indeed, this French malaise must be inscribed within the larger framework of the decline of the nation-state in the era of globalisation. If we are to follow the arguments of one of the pioneers of ‘world history’, Christopher A. Bayly, the pursuit of such a history entails more than an approach which is planetary in scale in order to privilege a more focused approach in which specific attention is paid to ‘the study of the social fragment, or the disempowered’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957155813477797">Bayly, 2004</xref>: 9). As precursors of globalisation, immigrants offer historical experiences that serve to highlight the nonsensical manner in which the official conception of national history was achieved. France has not adhered to its own founding principles, and the entire history of the twentieth century confirms this, especially when we review the ways in which equality has been simultaneously proclaimed and rejected.</p>
<p>The goal is not to hold France accountable for its shortcomings. Instead, postcolonial immigration embodies the exception to the universality of the Republic, and the socio-historical experience of immigration stands to provide us with an improved understanding of the dark side of the French Republican model. An alternative history of immigration can demonstrate how this history has been shaped by inconsistencies in the application of universal political values and how in turn it has drawn attention to the gap between principles and justice. Immigrant populations, as downtrodden as they may have been, never conformed to a pattern of domination to the point of resigning themselves to victimhood. Instead, they appropriated the values inscribed on public monuments and adapted them to their own particular circumstances, thereby limiting the degree of domination.</p>
<p>Any scholar who scrutinises colonial and postcolonial immigration in France will be confronted with a patchwork, the logic of which he/she will not be able to fathom merely by considering gradual emancipation. After all, how can we even speak about history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957155813477797">Benjamin, 2000</xref>) when experiences of failure and rejection prevail? In fact, only a handful of researchers in France have explored the political history of postcolonial immigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957155813477797">Boubeker and Hajjat, 2008</xref>). The various immigrant struggles which span the twentieth century – from the workers’ movement to anti-colonialist solidarity, from May 68 to the struggle for housing rights, from the Palestinian councils to the Mouvement des Travailleurs Arabes (MTA) – reveal the tremendous diversity of political and social engagement and the emergence of an ‘immigrant consciousness’ distinct from a ‘class consciousness’. In this way, the descendants of postcolonial immigration are no exception, with perhaps the slight difference that claims for the recognition of a shared patrimony have been articulated. It is too early to speak of a unified framework, but nevertheless more recent public affirmation by ‘visible minorities’ breaks away from previous forms of engagement. This process began toward the end of the 1970s when the political history of immigration intersected with the history of the banlieue.</p>

<title>The emergence of the heirs of postcolonial immigration</title>
<p>At the end of the 1970s, the <italic>banlieues</italic> were under heavy police surveillance. In Vitry, Bondy, La Courneuve and Vaulx-en-Velin violent clashes between immigrant youths and the police were recorded. Police stations and the judicial system began to operate as the gatekeepers of French society, deporting at least 2500 young people, three-quarters of whom had been found guilty of crimes punishable by no more than a month in prison. Most deportees would return to France illegally. At the underground concerts held by Rock Against Police (RAP), the lyrics of Lounis Lounes’ song reverberated: ‘On ne me rayera pas d’ici!’ In April 1980 the first informal collective of boys from the Parisian projects appealed for a ‘résistance des jeunes immigrés et prolétaires de banlieue’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957155813477797">Abdallah, 1981</xref>: 37). The challenge was to mobilise people through a range of activities – rock concerts, political pamphlets, videos – in order to denounce the security-based violence which was destroying their neighbourhoods and to combat the criminalisation of a ‘délinquance sociale’ experienced as a survival strategy. The call for independent action resonated with the young women of Zaâma d’Banlieue, a group based in Lyon, who denounced the sordid realism characteristic of discourse propounded by the ‘Jésus de banlieue’ (the label given to charitable and religious organisations active in the <italic>banlieues</italic>) as well as France’s two-tier judicial system, which criminalised petty offences while being lenient with police officers in cases of brutality and security-based crimes.</p>
<p>But in May 1981 events in the <italic>banlieues</italic> of Lyon brought immigrant youths out of anonymity. Within a national context marked by a wave of racist and security-based crimes, when the uprisings of the Minguettes neighbourhood in Vénissieux spread to the eastern sections of Lyon, the ‘malaise des <italic>banlieues</italic>’ literally exploded into the public sphere. Grinning on the set of the television station France 2, Jimmy ‘the High Roller’ introduced himself to the Minister for Social Affairs and National Solidarity Georgina Dufoix and to all of France in the series <italic>Les Dossiers de l’écran</italic>: ‘Mohammed, or Jimmy to the ladies!’ The emergence of these descendants of immigration into the public sphere seemed to inaugurate a new era, perhaps even the end of social scorn. The press even evoked the nationalisation of immigrant youth, and a number of policies aimed at the social development of underprivileged neighbourhoods initiated by the newly elected Leftist government established the basis for future ‘politique de la ville’ projects. However, between the summer of 1981 and 1983, a ‘dérive sécuritaire’ embittered relations between the police and the young inhabitants of the Minguettes estate. On 21 March 1983, officers were pelted with stones. People feared another crackdown and show of force by the authorities. Yet to everyone’s surprise nine youths from the projects embarked on a hunger strike and declared: ‘La violence, c’est d’avoir vingt ans, pas de boulot, et les flics sur le dos’. This statement was accompanied by an offer to negotiate. After negotiations with a representative of the Prime Minister, <italic>Libération</italic> carried the following headline: ‘Le gouvernement reconnaît les Minguettes’. And yet tensions between <italic>banlieue</italic> youth and the police did not dissipate. On the night of 20 June 1983, Toumi Djaïdja, the young president of the group SOS Avenir Minguettes, was critically wounded as a result of police brutality. Legend has it that Djaïdja came up with the idea of a ‘grande marche’ on his sick bed (the idea was in fact suggested by Father Christian Delorme, an eminent figure in the anti-racist movement) as a way of mobilising social democratic forces in a context marked by the multiplication of racist and security-based crimes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0957155813477797">
<title>The ‘beur’ movement at an impasse</title>
<p>In December 1983, while the Front National celebrated its first electoral victory in Dreux, the Marche pour l’égalité et contre le racisme triumphantly entered Paris. Only a handful of marchers (mostly from the Minguettes) had set out from Marseille on 15 October 1983, but by the time they arrived in Paris on 3 December, their number had swelled to 100,000. The families of the youths killed in the projects stood proudly at the head of the march, and joining them row after row were the faces of French pluralism. The call for fraternity had been heard loud and clear and <italic>banlieue</italic> youths transformed their public image. Consecration came when the President of the Republic, François Mitterrand, received a delegation of eight marchers at the Élysée Palace. With the promise of the ten-year ‘carte de séjour’, the marchers attained what years of struggle had been unable to exact from the government. On the threshold of the presidential palace, Toumi Djaïdja announced: ‘Le message a été entendu, c’est parti, on réussira’.</p>
<p>The success of the march signalled a new direction for inter-ethnic relations in 1980s France. From the positive response given to these new social actors, now referred to in the media as ‘beurs’, one might have thought that France was ready to open its gates to the descendants of postcolonial immigrants. However, just a few weeks after the euphoria associated with the march had waned, immigrant workers were being laid off from the Talbot-Poissy car plant. The mixed response to this development underscored the disparity between the multicultural aspirations of the ‘beurs’ and the willingness of politicians to encourage rivalry between one generation of immigrants and another. One can only be struck by this strange encounter between the ‘beurs’, welcomed at the presidential palace, and the image of their fathers sent packing by a post-industrial society where their labour was now redundant. In fact, this period offers a snapshot of sorts of two key moments in the immigration struggle in France. The march provided the ‘beurs’, for a short time at least, with extensive media coverage. But the local impact of this recognition was limited. For example, the issue of relations between the ‘beurs’ and law enforcement did not go away. Once the marchers returned to their neighbourhoods, they soon discovered that as far as the police and the courts were concerned the ‘lascars de banlieue’ were not transformed into ‘gentils beurs’ just because of media spin. Toumi Djaïdja, the leader of the march, was only released from prison by a presidential pardon.</p>
<p>It therefore became all the more urgent to take action. However, assembled in Lyon and then in Saint-Étienne, divisions between various ‘beur’ associations became increasingly apparent. The second march, called Convergence 1984 pour l’égalité, drew to a close under the spectre of a public fissure between the ‘beurs’ and other anti-racist groups in France, who were accused of being reticent. New ways of expressing anti-racist positions emerged, coinciding with Jean-Marie Le Pen exceeding the 10 per cent threshold of votes at the 1984 European parliamentary elections. A new youth movement, ‘Black, blanc, beur’, took off in the media. Remote-controlled by the socialist Left, SOS Racisme bulldozed its way over the ‘beur’ movement’s nascent dream of autonomy. In <italic>Verbatim, mémoires à L’Élysée</italic>, a book by Jacques Attali (a close advisor to President François Mitterrand), one could read that ‘Harlem Désir lance SOS Racisme. Jean-Louis Bianco a tout organisé à l’initiative de Jean-Loup Salzman et de Julien Dray. Christophe Riboud a financé. En bon militant, Coluche les a soutenus parce que je le lui ai demandé’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957155813477797">Attali, 1993</xref>: 793). SOS Racisme thus became the darling of the Fabius government, eager to engineer public opinion. ‘Antiracistes, affichez-vous!’ – this media-run anti-racism campaign had the effect of reducing the ‘beurs’ to their previous invisibility. In order to avoid playing into the hands of the Front National, the ‘bonnes consciences’ on the Left asked them to tone down their rhetoric, and even to sacrifice the memories of their recent struggles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0957155813477797">
<title>The pillars of autonomy</title>
<p>At the end of 1985, calls to protest against SOS Racisme’s incessant parading in the media were heard from Lyon. Distinguishing their ‘arabitude’ from a ‘beuritude’, the Jeunes Arabes de Lyon et Banlieue (JALB) connected the concerns of the <italic>banlieues</italic> today with a longer history of immigration. The first public protest held by JALB came in the aftermath of the murder of young Nordine Mechta in October 1985, at the very moment when SOS Racisme organised its first massive concert in the Place de la Concorde to blissfully celebrate the French melting pot.</p>
<p>For JALB, residents of the <italic>banlieues</italic> had to focus on fundamental issues, such as hate and security-based crimes. This activist approach was bolstered by several cultural initiatives that had already contributed to promoting informal groupings. One such example came out of the concert meetings held by Zaâma d’Banlieue in Lyon and from which the group Carte de Séjour emerged. There was also evidence of a new discourse espousing autonomy and self-organisation and denouncing the paternalist tone of certain anti-racist groups, described by Mogniss H. Abdallah in the following terms:
<disp-quote>
<p>Tout ne commence pas le 3 décembre 1983 et les lascars des Minguettes en savent quelque chose. Parlons de deux marches en une : celle des lascars qui voulaient désenclaver une situation locale devenue intenable, poser au niveau national la question des rapports à la police et à la justice, et celle de Christian Delorme et des antiracistes chrétiens qui, pour la bonne cause – l’antiracisme moral – ont instrumentalisé les luttes des jeunes immigrés. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957155813477797">Abdallah, 2000</xref>: 66–7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>JALB actively participated in the restoration of a network of organisations known for their political radicalism and for their refusal to compromise with respect to SOS Racisme or even France Plus (founded in 1984 by Arezki Dahmani, France-Plus brought together French youth of Maghrebi extraction, such as the children of the Harkis, with the goal of lobbying political parties). Alongside associations like Gutemberg in Nanterre, Wahid in Vaulx-en-Velin, and Ouverture in Saint-Chamond, the most active by far was IM’média, branding itself the first press agency for the <italic>banlieues</italic> projects and immigration. IM’média set out to build a national <italic>banlieue</italic> database that would allow the heirs of immigration to broaden the reach of their message while also controlling their public image. For a decade they published a newsletter and distributed videos, and these materials today constitute the principal archives of this movement. Many journalists from immigrant backgrounds, researchers, together with a number of stakeholders from activist movements (Mouvement de l’immigration et des banlieues (MIB), Comité national contre la double peine) that would leave their mark on the 1990s were involved with IM’média. IM’média were also responsible for the ‘J’y suis, j’y reste’ campaign following the hunger strike of JALB’s members in protest at the 1986 Pasqua law. Despite the political mobilisation initiated by JALB and the intervention of various church groups, the first round of cohabitation between the Left and the Right (1986–8, when Mitterrand chose Jacques Chirac to be his Prime Minister), was accompanied by a resumption of large-scale mediatised deportations. Control of migratory flows and the round-up of clandestine immigrants thus became common practice. The situation did not improve when the Left regained power in 1988, and two years later Prime Minister Michel Rocard would make his now infamous declaration that ‘La France ne peut accueillir toute la misère du monde, mais elle doit savoir en prendre fidèlement sa part’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0957155813477797">
<title>The <italic>banlieue</italic> generation and the activist big brothers</title>
<p>The return of immigration to the public sphere necessarily implied obfuscating the <italic>banlieues</italic>, which were reduced to what Michel Rocard explained as ‘problems of social mobility’. However, with the irruption in October 1990 of the commune of Vaulx-en-Velin in eastern Lyon and four nights of relentless fighting, a decade of social development policies were reduced to rubble. Shortly afterwards projects in the Parisian agglomeration would also flare up: Sartrouville, then Mantes-la-Jolie in 1991, Garges-lès-Gonesse in 1994, Noisy-le-Grand and Nanterre in 1995. The level of urban mismanagement and waste was of course striking. In terms of social achievements, the significant investment in urban public policy had been essentially wasted. Equal access to employment and housing and social acceptance remained no more than a mirage for the little brothers of the ‘beurs’, those on welfare, perpetual trainees, the long-term unemployed, or those in and out of prison. And then there was the matter of the panic stemming from concerns over security given that the triggers for the various uprisings were invariably incidents of police brutality! Certainly, tensions between youths and the authorities were not new, but nonetheless continued to be ignored. In the meantime, the question of local security needs had been politicised, partially as a consequence of the electoral successes of the Far Right.</p>
<p>Youth organisations such as Agora in Vaulx-en-Velin had brought the tensions between the youth and the police into the public sphere. Their discourse remained trivial though, compared to the voices officials paid attention to calling for more radical policies to address concerns over safety. Urban policy-making remained the domain of experts and elected officials and continued to exclude those primarily concerned. How, for example, can we reconcile the public discourse on the importance of civic recovery in the <italic>banlieues</italic> with public policies founded on the rejection of a way of life that valorises spontaneous activism? Relinquishing social movements, the descendants of postcolonial immigration founded new organisations and radicalised their positions: ‘Pas de justice, pas de paix!’ proclaimed Résistance des Banlieues (RDB). Most of these activist groups were run by former members of movements from the 1980s into which new recruits were inducted. This was the case with the Comité national contre la double peine, created in 1990, which in hindsight proved to be one of the most effective organisations of that generation. The authorities, incapable of addressing the social roots of the malaise, gradually began to adopt a moralising, even sanctimonious tone.</p>
<p>A more widespread suspicion of immigrant families soon followed, fuelled by sensationalist media coverage and recourse to a range of labels and terms – ‘dérive mafieuse’, ‘dérive ethnique’, or ‘dérive communautariste’ – all symbols of the now conceivable duplicity of immigrants’ allegiances and powerful indicators of withdrawal (‘repli communautaire’) into communitarianism. A new version of the ‘dangerous social classes’ was emerging, with the potential to unite and rise up against the Republic. Images of lawless housing projects fed the public’s greatest fears and fantasies, buttressed by repeated expressions of concern over security made by certain intellectuals on the Right, the first ‘Islamic headscarf affair’ in 1989, and especially after the first Gulf War in 1991. The conversion to Islam of the descendants of postcolonial immigration had by now become a significant area of concern. The first ‘headscarf affair’ unleashed a media firestorm and Prime Minister Michel Rocard denounced communitarian groups. The newly created Haut Conseil à l’Intégration stigmatised any affirmation of individuality. But the watchword of ‘integration against fundamentalism’ quickly proved to be as empty of meaning as Jacques Chirac’s call for mobilisation against a ‘fracture sociale’. However, by the mid 1990s, the focus shifted away from the concern with forms of social divide toward the ways in which Islam in the <italic>banlieues</italic> provided examples of the now increasingly invoked ‘clash of civilisations’. Of course, when the Right returned to political office at the beginning of the 1990s, it immediately imposed harsher policies and policing methods, justified by the slogan ‘immigration zéro’ supported by Charles Pasqua, the new Minister of the Interior. This radicalisation of public discourse aimed at immigrants/Arabs/Muslims has of course survived far beyond the 1990s, but it was during this period that it officially entered the realm of French politics.</p>
<p>It is in this context that the ‘Kelkal affair’ happened. (Khaled Kelkal was a young man from Vaulx-en-Velin, implicated in the bloody Islamist attacks that occurred in Paris in 1995, who was shot by police on 29 September of that year.) Prior to this period, Islam in the <italic>banlieue</italic> had generally been well perceived by elected officials who saw in this religion an opportunity to maintain public order. After all, in 1994 Lyon had inaugurated its new mosque with great pomp. Once again, it was in the <italic>banlieues</italic> around Lyon that a new social Islam would attempt to establish itself on the ruins of the failed social work system. Between 1991 and 1993, the conventions held by the Union des jeunes musulmans (UJM) attracted several thousand followers from all over France. The UJM worked extremely hard towards galvanising resources in the <italic>banlieues</italic> where by now secular organisations had for the most part abandoned their activities. Initially they were praised for their efforts by the authorities, but eventually they were accused of nurturing an Islamic conspiracy.</p>
<p>Somewhat paradoxically though, it was the tragic events of 1995 that would incite these groups, which were so passionate about Islam, to draw closer to secular protest movements. Muslim political consciousness thus discovered its connection with immigration, and two distinct strands of activism in the <italic>banlieues</italic> converged via new networks such as the Mouvement de l’immigration et des banlieues (MIB) in Paris or DiverCité in Lyon. The urban uprisings of 2005 saw the emergence of groups such as the Indigènes de la République and the Conseil Représentatif des Associations Noires (CRAN) and issues appeared to be evolving, if not from a social question to a racial question, then at least towards greater public awareness of the postcolonial dimension of the struggle of the descendants of immigration. The focus shifted to the role of memory and to finding new ways of posing age-old questions: what exactly does it mean to be an Arab, Kabyle, black, West Indian, Sino-Vietnamese or a French Muslim? One potential risk was that such questions would lead to the overstatement of particular genealogies and spark memory wars. Activist movements multiplied exponentially: Arabs, Berbers, blacks, West Indians, girls from the <italic>banlieues</italic>, Arab-Muslims, and so forth. To outside observers, this new way of conceptualising advocacy could be interpreted as originating in the absence of shared perspectives. Nevertheless, a model of resistance could be evidenced through this diversity of ethnic, religious or gendered approaches aimed at improved representation in the public sphere. What these groups did affirm was the variety of ways one could live in French society while simultaneously valorising forms of collective empowerment and weaving together the disparate threads of a society built around inclusion. The eclecticism of these groups best translates the diversity of postcolonial legacies and the myriad ways in which these historical struggles relate to immigration.</p>
<p>These examples were relatively low-profile, and for most of the period between the 1990s and autumn 2005, the malaise of the <italic>banlieue</italic> was a fairly trivial element in French politics. In the meantime, the socio-political context was preoccupied with the Algerian civil war, the Second Intifada, 9/11, George W. Bush’s crusade in Iraq, and the tragic chronicle of Islamic terrorism. When Nicolas Sarkozy whipped out his ‘kärcher’ in 2005 and promised to rid the <italic>banlieue</italic> of its ‘racaille’, the history of the public encounter between immigration and French society was forever transformed. ‘L’ennemi étranger’ no longer came from abroad but was instead perpetually reproducing himself within society. The spectre that was thought to have been exorcised in the dark days after the Dreyfus Affair and Action Française once again haunted the public sphere. The image of the ‘enemy within’ was now associated with an Islamist polygamist, living off the state, whose children were left loafing on the streets.</p>
<p>From this cursory overview of the experiences of a generation, one might conclude prematurely that all of these efforts proved futile: the ‘beur’ movement, the affirmation of social agency in the <italic>banlieues</italic>, and the autonomy of the descendants of immigration. However, since the 1980s, these different threads have gradually been woven together into a broader quest for recognition. This process is far from complete, but the struggle for recognition has allowed for the emergence of historical social actors. Many of the participants belonging to this generation of activists have become entangled in an existential web of hope and despondency, of seemingly eternal precariousness, and of dreams deferred. But from this canvas of experiences the questioning of French society has remained constant. The real controversy when it comes to immigration is to be found in these different dialogical moments, which, in their very dispersion, nevertheless stand as opportunities for the reassertion of democratic principles. A number of themes thus emerge from this analysis and serve to underscore the obstacles that remain, while also opening up new horizons.</p>

<title>A new activism born of autonomy and precariousness</title>
<p>Assuming responsibility for one’s own representation, finding one’s own bearings and then sticking to them in spite of outside interference – these are the challenges shared by activist movements. However, the heritage of immigration is first and foremost a burden. How does one become the subject of one’s own history when social exclusion is the only model one has? How does one claim autonomy with no job, no qualifications, no training, and no guarantee of political representation? And perhaps more importantly, how can a social movement be initiated without a solid foundation? How is it possible to evoke the lived experience of a generation which can never be fully confident that it has finally and permanently escaped precariousness, and when all collective action seeking tangible public recognition seems doomed to failure?</p>
<p>Socio-economic precariousness is not necessarily a condition common to all heirs of immigration. Already, at the beginning of the 1980s, the ‘beur’ movement was split between an activist base of ‘lascars de banlieue’ and a ‘beur’ elite, often older, better off and more educated. The chasm separating these two groups was so significant that in the language of the <italic>banlieue</italic> the term ‘beur’ quickly became pejorative, designating a clique made up of trendy, Left-leaning cosmopolitans. ‘beurgeois’ were now set against ‘lascars’: the former advocated an alliance with Leftists in order to find a place in the public or cultural sphere, whereas the latter fought tooth and nail for autonomy and concentrated on issues of police conduct: ‘D’un coté les militants des grandes causes qui rêvent de représenter les banlieues, de l’autre les militants de la merde, les voyous du mouvement’ (Farid T. cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957155813477797">Boubeker, 1986</xref>: 110). But who were these ‘lascars’ referred to here? In actuality, many were defectors from the first group. In any case, groups of breakaway students controlled the direction of the movement. Drawing on the relentless experience of confrontation with the police, a new mythology built around the realities of the <italic>banlieues</italic> was created. For these activists, social insecurity continued to threaten the residents of the <italic>banlieues</italic> and the often repeated argument made by the police unions that the police were merely there in order to mitigate widespread misery was deemed little more than a way of excusing instances of police violence. Thus, despite the fact that between the 1980s and the 2000s cases of police brutality provided the main catalyst for collective action, no real debate over policing practices ever took place. In a context of mounting security concerns, the accusations levelled by youths already stereotyped as delinquents fell on deaf ears. The word of a hoodlum against that of sworn police officers: in the court of public opinion, the outcome of such trials had been predetermined.</p>
<p>What conclusions can we draw from the actions of these autonomous movements whose main cause consisted of conflicts over policing and justice? This has proved to be an uphill struggle, even though history has proved these activists were right, and that cases of police brutality and other racially based or security-based crimes continue to be the primary cause of urban uprisings. Additionally, these autonomous movements have been unique in their capacity to persevere and innovate – through protest, media campaigns, counter-investigations, civil action suits or monitoring judicial compliance – while also inventing new forms of activism in response to the changing landscape of political and social challenges. These important developments and concrete steps in the realm of social intervention have partially altered certain forms of anti-social behaviour in the <italic>banlieues</italic> while also moving public opinion on the question of deportations

<title>Between the social and the political: the new ethnic situation and the social question</title>
<p>In the days following the Marche pour l’égalité et contre le racisme, a handful of ‘beurs’ claimed a place for themselves in the political sphere. Activists, artists and community volunteers, for the most part generals without troops, legitimised themselves by capitalising on a possible mobilisation of the <italic>banlieues</italic>. But as we have seen, the ‘beur’ movement was soon confronted with the limits of a political imagination that relied on narrow interpretations of Republican ideals and values. Gradually, with its media campaign promoting a pluralist cosmopolitanism from which the kind of social, cultural and urban connotations associated with immigration discourse were absent, SOS Racisme stifled the ‘beurs’. At the beginning of the 1980s, within Leftist circles anti-racist positions prevailed. From this perspective, in order to address public concerns and to compensate for the ascendency of the Front National, consensus was reached around a kind of political realism. But this approach precluded a political understanding of the resistance and the revolt taking place in the <italic>banlieues</italic>. Most studies dedicated to the collective action taken by youths with backgrounds in immigration concur when it comes to recognising the steady disappearance of social agents. It would take the uprisings in the autumn of 2005 for this conclusion to be revisited. What seems to have remained inaudible in the public debate is the extent to which the actions and collective experiences of these ‘étrangers de l’intérieur’ stand in contradistinction to an abstract universalism according to which egalitarianism must be premised on forgetting one’s own origins and affiliations.</p>
<p>In reality, the cultural, political and social realities of immigrants allow them to lay claim to new incarnations of the social question and therefore offer insights into a new facet of ethnic discrimination. For some of the organisations mentioned above, the central concern is with the socio-judicial dimension, whereas for others a socio-educative approach prevails, or the rediscovery of Islamic culture as a practical exercise of solidarity in the face of shared disaffiliation. The action of these groups is not therefore limited to the socio-cultural realm, or for that matter even to the local sphere of the <italic>banlieues</italic>. On the contrary, it is their capacity to create networks and to negotiate partnerships that is the prerequisite to public recognition, which is the essential concern of any struggle. Indeed, if today the question of identity spills into the public sphere in the context of globalisation, this is partially as a result of the actions taken by minorities against the stifling of their singularity. For it is precisely the refusal to accept the kind of dehumanising representations which result in feelings of disenfranchisement, by daring to express themselves in their own words and by exposing their wounds and their imperfections, that those who are excluded from the French model of integration can escape public disdain and even attain recognition. Furthermore, if the term ‘integration’ now causes some discomfort, this is above all the consequence of a collective questioning of the concept, for it is in participating in the transformation of French society, rather than conforming to some kind of prescribed mould, that each person today creates her/his own space.</p>
<p>In the end, the descendants of postcolonial immigration are reflecting on the meaning of coexistence. What else are these new activist minorities seeking to compensate for if not the shortcomings of the state, the contradictions between the values and principles of the social Republic, and the discriminatory reasoning at play on the ground? Their demands for justice and equality thus constitute, at the very least, attempts to apply these values, if not then to implement the notion of the political as it is conceived by Jacques Rancière, namely as a reconfiguration of the visible, the thinkable, and the possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957155813477797">Rancière, 1998</xref>). For this to take place, a critical re-evaluation of the great narrative of the nation must be undertaken.</p>

<title>Conclusion: Between history and memory: the legacy of a generation of experiences</title>
<p>‘Beur’ discourse was defined by the ambition to make history, to create a historic or a political space beyond the exclusive framework of immigration. Unlike the ‘beurs’, at the end of the 1990s new social agents understood that subjectivity was only achievable through self-exposure: to a history, to a memory whose narrative needed urgently to be written both for oneself and for others. The essential issue was therefore to update references to identity and to align a pluralist memory of immigration within the context of the present. More precisely, it became important to create a cultural space in which one could reflect on the very historicity of forms of experience. As such, it is the legacy of this generation of strife which opens up perspectives for the reconciliation of history and memory. This is why it was crucial to describe how new networks established between Muslim and secular movements have proved so instrumental, since even though they have differing visions of the world, these activists nonetheless found common ground in the defense of a nascent history of the <italic>banlieues</italic> and in their refusal to accept that this history should be sacrificed on the altar of Republican or for that matter globalised Islamic principles. For whether we talk about Muslim brothers or the children of the secular tradition, the sons and daughters of Berbers or of Arabs from France, the ‘lascars’ of the <italic>banlieue</italic> or students, adolescents or forty-somethings, female or male activists, all these groups have refused to allow their individual histories to be considered negligible or used as a cover or an illustration for the telling of another history – that other History with a capital ‘H’ – and before which they are expected to kneel.</p>
<p>The task of writing this history still remains. While self-styled organic intellectuals abound, we must note the absence of world-class authors close to immigration movements (in the way that James Baldwin supported the black civil rights movement in the United States).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0957155813477797">2</xref></sup> Perhaps the interrogation of history must come first, as a kind of prerequisite to the writing of history. This is always an issue underpinning the passage from a simple lived history to history as the outcome of debate and confrontation: discussing history so that it takes on structure and precision in order to weave the fabric of the experience of a generation. History is thus constituted from a critical distance, but in the end one must endeavour to move beyond a conflictual dialogue between history and memory in order to understand the degree to which history depends on memory, as Paul Ricœur notes: ‘confronté à d’autres relations au passé que l’histoire, dès lors que les mêmes événements tombent sous le jugement … de l’opinion publique et des médias, que l’histoire et la fiction entrent en compétition critique’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957155813477797">2002</xref>: 45).</p>
<p>It is in this sense that immigration allows us to consider the misunderstandings between history and memory. The link between collective memory and national memory is once again put into question by the overflow into the public sphere of other narratives privileging clandestine memories. The emergence of a pluralist memory of immigration thus underlines the need for a revision of the great national narrative, but also for the incorporation of the forgotten historical archives of those ‘peoples without history’ – to take up the Hegelian expression – and the resulting re-appropriation of an alternative memory. Of course, such a challenge will seem daunting, especially when confronted with the steadfastness of the custodians of a mythical ‘vieille France’ bent on repeating history and reinventing the foreigner in order to more effectively maintain the stranglehold on the <italic>banlieues</italic>. And yet, since the 1980s, a symbolic revolution has taken place: immigration, having become the defining element in a broader reflection on identity, has now imposed itself as an undisputable component of French society. Sweet vindication for the silent masses of French History.</p>
