<abstract>
<p>We describe a quality improvement programme used in a large teaching hospital trust to reduce the number of hospital acquired blood stream infections (HA-BSI) relating to vascular devices. Our strategy included the appointment of a lead nurse whose role was to engage with clinicians, to develop guidelines, to standardise and facilitate good practice, to train to uniform standards, and to retain local ownership, while working to avoid risk compensation. Information was gathered using our laboratory data search system, as well as observation and audit of vascular access device practice. Vascular access device training became part of all induction and update programmes for clinical staff.The results showed a significant and sustained decline in frequency of patient episodes of HA-BSI. The numbers of patients from whom coagulase-negative staphylococci, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Klebsiella</italic> and <italic>Enterobacter spp</italic>. were isolated in any given month all declined significantly. The numbers of patients with positive blood cultures with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> did not decline. The improvement has been sustained for more than 3.5 years. This study shows that when standardisation, facilitation and education are developed with stakeholder involvement, it is possible to achieve a sustained reduction in the incidence of vascular device associated infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many different approaches have been taken to try to reduce the risks of vascular access device associated infection. These have included approaches based on technologies such as antimicrobial central lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757177412443169">McConnell et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1757177412443169">Ramritu et al, 2008</xref>), antimicrobial locks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757177412443169">Safdar and Maki, 2006</xref>) disinfectants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757177412443169">Timsit et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177412443169">Dixon and Carver, 2010</xref>) needle-free connectors, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177412443169">Luebke et al, 1998</xref>) antimicrobial connectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757177412443169">Maki, 2010</xref>), and on education and training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757177412443169">Parra et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177412443169">Lobo et al, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Considerable success has been reported over the last decade using ‘care bundle’ approaches applied at the level of intensive care units. The relative success of care bundle approaches in controlling device associated infections have led to the advocacy of a zero tolerance to (preventable) device associated infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757177412443169">Pronovost et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177412443169">Eggiman et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177412443169">Halton et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177412443169">Bhutta et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757177412443169">Robb et al, 2010</xref>). Care bundles are defined by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement as a ‘set of evidence-based practices – generally three to five – that, when performed collectively and reliably, have been proven to improve patient outcomes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757177412443169">Resar et al, 2005</xref>). The bundle approach clearly specifies accountability, responsibility and ownership of tasks. Practices are standardised and compliance with best practice is regularly monitored and reported.</p>
<p>Attempts have and continue to be made to structure patient safety initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757177412443169">Pronovost et al, 2009</xref>) and to develop a theoretical framework for organizational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757177412443169">Weiner, 2009</xref>) yet there remains no clear explanation for the success and sometimes lack of success of care bundle approaches. Studies of a recent Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) programme aimed at improving patient safety in NHS hospitals failed to show evidence of improvement attributable to the intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757177412443169">Pronovost and Morlock, 2011</xref>) despite relative success with similar approaches in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757177412443169">Pronovost et al, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Changes in the perception of risk may lead to changes in behaviour and this change in behaviour (termed risk compensation) can undermine the desired improvement in safety (see for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412443169">Cassell et al, 2006</xref>). For example the introduction of antimicrobial central venous catheters could potentially change the perception of the risk of infection and this change in perception could lead to lower levels of vigilance in practice. Care bundles will be effective when opportunities for risk compensation are restricted. A criticism of the recent and unsuccessful IHI initiative is that it was overcomplicated with too many elements for effective compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757177412443169">Pronovost and Morlock, 2011</xref>) and ample scope for risk compensation behaviour.</p>
<p>We describe a trust-wide quality improvement programme aimed at reducing the risks of central venous catheter (CVC) device related bloodstream infection in a large teaching hospital. The approach that we describe was designed to maintain personal responsibility, encourage local ownership and empowerment, and to minimise opportunities for risk compensation behaviour. The questions that we asked before implementation of any change in practice was, ‘Might this change result in risk compensation behaviour?’ and, ‘How can risk compensation behaviour be minimised such that we facilitate good practice and discourage bad practice?’ Similarities and differences from a care bundle approach are discussed.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1757177412443169">
<title>Context</title>
<p>In our trust the average daily bed occupancy across the three sites for the years of the study were 901 (2007–08), 860 (2008–09), 848 (2009–10) and 849 (2010–11) using National Health Service KH03 data. Major specialist units within the trust include renal, cancer, cardiac, intensive care (adult and neonatal), and trauma.</p>
<p>A trust vascular access device (VAD) group was formed in 2006 and this group consisted of individuals with particular clinical responsibilities for central venous catheter insertion and care. Specialty groups represented included oncology, renal, interventional radiology, adult and paediatric gastroenterology (nutrition), intensive care, hepato-biliary surgery, infection control and microbiology. The main function of the group (as specified in the terms of reference) was to reduce the burden of preventable VAD associated infection in patients under the care of Barts and the London NHS Trust.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1757177412443169">
<title>Outline of the problem</title>
<p>The VAD group reported to the trust’s Infection Control Committee and made a number of recommendations up to January 2008 including the recommendation of the appointment of a nurse whose role was to standardise vascular access device practices across the trust. This recommendation followed the observation that vascular access device practices varied considerably within the trust even within specialty groups. For example in a trust-wide audit of insertion and post-insertion central venous catheter care in May 2007 exit sites were either not routinely decontaminated or were decontaminated with any of five different disinfectant preparations at various intervals; seven different types of connection devices were in use; the catheter was either not secured or secured using one of nine different methods; there were six different types of dressing in use for the exit site; and one of five different disinfectant preparations were being used for skin disinfection prior to CVC insertion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1757177412443169">
<title>Strategy for change</title>
<p>The nurse appointment was taken up on 4 February 2008. We decided that we needed standardisation, education and facilitation while retaining local ownership. Standardisation of policies and practices (where there was broad agreement that it was reasonable to do so) was the first step. We tried to maintain and encourage local ownership of good practice, and also to ensure that appropriate skills were retained at the ward level. To maintain local ownership the nurse did not take up a primary role in the insertion or post-insertion care of vascular access devices.</p>
<p>Proposals for trust-wide standards and best practice recommendations went through a number of iterations following review and feedback from the VAD group (VADG) members and also a more extended circulation of proposals throughout the trust.</p>
<p>Trust-wide ‘best practice’ recommendations were agreed prior to and in the six months following the appointment of the nurse and these included the use of 2% chlorhexidine solutions both for peripheral and central catheter insertion, and for connector decontamination; standard packs for peripheral and central venous catheter insertion; the introduction of the Visual Infusion Phlebitis Score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757177412443169">Jackson 1998</xref>) documentation system for peripheral catheters; the use of a standard needle-free injectable hub; standardised dressings for insertion sites; an agreed CVC fixation method; an agreed CVC and peripheral catheter insertion methodology (including preferred sites) and training programme using simulators; and enhanced requirements for documentation (including operator details). A standardised aseptic non-touch technique was introduced from July 2010. The timing of the introduction of interventions is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177412443169">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Procedure packs were made available for peripheral and central line insertion. Local ownership was supported by active engagement of staff in developing standardised elements. Specialty based individuals were trained as trainers in best practice and provided with appropriate training tools such as videos showing good practice. The trust-wide audits were carried out by staff not based on the ward(s) for which they carried out audits.</p>
<p>This approach was established within the context of pre-existing trust infection control policies that focused particularly on the achievement of nationally set target reductions in meticillin resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) bloodstream and <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infections. In part to support the trust’s MRSA control strategy, vascular access device audits based on the wards were introduced in June 2008. Each ward was required to audit 10 peripheral cannula insertions each month and post-insertion care for 10 patients on the ward each month. Those wards with patients with central venous catheters (such as intensive care) carried out central venous catheter audits with similar frequency requirements. The audit questions and scoring systems were based on the trust-wide best practice guidelines (formally validated in October 2008). Wards which reported low levels of compliance were subject to a range of management actions ranging from improvement and warning notices to management restructuring.</p>

<p>Data was retrieved from the microbiology laboratory information system using a standardised search programme. The search included blood cultures from inpatients only. Positive blood cultures were de-duplicated so that only the first isolate with a specific microbial identification from a patient was included for any given month.</p>
<p>Compliance with policies and the number of inpatients with a CVC were assessed at four trust-wide audits carried out in June 2007, and January 2009, 2010 and 2011.</p>

<p>The results of trust-wide audits of CVC management practices carried out in May 2007 (eight months before the start of the improvement programme) of 110 patients with a CVC and January 2009 of 118 patients with a CVC showed that there was an increase in the use of 2% chlorhexidine for hub and skin disinfection from 17/110 in May 2007 to 78/118 in January 2009, in the use of the trust policy recommended CVC dressing from 24/110 to 69/118, and in the numbers with a daily record of the insertion site (47/110 in May 2007 to 73/118 in January 2009). Further trust-wide audits in January 2010 and January 2011 showed further increases in compliance with trust policy recommendations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The most striking result of the approach that we report is not so much the early decline in the number of hospital acquired bloodstream infections which may reflect the enthusiasm and profile of the VADG and the nurse, rather it is the sustained reduction beyond the intervention period, up to the time of this report (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1757177412443169">Figure 1</xref>). Annual audits of CVC and PVC use in the trust show that half of the inpatients in this trust have a vascular access device at some stage of their stay. We do not routinely record whether, when blood is collected for culture, there is a device <italic>in situ</italic>. However, there were significant and sustained decreases in the number of episodes of bloodstream infection caused by a wide range of bacteria for which vascular access devices are a major risk factor including coagulase-negative staphylococci, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA and MSSA), <italic>Klebsiella spp, Enterobacter spp</italic>, and <italic>Enterococcus spp</italic>. The numbers of patients with episodes of <italic>E. coli</italic> bloodstream infection did not decline, which may reflect the dominance of other risk factors such as urinary catheterisation for <italic>E.coli</italic> bloodstream infection. There are a number of possible explanations for the sustained reduction seen in the improvement programme that we report following the start of the intervention in February 2008. These include sustained improvement in blood culture collection methods, and in CVC and peripheral catheter insertion and post-insertion management. Detailed investigation of cases of MRSA bacteraemia showed that from April 2009–10 there were nine cases of MRSA bacteraemia that were thought to be contaminants, this declined to four in the year April 2010-11 and since then no cases have been recorded. It is likely that the overall reduction in the number of blood cultures received by the laboratory is related to a reduction in the positive blood cultures. Patients with bloodstream infection may be very ill and require repeated evaluations often involving the repeated collection of blood cultures. In addition to the bias in blood culture collection attributable to illness severity, identification of a positive blood culture frequently leads to the collection of further blood cultures in order to confirm a diagnosis, and follow the response to treatment.</p>
<p>Many studies have shown that a care bundle approach can reduce the incidence of vascular access device associated infections in the context of intensive care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757177412443169">Pronovost et al, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177412443169">Eggiman et al, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177412443169">Halton et al, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177412443169">Bhutta et al, 2007</xref>). The favourable results from care bundles interventions in intensive care have also been reported in intensive care step-down units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757177412443169">Marra et al, 2010</xref>). The effectiveness of care bundle approaches outside of an intensive care context is less clear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757177412443169">Marwick and Davey (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757177412443169">Provonost et al (2010)</xref> have recently reported a sustained reduction in bloodstream infection rates among Michigan ICUs in the Keystone ICU (KI) project. The bloodstream infection control intervention used in the KI project included four recommendations designed to improve insertion technique and a fifth recommendation of removal of unnecessary central venous catheters. The intervention focused on encouraging clinicians to comply with the recommendations through teaching, training, and feedback. In addition a central line cart with necessary supplies was created and checklists were used to ensure good infection control practice.</p>
<p>There is no agreed theoretical basis for the success of care bundle approaches in reducing CVC associated infection. One possible explanation is that care bundles reduce the opportunities for risk compensation because the care bundles include multiple interventions restricting the opportunities for compensation behaviour(s). We report a successful trust-wide approach to the control of hospital acquired bloodstream infection. The approach that we have taken is not a typical care bundle approach in that interventions have been introduced over a period of years. Our approach from the outset was to maintain personal responsibility at the ward level. Each time that an intervention was made it was made trust-wide, and attempts were made to make compliance easier than non-compliance. Similarities with a care bundle approach included standardised practises based on evidence, and encouragement of local ownership. Dissimilarities with a care bundles approach included the lower intensity of monitoring of compliance, the wider range of interventions, and the trust-wide nature of the approach.</p>
<p>The approach that we have taken is novel in that it is based on a theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177412443169">Adams, 1995</xref>) for which there is little explicit mention in the literature on hospital acquired infection. Underlying the approach was a recurring question – ‘how do we make it easier to do the right thing and harder to do the wrong thing?’ At the start of the project there was a lack of consistency in what was considered ‘best’ practice even within the same specialty group and this led to confusion at all levels but particularly for staff such as junior doctors moving between different areas of the hospital. Many different types of equipment were available for operators; and there was a requirement to collect up equipment before carrying out a procedure (with all of the associated inefficiencies in use of time). Standardisation of both equipment and of the technical approach to biomedical devices allows both the facilitation and the training of good practice.</p>
