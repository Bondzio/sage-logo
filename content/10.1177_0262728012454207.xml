<p>This captivating history of market governance in late colonial India analyses the making of the free-trade regime through colonial law and legal reform, from the take-over of the colony by the Crown in 1857 to the final years of British rule. Examining laws and jurisprudence on a wide range of economic, property and family matters, Birla shows how the British administration and the Indian reforming elite sought to enforce a liberal economic system at the expense of indigenous systems of trade and kinship, particularly the ‘family firm’. This is, therefore, a book about the formation of the modern capitalist subject in India, highlighting the use of colonial law and discourse in this process. It also studies responses to this process by local merchants, the ‘targets’ of this new legal regime, focusing on the <italic>Marwari</italic> communities of Rajasthan.</p>
<p>Birla starts by revisiting the origins of liberal democracy and market governance in India, pointing to early attempts at economic modernisation in the mid to late 1800s. The dawn of colonial modernity, she argues, brought with it criticism of old commercial practices. It soon became imperative for the British administration and the Indian elite to reform ‘Indian Economic Man’ from an agent burdened by complicated networks of family, caste and custom to a ‘rational’ individual bound by contract in the open market (p. 2). This was the basis for the flurry of laws which, by the late 1880s, had introduced new categories for trade.</p>
<p>This study is interesting also as an account of the codification of personal laws, which Birla argues was an integral part of the strategy of imposing a free trade regime. She shows that the main target of these laws was the ‘family firm’, a unit based on caste, lineage and family affiliation which threatened to lock capital in extended networks. Colonial law would thus redefine the family firm as the ‘Hindu Undivided Family’ (HUF), placing it under the umbrella of ‘private’ personal law and cutting it off from the ‘public’ sphere of the market. This bold thesis no doubt challenges current assumptions about the origins and functions of the personal law system in India.</p>
<p>The book is divided into two parts. Part 1 examines the creation through colonial law of the free-trade regime and the undermining of kinship-based commercial practices. Chapter 1 draws attention to major commercial and financial statutes, explaining how the Indian Companies Act of 1882 provided a new definition of the corporation as a ‘public person’ and the limited liability contract as a yardstick for civil society (p. 28). This division between public and private was a first step towards regulating local forms of trade and credit, as merchant groups operated through extended networks based on family, caste and lineage in a manner which could only be hampered by such a division. The Indian Income Tax Act of 1886, in turn, would build on this public/private distinction to tax the income of ‘family firms’ redefined as the HUF—a category clearly at odds with the nature of the family firm (pp. 16, 28, 57). More interesting and very clear is Birla’s analysis of the Negotiable Instruments Act of 1881, showing how colonial law aimed at ‘standardising’ customary negotiable instruments such as bills of exchange (<italic>hundis</italic>) by basing them on rules of contract, in line with ‘European custom’ (p. 65).</p>
<p>Building on this analysis, Chapters 2 and 3 discuss reforms in the law on charitable endowments. This shows how colonial legislation and case-law introduced the ‘trust contract’ as the new basis for all forms of charitable endowment. Thus, gifts to temples were re-coded as permanent gifts to deities under the law of mortmain, with the effect of restricting the fluidity of customary gifting practices.</p>
<p>Part 2 of the book deals specifically with how local merchant groups negotiated with the colonial law. Chapter 4 focuses on criminal law, in particular on the criminalisation of customary forms of future trading. Here again, Birla shows how the real target were family firms, whose gambling practices threatened standardisation and were thus rebranded as illicit and open to prosecution. Marwaris contested this, Birla asserts, but does not fully explore how this was done. The last chapter returns to the HUF, showing how Marwaris promoted the concept of the joint family to reinforce their own patriarchal authority, especially over the exchange of women in marriage. This introduces another dimension into the debate which ultimately blurs the picture and makes the narrative somewhat disjointed.</p>
<p><italic>Stages of Capital</italic> is thus a very interesting book, but suffers from some flaws. To begin with, it is not particularly easy to read. Jargon–heavy and relentlessly abstract, the narrative is difficult to follow for a lay reader. Moreover, the constant attention paid to colonial ‘discourse’ somewhat skews the analysis and leaves some key questions unanswered. The most important question is whether colonial law had any real impact in changing the practice of market governance, beyond changes in law and discourse. This is a point of considerable importance which the author seems to discount at the outset, noting that her study focuses on ‘processes by which the law […] suppresses and transforms local knowledges and conventions’ (p. 38). But did the colonial law totally suppress such knowledge and conventions? In her study of the Companies Act 1882, the author mentions local officials complaining that British-run companies were ‘unable to transform the legal rules for companies’ procedure into everyday habit’ (p. 42). If that was admittedly the case, it seems unwarranted to hold that the colonial law completely suppressed and delegitimised customary practices, rather than sought in vain to impose ineffectual legal fictions on a resilient social order.</p>
<p>We find, therefore, that Birla views the question of the transformative ‘effects’ of the colonial legal regime too rigidly through the narrow lens of the official law and its criteria of legitimacy. She does not assess how penetrating changes in the law actually were, and whether local merchant groups considered such categories as ‘mortmain’, ‘trust’, ‘joint family’ and all such fictions at all legitimate to the extent of fully readjusting former practices. Perhaps this gap in the book is a result of the author’s choice of formal source material. Clearly Birla has brought into light an interesting range of laws, regulations and court rulings to show the intent of colonial authorities. But focusing on such material and the discourse they convey risks overstating the official discursive dimension at the expense of more pressing questions of actual practices on the ground.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this study contributes well to a range of debates about the history of colonial law and its relation with capitalism. It also adds to current understandings of the role of family firms in South Asian economies in particular.</p>
