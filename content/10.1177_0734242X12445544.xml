<p>In our relatively affluent European region, we (as private residents) throw away about a third of the food we purchase. About 60% of residential food waste (by weight) is considered avoidable (it is edible), 20% is potentially avoidable (such as leftover breadcrumbs) and 20% is considered unavoidable (such as bones and peelings). Considering the food production life cycle from ‘field to fork’, encompassing agriculture, industry, distribution, retailers, restaurants, catering services, and private households, food wastage could account for up to 50% of production. These are, to any standard, very high numbers that should be reduced for economic, environmental and ethical reasons. Of course food wasting varies with geographical location in response to culture, standard of living, level of urbanization, local climate, etc. Quantification and characterization of food waste is therefore, uncertain and overall environmental impacts of food waste treatment are difficult to assess.</p>
<p>Eurostat data indicates that in 2008, about 116 million tonnes of food waste was generated by the EU27 countries across all sectors, corresponding to 4% of total waste production, or 232 kg capita<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>. Households alone waste about 48 kg capita<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>, corresponding to about 21% of total food waste generation across all sectors. In 2008, Eurostat reported food wasting in Denmark of 160 000 tonnes (30 kg capita<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>) generated across all sectors, including 37 000 tonnes (7 kg capita<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>) directly from households. An assessment of Danish food waste generation performed in 2011, by the University of Aarhus and the University of Copenhagen, showed that about 1 million tonnes, or 285 kg capita<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>, of food waste was generated across all sectors. This included 237 000 tonnes from households (103 kg capita<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>). The relatively large discrepancy between these numbers stems from different methods for collecting data about waste generation and illustrates the difficulty in obtaining reliably accurate figures for food waste generation.</p>
<p>Both in Europe and globally, food waste has been, and to a large degree still is, disposed of at landfills or uncontrolled dumps. Several countries, including Japan, Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland incinerate food waste together with other municipal wastes for energy recovery. During the previous 20 years, anaerobic digestion for methane production and energy recovery have gained increased interest for treatment of especially industrial food wastes, including a large part of the non-edible fraction. Composting of food waste with the aim of reducing volume and recovering nutrients has also gained increased interest, although the waste quantities treated using this technology, are relatively small compared to other technologies. Food production generally results in a net CO<sub>2</sub> emission, whereas food waste management measures may result in either a net CO<sub>2</sub> emission or a net CO<sub>2</sub> saving, depending on the treatment processes applied.</p>
<p>It may be assumed that if food wastage is reduced, the associated impacts on the CO<sub>2</sub> balance from both food production and food waste treatment are minimized. To illustrate the potential reduction in carbon footprint per capita, by non-wasting food, a simple estimate of the net change in carbon footprint of the food production and food waste treatment systems was made. The estimate was based on Danish conditions where about 109 kg of edible food waste is generated per person per year with 26, 21, 13 and 40% produced in agriculture, food processing, retail and households, respectively, and where the food waste composition is about 76% vegetable and 24% animal waste. It was further assumed that the edible food waste from agriculture, retail and households was co-incinerated with residual municipal waste, whereas edible vegetable and meat waste from the food industry was digested or incinerated, respectively.</p>
<p>The estimate shows that, if the 109 kg of edible food waste is avoided, it will result in a net savings of about 240 kg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq capita<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup> throughout the whole food supply and food waste management chain. In comparison, studies have shown that the current treatment of organic municipal waste (sewage sludge, organic household waste, yard and park waste, and organic waste from small businesses) yields a net savings of about 210 kg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq capita<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>. In this context, edible food waste prevention provides a significant CO<sub>2</sub> savings. An estimate of the current municipal waste management in Scandinavia indicates a potential net savings of about 1580 kg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq capita<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>, thus, if an efficient scheme for reducing food waste is implemented, the potential savings could reach 1820 kg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq capita<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>. This is equivalent to about 20% of the carbon footprint of the average EU citizen and clearly shows that improvements in the waste sector can lead to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The above estimates suggest that significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions might be achieved by reducing the generation of other types of wastes in addition to food wastes. Moreover, there may also be a significant economic gain. Instead of investing heavily in infrastructure and technology for waste handling and treatment, money may be better spent on waste prevention. Of course there will always be waste that cannot be avoided, however, significant economic and environmental benefits are likely achievable if waste generation is prevented whenever possible.</p>
<p>Food waste generation is also a rapidly increasing problem in countries with a fast increase in the standard of living, such as China, India, Brazil and Mexico, where the waste management infrastructure is still mostly based on uncontrolled landfilling with significant emissions of methane to the atmosphere. The relative environmental savings achieved by moving from landfilling to food waste prevention is potentially considerable, especially in regions relying heavily on fossil energy to produce food.</p>
<p>Other environmental considerations beyond greenhouse gas emissions should of course be taken into account when assessing potential impacts of (food) waste prevention compared to treatment, for example resource depletion (such as phosphorus), social aspects, and macro-economic issues. This editorial is intended to promote discussion of these issues and researchers are invited to submit to <italic>Waste Management &amp; Research</italic> manuscripts that elaborate on the topics presented here. A special <italic>Waste Management &amp; Research</italic> issue on carbon flows in waste management is being considered for publication in 2013, and an international research seminar on the subject will be announced soon.</p>
