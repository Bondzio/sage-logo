<abstract>
<p>In low- and middle-income developing countries, the informal (collection and) recycling sector (here abbreviated IRS) is an important, but often unrecognised, part of a city’s solid waste and resources management system. Recent evidence shows recycling rates of 20–30% achieved by IRS systems, reducing collection and disposal costs. They play a vital role in the value chain by reprocessing waste into secondary raw materials, providing a livelihood to around 0.5% of urban populations. However, persisting factual and perceived problems are associated with IRS (waste-picking): occupational and public health and safety (H&amp;S), child labour, uncontrolled pollution, untaxed activities, crime and political collusion. Increasingly, incorporating IRS as a legitimate stakeholder and functional part of solid waste management (SWM) is attempted, further building recycling rates in an affordable way while also addressing the negatives. Based on a literature review and a practitioner’s workshop, here we develop a systematic framework—or typology—for classifying and analysing possible interventions to promote the integration of IRS in a city’s SWM system. Three primary interfaces are identified: between the IRS and the SWM system, the materials and value chain, and society as a whole; underlain by a fourth, which is focused on organisation and empowerment. To maximise the potential for success, IRS integration/inclusion/formalisation initiatives should consider all four categories in a balanced way and pay increased attention to their interdependencies, which are central to success, including specific actions, such as the IRS having access to source separated waste. A novel rapid evaluation and visualisation tool is presented—<italic>integration radar</italic> (diagram) or <italic>InterRa</italic>—aimed at illustrating the degree to which a planned or existing intervention considers each of the four categories. The tool is further demonstrated by application to 10 cases around the world, including a step-by-step guide.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Solid waste recycling in developing countries is generally carried out by the informal sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12454934">Gutberlet, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0734242X12454934">Medina 2007</xref>). This was true at some stage in the past, in what are now high-income developed countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0734242X12454934">Velis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0734242X12454934">Wilson, 2007</xref>). It is still the case in the low- and middle-income developing countries of Asia, Latin America and Africa, which are the main focus here. The informal recycling sector (IRS) also persists alongside the ‘modern’, formal sector recycling in Central and Eastern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X12454934">Istavan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0734242X12454934">Obersteiner et al., 2010</xref>); in emerging economies, such as Malaysia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0734242X12454934">Murad and Siwar, 2007</xref>)—now officially a high-income country; and is even reappearing in Southern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0734242X12454934">Papaoikonomou et al., 2009</xref>), further amplified by the effects of considerable immigration influx combined with the current economic crisis.</p>
<p>Activities of the informal sector in waste management vary widely, ranging from groups organised in cooperatives providing door-to-door collection of either recyclates separated at source or of mixed waste which they then often sort, to individuals scavenging in open dumps, transfer stations and communal bins (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0734242X12454934">Medina, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0734242X12454934">Wilson et al., 2006</xref>). Specifically, we use the definition from a 2006 GTZ study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0734242X12454934">Scheinberg et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0734242X12454934">Wehenpohl et al. 2007</xref>): <italic>‘the informal solid waste sector refers to individuals or enterprises who are involved in recycling and waste management activities but are not sponsored, financed, recognised or allowed by the formal solid waste authorities, or who operate in violation of or in competition with formal authorities’.</italic> This definiton is different to that of the informal sector in other contexts, where the term may be synonymous with the ‘black economy’. In particular, informal sector waste and recycling workers and businesses can be, and often are, registered with the authorities and pay taxes [e.g. as in Brazil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X12454934">Dias and Alves (2008)</xref>]; in this case, the definition of informality mainly relates to their lack of recognised status within the solid waste sector. Clearly, this definition does not include (organised) criminal activities, often evident in developed countries as, for example, the theft of valuable metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X12454934">Baillie, 2012</xref>), nor does it address issues around the status/rights of illegal immigrants who have been reported to participate in informal sector activities in some countries.</p>
<p>There is increasing consensus among all stakeholders and experts that the informal sector in general, and the IRS in particular, should not and, in fact, cannot be ignored while attempting to improve waste and resource management systems in developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12454934">Agamuthu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12454934">Ali, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12454934">Besiou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12454934">Chaturvedi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X12454934">Dias and Alves, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12454934">Gutberlet, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734242X12454934">Luken, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0734242X12454934">Sang-Arun 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0734242X12454934">Scheinberg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0734242X12454934">Scheinberg et al. 2011</xref>). Accumulating evidence suggests that these activities can be beneficial to formal municipal waste and resource management, in addition to providing a livelihood to around 0.5% of the urban population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0734242X12454934">Scheinberg et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0734242X12454934">Wilson et al., 2012</xref>). Specifically, informal sector and micro-enterprise recycling, reuse and repair systems achieve considerable recycling rates—often 20–30% wt. in low-income countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0734242X12454934">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0734242X12454934">2012</xref>). They are also entirely market driven with their only income coming from selling the collected segregated, and often reprocessed, materials and can, thus, save local authorities around 20% or more of what they would otherwise need to spend on waste management, representing many millions of dollars per annum in large cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0734242X12454934">Scheinberg et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0734242X12454934">Wilson et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>However, persistent factual and perceived issues with the activities of the informal sector, such as occupational and public H&amp;S, child labour, uncontrolled pollutant flows, untaxed activities, association with crime and political collusion, and incompatibility with the image of a modern city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0734242X12454934">Medina, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0734242X12454934">Patwary et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0734242X12454934">Wilson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0734242X12454934">Xu et al., 2012</xref>) result in poor inclusion/integration into official systems, despite the long-standing efforts of external support organisations, such as international donors and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12454934">Gunsilius et al., 2011</xref>). There is a major opportunity for win–win solutions—building recycling rates, protecting and developing people’s livelihoods, addressing the negative aspects of current informal recycling on health and the environment, and reducing costs to the city of managing its wastes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0734242X12454934">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>)—if the informal sector can be included more successfully within an integrated and sustainable waste management system.</p>
<p>Over the last 10 years research has tried to account, analyse, comprehend and propose solutions to address the key challenges related to the integration/inclusion/formalisation of the informal recyclers, considering waste management, material flows, and socioeconomic, governance and business aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12454934">Ahmed and Ali, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12454934">Asim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12454934">Atienza, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12454934">Chaturvedi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12454934">Fernandez, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X12454934">Gerdes and Gunsilius, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X12454934">Iskandar and Tjell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0734242X12454934">Mitchell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0734242X12454934">Moreno-Sanchez and Maldonado, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0734242X12454934">Nas and Jaffe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0734242X12454934">Ojeda-Benitez et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0734242X12454934">Rathi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0734242X12454934">Sanada and Yoshida, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0734242X12454934">Sang-Arun, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0734242X12454934">Schamber, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0734242X12454934">Scheinberg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0734242X12454934">Sembiring and Nitivattananon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0734242X12454934">Spies et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0734242X12454934">Suchada et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0734242X12454934">Velis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0734242X12454934">Wilson et al., 2006</xref>). Such interventions are described variously as aimed at the ‘integration’, ‘inclusion’, ‘formalisation’ or ‘legalisation’ of the IRS. Here, we continue the earlier practice of using the first three terms fairly interchangeably, while acknowledging recent efforts to provide precise definitions to differentiate the use of each of these terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0734242X12454934">Scheinberg, 2012</xref>), which, however, remain widely debated.</p>
<p>Recently, an International Solid Waste Association (ISWA) Task Force on Globalisation and Waste Management has been working towards preparing guidelines on how best to promote the inclusion/integration of the informal sector within a city’s waste management system. To provide a sound basis for such guidance for use in developing country cities, we propose a novel framework for classifying and analysing possible interventions to promote inclusion and integration of the IRS in a developing country city’s solid waste management (SWM) system, along with a tool for evaluating and visualising the focus of such interventions rapidly. This aims to be a comprehensive, integrated and structured systems approach, drawing from, and bringing together, all aspects of the phenomenon into a practically applicable tool designed to maximise the chances of success and deliver benefits to all stakeholders. We also provide 10 practical examples by applying the framework/tool to a selection of case studies.</p>

<title>Methodological approach towards the framework</title>
<p>The outcome of this research is also a methodology. It comprises a novel analytical framework for the better integration of the IRS activities in a city’s waste management system, along with specific tools developed to support its hands-on application. Hence, this methodology section covers the general approach towards creating these items—their detailed description can be found in the <italic>Results</italic> section.</p>
<p>A substantial part of the current understanding on the subject comes from practitioners working on behalf of municipalities, consultancies and NGOs, not necessarily having the opportunity or the focus to publish in academic peer-reviewed journals. The methodology followed in developing this analytical framework and tools was designed specifically to capture this practitioner expertise, enriching the current academic knowledge. The key steps were as follows.</p>

<title>Analytical framework/typology of interventions to promote integration with SWM</title>
<p>These recommendations for priority interventions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X12454934">Table 1</xref>) and the groupings proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X12454934">Gutberlet (2008)</xref>, are here re-arranged, extended and developed into a proposed typology of interventions, resulting in an analytical framework comprising four complementary aspects or possible categories of interventions. We have described three of these as primary <italic>interfaces</italic> between the informal recyclers and the outside world, namely their interfaces with:</p>
<list id="list2-0734242X12454934" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(A) the formal SWM system from which the informal sector obtains materials for recycling;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(B) the materials and value chain into which those materials are sold and which therefore provides their primary source of income; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(C) society as a whole, including various aspects relating to the acceptance of their activities by society.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The fourth category of possible interventions is different from, and underpins, the others, facilitating the conditions which enable actions under the three interfaces to be successful. To emphasise this point, we have used a different nomenclature for the label here:</p>
<list id="list3-0734242X12454934" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(O) Organisation and empowerment of the informal recyclers.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Within each <italic>category</italic> (A)–(C) and (O), 3–4 groupings of similar types of interventions have been identified and, within each of those groups, a series of individual <italic>intervention points</italic>. Typically, when one is considering how to promote informal sector integration/inclusion in a particular city, there will be a number of possible <italic>specific actions</italic> to achieve each <italic>intervention point</italic>. Inevitably, the four categories partly overlap, because some specific intervention points have key elements that fit into more than one interface or into the enabling category (O). However, for clarity and practical functionality of the analytical framework, each intervention has been allocated only to one category, which we judged to be the most appropriate.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12454934">Figure 1</xref> summarises the overall analytical framework and typology of interventions, and depicts these interdependencies in the form of a Venn diagram. The three interfaces (A)–(C) are shown as three intersecting ‘sets’, each underpinned by the necessary organisation and empowerment of the IRS (O) on which their success depends. The intersections between the sets are important—not only do these highlight those actions which could be assigned to more than one of the interfaces, but the two actions at the centre, which ‘belong’ to all three interfaces, are, arguably, among the most critical to the success of any integration initiative, namely access to the waste and improving the quality of the materials available for recycling through separation at source.</p>

<title>(A) Interface with the SWM system</title>
<p>If the IRS is to function as a component part of a city’s SWM system, then one set of interventions needs to address the interface between the two. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12454934">Table 2</xref> subdivides the possible interventions into four <italic>groups</italic>.</p>
<list id="list4-0734242X12454934" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Access to the waste</italic>. This includes both the legal right to recycle and also the physical role that the informal sector plays in the system, such as providing primary collection services. Example actions (interventions) could include memoranda of association or formal contracts between the municipality or their formal sector contractors and groups representing the informal sector. Access is such a fundamental issue that it sits right in the middle of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12454934">Figure 1</xref>, overlapping with both of the other interfaces (B and C).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Recognising the role of the informal sector.</italic> A key issue is for the authorities to recognise the role and contribution of the informal sector. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0734242X12454934">Medina (2002)</xref> classified current negative attitudes as <italic>repression</italic> (any kind of informal recycling activity is illegal); <italic>neglect</italic> (such activities are ignored); or <italic>collusion</italic> (the informal sector recyclers are tolerated in return for votes or payments). Interventions here are intended to instead provide active support and recognition from the authorities in such a way that this can continue irrespective of the political party in power. Of critical importance here is promoting inclusivity—strengthening and institutionalising the linkages. Possible actions include a ‘solid waste platform’ to give both service users and informal service providers a voice in how the system is planned and managed—examples include Belo Horionte, Brazil; Bengaluru, India; and Quezon City, Philippines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0734242X12454934">Scheinberg et al., 2010a</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Protecting public health and the environment.</italic> The focus here is both to control the public health impacts of informal sector recycling (e.g. by controlling sorting and littering on the street, and the disposal of residual wastes) and to promote public health benefits (e.g. by working with the informal sector to provide primary collection services in otherwise unserviced areas). Occupational H&amp;S of the informal recyclers is allocated under (C).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Strengthening interfaces.</italic> This includes both the physical interfaces, for example to allow informal collectors/recyclers to deliver waste smoothly to the city’s contractor for secondary transport to the disposal site or to allow recyclers at the transfer station or disposal site to have time and space to pick over the waste without interfering with the safe operation of the site, and the national laws and strategies within which the informal sector can work.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0734242X12454934">
<title>(B) Interface with the materials and value chain</title>
<p>Informal recycling relies entirely on selling the materials it can recover for income, for example paper and plastics to local or international recycling markets; glass bottles to local drinks companies for cleaning and refilling; clean, source-separated food waste to local farmers as feed for animals; or composted organic wastes to the agricultural value chain. Value chain analysis is a technique designed to examine the <italic>InteRa</italic>ctions between the actors in the supply chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0734242X12454934">Porter, 1998</xref>) as materials are processed and value added. It has been applied widely to the agricultural sector in developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0734242X12454934">Royal Tropical Institute – KIT et al., 2006</xref>). This tool helps to identify different ways of empowering and strengthening the role of those groups at the ‘bottom’ of the value chain. Currently, applications to the IRS are gaining momentum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12454934">Bagadayeva, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X12454934">Hickman et al., 2009</xref>), including initiatives involving large consumer products companies integrating informal recyclers’ organisations into the value chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0734242X12454934">Peinado-Vara, 2011</xref>). Value chain analysis is used here in categorising possible interventions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12454934">Table 3</xref>). The main <italic>groups of interventions</italic> are as follows.</p>
<list id="list5-0734242X12454934" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Improving the quality of the source material</italic> is another critical action at the centre of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12454934">Figure 1</xref>, alongside <italic>access to the waste</italic> (from interface A). Promoting separation at source so as not to mix wet (organic) and dry wastes, and so avoiding contamination of both organic products and recycled materials, not only increases the quality and value of the products, but also addresses some of the basic ethical—actual and perceived—concerns about the activities of the informal sector as being ‘dirty/unhygienic’. Another specific action here is negotiating contracts between (individual or groups of) recyclers and waste generators.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Adding value to the products sold.</italic> Larger quantities of secondary raw materials generally attract a higher price. A first group of interventions increases the quantity available for sale, for example by equipping collectors with larger and/or wheeled containers, or making space available to store materials prior to sale. A second group focuses on <italic>reprocessing</italic> to add value to the product before selling it on. Even affordable and simple technologies like multiple stages of manual sorting or washing can double the price of a material. For example, the Zabbaleen in Cairo were supported by Oxfam and others in the 1980s to introduce technologies to manufacture both intermediate and final products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12454934">C.I.D. Consulting Group and GIZ, 2008</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Improving linkages along the value chain.</italic> Improving communications can strengthen the whole value chain. Actions can include forums to promote dialogue and negotiating contracts.</p></list-item>

<sec id="section9-0734242X12454934">
<title>(C) Social aspects and the interface with society</title>
<p>Many early efforts to ‘help’ the IRS have been criticised for focusing almost exclusively on ‘fixing the problems’ of child labour, unhygienic working conditions, etc. (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0734242X12454934">Scheinberg, 2012</xref>), rather than seeing the issue in the broader context of poor people struggling to earn a sustainable livelihood. If a city is to build on existing recycling activities and integrate the informal sector as an integral part of its SWM system, then an essential category of interventions are those addressing the social aspects and the interface with wider society. Many of these interventions could equally be viewed as supporting functions for either interface A (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12454934">Table 2</xref>) or B (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12454934">Table 3</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X12454934">Table 4</xref> distinguishes three primary <italic>groups of interventions</italic>, as follows.</p>
<list id="list6-0734242X12454934" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Facilitating recognition and acceptance of the informal sector (by the wider society).</italic> This includes legal recognition by government, essentially bringing what is described here as the ‘informal sector’, defined as such within the context of SWM, firmly within the formal economy. Key interventions include: facilitating registration; the IRS paying their taxes; providing informal sector recyclers and collectors with ‘respectability’, for example through the issuing of uniforms and identity cards and engaging the public in how they can effectively work together.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Work towards child education and gender equality and inclusivity</italic>. Elimination of child labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X12454934">International Labour Office, 2004</xref>) requires both building people’s livelihoods so that a family can afford for their children not to work and making it possible for the children to attend schools. Gender equality is relevant owing to the prominent role of women in related activities, and in livelihood protection and enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12454934">Alter Chen et al., 2004</xref>); it can be tackled, for example, by the provision of loans accessible to women, through their involvement in planning, in training and educational courses.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Occupational H&amp;S.</italic> Manually separating waste is hazardous work. The risks can be alleviated, for example by providing and promoting the use of protective clothing; the availability of accessible health care; and ensuring that hazardous wastes are separated out from other wastes at source. However, prevention is better than cure, hence the emphasis that is placed, both in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12454934">Figure 1</xref> and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12454934">Table 3</xref>, on the separation of wet and dry wastes at source so that the work of the waste-picker becomes much less dirty in the first place. Special provisions should be in place for IRS activities related to the handling of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), where risks are considerably higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12454934">Chi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0734242X12454934">Xu et al., 2012</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0734242X12454934">
<title>(O) Organisation and empowerment</title>
<p>All of the interfaces between the IRS and (A) the formal SWM sector, (B) the value chain and (C) society as a whole are underpinned by a set of enabling interventions related to the organisation and empowerment of the informal sector itself (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0734242X12454934">Table 5</xref>).</p>
<list id="list7-0734242X12454934" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Organisation if IRS (into larger structured groupings).</italic> Some sort of self-organisation is a crucial step to achieve recognition as working partners from the city and also to allow for collective bargaining with others in the value chain from a position of strength; indeed, many have argued that this is an essential first step in any intervention programme (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12454934">Gunsilius et al., 2011</xref>). The type of organisations used varies widely depending on local culture and circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0734242X12454934">Medina, 2000</xref>). Discussion at the IRS Integration Workshop suggested that integration initiatives in Asia tend to focus on entrepreneurship, such as micro–small enterprises (MSEs), while in Central and South America they tend towards cooperatives or similar associations, and community-based organisations (CBOs). The support of NGOs has been found to be important in dealing as a neutral broker between the different actors/stakeholders and in supplementing the governmental resources (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0734242X12454934">Tukahirwa et al., 2010</xref>). National, and even international, networks and forums, such as Women in Informal Employment Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO), Informal Waste Management Thinking Group, Red Lacre, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://informalwastesector.net">informalwastesector.net</ext-link>, are beginning to emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12454934">Fernandez, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0734242X12454934">Peinado-Vara, 2011</xref>), which are important in giving the IRS a collective and unified voice.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Financial viability.</italic> Most informal sector recycling depends for its income entirely on selling into the secondary materials market, in which prices are often volatile. Hence, one group of actions focuses on reducing vulnerability to market fluctuations. Any move to add value and to improve their relative position in the value chain is likely to require both working and investment capital. For example, every itinerant waste buyer purchasing newspapers from householders needs the cash flow to buy his/her materials before selling them on at a profit; therefore micro-credit facilities to allow easy access to capital, and the provision of third-party guarantees for such loans, are important interventions. At the same time, it is relevant to the IRS and to the long-term viability of the intervention to ensure it is not dependent on external subsidies, unless this is a contractual payment from the government for the service provided, as was the case of Diadema, Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X12454934">Diaz and Alves, 2008</xref>). Currently, substantial international actor efforts are emerging in support of the entrepreneurial side of the informal recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0734242X12454934">Peinado-Vara, 2011</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Capacity building.</italic> Many of the other interventions, across all of the interfaces, involve the informal sector in operating as a business. Hence, a key group of interventions is to build capacity in the sector across a whole range of entrepreneurial and business management skills, perhaps also underpinned by basic personal development at adult education level. At the IRS Integration Workshop it was stressed repeatedly that many integration attempts fail owing to the difficulties related to the practical management of the informal sector’s organisation, for example book-keeping, data collection and financial management.</p></list-item>

<title>InteRa: a rapid evaluation and visualisation tool</title>
<p>A novel visual representation of the <italic>intervention typology</italic> for IRS integration is introduced through a radar diagram (<italic><italic>InteRa</italic></italic>). The <italic><italic>InteRa</italic></italic> is a concise and implementable methodological tool to evaluate broadly the relative focus (<italic>importance</italic>) of each integration/formalisation intervention case study, with reference to the four different <italic>categories</italic> [<italic>interfaces</italic> (A)–(C) and enabling aspects (O)] that are important to be considered and a clear to way to display visually and communicate such findings.</p>
<p>To apply the tool, use is made of the listings of possible interventions for each of the four categories (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12454934">Table 2</xref><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12454934"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X12454934"/>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0734242X12454934">5</xref>). Scores are allocated against each of the <italic>specific actions</italic>, according to the level of attention it has received within this particular intervention case. There are three possible assessment outcomes, depending on whether the <italic>specific action</italic> was treated as a key action (<italic>K</italic>), or considered to a medium degree (<italic>C</italic>) or was ignored (<italic>I</italic>) in the implementation of the intervention scheme. Each assessment outcome is translated into numeric values: <italic>K</italic> = 1, <italic>C</italic> = 0.5 and <italic>I</italic> = 0. If no information is available, a zero score is allocated, as if the <italic>specific action</italic> was ignored.</p>
<p>As a next step, an average score is obtained for each <italic>intervention point</italic> (column 3, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12454934">Table 2</xref><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12454934"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X12454934"/>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0734242X12454934">5</xref>), calculated as the arithmetic mean of the values for the <italic>specific actions</italic> relating to this particular <italic>intervention point</italic>. Finally, averaging of the scores of the component <italic>intervention points</italic> within each specific <italic>category</italic> gives the overall score for this <italic>category</italic>. As a result, each <italic>category</italic> is marked with a score from 0.0 to 1.0, which indicates the <italic>importance</italic> of the <italic>category</italic>.</p>
<p>The four average <italic>importance</italic> values obtained, each for one of the (A)–(C) and (O) intervention <italic>categories</italic>, are plotted on a four-side radar diagram on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0. Radar diagrams are an established approach to integrating results of multiple sustainability indicators. This representation allows for a simple display of the focus (or ‘main aim’) and thoroughness of an integration/formalisation initiative. A well-balanced integration intervention that considers all three <italic>interfaces</italic> (A)–(C) and the enabling/underpinning organisation and empowerment <italic>category</italic> (O), would result in a balanced rombe, with all sides equally distant from the centre; a thorough intervention would result in a rombe with sides well away from the centre and vice versa. A worked example providing step-by-step guidance on applying <italic><italic>InteRa</italic></italic> is provided in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0734242X12454934">Appendix A</xref>.</p>
<p>The metrics of <italic><italic>InteRa</italic></italic> has implications for the potential outcome and its interpretation. There are two discrete situations in which <italic><italic>InteRa</italic></italic> can be applied: (i) <italic>a priori</italic> application—the tool applied when a new intervention is planned/designed to provide confidence that a comprehensive and well-balanced approach is followed, and this is the key use intended; and (2) <italic>a posteriori</italic> application—the tool applied to an existing intervention, to evaluate the current baseline situation and identify opportunities for improvement. In the latter application, information may not be available on a particular <italic>specific action</italic>, especially if the case is evaluated solely from usually incomplete literature data or by practitioners not directly involved in the integration intervention and with limited access to the documentation. In this case, because a zero (0) score is allocated for absence of information, generally lower overall values will result in comparison to application during planning where it can be assumed that all information is available. The zero scoring in the absence of data may under-score some interfaces, but equally avoids the pitfall of subjective marking or speculation leading to over-scoring. It may also help to motivate programme managers to publicise the information and those doing the scoring to seek out all relevant information.</p>
<p>Technically, the <italic><italic>InteRa</italic></italic> tool introduces four new sustainability-type indicators [<italic>categories</italic> (A)–(O)]. These types of indicators were chosen to be developed here because they have been found to be generally suitable for communication at the decision- and policy-maker level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12454934">Bell and Morse, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12454934">Dahl, 2012</xref>), and have been applied extensively to environmental problems (e.g. Dewulf and Van Langenhove, 2000). Regarding data intensiveness, 61 attributes are required in total (interface A: 17; B: 15; C: 17; category O: 12); all data inputs are qualitative and could be readily available. Only three scoring levels were selected for a particular <italic>specific action</italic>, because it may be inefficient and difficult to obtain conclusive evidence on finer levels of detail about the <italic>specific actions</italic> of an intervention.</p>

<title>Application in 10 integration/inclusion/formalisation case studies</title>

Notably, the use of the case studies is illustrative. Because the sample is very small and not fully representative (most of the cases are from Asia and Latin America, and none from sub-Saharan Africa; other cases with greater focus on interface B may be available, etc.), results should be taken only as indicative, and not used for drawing general conclusions about the IRS or the likely efficacy of past interventions.</p>

<title>Analytical framework/typology of interventions</title>
<p>A framework—or typology—has been developed for classifying and analysing possible interventions to promote the integration of informal sector recycling within a city’s SWM system. This represents a crystallization and culmination of collective experience around the world over the last 30 years. Here, we attempt to consider all the different approaches applied to integration/formalization/inclusion of the IRS in systematic way, and clarify and combine its various aspects into a comprehensive, composite, and yet succinct, tool (<italic>InteRa</italic>) with direct practical utility.</p>
<p>The typology assigns each possible intervention action to one of four <italic>categories</italic> (A)–(O). It is self-evident that any move to integrate the informal sector with a city’s formal SWM system inevitably needs to address the interface between the two (A). Similarly, the IRS relies on income, either entirely or mainly, from selling the collected and reprocessed secondary raw materials/products into the materials value chain, so that is the second <italic>interface</italic> (B). A major constraint to integration/inclusion is the perceived image of the informal sector, which can be very negative—unhygienic, polluting, untaxed, relying on collusion with corrupt officials for its existence—thus, the third interface is with society as a whole (C). In order to improve its own position and to negotiate across these <italic>interfaces</italic>, some sort of self-organisation by the informal sector is necessary; hence, the fourth category of enabling interventions, focusing on organisation and and empowerment (O), underpins the three <italic>interfaces</italic>, and it could be considered partly as a pre-condition of any successful intervention.</p>
<p>When the typology is outlined in this way it could be expected that, in order to be successful, any project initiative aimed at promoting the integration of the informal sector in a city’s SWM system should combine a selection of individual interventions, chosen both to give a balanced set, with components selected from each of the four ‘categories’, and tailored to be appropriate to the local needs and circumstances.</p>
<p>Notably, two key points of intervention sit right in the middle of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12454934">Figure 1</xref>, where the three <italic>interfaces</italic> (A)–(C) intersect. These are access to the waste (categorized here under <italic>interface</italic> A) and improving quality of materials for recycling by separation at source (under B). Source separation of wastes emerged at the IRS Integration Workshop as the one single intervention most likely to improve quality of products and, thus, revenues. These issues also go to the heart of the ‘old’ way in which the informal sector was often been perceived—‘stealing materials’ from the city waste (linked to access and ownership issues) and being in some way ‘dirty’. If the citizens of a city discard their wastes mixed together, then any manual separation for recycling will, inevitably, be ‘dirty’. If the citizens separate their wastes into wet and dry components, then the work of the IRS will immediately become much ‘cleaner’. Other important actions that appear at intersections of categories are financial sustainability and access to finance, and health and safety of both the public and the informal sector workers.</p>
<p>The fact that two such critical points of intervention could be assigned to any one of the three main interfaces emphasises the slightly arbitrary nature of the allocation and indicates that it is important not to be overly concerned as to just which <italic>category</italic> a particular point of intervention should belong to, as long as they are considered as key points to intervene and counted in one of the <italic>categories</italic>. Indeed, it could be considered as a fundamental strength of the framework that such cross-cutting and significant interventions are highlighted in the central, cross-section area of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12454934">Figure 1</xref>. Another example is the group of interventions on financial sustainability, categorised under the underpinning (O), but potentially also related to interfaces (B) and (A)—enabling access to capital is clearly another key intervention. Potentially, if needed, the tool could be modified by adopting alternative approaches to the metric, for instance by adding emphasis via increased weighting of the scores allocated to such <italic>intervention points</italic> that are central to integration efforts.</p>
<p>The two issues of access and separation at source also link directly to the transition from waste management as a liability (prevention of loss of amenity, protection of public health, preservation of local and global environment, such as contributing to global warming potential), relating to <italic>interface</italic> A, to a largely resource-driven management of resource-rich potential secondary raw materials, relating to <italic>interface</italic> B. Key considerations relate to the legal ownership of waste at the point it arises and the responsibility of handling it appropriately and safely. Legislation can, and should, clarify ownership status, offering solutions on the novel definitions of waste as resource-rich materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0734242X12454934">Pongrácz, 2002</xref>), as has been explored recently for construction waste in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0734242X12454934">Zakar and Clift, 2010</xref>). For situations that involve the integration/inclusion of informal sector recyclers, solutions should be sought to distribute the risks equitably between stakeholders (people as municipal solid waste generators and public health beneficiaries; local authority responsibility for public health—private SWM industry liability while providing services meeting contractual obligations with a local authority) and sharing benefits (with an equitable distribution of the financial benefits of recycling between the informal recyclers, the formal service providers, downstream industries using the secondary raw materials generated and the general public through the local authority).</p>
<p>Recent developments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734242X12454934">Luken, 2011</xref>) suggest that the ability of the IRS to collect waste and reprocess it to a suitable secondary raw material status has attracted the attention of the final industrial users of these materials, and direct communication pathways are currently being built between them. Given that the IRS represents a very small cog in a long supply chain, often dominated by much larger and financially-stronger players, it could be argued that there is a need to re-structure the supply chain towards more equitable distribution of gains, so as to provide sustainable livelihoods for the waste-pickers. For example, systems similar to those which aim to improve the livelihoods of poor farmers in developing countries, who sell their agricultural produce into what is now an international commodity market, could be further explored.</p>
<p>Traditional development approaches to integration of the informal sector at one time tended to focus on ‘helping’ waste-pickers on the grounds that they lack financial and social assets, and ‘alleviating their poverty’ because they are often chronically poor—this being relevant to achieving the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. However, these approaches—focusing primarily on <italic>interface</italic> C—were criticised for objectifying the informal sector because the IRS were not necessarily asked what they want and were not always recognised as a legitimate and important stakeholder group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0734242X12454934">Scheinberg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0734242X12454934">Scheinberg et al., 2006</xref>). The typology developed here reflects an emerging consensus that what is required is a broader systems approach, which analyses the informal sector as undertaking a range of economic activities within both the overall waste management system (<italic>interface</italic> A), to which they make a very substantial financial contribution in terms of avoided direct costs; and the materials value chain (<italic>interface</italic> B), where their activity is the basis of all subsequent added value. Modernisation solutions are sought which develop and strengthen the IRS economic and operational niches, while not compromising necessary standards of waste and resources management.</p>

<title>Applying the rapid evaluation and visualisation tool, <italic>InteRa</italic></title>
<p>The set of case studies (CS1–10, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0734242X12454934">Table 6</xref>) covers examples from three distinct continents and includes extremely different types of interventions. For example, CS5, considering the intervention performed by the government in order to close the Payatas Landfill, is sensibly dissimilar to CS3 where the Zabbaleen work in MSEs and have considerable expertise in reprocessing materials and manufacturing products, or to CS2 from Belo Horizonte which constitutes a more socially-based initiative in collaboration with the municipality. However, the general limitations noted in the <italic>Results</italic> section apply, for example all of C8–C10 cover similar interventions in small Argentinean cities, which may be atypical of IRS integration efforts elsewhere.</p>
<p>While local solutions may require focus to be placed in one direction more than others, it could be argued that paying balanced attention to all four <italic>categories</italic> could enhance the possibilities for a successful intervention. Only one of the intervention cases (CS1: Linis Ganda) has a distinctively ‘better’ profile than the others considering both balance [(A)–(O) at a similar level] and comprehensiveness [each of (A)–(O) comparatively high at 0.4–0.5]. In most cases, initiatives are clearly focused towards one or, at best, two interfaces. For example, in Belo Horizonte (CS2) emphasis was placed on organisational aspects (O), while in Cairo (CS3) it was primarily on materials and the value chain (B). Balanced cases (similar importance level from A to O), such as the Linis Ganda (CS1), are unusual within the dataset considered.</p>
<p>The normality of the distributions of only 10 cases and the variability of the results indicates that the <italic>InteRa</italic> seems capable of capturing the focus of integration interventions; the indication of lack of normality for the SWM interface (A) should be further explored with a higher number of cases.</p>
<p>In a hypothetical, ideally comprehensive integration intervention, all the <italic>specific actions</italic> marked in <italic>InteRa</italic> could have been considered and acted upon. However, given that the selection of an appropriate set of actions must be based on the local circumstances and that an <italic>importance</italic> of 1 would indicate that all the potential actions had been ‘key’, an overall score much lower than 1 can be anticipated. The fact that <italic>InteRa</italic> is demonstrated here not with planned interventions but with existing cases for which data is missing, and hence penalised with zero score allocations (e.g. typical case CS10), makes the resulting <italic>importance</italic> scores seem reasonable. Specifically, the existing case studies set (CS1–10, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0734242X12454934">Table 6</xref>) results suggest that an <italic>importance</italic> of 0.2 for a particular <italic>interface</italic> is a readily implementable level of attention and that an <italic>importance</italic> of 0.3–0.5 could denote that considerable attention is paid to the interface for existing cases—similarly, for importance of 0.4–0.6 for planned interventions, where all information is by default available, all zeros arise from absence of planning a certain <italic>specific action</italic>. However, more cases will provide a better understanding of what are the practically achievable levels for each <italic>category.</italic></p>
<p>These preliminary results suggest that there is wide scope for improvement when planning and implementing interventions aimed at the integration of the IRS into SWM. Improvements are feasible toward designing more balanced initiatives, where applicable—namely, placing similar emphasis on all 4 <italic>categories</italic> (A)–(O). While it could be assumed that balanced interventions could be more viable overall, arguably interventions of specific focus could also be beneficial in certain local circumstances. The consistently relatively low <italic>importance</italic> of SWM (A) in the sample set of case studies is in line with the impression prevailing amongst SWM practitioners that, in many cases, this critical element has not been successfully addressed so far and remains a source of unresolved tension between key stakeholders. Systematic efforts are needed in this direction.</p>
<p>The indicator for the enabling O <italic>category</italic> is defined in a slightly less robust way than the (A)–(C), because it has fewer <italic>intervention points</italic> [12 vs 15–17 for (A)–(C)] and some of these contain only one <italic>specific action</italic>, i.e. there is no averaging, which makes <italic>category</italic> O more sensitive to data accuracy. Despite that, O shows the most normally distributed results in comparison with the three interfaces, suggesting a good function as an indicator. The high variability of the O <italic>category</italic> results from the relatively high scores being non consistent across all the case studies, but it still indicates that such enabling actions relating to organisation and empowerment receive considerable attention. This seems to provide evidential support that <italic>category</italic> O serves as a pre-condition for implementing interventions; hence, it receives considerable attention most of the time.</p>
<p>A general trend appearing to emerge from examining the individual <italic>intervention points</italic> is that attention of reported integration interventions concentrates on high and general level challenges, such as the ‘Socio-political context towards informal sector’, ‘Access to funding’, ‘Organisation of waste pickers’ and ‘NGO participation’; but the down-to-earth practicalities or hard-to-address topics, such as ‘Protecting public health &amp; environment’, ‘Improving formal/informal interface’, ‘Data collection and documentation’, ‘Facilitating child education’, ‘Ensuring occupational health and safety standards’, and ‘Promoting gender equality/inclusivity’ remain far more difficult to address or are not selected to be communicated when information is put in the public domain. While the high level integration aspects are significant enabling systemic factors, the major challenges lie in identifying and implementing workable solutions for the more practical aspects.</p>
<p>The <italic><italic>InteRa</italic></italic> methodology/radar diagram visualisation tool allows a quick overview of the focus of IRS integration interventions and enables comparisons between different cases. However, the tool does not claim to be able to measure the sustainability or to predict the long-term viability of a planned intervention. For example, the case of Londrina (CS6), appears to have considered all the different categories (although it does score relatively low in all them) and to be a relatively ‘balanced’ intervention, while it is known that the initiative declined after a drop in the prices of the recyclables and other institutional and SWM problems encountered. Notwithstanding this caution, the <italic>InteRa</italic> methodology forms an advanced starting point to build comprehensive and balanced interventions from, and it considers all key aspects of triple bottom line approach to sustainable development (environmental, social, financial capitals), encouraging a balanced approach between the different framework aspects. This could be further amplified by additional research, focusing on collecting tangible and possible quantitative evidence, identifying a few critical measurable factors that could indicate good chances of designing a resilient and sustainable intervention.</p>

<title>Key reflections</title>
<p>This work has used a systems approach to develop a framework and a visualisation tool to be used when designing a set of interventions to promote integration/inclusion of the IRS within in a particular city’s solid waste and resources management system. The framework proposed is based on a typology for classifying and analysing the possible interventions, and represents a formalisation and culmination of collective experience around the world over the last 30 years.</p>
<p>The framework suggests that when designing an intervention, consideration should be given to implications on three key interfaces. While there are no easy or off-the-shelf answers on how to approach integration interventions, any win–win solution needs to understand and act upon opportunities and challenges relating all three <italic>interfaces</italic>, i.e. the contribution informal recyclers make to the SWM system-(<italic>interface</italic> A) and the recycling/materials chain (<italic>interface</italic> B), along with the social situation (<italic>interface</italic> C), collecting and building upon baseline data. It can be argued that a necessary pre-condition to enable change is organisation and empowerment of the informal recyclers—the city and other stakeholders need reliable partner organisations to work with, and organisation brings bargaining power and enables individual ‘producers’ to get a better deal in the value chain. Hence, any intervention should also be addressing this underpinning and enabling this fourth category (O). The <italic>InteRa</italic> radar diagram is a comprehensive tool to guide the planning of such an intervention process and rapidly catch its focus, providing both a structured approach and a rapid visualisation aid.</p>
<p>A key suggestion is that a balanced intervention needs to bring together specific actions chosen from across all these four <italic>categories</italic>. The selection of interventions will depend on the local needs and circumstances. Vital interventions are likely to include those at the overlap between the interfaces, including both access to the waste and separation at source; financial sustainability and access to finance; and H&amp;S of both the public and the informal sector workers.</p>
<p>Application of the framework and <italic>InteRa</italic> tool to a wider set of case studies on IRS integration interventions is necessary to test and further validate its functionality, and prove its practical utility in designing balanced and comprehensive interventions. The testing here has, necessarily, had to focus on <italic>a posteriori</italic> application to previous interventions, while the main application proposed is for the <italic>a priori</italic> design of new interventions. Such a wider application could also provide greater insights about the current level of attention placed on the different aspects of integration interventions around the world.</p>
