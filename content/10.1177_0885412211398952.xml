<p>For Howard Gillette, civitas means “the community of citizens,” and by extension, the civic life of a community. He considers issues of social justice and the possibility of uplifting the life of individuals through the nature of urban and architectural design. The book is a history of planning in the twentieth century viewed as an evolving response to intense issues of poverty, slum housing, lack of education, and lack of opportunity. Could environmental intervention be a corrective tool for settlement and social issues in cities?</p>
<p>The book covers the Progressive Era, the Garden City era, and the concept of Neighborhood Planning, resulting in some of the well-known early developments such as Radburn and Sunnyside Gardens. It then folds in a section on <italic>The City</italic>, a documentary made for the 1939 New York World’s Fair, that issues, full faith, the proposition that “proper environments can shape better communities.” This film was influenced heavily by Louis Mumford and represented the beliefs of the Regional Planning Association of America yet, it seems as though an inordinate amount of time is spent in looking at the uneven and contentious film making process rather than the stated intentions of the book. The film does show early concern for the overdominance of the car and its effect on planning, even in this pre–World War II time. Of course, at the World’s Fair, this message was heavily countered by the General Motors exhibits showing a glowing future based on the automobile.</p>
<p>Though some of Gillette’s writing is burdened with multisyllabic words and compound, complex sentences occasionally requiring diagramming, he does bring in some essays that are well-edited and quite good. His chapter on the <italic>Planned Shopping Center in Suburb and City</italic> is a good consideration of the shopping center as a deliberate community building effort. He falls short of considering the growth of consumerism, the abandonment of the traditional town and city centers or the implications of private ownership of areas substituting for public spaces for civic interaction while controlling public access and expression. In other words, he stops short of considering <italic>civitas</italic> with the impact of Walmart and sprawl, as well as the ultimate isolation of resulting autodependency, even the eventual problem of consumer debt or wealth as a requirement for full citizen participation.</p>
<p>He does discuss the reintroduction of suburban shopping center forms into downtowns, once they have been sufficiently damaged by suburban exodus. He looks at the issues around festival marketplaces developed by James Rouse. An interesting biographical section on Rouse considers both his accomplishments and his motivations as developer and his ongoing commitment to rebuild and revitalize inner cities. Rouse’s determination to be an uplifter, to provide affordable housing, and opportunities for the poor was based on a lifelong religious commitment.</p>
<p>Though Gillette does not consider the private ownership of large sections of downtowns by single corporate or individual entities, a consideration that would have logically grown out of the shopping center as precursor of downtown redevelopment, he does consider the rise of new towns such as Columbia, Maryland, where such private ownership of community areas would have been apparent. The appropriation of the public realm by private developers has become a quiet movement whose implications remain little discussed. The downtown of Newburyport, Massachusetts, of Nantucket, Massachusetts, and a large portion of Harvard Square, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, are wholly owned by either one man or a single corporate entity. While public streets are still maintained, all the ownership, leasing, and operations of the retail and commercial buildings are tightly controlled. This seems to turn the issue of <italic>civitas</italic> squarely on its head, yielding the privately controlled city—<italic>civitas</italic> embodied as marketing strategy.</p>
<p>The book considers the Congress for the New Urbanism as a movement that sought to develop new principles of design to overcome the social and physical problems of the built environment. It looks briefly at a number of New Urbanist projects and the intentions, failures, and successes Gillette finds. He looks at the problem of maintaining affordability in developments that are highly appealing and successful real estate products, and the approach of designing in concert with community input.</p>
<p>Gillette does consider the essential issue in creating community—whether relationships can progress in a community that is economically heterogeneous or whether it is more likely to occur in homogeneous groupings. New Urbanism pursues the concept of equal citizenship of all classes and income levels in community building. Besides the historical underpinnings of New Urbanism, this chapter examines the New Urbanist response to the Katrina crisis as an example of how to restore community, quite literally. The large-scale planning efforts on the gulf coast and how these concepts collided with opposing efforts, local mindsets, and rebuilding costs is well-described.</p>
<p>Public housing and low-income issues (Pruitt-Igoe, Cabrini Green), its frequent failures, as well as the more successful Hope VI program are compared. The issue of isolation versus upliftment in designed mixed income communities and this is a successful strategy is examined. Occasionally, Gillette will open a dialogue about “fortresses of individualism” versus opportunities for sociability that I wish had been more fleshed out, as this may be another direction in the <italic>civitas</italic> debate. I wanted to more of his thinking on this. We are finally left with the inevitable question: can poverty be mitigated by environmental structure or is the psychological effect of being denied membership in the predominant culture likely to yield to design alone?</p>
<p>What is also only briefly suggested is the current economic situation and the impact on many levels of income needing affordable housing, the lack of affordable workforce housing for redeveloping local economies, and the need to consider all housing equity through the lens of the climate change and energy efficiency. As Gillette suggests “no single path beckons irresistibly at the outset of the twenty-first century,” but that a further resolution of issues of health, economic and cultural revitalization, transportation, limitation of sprawl, between academic criticism and public policy is the way forward.</p>
