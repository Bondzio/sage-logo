<p>Nothing is more devastating to a performing artist than not having the chance to be on stage and, as the pervasiveness of performance anxiety attests, nothing is more threatening than having that chance. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0305735613480918">Plaut, 1990</xref>, p. 59)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although much research has focused on music performance anxiety (MPA) over the last four decades, MPA is still clouded in mystery for many musicians. The causes of MPA, and the relationships between physiological and psychological mechanisms that underpin it, are not yet fully understood. Moreover, few replications of research studies exist, and successful and lasting treatments of MPA still require verification. As a result, the illusive international performing career seems available only to those who are free from worry – that is, musicians whose palms never sweat and knees do not shake, who have no fear of evaluation and criticism, and whose thinking is indelibly positive and confidence is unwavering.</p>
<p>As is clear from Dianna Kenny’s ambitious new volume, <italic>The Psychology of Music Performance Anxiety</italic>, such performers rarely exist. Stories of such eminent musicians as Enrico Caruso, Maria Callas, Vladimir Horowitz and Arthur Rubenstein reveal that MPA is both a pervasive and pernicious problem, even for those among the performing elite. And, without readily available treatments and broader support networks, many musicians turn to self-administered “cures” that can lead to even more problems, including alcohol and drug abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0305735613480918">Dobson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0305735613480918">West, 2004</xref>). In these cases, musicians risk addiction and other deleterious side-effects, as well as jeopardize their potential to produce exciting and successful performances.</p>
<p>In her book, Kenny illuminates MPA in practically all of its guises, and critically examines MPA’s causes, symptoms and treatments, as well as their meaning and implications for practising musicians.</p>
<p>By first laying out psychological, physiological and philosophical frameworks embedded in a short historic overview (Chapter 2), Kenny creates an understanding of the development of general and specific theories of MPA. She discusses nomothetic and idiographic approaches, Descartes’ and Freud’s theories of body and mind, Darwin’s and Canton’s assumption of survival, and the importance of biology and the environment. She also explains how anxiety can become problematic, or in the worst case, pathological.</p>
<p>She then refers to the classifications, defining features, commonalities and differences of anxiety disorders (Chapter 3), using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) to discuss “whether people suffer from a unique condition known as performance anxiety or whether their performance anxiety is a manifestation of another underlying anxiety disorder or other psychopathology” (p. 34).</p>
<p>After setting out the groundwork, she is able to tackle the thorny issue of defining MPA (Chapter 4). Kenny points out that, while many researchers have sought to provide new insights into phenomena related to MPA, they have typically lacked a coherent and consistent definition of the underlying concept, “the first and essential step in its analysis and eventual understanding” (p. 47). For a concise definition, we can turn to one of Kenny’s earlier publications:
<disp-quote>
<p>Music Performance Anxiety (MPA) is the experience of marked and persistent anxious apprehension related to musical performance that has arisen through specific anxiety-conditioning experiences. It is manifested through combinations of affective, cognitive, somatic and behavioural symptoms and may occur in a range of performance settings, but is usually more severe in settings involving high ego investment and evaluative threat. It may be focal (i.e. focused only on music performance) or occur comorbidly with other anxiety disorders, in particular social phobia. It affects musicians across their lifespan and is at least partially independent of years of training, practice and level of musical accomplishment. It may or may not impair the quality of the musical performance. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0305735613480918">Kenny, 2009</xref>, p. 433)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Kenny has arrived at this definition by unravelling overlapping theoretical approaches. The above is predicated upon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0305735613480918">Barlow’s (2000)</xref> emotion-based theory, a triple set of susceptibilities which is responsible for developing anxiety/mood disorders, emphazising genetic contributions, and general and specific (early-) life experiences (e.g., not achieving secure attachments in early childhood) as sufficient conditions to produce MPA.</p>
<p>These conceptualizations are used to describe the epidemiology and measurability of MPA (Chapter 5) and function as a precursor for Kenny’s own model (Chapter 6). She outlines the advantages and disadvantages of test batteries, introducing her Music Performance Anxiety Inventory. This particular questionnaire stems from Barlow’s theory, including among other factors uncontrollability, self- and third-party evaluation, physiological arousal and memory bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0305735613480918">Kenny &amp; Osborne, 2006</xref>). It has been adapted across a wide range of age groups, offering a “careful assessment of each musician’s anxiety profile . . . so that targeted treatment for each of the concerns can be addressed in therapy” (p. 107). Furthermore, she refers readers to empirical work in which her questionnaire has been shown to achieve sufficient reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0305735613480918">Kenny, Davis, &amp; Oates, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0305735613480918">Osborne &amp; Kenny, 2005</xref>). Kenny’s model of MPA focuses on how it develops, as well as how anxiety-related problems persist and desist, comprehensively synthesizing extant social context, behavioural, cognitive and emotion-based learning processes.</p>
<p>After surveying theoretical perspectives that explain the causes of MPA, Kenny turns her attention to common forms of therapy (Chapter 7). Here, she not only lists cognitive/behavioural, psychoanalytic, emotion/performance-based and multimodal approaches, but also scrutinizes non-Western and other alternative methods including mindfulness-based stress reduction, yoga, music therapy, biofeedback and the Alexander technique, as well the effect of self-administered substances such as alcohol, caffeine and cannabis. In doing so, she concludes that, while a variety of possible treatments have become available over the past 30 years, “empirical validation is [still] required before treatments can be recommended” (p. 231).</p>
<p>In Chapters 8, 9 and 10, Kenny illustrates severe manifestations of MPA and draws together the theoretical and clinical perspectives reviewed earlier in the book through a series of vivid personal accounts of musicians’ MPA experiences, punctuated by preventive and pedagogical advice. She gives the reader a sense of what it is like to suffer from MPA, the implications it has on one’s life, the personal histories that are predictive of certain outcomes and how different individuals are able to address their fears. This interweaving of scientific research and personal narratives is what makes Kenny’s book so compelling, and it gives musicians who suffer from MPA, as well as scientists, educators and interested others, the possibility of shared insight.</p>
<p>Finally, <italic>The Psychology of Music Performance Anxiety</italic> highlights lingering questions and problems that should be addressed in future research. This includes the lack of studies into long-term treatment and the prevalence of often short-term or symptom-focused therapies, which in her words show “statistical differences before and after treatment, but . . . might not be clinically significant” (p. 167). Kenny also points to the need for more replication of research findings. She acknowledges that there are individual responses to different therapies, but also exposes the problems of ecological validity and highlights the recent progress of psychodynamically-oriented therapies. As a consequence, she not only focuses on adults and their performance anxiety-related symptoms but takes care to emphasize that age-specific and exposure-related MPA, particularly in childhood, must be investigated further.</p>
<p>The book could have perhaps given more attention to performance physiology and its overall relationship with performance psychology. While physiological responses to anxiety, such as cardiovascular, conductivity and cortisol changes throughout one’s performance, have been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0305735613480918">Fredrikson &amp; Gunnarson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0305735613480918">Iñesta, Terrados, García, &amp; Pérez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0305735613480918">Yoshi, Kudo, &amp; Ohtsuki, 2008</xref>), more could have been written about the wide range of possible somatic symptoms and their relation to cognitive, emotional and behavioural responses to MPA. Although the book’s focus is explicitly on the <italic>psychology</italic> of MPA (and indeed, psychological and physiological responses do not always correlate), an analysis of physiological aspects could have helped to elucidate more of the various MPA phenomena.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Kenny’s book is essential reading for anyone who wishes to understand MPA. It is useful for performers and teachers who want to explore the relationship between performance anxiety and performance quality, scientists who are interested in those aspects of the field which require further study, and therapists who seek to supplement their knowledge of treatment methods.</p>
