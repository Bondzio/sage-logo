<p>This is a somewhat eclectic collection of essays. In his foreword, Kevin Moloney suggests that: ‘A particular strength of the collection is its methodological pluralism’ (Vol.1, p. x). One of the problems with British political science is that sometimes there is a little too much methodological pluralism. The editor states that the volumes are ‘a deliberately ambitious project’ (Vol. 1, p. xiii), but they might have been more useful if there had been more standardization in the approach that authors were required to adopt, at least in terms of some themes which could be tackled as appropriate in particular chapters. Although there are undoubtedly some strong contributions in these volumes by highly respected authors, alongside some younger scholars who are beginning to make an impact, the overall quality level is rather uneven. One doesn’t get the sense that the publishers exerted a great deal of editorial control. The layout is not particularly attractive and is not helped by the slightly off-colour paper. If it is recycled paper, it would have been worth pointing this out.</p>
<p>It may be, as the editor claims, that what is offered (along with a third volume covering other parts of the world and not reviewed here) is ‘the most wide-ranging set of scholarly studies of organized interest behaviour to date’ (Vol. 1, p. xiii). However, there is a trade-off between range and focus. The selection criteria for the chapters are also unclear. The inclusion of five chapters on countries in Eastern Europe is to be applauded, but why include two of the Baltic states and exclude both Hungary and Poland? Getting authors to write particular chapters is always a challenge, especially in a project of this scope, but perhaps the search was insufficiently insensitive and extensive.</p>
<p>Probably the book’s claim to originality and a distinctive slant lies in its coverage of what is sometimes called the ‘public affairs’ end of lobbying and the regulatory issues that arise as a result. Here one is in ‘lobbyists for hire’ territory, rather than the more conventional and arguably over-written activities of trade associations and professional organizations. In the opening chapter of the American volume, Burdit Loomis and Micheal Struemph look at large lobbying firms in Washington, D.C. and the extent to which their activities are being internationalized. The development of international public affairs management is also dealt with in a later chapter by Phil Harris. Kati Tusinski Berg examines codes of ethics in lobbying. There are also chapters on lobbying reform in the US and the EU and the politics of regulating lobbyists. A rather distinctive chapter by Anthony Nownes and Marcus Osborn looks at how state governors generate legislative and public support for their agendas.</p>
<p>Jordan and Maloney’s work on the ‘supply side’ of groups has a deservedly high reputation and in their chapter they seek to ‘consolidate’ this body of work. This is a useful exercise, but the territory covered is familiar. Iain McMenamin examines the unjustifiably relatively neglected topic of the relationship between parties and business and sets out four logics of business contributions to parties. Perhaps the most original chapter is that by Irina Michaolwitz, in which she looks at how much institutions matter. She argues that the interdependencies between the European institutions lead to an un-balanced exchange relationship between private and public actors in the EU, whereas in the US ‘two apparently equal powerful systems – politics and lobbying – are competing and both have negotiation assets with which they become true exchange partners’ (Vol. 2, p. 261). I am not sure that I am convinced by this argument, or that if I was I would think the implications of the US model were good for democracy, but at least it is thought-provoking.</p>
<p>The regulation theme is continued in the volume on Europe, with a very useful survey on the regulation of lobbying in the UK by the book’s editor. There are two overview chapters on the EU, but most chapters are country studies ranging from The Netherlands to Croatia. The most interesting one is a sophisticated comparison of French and German trade associations by Christine Quittkat. She subjects questionnaires sent to trade associations which achieved a respectable rate of return to statistical analysis, focusing on the Europeanization of the associations. She finds that German associations simply had to transfer national routines to the new European political space. ‘French trade associations, in contrast, are confronted with difficulties of adaptation with regard to those points in which the European and French logic of influence differ most’ (Vol. 1, p. 154).</p>
<p>The book would have been strengthened had more attention been given to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that cover issues such as the environment, the Global South and human rights. This is where some of the most politically significant developments in relation to interest groups are taking place. The American volume does include a chapter on human rights NGOs at the United Nations, while the European volume contains a data-based analysis by Lori Poloni-Staudlinger on the activity choices of environmental groups in the UK, France and Germany. While the results are not particularly surprising, suggesting that the presence of allies in government affects activity patterns, a more extended analysis than that offered by this rather brief chapter would have been welcome.</p>
<p>Another topic that is missing is any systematic overview of how state organization affects interest group activity. In particular it might have been worth looking at the increasingly sophisticated techniques of stakeholder management being used by some governments.</p>
<p>Kevin Moloney claims in his foreword that: ‘This collection offers an ideal “one-stop” source for teachers wanting to assign class readings about lobbying in nations which do not tend to feature in the academic literature’ (Vol. 1, p.xi). Of course, it is possible that there is limited interest in lobbying in Estonia and Lithuania, and that is why they have not featured much in the literature, even if case studies can be used as building-blocks for broader generalizations. There are undoubtedly chapters in these volumes that could usefully be assigned to students, but at effectively £80 a volume it’s not the cheapest or even necessarily the best way of achieving that goal.</p>
