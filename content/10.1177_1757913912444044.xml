<title>The problem</title>
<p>Childhood abuse is perhaps one of the most controversial and ‘taboo’ subjects in society today. This alone is quite confusing, as, apart from abusers, the majority of society condemns such acts. There is no worse crime; no crime that leaves a longer legacy and no crime that has such a huge ripple effect on society. So why do we simply not want to know?</p>
<p>Perhaps, because we will have to admit that, as adults, we continually fail children? Because we will have to face the fact that people we know and love are capable of such evil crimes? That if we truly face the scale of the problem, we may have to ask, ‘will we ever have trust in people or society again?’ Is there hope of eradicating this nasty crime? Giving survivors the opportunity to speak out will go some way to doing that. The guilt for families of survivors is often so bad that the families themselves don’t want to talk about it, are unable to support the survivor, sometimes blaming the family member who was the victim. This often makes them feel alone, as they would have felt when they were being abused and reinforcing the false belief that somehow it was their fault. Supporting a survivor is very challenging and, for families, can often be intertwined with feelings of guilt and blame. All these negative feelings belong with the abuser, but for families and survivors, letting go of them often takes many years, if ever achieved.</p>
<p>Abusers are adept at passing the responsibility for their crime to their victims and their families. We must not forget to provide support to the families of victims so that they can be part of the healing process.</p>
<p>NAPAC is often contacted by many family members or those caring for survivors and very often they just don’t know what to say or do. All society needs to be educated and stay informed about the devastating and life-long consequences of abuse. As you can see below, the consequences affect us all, and to people who say “I’ve never met an abuse survivor” we say “yes you have, you just didn’t know it”.</p>

<title>How it affects us all</title>
<p>Most of society’s problems have their roots in childhood abuse, for example: eating disorders; obesity; homelessness; depression; criminality (over 70% of people in prison are survivors of childhood abuse); self mutilation; alcoholism and drug addiction; and suicide, to name but a few. It is a proven fact that we could reduce crime, improve healthcare and improve education by simply reducing childhood abuse.</p>
<p>What about the survivors that do grow up and finally, well into their adulthood, decide they need to get help and face the past? Pastoral care for survivors and their families is patchy to say the least. Few would argue that six counselling sessions courtesy of the NHS is not going to even scratch the surface. Worse still, scratching the surface can be even more damaging to the individual if on-going support is not available. Opening that can of worms can have devastating consequences if proper support is not there for the individual. Support groups run by untrained people, assessments by a variety of psychiatrists, each offering different agendas and advice, (as many survivors have to go through to provide evidence for their criminal case) can be extremely damaging. Survivors must ‘heal at their own pace’. Pushing expectations above capability can be very dangerous for long term health, and often evoke a sense of failure. It is essential to remember that as adults, the scale of damage varies from person to person, but it is often enduring and lifelong.</p>
<p>There are five types of childhood abuse: neglect, sexual, physical, emotional and ritual. Some people fail to recognise the latter but we know from listening to many victims that it exists. Some cultures excuse abuse as they say it is part of their belief system – child witchcraft, genital mutilation, child marriages and abuse carried out in groups, perhaps with religious artefacts. Many of these categories overlap; it goes without saying that emotional abuse is suffered by all victims of any of the other four categories. However, emotional abuse standing alone is all too common, where children are constantly told negative things and deprived of a stable emotional relationship. What we must remember is that all abuse is harmful. It is an unwanted invasion of a child’s space, body and spirit. It is an alteration of a developing personality and a destabilising, shattering of an innocent childhood.</p>
<p>At NAPAC, we don’t like to categorise abuse. To do so is bad news for the victim and for society as a whole. No one but the victim can say how it has affected him or her. Every month hundreds of people tell us about the devastation it has caused them. We never say “we know how you feel” or even pretend to. Even though most of us at NAPAC are survivors ourselves, abuse is so personal, we can understand but we cannot know how the survivor feels. But just offering this understanding is helpful for survivors, and a unique service not provided anywhere else.</p>

<title>What now?</title>
<p>NAPAC is the only UK national charity that supports adult survivors of all forms of childhood abuse. Founded in 1997, NAPAC runs Britain’s only ‘Helplines Association’ accredited free phone support line for adult survivors. In 1997 the founder of NAPAC discovered that the only place survivors had to turn to was ChildLine. And of course, ChildLine is for children. Now part of NSPCC, ChildLine needed somewhere to refer adult survivors and thus was instrumental in helping to get NAPAC started. The NAPAC Support Line is staffed entirely by volunteers some of whom are survivors themselves. Unlike many charities, we get no government funding although we have been fortunate to have obtained a successful grant from the Big Lottery Fund. This lack of government funding is despite the fact that setting up NAPAC was a key recommendation of the National Commission of Inquiry into the Prevention of Child Abuse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913912444044">1</xref></sup> Research shows that the average time it takes a survivor to disclose the abuse they suffered is 22 years after it ended. Callers to our Support Line appear to confirm this as many are well into their 40’s, 50’s and 60’s and have never before spoken of the abuse. So NAPAC is clearly not a service that should be marginalised. It is an essential life-saver.</p>
<p>Much of the feedback we receive confirms this. We are also increasingly hearing from younger survivors who are thankfully getting help earlier. Early intervention and support is vital if these young people are to grow and lead fulfilled lives. A vitally important recommendation of the National Commission stated that giving adult survivors a voice was essential to child protection. We reply to every letter or e-mail, we offer accredited training in how to work with survivors and resources permitting, are currently rolling this programme out across social services, GP’s, prisons and other institutions where abuse is sadly still rife. We send out information packs to survivors and for those looking for one to one or group support we explore all the possibilities.</p>
<p>As a charity NAPAC is certainly unique. No other organization does what we do. But supporting adult survivors is not a ‘cosy cause’. It stands to reason that if society has difficulties in addressing the issue of child abuse then helping those children when they have grown up will be even more problematic. And of course, because abuse knows absolutely no socioeconomic, ethnic or cultural boundaries it stands to reason that there are many highly intelligent, influential and powerful abusers in society and they do not want their crimes spoken of. They do not want NAPAC to exist. But we do because we have to. And we are growing every day. The only way to help the millions of adult survivors of abuse and to protect our children today is to stay informed and start talking about a subject we would all like to ignore; it is a moral duty that every person in society must share.</p>
