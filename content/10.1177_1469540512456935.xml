<sec id="sec1-1469540512456935"><title>Kate Haulman, <italic>The Politics of Fashion in Eighteenth Century America</italic> Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2011. 304 pp. $39.95. ISBN 9 780 807 834 879</title>
<p>For anyone wishing to understand the historical underpinnings of American fashion, Kate Haulman’s <italic>The Politics of Fashion in Eighteenth Century America</italic> is an excellent place to begin. Exploring men’s and women’s clothing and hair styles in 18th-century Boston, New York City, Philadelphia and Charleston, this elegantly written monograph demonstrates that fashion was central to Anglo-American debates about gender, class, sexuality, imperialism, republicanism and revolution.</p>
<p><italic>The Politics of Fashion</italic> unfolds chronologically, with each of its seven chapters devoted to a different era in American fashion’s long 18th century. Readers learn that hoop skirts characterized women’s dress in the early part of the century, that elaborate hairstyles came to the fore in the latter half, and that Polish and Grecian dresses became stylish near the end. We also learn that men’s fashions underwent a dramatic shift during this period, with the earlier years characterized by sumptuous and patterned coats, the middle by powdered periwigs and small hats, and the latter by dark and subdued outer clothing and white waistcoats.</p>
<p>As fascinating as are the book’s detailed – and, in many cases, illustrated – discussions of fashion’s material history, the most important contributions made in <italic>The Politics of Fashion</italic> are Haulman’s analyses of fashion’s social and political significances. Drawing on newspapers, diaries, letters, business records, advertisements, political tracts, dramatical scripts and fiction, <italic>The Politics of Fashion</italic> offers insight into not only how New Yorkers, Bostonians, Philadelphians, and Charlestonians dressed and styled themselves during this period, but also into how commentators perceived and attempted to change the ways that Americans adorned their bodies.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of the difficulty of finding historical sources on marginalized people’s dress, most of Haulman’s book focuses on elite and middling people’s bodily adornments. In Chapter 1, though, the author does explore how some workers and slaves adorned themselves. So as to help identify escaped slaves and servants, notices about runaways often contained descriptions of their clothing. From these notices, Haulman determines that many escapees ‘combin[ed] pilfered attire with items of their own’, creating new and distinct styles (p. 28). Haulman also shows that despite many elite and middling people’s belief that working people did not deserve attractive or fashionable clothing, many market women created modish and unique clothing from inexpensive fabrics, thus asserting their own style and dignity.</p>
<p>A main theme in <italic>The Politics of Fashion</italic> is the transition of affluent men’s dress from extravagant to subdued. At the beginning of the 18th century, wealthy men tended to wear sumptuous, patterned fabrics; this attire symbolized their economic and political prowess. By the end of the 18th century, however, elite and middling men alike dressed in dark and solid colours and simple lines. Haulman rightly situates this rise of understatement within the context of anti-imperialism and republicanism. Angered by British taxes on non-British imports, as well as frustrated with colonialism, commentators began calling for American men to adopt non-European styles. Bolstering such arguments were growing religious linkages among femininity, frivolity and fashion. Not only were fashionable men slaves to European modes, so were they vain and effeminate. True American men, in this formulation, cared little for ostentation; as Haulman writes, ‘antifashion’ became fashion (p. 225). By the time George Washington came to power, all men aspiring to economic and political influence knew they had to dress simply and without affectation.</p>
<p>Within this push for sartorial simplicity, women’s status fared differently. As Haulman shows, elite women throughout this period continued to wear luxurious fabrics and elaborate styles. Their expertise in fashion afforded them some social power, in the sense that elite men knew that women’s judgement of men’s attire could both enhance and degrade their romantic and political chances. At the same time, though, the ever-present and constantly increasing connections being made among fashion, vanity and frippery meant that fashionable women were forever being deemed as insignificant, irrational and greedy. By the middle of the century, they were also being called out as unpatriotic, even treasonous. Just as true American men rejected European styles, so were true American women supposed to wear humble and homespun clothes. Yet not only were they supposed to don such items, so were they supposed to make them. In the growing anti-imperialist atmosphere, it became a virtue for affluent women to stay home and spin, thus proving their American authenticity and femininity.</p>
<p><italic>The Politics of Fashion</italic> has much to say about the importance of clothing and style within American gender and political dynamics, demonstrating conclusively that what people wore in New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Charleston during the 1700s had ramifications far beyond their own individual choices, resources and desires. Possibly, the book would be further strengthened by offering more comparisons between what was happening in these cities with that occurring in other contexts. In both England and New France during this period, anglophone men tended to use linkages between fashion and femininity to discredit aristocratic men’s claims to power. As well, Christian critiques of fashion both pre-dated and post-dated the 18th century, not only in the USA but also in Canada and western Europe. By bringing more attention to the similarities and differences between the American case, on the one hand, and other contexts, on the other, <italic>The Politics of Fashion</italic> may have been able to offer even more insights into which aspects of the history of fashion were unique to the USA, and which were connected to transnational developments.</p>
<p>One of the most innovative books on the history of fashion to date, <italic>The Politics of Fashion in Eigtheenth-Century America</italic> unites the interests of material, gender and political historians, offering new and important perspectives on how attire and style helped to construct gender, race, and class in the USA. As Kate Haulman expertly demonstrates, 18th-century critical commentary on fashion tended to depict women and the non-affluent as incapable of dressing modestly and patriotically. As a result, and by the 19th century, fashion came to play a critical role in many Americans’ understandings of who, and who could not, make legitimate claims to governance and citizenship.</p>
