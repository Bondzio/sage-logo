<abstract>
<p>This article examines the effect of mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) on the profile of merging firms’ inventive activity. The authors conceive of the inventive process as a recombinant search, whose outcome can be characterized along two complementary dimensions, which define its profile: its depth of impact on subsequent inventions, and its breadth of impact across different scientific domains. The profile of firms’ inventive activity depends on two main factors: the resources available to be recombined and the organizational incentives that guide the recombination process. In turn, these factors significantly depend on the upstream, technological resources available and on firms’ downstream, product-market related assets. Importantly, both of these factors may change in the aftermath of M&amp;A, as their specific institutional features facilitate the exchange and redeployment of upstream and downstream resources. The authors then discuss how variations in the profile of firms’ inventive activity in the aftermath of an M&amp;A reflect the diversity of upstream and downstream resources redeployed by the M&amp;A deal. They test their hypotheses with a panel of firms from the US medical devices and photographic equipment industry. The study finds that diversity in merging firms’ downstream resources exerts a positive impact on post-acquisition profile of inventive activities, whereas diversity in knowledge bases does not seem to exert a significant direct effect on the two qualitative dimensions of inventive activity considered. Yet, technological diversity displays a positive effect in deals characterized by high market relatedness.</p>

<p>When competitive advantage increasingly depends on the continuous development of technological innovations, even the largest organizations require knowledge from beyond their boundaries. A significant portion of such knowledge-sourcing activity occurs through mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), which enable companies to obtain highly developed technical expertise and R&amp;D skills, functional product development teams, or specific new technologies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476127012457980">Cassiman and Colombo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1476127012457980">Ruckman, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1476127012457980">Inkpen et al. (2000)</xref> showed that in the 1990s, high-tech assets as acquisition targets accounted for 21% of all US M&amp;A activity by number and 39% by value; this trend, though varying somewhat, has persisted overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1476127012457980">Jones, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1476127012457980">Vella, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476127012457980">Ahuja and Katila, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476127012457980">Cassiman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476127012457980">Cloodt et al., 2006</xref>) revealed that M&amp;A can enhance the innovativeness of the acquiring firm by encouraging the renewal of the acquirer’s business lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476127012457980">Karim and Mitchell, 2000</xref>) and improving firms’ innovation capabilities through the redeployment of valuable resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476127012457980">Capron, 1999</xref>). Companies such as Cisco have even built dominant technological and market positions through their acquisitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476127012457980">Mayer and Kenney, 2004</xref>). More generally, M&amp;A provide a possible positive shock that can help rejuvenate organizations and prevent them from falling into competency traps (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1476127012457980">Morosini et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1476127012457980">Vermeulen and Barkema, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet other studies have highlighted M&amp;A downside risks. Specifically, they can lead to excessive organizational focus on the short term, which may reduce innovativeness (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012457980">Hall, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476127012457980">Hitt et al., 1991</xref>). In addition, the uncertainty brought about by acquisitions and a possible clash of organizational cultures may encourage the departure of key inventors from the merging organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476127012457980">Ernst and Vitt, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1476127012457980">Stuart and Sorenson, 2003</xref>) or decrease their productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1476127012457980">Kapoor and Lim, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>These apparently contradicting results demand a deeper analysis of the factors and the contingencies underlying the mechanisms by which M&amp;A affect firms’ innovativeness and technological outcomes. To take on this challenge, we explore the impact of M&amp;A on the profile of firms’ inventive activity and thus depart significantly from prior literature that looked primarily at the effect of M&amp;A on the mere <italic>quantity</italic> of inventions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476127012457980">Ahuja and Katila, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476127012457980">Cloodt et al., 2006</xref>). Considering the qualitative profile of inventions is important though, because there is enormous variance in terms of their economic impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476127012457980">Gambardella et al., 2008</xref>): just the top 10% of patents earn 48–93% of all inventions’ financial payoffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1476127012457980">Scherer and Harhoff, 2000</xref>). Moreover, firms’ market value relates closely to the quality of the inventions they own rather than to their sheer number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476127012457980">Deng et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476127012457980">Hall et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>We thus integrate M&amp;A and technology literature to develop a theoretical framework that explains changes in the profile of inventive activities for merging firms after the deal. From M&amp;A literature, we draw on the notion that M&amp;A allow the redeployment of resources not readily available on the market (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476127012457980">Capron, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476127012457980">Capron et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476127012457980">Karim and Mitchell, 2000</xref>). From technology literature, we note that an inventive process can be represented as a recombinant search (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476127012457980">Fleming, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476127012457980">Nelson and Winter, 1982</xref>), whose outcome can be characterized along two relevant dimensions: the depth of impact of its outcome on subsequent inventions and the breadth of its impact across different scientific domains (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476127012457980">Argyres and Silverman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476127012457980">Hall et al., 2001</xref>). Then we discuss how variations along these two dimensions, in the aftermath of an M&amp;A, reflect the diversity of upstream and downstream resources redeployed by the M&amp;A deal. We test our hypotheses with a panel of firms from the US medical devices and photographic equipment industry.</p>
<p>The article proceeds as follows. In the next section, we present the background of our study and its hypotheses. After describing the empirical setting and methodology, we present the results of our econometric analyses. We conclude by discussing the main implications of our findings and the limitations of our study, as well as indicating a few interesting avenues for further research.</p>
<sec id="section1-1476127012457980">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Analyzing how M&amp;A affect the profile of firms’ inventive activity implies making assumptions about the functioning of the inventive process itself, as well as describing how M&amp;A affect the mechanisms underlying this process. We conceive of the inventive process as a recombinant search (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476127012457980">Basalla, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476127012457980">Fleming, 2001</xref>), a conceptualization with profound roots in prior literature and in the practice of R&amp;D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476127012457980">Nelson and Winter (1982)</xref> stated that the creation of novelty in art, science, or practical life consists largely of a recombination of conceptual and physical materials that previously existed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476127012457980">Fleming and Sorenson (2004)</xref> described how even inventions that resemble one, unbreakable component might arise from the recombination of discrete components.</p>
<p>The outcome of this recombinant search depends on two main factors: the resources available to be recombined and the organizational incentives that guide the recombination process. In turn, these factors significantly depend on the upstream, technological resources available and on firms’ downstream, product-market related assets. Importantly, both of these factors may change in the aftermath of M&amp;A, as their specific institutional features facilitate the exchange and redeployment of upstream and downstream resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476127012457980">Capron, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476127012457980">Capron et al., 1998</xref>). First, M&amp;A provide a common means to acquire technological resources in high-tech industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476127012457980">Cassiman and Colombo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1476127012457980">Inkpen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1476127012457980">Ruckman, 2005</xref>) and hence can enlarge the pool of knowledge on which firms draw in their inventive activities. As the development of new knowledge depends on a firm’s combinative capabilities to exploit its existing knowledge base and the unexplored potential of technology in use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1476127012457980">Kogut and Zander, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476127012457980">Nelson and Winter, 1982</xref>), M&amp;A can thus influence the profile of inventive activities.</p>
<p>In addition, M&amp;A allow the redeployment of downstream, closer-to-the-market resources. These assets play an important role in determining the direction of change in the post-acquisition profile of inventive activities, because they can alter organizational incentives, and they do so by modifying the ability of firms to profit from innovation. Invention is in fact merely the first stage in the uncertain innovation process, and value appropriation is not automatic. The ability to capture the value of inventions requires two main premises. First, firms must be able to preserve the uniqueness of their inventions, so the effectiveness of their intellectual property protections plays a major role. Second, firms must control the downstream resources – the so-called ‘complementary assets’ – necessary to exploit the knowledge generated by the invention and bring it to the market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1476127012457980">Teece, 1986</xref>). Being able to rely on such complementary assets affects the incentive of firms to invest in R&amp;D because these assets augment the prospects of value appropriation through R&amp;D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1476127012457980">Levin et al., 1987</xref>). Hence, as M&amp;A allow the redeployment of upstream and downstream resources, they modify firms’ resource base and incentives, that is, two key determinants of inventive output.</p>
<p>Following extant literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476127012457980">Argyres and Silverman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476127012457980">Hall et al., 2001</xref>), the profile of inventions that result from the recombinant search process can be characterized according to two measures: depth of impact and breadth of impact. The depth of impact of an invention denotes its influence on future inventions and inventors, that is, the extent to which new inventions must build on or refer to it. The breadth of impact signifies the span of applicability of an invention across scientific and technological fields, or its generality. Both dimensions also have important economic implications. On the one hand, firms’ market value has been shown to be influenced positively by the depth of impact of the patents they own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476127012457980">Hall et al., 2005</xref>). On the other hand, the breadth of impact of inventions helps firms in the exploitation of real options in an uncertain technological context and fosters new product development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1476127012457980">Novelli, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>In this section, we discuss how merging firms’ diversity of upstream and downstream resources might influence the profile of post-acquisition inventive activity as assessed by depth and breadth of impact.</p>
<sec id="section3-1476127012457980">
<title>The effect of merging firms’ technological bases diversity</title>
<p>In high-tech industries, firms can acquire firms that operate in a similar or dissimilar technological space. The technological space in which firms operate is associated to their knowledge bases, that is to the inventions they have developed and own.</p>
<p>A deal targeting a firm in dissimilar technological space, by providing new and diverse sets of knowledge-based resources, can augment firms’ possibilities of search. The ability to generate novel outcomes is based on idea availability, which could be constrained by local search if it refers to only a limited set of options that match confidently held beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1476127012457980">Taylor and Greve, 2006</xref>). Firms tend to concentrate on familiar technological problems and recombine familiar pieces of knowledge because increasing returns to experience, or mutual positive feedback between experience and competence, make this process preferable to the exploration of distant ideas. Although this process may be rewarding in terms of enabling the organization to build specialized competences, the ease of learning and problem solving in specific directions makes the adoption of alternate directions less likely. That is, developing deeper expertise with familiar knowledge bases yields more immediate and likely returns, so it appears preferable to exploring distant technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1476127012457980">Ahuja and Lampert, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, diverse inputs enable firms to move beyond closely related technological domains and engage in distant search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476127012457980">March, 1991</xref>). M&amp;A can provide such diverse inputs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1476127012457980">Karim and Mitchell (2004)</xref> describe how Johnson &amp; Johnson pursued recombinative exploration through M&amp;A by developing synergies across different product lines of acquired companies, complementing resources, and finding opportunities to leverage acquired knowledge to develop new lines. Such outcomes are more likely if M&amp;A integrate diverse knowledge bases. Since recombination is the ultimate source of novelty, inventors in firms that encompass greater technological diversity and make diverse knowledge domains available are more likely to attempt a previously untried combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476127012457980">Fleming, 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1476127012457980">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the diversity of knowledge might be at the basis of distant search and facilitates novel combinations, the ex post effects on inventions’ (average) depth of impact is less clear. Empirical evidence confirms that breakthrough inventions often result from distant search (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1476127012457980">Ahuja and Lampert, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476127012457980">Rosenkopf and Nerkar, 2001</xref>). Yet the research that has explored the causes of technological breakthroughs often suffers from selection biases, in that it is based on actual breakthroughs and ignores organizational failures, which tend to be more difficult to observe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476127012457980">Fleming, 2002</xref>). Thus influential inventions may result from distant search, but this finding does not take into consideration the many failures that distant search also might have produced. That is, diversity might be a necessary condition for achieving a breakthrough, but certainly not a sufficient one. On the contrary, diversity can actually also become a source of confusion and information overload. As the French mathematician and physicist Henri Poincaré highlighted, ‘invention consists in avoiding the constructing of useless combinations and in constructing the useful combinations which are in infinite minority. To invent is to discern, to choose.’ Yet the combinatorial flexibility conferred by a large choice set of resources can be overwhelming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1476127012457980">Chua and Iynegar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1476127012457980">Rivkin, 2000</xref>), and even if diversity helps create novel combinations, it cannot help discern among them. Since the agents of recombination are people, the process of invention remains strongly influenced by cognitive phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476127012457980">Fleming, 2001</xref>), and the most fundamental influence is a limitation on the number of potential combinations that an inventor can simultaneously consider. Empirical evidence confirms that the challenge of implementing diverse knowledge obtained from broad search makes the generation of usable innovations more difficult. On the contrary, recombining familiar components inventors are less likely to develop a useless invention, because they learned which components failed in previous inventions. In sum, if the pursuit of breakthroughs is facilitated by diversity, diversity might affect negatively the <italic>average</italic> of the depth of impact of inventions, because of the many failures it leads to. Along these lines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1476127012457980">Taylor and Greve (2006)</xref> found that teams of members with various experience and different backgrounds display more variance in outcomes, and most importantly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476127012457980">Fleming (2001)</xref> showed that recombining familiar components leads, on average, to better quality inventions than does distant search. These arguments suggest the following hypothesis:</p>
<p><bold><sc>hypothesis</sc> 1:</bold> The diversity of merging firms’ knowledge bases is related negatively to the average depth of impact of inventions after the acquisition.</p>
<p>If M&amp;A lead to an increased technological diversity, this might still be beneficial for the breadth of impact of subsequent inventions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1476127012457980">Novelli (2011)</xref> suggests that the ability of firms to generate technology with a high breadth of impact depends on their ability to master the logics of induction and deduction to generate general solutions to technical and technological problems. In particular, induction is the process of generalizing conclusions coming from particular instances, establishing a general law from the observation of particular cases. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1476127012457980">Novelli (2011)</xref> further suggests that in the specific context of technological development, generalization by induction can be thought as a process that begins with firm’s exposure to a number of technological domains, each of which is characterized by specific problems. Firms will then try to act so as to minimize the distance between the current state and the objective state, in which there is a solution that fits all the applications. And she shows that a wider, more diverse technological base can facilitate the process of induction to create inventions with a wide breadth of impact. The reason is that the diversity of knowledge within the firm boundaries augments the capacity for making novel linkages and associations just like the diversity of knowledge within an individual mind does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1476127012457980">Simon, 1985</xref>), and as a consequence the outcome of the process is going to be more general as it takes into account a greater variety of possible states of the world. We thus suggest the following hypothesis:</p>
<p><bold><sc>hypothesis</sc> 2:</bold> The diversity of merging firms’ knowledge bases is related positively to the average breadth of impact of inventions after the acquisition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1476127012457980">
<title>The effect of market relatedness</title>
<p>The direction of inventive activities is a matter of resources and abilities, but also of incentives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1476127012457980">Henderson, 1993</xref>). That is, not only will firms develop technological solutions they are capable of, but they will also consider those solutions that are more aligned with their incentives. With specific reference to economic incentives, an organization will therefore tend to favor investments in research from which it expects to reap profits. Incentives will thus influence the profile of inventive activities in at least two ways. First, through the selection of specific R&amp;D projects. An organization will in fact tend to prefer some investments in research over others, and will most likely promote and approve R&amp;D projects that have the potential to create higher profits, discarding those that have lower expected prospects. Second, organizational incentives can shape directly inventors’ actions and decisions, in that for career concerns they may prefer to put up projects and to address technological problems that are more likely to be approved within the firm.</p>
<p>By allowing the access to and the redeployment of diverse downstream resources and complementary assets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476127012457980">Capron, 1999</xref>), M&amp;A can change organizational incentives – and therefore change the profile of post-acquisition inventive activities. Access to complementary, downstream assets might change the incentive of firms to invest in R&amp;D because they influence the prospects of firms’ value appropriation through R&amp;D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1476127012457980">Teece, 1986</xref>). Not only can downstream assets influence the amount of R&amp;D, but also the type of research pursued. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476127012457980">Fosfuri et al. (2008)</xref> showed that downstream resources in software and hardware significantly explain the decision of profit-oriented firms to introduce and commercialize open source software products. Specifically, we contend that the more merging firms’ downstream resources and capabilities are diverse, i.e. the more merging firms compete in different product markets, the more positive the effect will be on the profile of inventive activity.</p>
<p>The redeployment of diverse downstream resources can affect positively the depth and breadth of impact of post-acquisition inventions in three main ways. First, they increase the expected profits from R&amp;D activities aimed at particularly new or general solutions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476127012457980">Nelson (1959)</xref> shows that when a firm owns downstream assets in a wide and diversified range of product markets, it is more likely to search broadly and foster particularly original research, because it is able to exploit its results in multiple market applications. In fact, when firms look for particularly original and breakthrough inventions, i.e. inventions that might have a high depth of impact on future inventions but might have an ex ante uncertain market applicability, it is difficult to predict where exactly one can apply this knowledge in product markets. Accordingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1476127012457980">Link (1982)</xref> finds product-market diversification to be a significant predictor of investments in basic research. Hence, an increased downstream scope intensifies the pursuit of inventions with a potentially high depth of impact on the premise that is will be easier to find a commercial application for them.</p>
<p>By the same token, acquiring diverse and complementary downstream resources, because of increased appropriability and newly acquired downstream economies of scope, intensifies firms’ incentive to search for inventions of broader market applicability and a larger breadth of impact. Hence, adding unrelated downstream assets facilitates the pursuit of research applicable in broader domains.</p>
<p>Second, when firms pursue M&amp;A in unrelated product markets, it is less likely they will have to implement cost-cutting integration strategies, at least in the short term. As a consequence, their incentives will be less focused on efficiency, and they will less likely discourage long-term path-breaking projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1476127012457980">Valentini, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, when merging firms act in the same product market, it is more likely that they developed bureaucratic effects due to the increase in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476127012457980">Cassiman et al., 2005</xref>), in that a stronger integration is more likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1476127012457980">Haspeslagh and Jemison, 1991</xref>). In line with these arguments, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1476127012457980">Skovvang Christensen (2006)</xref> described, when Ericsson acquired Telebit, a firm with overlapping downstream assets, Telebit ceased to produce and market its products, which meant the firm lost its ability to understand customers’ needs, which implied a decrease in its product quality. Conversely, acquiring a firm operating in a complementary market may increase incentives to pursue inventions with a high level of impact and applicable in broader scopes.</p>
<p>We thus propose the following hypotheses:</p>
<p><bold><sc>hypothesis</sc> 3:</bold> The market relatedness of an acquirer and a target is related negatively to the inventions’ average depth of search after the acquisition.</p>
<p><bold><sc>hypothesis</sc> 4:</bold> The market relatedness of an acquirer and a target is related negatively to the inventions’ average breadth of impact after the acquisition.</p>

<title>The joint effect of upstream and downstream resources</title>
<p>We previously argued that the downside risk of exploring widely thanks to a more diverse knowledge base is that the success rate of inventive activities will be more uncertain and inventions poorer on average, with a lower depth of impact. Yet the primary cause of inventions’ failure to be impactful is the lack of any – actual or foreseeable – application. Ceteris paribus, when a firm owns downstream assets in a wide and diversified range of product markets, it is more likely to find an application for its inventions. Hence, adding unrelated downstream assets might diminish the probability of obtaining a failure. We therefore posit:</p>
<p><bold><sc>hypothesis</sc> 5:</bold> The negative effect of the diversity of merging firms’ knowledge bases on the average depth of impact of inventions is weaker when market relatedness between target and acquirer is low.</p>
<p>Extant literature indicates that in a firm with greater technological diversity, novel combinations of broad applicability and impact are more likely to be found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1476127012457980">Novelli, 2011</xref>). When there are also diverse downstream assets these combinations are also more likely to be approved by top management. A broader product-market scope insures that, whatever direction the path of research may take, the results are likely to be of value to the sponsoring firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476127012457980">Nelson, 1959</xref>). If downstream diversification augments the probability to sponsor and pursue novel combinations in research, then we also expect the following to hold:</p>
<p><bold><sc>hypothesis</sc> 6:</bold> The positive effect of the diversity of merging firms’ knowledge bases on the average breadth of search of inventions is stronger for low market relatedness between target and acquirer.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section7-1476127012457980">
<title>Data</title>
<p>We tested our hypotheses with a longitudinal data set that details the acquisition and patenting activities of 154 US firms in the medical devices and photographic equipment industry (SIC 38). The sample consists of firms in this industry with data availability in the Compustat database.</p>
<p>Data about the M&amp;A deals came from SDC Platinum. We selected deals completed (1) between 1988 and 1996, (2) by US firms, and (3) by an acquirer whose primary SIC code was 38. However, targets could belong to any industrial sector, which allowed for varying levels of market relatedness. We retrieved additional information about parent companies, affiliates, and associates from the ‘Who Owns Whom’ database, business news, and companies’ websites. Several sample firms were very active in acquisitions, while others conducted no acquisitions.</p>
<p>The medical devices industry is a suitable setting for this study because it witnessed many deals throughout the 1990s, and innovation is key to competitive advantage, such that patents offer an effective and valuable way to appropriate returns from R&amp;D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476127012457980">Arora et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, mixing diverse knowledge bases is a key element of innovation in this industry. In the 1990s, John Abele, the founder and chair of Boston Scientific, even contended that most technological advances in the industry were coming from outside the medical marketplace, including from the entertainment sector with its specialization in imaging technologies.</p>
<p>The chosen study period also has two advantages. First, it ends at the beginning of the latest M&amp;A wave, which enables us to disentangle the effects of single deals. Second, it does not contain significant revolutionary technological changes, so we avoid specific phenomena such as patents races.</p>

<title>Dependent variables and analyses</title>
<p>To characterize firms’ inventive activity we relied on patent measures obtained from the NBER US Patent Citations Data File (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476127012457980">Hall et al., 2001</xref>). Patents have served as proxies for inventive activities in multiple fields, ranging from sociology to economics. As measures of inventive activity, patents not only represent an externally validated measure of technological novelty with clear economic significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1476127012457980">Scherer and Ross, 1990</xref>), but also correlate empirically with other measures of technological performance, such as new product or innovation counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476127012457980">Hagedoorn and Cloodt, 2003</xref>). Nonetheless, the use of patents presents some limitations. Some inventions are not patentable or just not patented, and the propensity to patent varies widely across industrial sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1476127012457980">Levin et al., 1987</xref>). Because patenting patterns largely depend on industry characteristics, we focus on a single industrial sector. Thus the external factors that affect the propensity to patent should be stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476127012457980">Ahuja and Katila, 2001</xref>). In addition – and perhaps most important for this study – patented inventions vary greatly in their quality (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476127012457980">Gambardella et al., 2008</xref>), which makes considering and measuring the qualitative profile of inventive activity of paramount importance.</p>
<p>We characterize inventive activity according to its depth of impact and breadth of impact (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476127012457980">Argyres and Silverman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476127012457980">Hall et al., 2001</xref>). As we discussed previously, the depth of impact denotes its influence on future inventions and inventors, whereas the breadth of its impact (also denoted as generality; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476127012457980">Hall et al., 2001</xref>) signifies the degree of applicability across scientific and technological fields.</p>

<p>Citation by subsequent patents indicates not only the depth of impact of the underlying invention but also its economic value (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476127012457980">Gambardella et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1476127012457980">Trajtenberg, 1990</xref>). Thus the use of forward citations as a proxy of patent depth of impact is widespread (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476127012457980">Argyres and Silverman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476127012457980">Fleming, 2001</xref>). To acquire a patent, an inventor must submit an application to the patent office that describes a non-obvious and industrially useful invention. Applicants also must cite all previously granted patents that made technological claims similar to those in their applications. This process is supervised by patent examiners, who verify that the list of references included in each patent application is complete.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1476127012457980">2</xref></sup> The function of the citation requirement is to establish the scope of the patent; inventors can only claim patent rights to unique aspects of their inventions. To establish uniqueness, each application must identify how the proposed invention extends patented technological precursors. Similar to article citations in an academic context, highly cited patents are the most important inventions in that area.</p>

<p>The number of citations a patent can receive depends on the year of application.

<p>That is, for every deal <italic>m</italic> in the sample, we calculated the average value of the <italic>n</italic>th dimension that characterized the profile of the inventive activity IA (i.e. depth of impact and breadth of impact), referring to patents for which the two merging firms filed an application two years before the deal and two years after the deal itself.</p>
<p>Sample selection and endogeneity might be a concern in previous empirical models. First, firms that engage in M&amp;A may differ systematically from those that do not. And second, acquiring firms may acquire different targets (i.e. firms with different characteristics) for different motives, and these motives might be related to technological outcomes; hence our main regressors – i.e. diversity of upstream and downstream assets between acquiring and target firms – might be endogenous. To tackle this issue, we therefore also estimated a three-stage model which considers both selection bias and endogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1476127012457980">Mroz, 1987</xref>). In a first stage, we estimate a selection model to predict the probability of a firm to become an acquirer. The purpose of this estimation is to eliminate the problem of selection bias including a correction term – known as the inverse Mills ratio – in the structural equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1476127012457980">Heckman, 1979</xref>). In stage 2 the problem of endogenous regressors is tackled. Acquiring firms might pursue different goals through the acquisition. While understanding directly the precise goals of the deal might be difficult, and even press releases might not necessarily mirror the real intention of acquirers, these goals should be reflected in the choice of the target firms, as different targets are likely be acquired when pursuing different corporate goals. This study suggested that the main covariates explaining variance in post-acquisition inventions’ profile are the diversity of knowledge bases between acquiring firm and target firms, and their market relatedness. Typically, a possibly endogenous variable is regressed on a series of instruments, and then the estimated value of the endogenous variable is included in the structural equation instead of the endogenous regressor itself. Since we actually have two endogenous variables, and we are also interested in the effect of their interaction, we proceeded in the following way. We first constructed a vector D of four (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive) dummies characterizing each deal, which indicate whether the target is close or distant with respect to the acquiring firm in terms of technological and downstream resources, such that:</p>

<p>where high vs. low technological diversity is defined as being above or below the sample median of the diversity of the knowledge bases measured as previously described, and high product-market relatedness is defined as target and acquiring firms having the same two-digit SIC code – the remaining cases indicating a low product-market relatedness. Hence, for instance, a deal characterized by a high (i.e. above the median) degree of diversity of technological bases and a high downstream relatedness would be characterized with a 1 for the first dummy, whereas the other three dummies would be equal to 0. Next, we estimated a multinomial logit having D as the dependent variable. This model allows constructing predicting values of our potentially endogenous regressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476127012457980">Cassiman and Veugelers, 2006</xref>). In stage 3, the structural equation is then estimated. In this model, changes in inventions’ profile are regressed on the predicted values of D from stage 2 multinomial logit, the inverse Mills ratio from stage 1, and a number of control variables. In doing so, we attempt to control for both sample selection and endogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476127012457980">Berndt, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1476127012457980">Mroz, 1987</xref>).</p>

The diversity of knowledge bases between the acquirer (A) and the target (T) then can be measured as the complement of the uncentered correlation of the technological vectors of the two firms A and T, that is, 1 – <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub><italic>F</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub>′ / [(<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub><italic>F</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub>)(<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>AT</italic></sub>)]<sup>1/2</sup>.

<list-item><p><italic>Financial leverage</italic>. The opportunity cost of R&amp;D may increase with firms’ leverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012457980">Hall, 1990</xref>). On the one hand, moral hazard problems in transferring information about risky problems from firms to investors increase preference for retained earnings as a source of finance for R&amp;D projects. On the other hand, the discipline induced by a high debt may foster a short-term perspective that discourages uncertain investments, such as in R&amp;D. Leverage is calculated as debt financing divided by total financing.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Organizational size</italic>, measured as the log of assets. Organizational size might influence the type of inventions pursued; for example, large organizations tend to favor the familiar to the unfamiliar, the mature over the nascent, and solutions that are nearby to de novo solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1476127012457980">Ahuja and Lampert, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1476127012457980">Sorensen and Stuart (2000)</xref> showed that a larger size is generally associated with a tendency to build and rely on previous innovative activities and refine and elaborate older areas of technology. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1476127012457980">Chandy and Tellis (2000)</xref> have shown that large firms and incumbents are more likely to introduce radical innovations than small firms and that innovations introduced by large firms are no less radical than those introduced by small firms or non-incumbents.</p></list-item> <list-item><p><italic>R&amp;D intensity</italic>, measured as R&amp;D expenditures over sales. First, this intensity might have an effect, in and of itself, on the type of inventions pursued by an organization. Second, it might have an effect through its relationship with firms’ M&amp;A strategy. Several studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1476127012457980">Veugelers and Cassiman, 1999</xref>) have provided evidence that internal and external knowledge-sourcing modes are complementary rather than substitutes. Firms combining internal and external activities outperform those that base their innovation strategy on a single activity; acquiring external know-how significantly increases technological performance only if the firm is engaged in internal R&amp;D activities as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476127012457980">Cassiman and Veugelers, 2006</xref>). Internal R&amp;D capabilities have positive effects on firms’ skills in searching for, scanning, and integrating external knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1476127012457980">Cohen and Levinthal, 1990</xref>). Overall, if a high absorptive capacity is associated with a better chance of identifying, integrating, and applying new, external knowledge, it also may enhance the process of identifying and integrating suitable targets in technological M&amp;A. A firm that strategically decides to acquire external technological knowledge without investing in internal capabilities is thus in a worse position to create synergies. Ceteris paribus, bidders that combine internal innovation activities with external technology grafting observe a higher potential return from M&amp;A and enhanced inventive processes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Number of patents produced.</italic> The profile of inventive activity might also depend on the quantity of patents produced.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Year dummies</italic>. These dummies capture possible unobserved year-specific effects and help account for measurements issues in patents’ citation-based measures that the time-moving normalization may leave unresolved.</p></list-item></list>

<p>With hypotheses 1 and 2, we suggested that the diversity of knowledge bases between merging firms would decrease the post-acquisition depth of impact, but increase the subsequent breadth of impact. Yet in models (1) and (2), the parameter estimate of the diversity of knowledge bases is not significantly different from zero. Overall, therefore, the diversity of technological bases between merging firms does not seem to exert a direct effect on post-acquisition inventive activities. Hypotheses 3 and 4 posited that product-market relatedness is negatively related to post-acquisition depth and breadth of impact. Consistently, we find the parameter estimate of market relatedness to be negative and highly significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). When firms obtain downstream resources in complementary markets, they tend to search more broadly and produce inventions with greater influence in a wider range of technological fields. This is also consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476127012457980">Chen (1996)</xref>, who argued that firms actively engaged in diversification are more sensitive to new opportunities. Hence, the active pursuit of diversification strategies might indicate a mindset of exploration, and therefore can be correlated to a more impactful and more diverse pool of R&amp;D activities.</p>
<p>We also predicted the coefficient of the interaction between diversity of technological bases and market relatedness to be negative in models 1 and 2 (with hypotheses 5 and 6, respectively). However, the parameter estimate of the interaction term is positive and significant in both models (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Overall, it then clearly appears that market relatedness between acquiring and target firms has a general negative effect on the considered dimensions of the qualitative profile of inventive activities, an effect which is possibly countervailed by a high degree of technological diversity in merging firms’ knowledge bases. There seems therefore to be two positive options for merging firms: either firms acquire organizations in distant product markets, or they acquire firms that are downstream-related, but with a high degree of technological diversity. Market relatedness and technological relatedness thus seem to play almost ‘substitute’ roles.</p>
<p>The parameter estimates of control variables follow expected patterns. Firms’ leverage has a negative effect on breadth of search. As expected, the short-term focus often demanded by a high level of debt may constrain firms’ search process. The pre-sample patent variables and several year dummies were also generally significant, which indicates that it is important to control for unobserved firm and period effects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1476127012457980">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The partially unexpected results call for a deeper analysis of our arguments. In particular, the negative effect of market relatedness was theoretically supported on the basis of the fact that an increase in product-market scope could change the incentives of merging firms in a way that more uncertain and general technological trajectories may be preferred and that bureaucratic effect due to increase in size may be less present.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1476127012457980">6</xref></sup> This mechanism, though, may actually work if merging firms are managed in a way that facilitates risk and output sharing across business units. This will more probably happen if accompanied by organizational controls focused more on organizational actions than merely on outcomes. When this is the case, business units are more likely to consider the novel assets redeployed through acquisition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476127012457980">Hitt et al. (1996)</xref> have shown that the type of organizational control firms adopt is significantly related to the acquisition strategy firms follow, whereby firms with a higher acquisition intensity are characterized by a lower propensity to use strategic controls and a higher propensity to adopt financial, output-related controls. We would therefore expect the positive effect of diversity of downstream assets on depth and breadth of impact to be more pronounced when the acquirer is characterized by low acquisition intensity. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1476127012457980">Table 2</xref> (columns (3) and (4)) shows the results of our baseline regression where we also insert the interaction between market relatedness and acquiring firm M&amp;A intensity (measured as the number of acquisitions carried out from 1987 until the focal deal is carried out). The parameter estimate of this variable is negative, thus providing some additional support to our theoretical arguments.</p>
<p>In unreported results, we also find that the main results hold qualitatively when we use the M&amp;A deal as the unit of analysis, and analyze the change in post-acquisition behavior compared with pre-deal outcomes as a function of technology and market relatedness between the acquiring firm and target. Yet, as previously discussed, our results might also suffer from potential bias due to selection and endogeneity. To address this concern, we adopted a three-stage estimation strategy.</p>
<p>In a first stage, we predicted the probability of becoming an acquirer with a probit model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1476127012457980">Heckman, 1979</xref>). We identify the relevant covariates drawing upon prior literature that has analyzed firms’ propensity to acquire in high-tech contexts (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476127012457980">Blonigen and Taylor, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476127012457980">Hall, 1999</xref>) . The model is estimated for firms in the industry with data availability, and regressors are one year lagged. The results of this analysis are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1476127012457980">Table 3</xref> and show signs in line with previous related studies.</p>

<p>In the second stage, we examine acquirers’ selection of target firms. The selection is modeled through a multinomial logit having as dependent variable a vector of four unordered options, which represent the possible combination of high vs. low market relatedness and technological diversity between merging firms, as described in the previous section. To understand the selection process, we consider a number of variables to identify acquirers’ innovation and general strategy as well as past performance. These variables include: financial leverage, advertising intensity, capex intensity, R&amp;D intensity, size, Tobin’s q, size of knowledge base over employees, and prior experience in M&amp;A (measured as the number of M&amp;A conducted since 1987), as well as the inverse Mills ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476127012457980">Berndt, 1991</xref>). Results of the multinomial logit are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1476127012457980">Table 4</xref>. This estimation is then used to calculate the predicted values of the strategies actually used by acquirers in the structural equations referring to the changes in the three dimensions of inventive activities we consider, and whose results are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1476127012457980">Table 5</xref> (the model does not include a constant term to allow for the contemporaneous presence of the four dummies characterizing deals).</p>

<p>A decrease in significance in a three-stage model with relatively few observations is frequent, and might indicate the poor predictive power of the adoption decision or result from the multi-stage method itself, which often produces multicollinearity concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1476127012457980">Maddala, 1983</xref>). Still the models indicate results that are consistent with our base model. In particular, change in depth of impact is related positively to deals in which merging firms are characterized by a low diversity of technological bases and a high diversity of downstream assets. Along similar lines, breadth of impact is negatively related to deals in which there is a high technological diversity as well as high diversity in downstream assets. These results therefore support the idea that diversity in downstream resources exerts a positive effect on the profile of inventive activity and that upstream resource diversity and downstream resource diversity play almost substitute roles.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>In an increasingly knowledge-based economy, understanding the factors that shape organizations’ ability to produce influential technological knowledge is central to organizational studies. We have focused on a recurrent organizational event and examined its multifaceted impact on firms’ inventive activity. Therefore, we have addressed the important, still controversial issue of the effect of M&amp;A on firms’ inventive activities, as well as shed some new light on the fundamental drivers of technological breakthroughs and invention quality.</p>
<p>Our empirical findings can be summarized as follows. Diversity in merging firms’ downstream resources exerts a positive impact on post-acquisition profile of inventive activities, whereas diversity in knowledge bases does not seem to exert a significant direct effect on the two qualitative dimensions of inventive activity we considered. Yet, technological diversity displays a positive effect in deals characterized by high market relatedness.</p>
<p>The positive effect of increased firm scope is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476127012457980">Nelson’s (1959)</xref> finding that large, diversified firms find basic and original research relatively more profitable, not just because of their larger knowledge base but precisely because of their greater downstream presence, which expands the area over which they can use and apply this research. It is also in line with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1476127012457980">Miller et al. (2007)</xref>, who found that the use of interdivisional knowledge in diversified firms positively affects the impact of an invention on subsequent technological developments. More broadly, it is also in line with the fresh stream of literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476127012457980">Campa and Kedia, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1476127012457980">Villalonga, 2004</xref>) that does not consider diversifying M&amp;A as necessarily value-destroying, but that has shown that some of the assumed negative effects of diversification can be explained by the wrong econometric specifications that characterized previous empirical exercises.</p>
<p>The significant role of downstream resources in shaping the quality of inventive activity also is germane to the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1476127012457980">Kapoor and Lim (2007)</xref>, who showed that knowledge and incentive-based perspectives complement each other in explaining the patenting output of inventors from acquired firms. We also find that both theories matter, because the interaction between diversity in downstream complementary assets and technological resources is fundamental for explaining post-acquisition variations in patenting profile. Both resources and incentives thus emerge as two related drivers of inventive activities, in terms of not only quantity but also quality.</p>
<p>Contrary to our expectations, the results show that the diversity of knowledge bases of merging firms does not necessarily lead to a wider impact of inventions. The non-significant direct effect of the diversity of knowledge bases can be explained, we speculate, because of the lack of control for organizational integration decisions. Acquirer and target knowledge bases can more likely lead to cross-pollination and increased opportunities for recombination if the two organizations are actually integrated. Diversity of knowledge bases however exerts a positive effect on inventive activities when product-market relatedness is high, that is, when the probability of integrating is higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1476127012457980">Haspeslagh and Jemison, 1991</xref>). In addition, even if the deal might be primarily driven by traditional efficiency or market power decisions as it is often the case when market relatedness is high, when knowledge bases are diverse there might be the possibility of technological motives behind the deal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476127012457980">Cassiman et al., 2005</xref>), which in turn lead to better technological outcomes. The multinomial logit results seem to suggest that this type of deal is sought by companies with a lower past research productivity, as assessed by the size of knowledge base over the number of employees. And in this case the deal helps improve the profile of inventive activity. The multinomial logit also indicates that the opposite situation, the one characterized by a low technological diversity and low market relatedness, is sought by companies with a significantly lower financial stress. In these cases, acquirers are therefore less influenced by the pressure on short-term results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012457980">Hall, 1990</xref>), and an enlarged downstream scope provides further opportunities for innovation.</p>
<p>This study adds to the M&amp;A and technology literature in several ways. First, we focus on a relatively understudied post-acquisition outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1476127012457980">Zollo and Meier, 2008</xref>). In recent years, M&amp;A have been used increasingly as a strategic option to source knowledge, so a better understanding of the factors that govern the impact of M&amp;A on firms’ inventive activities assumes paramount importance for theory as well as for practicing managers. Second, unlike studies that explore the drivers of possible changes in post-acquisition patenting output, we analyze drivers of change in the type of patenting output. Analyzing the type of invention is important, because inventions display significant variance in their economic relevance, largely associated with the measures we considered to characterize the profile of firms’ inventive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476127012457980">Gambardella et al., 2008</xref>). Third and relatedly, this study contributes to our scarce understanding of the drivers of invention quality. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476127012457980">Fleming (2002)</xref> has highlighted, little theory and evidence pertains to the sources of technological breakthroughs or inventions’ quality. We have outlined how additional downstream and upstream resources, made available through M&amp;A, help shape the profile of inventive activity, and in particular we have contributed to the empirical literature on the effect of market scope on innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476127012457980">Ahuja et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>At a more general level, our study adds to organizational learning literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1476127012457980">Morosini et al. (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1476127012457980">Vermeulen and Barkema (2001)</xref>, among others, have argued that M&amp;A provide positive stimulation through new and different knowledge, which prevents firms from falling into competency traps. However, previous studies have focused on sales growth and firm survival as key performance measures. Understanding how M&amp;A contribute to inventive activity also may help reconstruct the link between the M&amp;A stimulus and chances for survival, growth, and development. Therefore for managers, this study highlights and suggests the conditions in which M&amp;A may promote organizational rejuvenation.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these contributions, several limitations also warrant attention. First, we examine only acquirers in a single industry. These findings plausibly might generalize to similar industries in which technological innovation is crucial, but our study also could be replicated in industries with different structures, characterized by different types of M&amp;A (e.g. a few large deals rather than many small deals). Second, we observed changes in the profile of inventions over a post-acquisition period of just two years (robust over three years as well). However, the effect of M&amp;A sometimes can emerge only years after the deal, and the type of R&amp;D conducted in the relatively immediate aftermath of a deal may differ from that conducted over a longer period of time. Third, M&amp;A success is likely a function of both the potential benefits stemming from the combination of the involved firms and organizational integration, which translates potential fit into real synergies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1476127012457980">Haspeslagh and Jemison, 1991</xref>). We focused on the combination potential; thus opportunities remain to analyze the (possibly moderating) influence of the integration process on inventive process success. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1476127012457980">Paruchuri et al. (2006)</xref> have shown for example that acquisition integration is disruptive and leads to the most severe productivity drops for inventors who have lost the most social status and centrality in a combined entity. As we previously argued, the depth of organizational integration might moderate the extent to which inventors are able to recombine merging firms’ knowledge bases. Similarly, in this study we are not considering if firms are using concurrent sources of technological knowledge, such as strategic alliances. The effect of M&amp;A might more broadly depend on the portfolio of firms’ external linkages. Most importantly, our results should be carefully interpreted since, notwithstanding our empirical efforts, we cannot unequivocally establish a causal relationship between M&amp;A and changes in profile of inventive activities.</p>
<p>Several extensions of this research stream deserve attention. In particular, additional research at a more micro level could examine how M&amp;A affect productivity at the inventor level. Previous research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476127012457980">Ernst and Vitt, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1476127012457980">Stuart and Sorensen, 2003</xref>) has suggested that M&amp;A increase workers’ mobility. Yet when firms acquire other firms, they obtain not only their current knowledge base but also their capabilities to build future new knowledge. Because this ability largely resides with firms’ inventors, it is of paramount importance to understand how inventors react to M&amp;A events and how firms deal with these reactions. In one of the rare studies at the inventor level, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1476127012457980">Kapoor and Lim (2007)</xref> discuss factors that might explain the productivity of inventors in acquired firms. Additional research at this level of analysis also should investigate the specific modalities for effectively integrating and recombining bidder and target knowledge bases after the deal, as well as the extent to which post-M&amp;A mobility leads to the real transfer or loss of knowledge. Research also might address the strategic effects of M&amp;A. If they change the innovation strategy of merging firms and strategic interactions in R&amp;D exist – that is, if firms make decisions on the basis of observed or expected competitors’ decisions – then M&amp;A might also indirectly change the innovation strategy of merging firms’ competitors. In a recent review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476127012457980">Haleblian et al. (2009)</xref> highlighted how little we know about how acquisitions affect rival firms in the market. Firms’ innovation strategies thus offer fertile ground for investigating the strategic effects of M&amp;A.</p>

<p>For example, the life and materials science firm DSM took over Gist-Brocades, though almost no overlap existed between the R&amp;D activities of the two firms. After the deal was signed, no R&amp;D laboratories were closed; on the contrary, new R&amp;D programs were launched that combined their different competencies, such as Gist-Brocades’ biotech competencies and DSM’s know-how with regard to chemical processes. They developed new technological competencies, including ‘green routes’ for the production of intermediates of antibiotics based on a fermentation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476127012457980">Cassiman and Colombo, 2006</xref>). Similarly, Medtronic acquired PS Medical, which at that time was developing an implantable drug delivery system to allow patients suffering from chronic cancer pain to self-administer doses of pain relievers directly to their central nervous system. This system combined with Medtronic’s programmable drug administration system and thus led to innovative products for treating neurological disorders.</p></fn>

<p>Recent studies showed that the addition of citations by patent examiners may make citations biased measures of knowledge flows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476127012457980">Alcacer and Gittelman, 2006</xref>). A priori, there is no reason this bias undermines the reliability of patent citations as indicators of the quality of patents though. In an extensive survey of some 8000 patents, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476127012457980">Gambardella et al.

<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476127012457980">Hall et al. (1986</xref>: 281) stated, ‘there is a rather strong contemporaneous relationship between R&amp;D expenditures and patenting, which does not disappear when we control for the size of the firm, its permanent patenting policy, or even the effects of its R&amp;D history.’ Therefore, most R&amp;D carried out in a given year leads to a patent application soon thereafter, with a very short lag between R&amp;D activities and patent applications.</p></fn>

<p>Breadth and depth of impact are not completely independent measures, as the breadth of applicability of a patent depends on the number of forward citations a patent receives (i.e. its depth of impact). Still, regression results having breadth of impact as the dependent variable remain unchanged if we insert depth of impact as an additional covariate.</p></fn>

<p>Notice our theoretical arguments implicitly assume a positive correlation between forward citations and commercialization. The available empirical evidence is generally aligned with this assumption. On average, the number of forward citations received is correlated with patent commercial value (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476127012457980">Gambardella et al., 2008</xref>) and is correlated with the probability that a patent leads to a start-up (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1476127012457980">Shane, 2001</xref>).</p></fn>
