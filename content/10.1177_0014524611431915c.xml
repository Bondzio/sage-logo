<p>I would imagine that most of us have had a knock on our doors from the Jehovah Witnesses. Each time they’ve visited me they were always very pleasant and presentable as well as being smartly dressed young men and women. Now although I am happy to discuss matters of religion until the cows are milked I always find myself getting a tad impatient with my visitors. In my encounters with my zealous friends they have never really listened to any words of wisdom which I may have wished to share, for they had already been ‘instructed’ to use the fairy tale book of Jesus and his magic numbers to counter any argument which might be used against their teaching. So to borrow a quote from Dr Martin Luther King, “I have a dream,” - I have a dream that the Church has to become a community that is not afraid to think, and ask questions, and explore doubt, and experiment with creating a more loving and just society.</p>
<p>And I have this dream because I firmly believe that many people view the Church as an institution with no intellectual integrity nor a brain and therefore no relevance in the world today, which probably accounts for pastor Harold Camping receiving much air play when he predicted that the end of the world would commence on May 21<sup>st</sup> 2011 at 6.00pm, or that a piece of toast with the alleged image of Jesus can bring miraculous powers to those who possess it (not sure if you have to eat it or not though).</p>
<p>I’m always conscious that there is a core group in our national Church who have become something like the religious version of the Flat Earth Society where they cling to antiquated ideas and call those who question them, ‘far from God’. They stick religiously to the bible – which is fine - but then they will apply scriptures to topics that suit them and shun other biblical passages that would contradict them. I don’t hear many of them mention anything about being put to death if you fall out with your parents (Leviticus 20:9). They would however find it perfectly acceptable to bless nuclear submarines but heaven forbid that they would ever want to bless same sex couples. They would advocate that ministers should be one with the people but insist that they wear 18<sup>th</sup> century costumes on Sunday mornings. Sadly we are trying to use antiquated ideas to minister to 21<sup>st</sup> century people. And it doesn’t work – unless we are happy to live in a time warp.</p>
<p>Surely the task of any Church leader is not to tell people WHAT to think, (or even what to believe) but to encourage people to think critically of what faith means in our world today and how it should be applied. We are called to be seekers of Truth NOT possessors of Truth. Doers of deeds and not simply thinkers of Deeds. Which brings me to our reading from the Gospel of Luke.</p>
<p>The followers of Jesus are grouped together no doubt mulling over the consequences of their fallen leader and the possible repercussions of being associated with him, when suddenly like a magic genie popping out of a bottle, Jesus appeared before them; and we read that the disciples were startled and frightened and who wouldn’t be? But once they realize that this is not a ghost or a figment of their imaginations – that this is their friend who stands amongst them their fear turns to joy (although if it were me I would still be feeling pretty scared). And then we have a lovely comely scene – ‘I’m starving’, said Jesus. ‘Have you anything to eat?’</p>
<p>They did and once he had dined and relaxed and caught up with the news we read that he opened their mind to understand the scriptures. If only he could do that today.</p>
<p>The people of Jesus’ day had always wanted a, “Tell us simply and clearly,” kind of faith.</p>
<p>There have been many who have been interested in Jesus and what he had to say for thousands of years. He was often asked by the Jewish authorities and the curious, ‘Don’t keep us in suspense! If you are the Messiah, just tell us in words in which we can understand – a yes or no will be sufficient! If your answer suits us then we are happy to believe.’ But Jesus’ reply was always, ‘No! I’m not going to tell you plainly.’</p>
<p>If he opened the disciples’ minds to understanding the scriptures would it not be so wonderful for us if he were to come into our worship service right now, walk down the aisle, sit at the front and ask us, ‘Do you have any questions?’ If that were possible what would you ask?</p>
<p>‘Was there really an Adam and Eve and talking serpents and magical trees and an ark that survived a deluge of rain?’</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>‘Jesus, what about my friends who are good people and work hard in their community and perform charitable deeds but have no interest in the institutional Church. Are they going to go to hell just because they don’t subscribe to our faith?’</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>‘What about the big issues of our day, Jesus? The collapse of the world banks. The Middle East. Climate change – what’s your position on these matters? Keep it simple, Jesus, just tell us without being too complicated – tell us plainly!’</p>
<p>And what would your reaction be if, after putting all our questions to Jesus, he turned round and said, ‘No! I’m not going to tell you plainly!’ Would we then class Jesus as a fraud, charlatan – someone who simply doesn’t know the answers to our questions and maybe has never known the answer to the questions?</p>
<p>That was the impression the hierarchy of Jerusalem had – here was a political upstart and troublemaker – someone not to be taken seriously for when asked a straightforward question he used parables and apocryphal language in reply. And because of their frustration and annoyance at his attempt to dissuade them from their quest they became so furious they took up stones to kill him for blasphemy.</p>
<p>If Jesus were really the Son of God surely he would find a way to explain, simply and plainly, what those in authority wanted to know.</p>
<p>But he refused to do it. Actually that’s not quite true: he did say, ‘I did tell you, but you didn’t believe. You’ve seen how I’ve broken the barriers between people and God. You’ve seen how I have accepted, in God’s name, all those who you view as outcasts and miscreants and yet loved by God. You have heard me preach about God’s Kingdom and what it entails. You have seen me and you have heard me and you still don’t believe!’</p>
<p>And here’s why they didn’t want to believe: Those people had wanted to be told WHAT to believe and Jesus spelt out in two simple commandments – Love God – Love your neighbour as yourself - but that was too easy – too straightforward and it didn’t suit their thinking. And so they continued with their demands – ‘Give us the facts. Give us the truth. Make it plain and simple, and we will believe.’ And Jesus said, ‘No you won’t. Been there and done that and I’ve even got the T-shirt. I’ve taught you and shown you, and you still do not believe.’</p>
<p>The way to true belief is not by someone telling you WHAT to believe, instead it’s all about learning HOW to believe!</p>
<p>For example: How can we know if forgiveness really works unless we experiment by forgiving?</p>
<p>How can we know whether the power of acceptance really works unless we test it by accepting?</p>
<p>How can we possibly take Jesus seriously unless we strip him of the sanitized clothing that’s been placed on him throughout the centuries?</p>
<p>Jesus, as a signpost to the liberating God, proclaimed a ministry where he expects us to think for ourselves. And that’s what he shared with the disciples as recorded in Luke’s version of the gospel.</p>
<p>Which means it’s okay to ask questions, and express doubt, and probe the unknown. Christ does not tell us WHAT to think, but teaches us HOW to think.</p>
<p>I think one of the weaknesses of the Church is to preach a message where we would presume everything to be black or white – where the choices are very clear. But that was never Jesus’ intention nor desire. He had not come to teach people WHAT to think, but HOW to think – not ABOUT life, but HOW to live life! That’s why he says to us – ‘Follow me – and engage your brain in the process.’</p>
