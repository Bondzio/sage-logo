<p><italic>Opening Windows onto Hidden Lives</italic> presents a history of the USDA’s Division of Farm Population and Rural Life’s study of farm women in the early twentieth century. The authors explain that the Division was “the first unit of the federal government that was devoted to sociological research” (p. vii). While previous volumes by Julie Zimmerman and Olaf Larson explored the history of the Division in greater breadth and depth, this book focuses specifically on the surprising attention that it paid to rural women. Although women were seldom the explicit focus of study, they were nonetheless included to a degree that was unprecedented at the time, and through the research done by the Division much historical information is preserved regarding the lives of farm women. Zimmerman and Larson have gone through the monumental task of poring through the vast library of research produced by the Division in order to uncover work that discussed women’s lives and concerns, which the book makes accessible through its bibliography and reprints. <italic>Opening Windows onto Hidden Lives</italic> thus provides access to an enormous amount of previously unexplored historical data about rural women.</p>
<p>The book is split into three distinct sections, the first of which details the history of the Division itself and its study of rural life, including comprehensive descriptions of how and why its researchers studied and included rural women. The second section provides an extensive (although not exhaustive) bibliography of work produced by the Division of Farm Population and Rural Life from the years 1919—1953. The final section presents five reprints of selected Division publications that focus on rural life and women’s concerns, the most interesting and extensive being the fifth, “The Advantages of Farm Life: A Study by Correspondence and Interviews with Eight Thousand Farm Women: Digest of an Unpublished Report,” from 1924. This publication includes numerous quotations from those correspondences and interviews, providing rich firsthand descriptions of women’s own perspectives on farm life at the time.</p>
<p>The book’s first section provides a context for these reprints, and begins by describing the happy accident of women’s inclusion in the Division’s studies. Zimmerman and Larson explain that it was due in large part to the appointment of David F. Houston as Secretary of Agriculture in 1913. Houston had an interest in social research, and believed strongly in the holistic nature of farming and the lack of clear distinctions between farm life and home life. He thus pushed for greater study of rural farm life, and including women and the home as integral parts of the farm. The authors go into great detail describing the development of the Division out of Houston’s work, and its growing importance within the USDA. The Division, the authors argue, was pivotal in the development of the field of rural sociology (p. 25).</p>
<p>Subsequent chapters in this section describe the popular perspectives on women’s roles in society at the time, and the ways in which competing points of view influenced the Division’s study of women as embedded in rural farm life. Although the holistic stance of Houston and the Division eventually became marginalized in favor of the home economics approach that attempted to reinforce patriarchal relations and separate spheres, the Division attempted to forge a middle ground between these perspectives, studying women both as social actors and as workers within the home. Nonetheless, women were never studied on their own by the Division, but always as part of the whole of rural life. Zimmerman and Larson point out that this also means that despite the quantity of data collected on women, they “were also never critically examined” (p. 65).</p>
<p>This section of the book ends with the suggestion that future researchers might be able to use the Division’s work to examine critically the lives of rural women. In the following two sections of the book they present selections from the data for readers to peruse. The bibliography makes it clear what an enormous wealth of information exists due to the efforts of the Division, while the selected reprints give the reader vivid examples of the varied data that some of these reports contain.</p>
<p>Of particular interest in this final section was the degree to which the women’s own accounts seemed to contradict the Division’s interpretations as reported in the book’s first section. While those earlier chapters noted the Division’s discussions of the hardships of rural life and the degree to which farm women lacked modern amenities of the time period, the women themselves seemed repeatedly to state the opposite. They described with pride the appliances and improvements that made their work lives easier, as well as the unique rewards of rural life, including the rural environment, the sense of community they experienced, and the collective activities that structured their social lives. This too, contrasted with the Division’s interpretation, which seemed to focus instead on the social isolation of rural life.</p>
<p>Discrepancies like these are interesting in and of themselves, but it would have been helpful to see them addressed and analyzed by the authors. This is the book’s biggest weakness. While the authors do a thorough job of describing how and why women were studied by the Division, comparatively little time is spent on analysis of this study or explanation of what was learned. While it is fascinating to learn about the social and political currents that led to rural women being studied in depth by the USDA, the book would have been strengthened by a more straightforward summary of the data itself, as well as a critical analysis of the different ways in which the data was interpreted and used at the time, and a discussion of its sociological significance. Yet even without this, <italic>Opening Windows onto Hidden Lives</italic> provides an essential resource for anyone interested in the history of rural women, and of American women in general.</p>
