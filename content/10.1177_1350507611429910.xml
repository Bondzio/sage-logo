<abstract>
<p>This essay highlights the state of unawareness to which the theories held by managers are susceptible. The essay opens up the question whether the critical rationalist approach, which specifically addresses the unawareness problem in science, is indeed inadequate for organizations as commonly argued. We suggest that organizations apply fragments of the critical rationalist approach anyway, but fail to make the whole because of certain obstructers. By specifying these obstructers we theorize that the critical rationalist approach is applicable once its obstructers are addressed properly. The most fundamental obstructer is the ‘mindless derivation’, meaning the unawareness of the major premise in managers’ theories, by which it cannot be critically discussed and consequently the theories cannot be systematically falsified. We draw an organizational theoretical system as a basis for systematic detection of unawareness and exercise it in a real illustrative case.</p>

<title>Introducing the state of unawareness</title>
<p>Human beings hold a theory of the world that guides their actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507611429910">Argyris, 1976a</xref>); managers draw upon their theories when they craft their strategies: ‘Strategies are operationalizations of theories of the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350507611429910">Hedberg and Jonsson, 1977</xref>: 90). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1350507611429910">Mintzberg (1987</xref>: 16) the strategy <italic>embodies</italic> the theory: ‘<italic>strategy is a perspective</italic>, its content consisting […] of an ingrained way of perceiving the world’ (italics in original). We define such management theories as the demarcation of a set of forces that affect the attainment of the subject’s ultimate goals, the characterization of these forces and the explanation of their behavior, including interrelationships.</p>
<p>The functions and the need for a theory are debated vehemently in the literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1350507611429910">Thomas (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1350507611429910">1999</xref>) contrasts theory with practice, and holds the scientific preoccupation with theory as an impediment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1350507611429910">Rajagopalan (1998)</xref> sees theories everywhere, practice included, since they address an inevitable human need. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350507611429910">Brown (1976)</xref> argues that a theory, since it is a metaphor, is easier to grasp than real representation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1350507611429910">Popper (2002)</xref>, whose doctrine underlies this essay, sides with the last two. Our view and definition postulate both stances: on one hand, we ascribe theories to managers, who are distinct practitioners; we hold that these theories are unavoidable and that they control the observation and perception of the world. On the other hand the theory could be a source of bias and a fortress of conservatism.</p>
<p>The very notion of ‘theory’ implies that the theory may be false. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350507611429910">Hedberg (1981</xref>: 11) notes: ‘Individuals in organizations sometimes form their beliefs on misinterpretations of cause-effect relationships […] This gives room for theories of action—myths—with low or no validity to the concerned organization’. One possible source of invalidity is the unwarranted omission of relevant forces from the theory, which practically means the complete ignorance of those forces:
<disp-quote>
<p>the environment is put there by the actors within the organization and by no one else. This reasserts the argument that the environment is a phenomenon tied to processes of attention, and that unless something is attended to it doesn’t exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1350507611429910">Weick, 1969</xref>: 27, 28).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This false demarcation, when unconscious, we name the state of unawareness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350507611429910">Bohn (1994</xref>: 63) regards it as the lowest possible level of knowledge: ‘You do not know that a phenomenon exists or if you are aware of its existence, you have no inkling that it may be relevant to your process’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1350507611429910">Schoemaker (1995</xref>: 38) classified it as the ‘things we don’t know we don’t know’ and warns that ‘the greatest havoc is caused by [this class]’. So: unawareness applies when the theory holder does not imagine the very possibility that the theory is false, due to omitted forces. As a consequence, the state of unawareness bars the initiation of the decision-making process. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1350507611429910">Simon (1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1350507611429910">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1350507611429910">Simon et al., 1986</xref>) the decision-making process is triggered by a phase of problem recognition; alas, the state of unawareness hides the problem.</p>
<p>Based on ideas of the philosophers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1350507611429910">Russell (1903/1992</xref>: 449) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1350507611429910">Polanyi (1974</xref>: 38–40), the state of unawareness exhibits three characteristics, two logical and one cognitive: (1) the object of unawareness cannot be specified, because specification presupposes awareness; (2) the state of unawareness cannot be refuted; and (3) the acquisition of awareness is unteachable, since it is a tacit act.</p>

<sec id="section3-1350507611429910">
<title>Objective, method and structure of the essay</title>
<p>We claim that organizations can confront unawareness better when employing the critical rationalist (CR) stance, suggested by the philosopher Karl Popper, because the essence of CR is active theory testing, which is a key part of organizational learning. Alas, the common wisdom is that the critical rationalist epistemology is inadequate for management (see the section ‘Popper in organization science literature’ for further evidence on this statement); our theory claims the opposite.</p>
<p>The method we apply here is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1350507611429910">Von Krogh et al. (1994</xref>: 55) call ‘synthesis of grounded and grand theories’, which means ‘unifying languages, theoretical concepts and their interrelationships’. The ‘grand theory’ is twofold: first, Popper’s CR (elaborated in the following section); second, several established accounts of management learning. The ‘grounded theory’ is the way we reinterpret these accounts from the critical rationalist perspective (in ‘The problem’ section). Next we formalize the grounded theory in a testable form and clarify it with an illustrative case. Discussion and conclusions close the essay.</p>

<sec id="section5-1350507611429910">
<title>Why the epistemological perspective?</title>
<p>Unawareness can be studied from several perspectives, like economic (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350507611429910">Grove, 1999</xref>) or social-cultural perspectives (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1350507611429910">Yates, 1983</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350507611429910">Gardner (2006)</xref> prefers and promotes the cognitive perspective which conceptualizes ‘what people are thinking, how they are thinking, and how, when necessary, <italic>that thinking can be changed</italic> […] Conscious awareness of cognitivism is a boon when it comes to changing minds’ (pp. 42–43, 47; italics in original). The restriction of the cognitive perspective, however, is its focus on the knower. To borrow a classification used in information science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350507611429910">Dervin and Nilan, 1986</xref>), it is knower-centric; the counterpart is knowledge-centric, that emphasizes ‘some element of absolute correspondence to reality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350507611429910">Dervin and Nilan, 1986</xref>: 13), namely truth.</p>
<p>The emphasis put on truth suggests an investigation from the epistemological perspective. Epistemology means ‘the theory of knowledge, especially with regard to its methods, validity, and scope’ (Oxford dictionary). The epistemological investigation of organizations is rare, and within this the point of truth is considered secondary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350507611429910">Giroux and Taylor, 2002</xref>) or lacks consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1350507611429910">Schneider, 2007</xref>). Instead the emphasis is on knowledge as a social substance, where the question of truth is marginalized (examples are <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350507611429910">Cook and Brown, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350507611429910">Durand et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1350507611429910">Nonaka, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1350507611429910">Rowland, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1350507611429910">Von Krogh et al., 1994</xref>). Against this stance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1350507611429910">Schneider (2007</xref>: 631) rightfully calls ‘to recognize that the problem is philosophical in nature’. We accordingly turn the focus to the truth from a philosophical approach.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1350507611429910">
<title>The Kuhnian epistemological stance of organizations</title>
<p>The dominant epistemological stance in the literature on organizations is the Kuhnian (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350507611429910">Huff et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1350507611429910">Lyles and Schwenk, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1350507611429910">Weick, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350507611429910">Kuhn (1970a)</xref> argues that a matured scientific domain rests upon a paradigm, i.e. agreed-upon postulates. The domain knowledge progresses in revolutions, where each revolution ‘ousts’ the prevailing paradigm and ‘coronates’ a new one. As long as a paradigm prevails it defines the legitimate questions—‘puzzles’—to which the scientists should find better solutions. The keywords in Kuhn’s theory are the paradigm and the puzzle; the latter conveys the literal meaning of a predefined problem. Another cornerstone is the scientific community that institutionalizes the paradigm as the truth reference. The notion of socially-related truth is known as conventionalism (and has its roots in classical Lockean empiricism; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350507611429910">Meyers, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A typical adoption of the Kuhnian conceptualization in the organizational context reads as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>The concept of dominant logic also derives direct support from Kuhn’s work on scientific paradigms. […] In a sense, Kuhn’s ‘paradigm’ is simply a way of <italic>defining and managing the world and a basis for action in that world.</italic> […] The analogy from science to a business firm is simple and direct. The dominant paradigm and the dominant logic are conceptually similar but employed in different fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1350507611429910">Prahalad and Bettis, 1986</xref>: 492; italics in original).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This adherence is quite paradoxical since Kuhn draws a clear line between science and practice, based on the void of a paradigm in the latter. Thus, he asserts, practice can at best be ‘plausible’ but not truthful: ‘Though they [practitioners] had rules to apply, they had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350507611429910">Kuhn, 1970b</xref>: 9). The message conveyed by Kuhn and followed by the management literature is that unawareness is the way of life; it is not the responsibility of the individual scientist to reconsider the boundaries of the paradigm or to undermine the predefined questions. The revolution ‘happens’, not initiated (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350507611429910">Huff et al., 2000</xref>); in short, the unawareness is both inevitable and excused. Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350507611429910">Kuhn (1970b)</xref> posits himself as the antithesis of Popper, we are turning to review the latter.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1350507611429910">
<title>The Popperian epistemological stance</title>
<p>Karl Popper (1902–1994), the founder of Critical Rationalism, contemplated his ideas first in the 1930s. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350507611429910">Freudenthal (1977)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1350507611429910">Thornton (2006)</xref> hold that Popper should be read in the context of the Zeitgeist, namely that of ‘logical positivism’ led by the Vienna Circle. The Vienna Circle (and the analytic philosophy in general) denied ideas of metaphysics that populated the philosophical thinking beforehand. They distinguished meaningful statements as those that are empirically verifiable—what became the ‘principle of verifiability’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350507611429910">Freudenthal, 1977</xref>).</p>
<p>Popper defies the epistemology of verification and contrarily suggests a methodology for falsification; for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507611429910">Popper (1961a</xref>: 49) epistemology and methodology mean the same. Verification is unachievable, Popper argues, since it is endlessly circular. The key principle he establishes is that a theory holds unless proved otherwise; hence the core of science is about refuting theories rather than confirming them. Popper grounds his method on four pillars:</p>
<sec id="section8-1350507611429910">
<title>The primacy of deductive logic</title>
<p>‘The problem of induction’ is for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507611429910">Popper (1961a</xref>: 27) the point of departure. His entire doctrine rests upon the unequivocal deductive logic:
<disp-quote>
<p>Here too the procedure of testing turns out to be deductive… certain singular statements—which we may call ‘predictions’—are deduced from the theory… if the conclusions [i.e. ‘predictions’] have been <italic>falsified</italic>, then their falsification also falsifies the theory from which they were logically deduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507611429910">Popper, 1961a</xref>: 33; italics in original).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1350507611429910">
<title>The elimination of psychologism</title>
<p>The progress of scientific knowledge follows two phases: discovery and justification. In the former a theory emerges, in the latter its truth is warranted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350507611429910">Freudenthal, 1977</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507611429910">Popper (1961a</xref>: 31) strictly states his exclusive interest in justification: ‘I shall distinguish sharply between the process of conceiving a new idea, and the methods and results of examining it logically’. The exclusive use of (deductive) logic is for Popper the ultimate vaccine against psychologism.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1350507611429910">
<title>The quest for active criticism</title>
<p>The elimination of psychologism does not imply that Popper expects the scientist to be unbiased or purely rational upon discovery. Just the opposite is true: it is exactly because psychological ‘contamination’ is inevitable that the quest for active and intentional criticism is so material. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507611429910">Popper (1961a)</xref> expects the scientist to actively test, criticize and revise her theory if necessary: ‘we shall take the greatest interest in the falsifying experiment’ (p. 80). Discovery, according to Popper, may be based on any source, scientific or not, explicit or implicit, whereas justification requires an explicit application of logic and scientific methods.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1350507611429910">
<title>The problem-solving orientation</title>
<p>‘It [science] begins when a myth [or theory] is challenged and breaks down—that is, when some of our expectations are disappointed … <italic>science begins with problems</italic>, practical problems or theoretical problems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1350507611429910">Popper, 1994</xref>: 95; italics in original). Popper defines the scientist as primarily a problem solver, and repels the popular notion that science starts from observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1350507611429910">Popper, 1994</xref>). Concerning the ‘solving’ side he writes: ‘there is only one way to learn to understand a serious problem… And this is to try to solve it, and to fail’ (p. 99). This ‘only way’ to solve a problem is to hypothesize a solution (i.e. a new theory), to test it critically and to learn from the discovered mistakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1350507611429910">Popper, 1994</xref>: 159).</p>
<p>A scientific theory, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507611429910">Popper (1961a</xref>: 59), aims at ‘rationalizing, explaining and mastering the world’. The aim of prediction is intentionally excluded since for Popper prediction is not a scientific end in itself but only a device for falsification. A genuine scientific theory expresses a natural law and constitutes a strict universal statement, namely claims truth for the entire population to which it refers (e.g. E=MC<sup>2</sup>). A natural law is actually prohibitive—it excludes certain existential statements; for instance, the law ‘all A’s are B’s’ proscribes any of ‘there is an A that is not-B’. This distinction allows the interplay which is the kernel of falsification:
<disp-quote>
<p>In this formulation we see that natural laws might be compared to ‘proscriptions’ or ‘prohibitions’. They do not assert that something exists or is the case; they deny it. They insist on the non-existence of certain things or states of affairs, proscribing or prohibiting, as it were, these things or states of affairs: they rule them out. And it is precisely because they do this that they are <italic>falsifiable.</italic> If we accept as true one singular statement which, as it were, infringes the prohibition by asserting the existence of a thing (or the occurrence of an event) ruled out by the law, then the law is refuted […] Strictly existential statements, by contrast, cannot be falsified. No singular statement (that is to say, no ‘basic statement’, no statement of an observed event) can contradict the existential statement, ‘There are white ravens’. Only a universal statement could do this. On the basis of the criterion of demarcation here adopted I shall therefore have to treat strictly existential statements as non-empirical or ‘metaphysical’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507611429910">Popper, 1961a</xref>: 69; italics in original).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hence falsification requires both kinds of statements, and the way it works is as follows: ‘whenever it is found that something exists here or there, a strictly existential statement may thereby be verified, or a universal one falsified’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507611429910">Popper, 1961a</xref>: 70). Note that the falsifying statement can be produced by either assigning initial conditions to a universal statement or via prohibition.</p>
<p>These two kinds of statements are the building blocks of a theoretical system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350507611429910">Figure 1</xref>), a construct that exhibits two additional key concepts: hierarchy and derivation. A theoretical system consists of a hierarchy of statements that are derived from one another in a diminishing universality. At the top there are the hypothesized axioms (the term does not imply mandatory truth, just that it allows all the lower statements to be logically deducible), and at the bottom—singular statements. Each level is falsifiable by the level underneath, which means that a singular statement can still be regarded as a hypothesis (or an ‘axiom’) for a sub-system as long as it stands a further derivation. The implication of a ‘successful’ falsification in a low level is not necessarily decisive, as it may apply to just a part of the system.</p>

<sec id="section12-1350507611429910">
<title>Popper in the organization science literature</title>
<p>The organization science literature often identifies Popper as a positivist; accordingly, his doctrine is assumed to incorporate two qualities of positivism: first, ‘One of the principal difficulties with the positivist vantage point is that we are forced to treat processes as special cases of models built from static entities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1350507611429910">Spender, 1998</xref>: 234). Indeed, each strategic environment is a ‘special case’, but the ‘entities’ of which it is assembled in every way dynamic.</p>
<p>Second, the positivist view assumes independent observation, which is:
<disp-quote>
<p>observation detached from the values and idiosyncrasies of the observer. This does not mean observation <italic>without the presence</italic> of an observer: it simply means observation that is judged by scientists to be independent of the peculiarities of any particular individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1350507611429910">Midgley, 2008</xref>: 56; italics in original).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Therefore, the observer ‘is expected to preserve his distance from experimental phenomena, keeping his biases and interests from affecting the object of study’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1350507611429910">Schön, 1983</xref>: 144).</p>
<p>Both premises are negated. The organization and the theorized environment are inseparably intertwined; they affect one another cyclically in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1350507611429910">Weick (1969)</xref> calls ‘enactment’. Further, the environment is in a continuous flux—either as a response to the organization’s ‘observation’ or independently. Therefore the observation is actually an intervention, which ‘could create a change, thereby making it possible to say that the observation is a result of the intervention rather than the intrinsic characteristics of the phenomenon being observed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1350507611429910">Midgley, 2008</xref>: 56). The intervention in the already dynamic environment makes each situation idiosyncratic rather than derivable from a universal theory; so nothing like the latter can be falsified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1350507611429910">Majone, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1350507611429910">Schön, 1983</xref>). Therefore ‘we do not have adequate theory to apply to problems in any policy area […] it [the theory] is typically insufficiently precise for application to a policy process’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1350507611429910">Lindblom, 1959</xref>: 87).</p>
<p>Following this line of reasoning, the bottom line is that CR is inadequate for the organizational circumstances. Both reasons are interwoven: (1) the ‘theory’ of the environment is too singular to be falsified and (2) the theorizing organization is anything but impartial. We label this double-edge (concerning the environment and the organization) rejection the <italic>inadequacy argument</italic>.</p>
<p>As a summary of the four themes discussed thus far, namely unawareness, management, Popper and Kuhn, the main point is that Kuhn explains (and excuses) unawareness whilst Popper confronts it. From the Kuhnian viewpoint the organizational unawareness is an inescapable disease. The counter Popperian thesis is regarded as inadequate in the managerial context, which leaves the unawareness problem unsolved. Popper centers on the problem recognition, and his cyclical scientific process is a sheer response to the unawareness problem.</p>

<title>The problem: Falsification obstruction</title>
<p>In this section we suggest a competing theory to the <italic>inadequacy argument</italic>. We demonstrate that in fact organizations employ fragments of the Popperian method, though implicitly. The competing theory claims that Popper’s method is not inadequate but obstructed. This claim builds on perusing established theories of organizational learning from a critical rationalist viewpoint and extracting from each both the Popperian elements and against them the obstructers.</p>

<title>The means-ends construct and bounded rationality</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350507611429910">March and Simon (1993)</xref>, organizations are goal-oriented systems. The end goal is attained by means. Because of complexity, the means are distributed across the various organizational functions, and each of them is assigned a sub-goal. Thus we get a hierarchy of goals and sub-goals, or a means-ends chain. The derivation of sub-goals from higher goals is defined as means-ends analysis, from which an action program emerges. The alignment of means to ends reflects the assumption that those means would yield the desired ends; however, the rigor of this assumption varies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350507611429910">March and Simon (1993</xref>: 177) distinguish between operational and non-operational criteria, where the means-to-ends are positively relatable in the former but not so in the latter. The nonoperational criteria plague the top of the means-ends hierarchy, so that the sequence of deductive derivation is fragmented: ‘The goals at the higher levels of this hierarchy are not, however, operational’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350507611429910">March and Simon, 1993</xref>: 216). As a consequence the refutation process is broken: ‘the choice of explanation is arbitrary in the logical sense’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350507611429910">Rittel and Webber, 1973</xref>: 166). This syndrome is known as ‘causal ambiguity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1350507611429910">King, 2007</xref>), which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350507611429910">Lippman and Rumelt (1982</xref>: 421) define as ‘the ambiguity surrounding the linkage between action and performance’.</p>
<p>In short, the means-ends construct is a process of deductive derivation, where the hypothesized appropriateness of the means for the ends is tested upon action. However, the sequence of deductive derivation is fragmented at the top level. The means-ends construct reflects three Popperian themes: the identification of cause with action, the idea of testing, and the process of sequential deductive derivation (applied via the vehicle of prohibition).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507611429910">Argyris (1976a</xref>: 7) notes that ‘as with any complex body of knowledge […] Some theories-in-use have a hierarchical structure’. The hierarchy refers to either the if-then statements or the assumptions. Regarding the first, the hierarchy concerns an up-scaling generalization of occurrences to which the theory applies. As for assumptions, the stratification spans two dimensions—depth and width. The depth indicates the universality of an assumption that stipulates the theory, up to what Popper calls ‘universal statement’. The width suggests that a particular assumption is shared across several theories and sustains their respective actions. Allegedly a theory-of-action may be confirmed like any other applied theory—based on the specification of the situation, the action and the expected result. Yet the testing of a theory-of-action faces two unique difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507611429910">Argyris, 1976a</xref>), because of the normativeness embedded in the theory:</p>
<list id="list2-1350507611429910" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Whilst it is easy to test if-then statements via deductive logic, the governing values are taken for granted.

This difficulty embodies the second portion of the inadequacy argument mentioned above (see section above ‘Popper in the organization science literature’).</p></list-item></list>
<p>In short, the theory-of-action maintains two principles: first, it is by and large a theory, and as such should be tested (and indeed it is); second, the testing is restricted by both the higher values’ axiomatic nature and the bias associated with the normativeness.</p>

<disp-quote>
<p>The process [of issue diagnosis] is characterized by both deductive and inductive modes of thinking. […] A deductive mode of thinking begins with a set of explicit assumptions from which conclusions flow as logical extensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350507611429910">Dutton et al., 1983</xref>: 312, 313).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The deduction process employs what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507611429910">Popper (1961a)</xref> calls the ‘initial conditions’ course: ‘the deductive element in SID translates an individual’s initial assumptions into specific judgements or predictions about an issue’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350507611429910">Dutton et al., 1983</xref>: 313). Alas, the initial conditions may be projected on a flimsy theory: ‘deriving cause-effect relationships [theory] from conceptual categories is rarely, if ever, completely justified by the available evidence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350507611429910">Dutton et al., 1983</xref>: 313). The deductive exercise described above generates scenarios, a popular management technique. But why is the underlying theory flimsy? Because:
<disp-quote>
<p>Organizations use small samples of specific historical events to construct theories about events […] More generally, many modern techniques of planning in organizations involve the simulation of hypothetical future scenarios … The logic is simple: small pieces of experience are used to construct a theory of history from which a variety of unrealized, but possible, additional scenarios are generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1350507611429910">March et al., 1996</xref>: 7).</p>

<title>The theory of incomplete organizational learning cycles</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350507611429910">Hedberg (1981)</xref> portrays two modes of organizational learning: one containing a complete learning cycle, another with an incomplete cycle. A ‘learning cycle’ is a continuous feedback loop between the environment (the stimulus) and the organization (that responds by action) by which the organization constructs its theory-of-action. The complete cycle is an endless phase of discovery during which the organization absorbs signals from the changing environment and instantly adjusts its theory; hence the theory is allegedly correct at any time. However, this is an unachievable ideal; more often the theory is a ‘myth’ that crashes against falsifying feedback from the environment: ‘A ruling myth is a theory that generates strategies and actions. Strategies are hypotheses, and actions test these hypotheses, verifying or falsifying the theory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350507611429910">Hedberg, 1981</xref>: 12).</p>
<p>This sounds like a scientific method, except that the falsification is forced upon the organization rather than deliberated. Further, the unintended and uncontrolled justification is invalid, since ‘direct empirical falsification does not work when learning cycles are incomplete’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350507611429910">Hedberg, 1981</xref>: 12); Hedberg may well refer here to either the causal ambiguity or the normative-led biases that we mentioned earlier.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1350507611429910">
<title>Theory of management control</title>
<p>Control to planning in organizations is like justification to discovery in science: ‘After strategies are set and plans are made, management’s primary task is to take steps to ensure that these plans are carried out, or, if conditions warrant, that the plans are modified’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350507611429910">Merchant, 1982</xref>: 43). The classic and most fundamental form of control is known as feedback (or results). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1350507611429910">Simons (1995</xref>: 59) introduces the concept as follows: ‘These feedback systems, which are the backbone of traditional management control, are designed to ensure predictable goal achievement. […] to monitor organizational outcomes and correct deviations from preset standards of performance’.</p>
<p>The feedback control is over the ends, or the goals, where the ultimate goals are indicated by the results of their sub-goals. The phrasing used by Simons bears a clear flavor of falsification: ‘One way to uncover these variables [the sub-goals] is to imagine that a strategy failed and then ask what factors would be identified as causes for this failure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1350507611429910">Simons, 1995</xref>: 63).</p>
<p>The pros of the results control are operationality, clarity and logical deducibility; but there are cons: it does not dissipate the causal ambiguity associated with the high-level goals, and the results may appear too late. For the sake of compensation the control system is extended to include another component that (in contrast to the feedback notion) is called feed-forward control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350507611429910">Durden, 2001</xref>). This control is aimed at discovering environmental changes that may have future strategic implications, without a means of validation.</p>
<p>The control system reflects some concepts that we mentioned earlier: the causal ambiguity and the complete-incomplete learning. As for the causal ambiguity, the assumed remedy is short since the feedback and the feed-forward controls are disintegrated. When projected on Hedberg’s ideas the control looks quite paradoxical, since the incomplete learning (which the feedback control embodies) is considered prime whilst the complete learning (i.e. the feed-forward) is a means of compensation.</p>

<title>The ‘falsification obstructers’ theory</title>
<p>The second section of this article sketched the Popperian doctrine; the last section surfaced implicit Popperian elements in organizational theories. The present section projects the organizational theories on the Popperian structure. The first step is to establish a common language across the various conceptualizations of theories. There are three types of theory: descriptive, normative and design. The descriptive theory explains ‘why it is’, the normative theory claims in favor of ‘how it should be’, and the design theory bridges the gap by answering ‘how to attain the desired (normative) goal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1350507611429910">Van Aken, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1350507611429910">Walls et al., 1992</xref>: 41). By these definitions, the myth, the means-ends construct, and the theory-of-action (save the values) are design theories; the values are the normative theory; and the implicit theory from which the scenarios are derived is descriptive. According to the theory-of-action, the normative part subordinates the design theory.</p>
<p>Popper’s doctrine is equally applicable for descriptive and design theories (which he terms ‘technological form’). Popper regards the design theory as the mirror image of the descriptive theory: ‘The negative [i.e. the other side of the coin] formulation of empirical laws is described as their technological form’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350507611429910">Faludi, 1983</xref>: 273). Popper’s vocabulary resembles the means-ends concept:
<disp-quote>
<p>every natural law can be expressed by asserting that such and such a thing cannot happen; […] This way of formulating natural laws is one which makes their technological significance obvious and it may therefore be called the ‘technological form’ of a natural law. […] …we see at once that it may well be expressed by sentences of the form: ‘You cannot achieve such and such results’, or perhaps, ‘You cannot achieve such and such ends without such and such concomitant effects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350507611429910">Popper, 1961b</xref>: 61).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Especially when Popper concerns the testing procedure of a theory, the equivalence between the descriptive and the design theories is conspicuous:
<disp-quote>
<p>The purpose of this last kind of test is to find out how far the new consequences of the theory […] stand up to the demands of practice, whether raised by purely scientific experiments, or by practical technological applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507611429910">Popper, 1961a</xref>: 33).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, Popper’s doctrine is not applicable for normative theories. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507611429910">Argyris (1976a)</xref> notes, a normative theory respects deductive logic only within its boundaries; that is, the values should be consistent with one another. But the normative theory is not falsifiable by derivatives. The Popperian exclusion is understandable, since normative theories are foreign to the natural sciences (how weird it could be if a physicist suggested changing the light speed). For that reason <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1350507611429910">Popper (1994)</xref> is so anxious to eradicate any normativeness from the theory as a testing precondition, even when the theory deals with human beings: ‘I propose to treat both Richard’s [a typical human being] aims and Richard’s knowledge not as psychological facts, to be ascertained by psychological methods, but as <italic>elements of the objective social situation</italic>’ (p. 167; italics in original).</p>
<p>In organizations, all the three kinds of theory exist: there is a descriptive theory, represented by the source for scenarios derivation; there is a design theory, represented by the myth, the means-ends construct and the theory-of-action (save the values); and there is the normative theory within the theory-of-action. All the three constitute the organization’s theoretical system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350507611429910">Figure 2</xref>), an adaptation of the Popperian origin which we presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350507611429910">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1350507611429910-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<p>We describe the system from top to bottom (derivation-bound) and next from the bottom up (falsification-bound). On the upper-hand side there are the two governing theories: normative and descriptive. The normative theory (left) contains values and ultimate goals, according to the theory-of-action. The ultimate goals drive the high-level goals. At the same level there is the descriptive theory (consisting of numerical universal statements in Popper’s jargon), with which two sub-systems are associated. On the right-hand side, via syllogistic derivation, the assignment of initial conditions to the theory results with scenarios (singular predictions). To the left, the design theory mirrors (implicitly) the descriptive theory, by prohibition. The design theory constitutes the means-ends analysis, in which the high-level goals are the means aimed at attaining the ultimate goals and so on downward (singular statements). The dotted line between the scenarios and the design theory signifies that from the repertoire of means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350507611429910">Hedberg, 1981</xref>) a certain set is selected to accord with the actual scenario. At the bottom, the results and the environment (basic statements, the ‘real world’) are interwoven, to signify the blurred border between them that the enactment renders.</p>
<p>Now the falsification: ideally, there would have been two routes of falsification: from the results to the mirrored design/descriptive theory (hereinafter: left) and from the environment, through the scenarios, to the descriptive theory (right). By definition, no route returns to the normative theory because of the logical irrefutability. However, the ideal is hampered by further falsification obstructions. The left route is obstructed by causal ambiguity, which splits the design theory at the operationality line. The right route is obstructed twice. The mental irrefutability affects this part of the environment that is subject to enactment (whilst the farther environment bypasses the obstructer). The rationale for placing this obstructer on the right route is that cues from the environment are subject to interpretation and manipulation more than the relatively hard data that the results control provides. Higher on this route, the mindless derivation under which the scenarios were deduced is now operating in the reverse direction: it conceals the theory from which the route originated.</p>
<p>The accumulated result is that both potential routes of falsification are obstructed; sooner or later they hit a ceiling and draw back. Borrowing Popper’s syllogistic articulation, we illustrate the problem as the detachment of the major premise: because of the mindless derivation or the causal ambiguity, the upward falsification falls into a ‘black hole’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1350507611429910">Johnson-Laird (1983</xref>: 23, 24) specifies the problem in a cognitive manner: human beings normally think through syllogisms, but often they are unaware of that mode and especially tend to ignore the major premise. Notably <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350507611429910">Popper (1961b</xref>: 124) establishes his criticism against the ‘poverty of historicism’ on this very detachment: that the historical trend (the ‘initial condition’) is accounted without a universal law as a reference.</p>

<title>The theories</title>
<p>The descriptive theory comprises three types of statements. The first discloses the conceptual structure; for instance, the subcategories in the customers’ market: ‘The market consists of the Telco’s [telecommunication providers] and the cables companies’. The second reflects the concept attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350507611429910">Bruner et al., 1956</xref>), i.e. attribution: ‘Video is a psychological need’. The third relates the concepts by causality: ‘The product’s decline is influenced by both customers and new technology’. Note that each of the three is phrased as a universal law and stands for a major premise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350507611429910">Bruner, 1990</xref> observes that causal laws are articulated in a timeless sentence, as exemplified here).</p>
<p>The impact of the scenarios on the high-level goals was remarkable. Examples are: ‘What are the competitors doing and which share of the market each is taking? This will determine my choice’; or: ‘First we look at the market and try to understand its trends, and then we look inside and check what we can offer’. Another example: ‘Any change in the market trends will be critical for us. We still don’t know whether to enter the market or not’.</p>

<title>Obstructers</title>
<p>The normative theory is vicariously indicated by the leading values, e.g. ‘To lead the market’, ‘To grow’, ‘To earn money’, which are values in themselves and thus logically irrefutable. Mindless derivation, mental irrefutability and causal ambiguity at IND are illustrated below.</p>
<p>The prime indication of mindlessness is the unawareness of the very existence of scenarios. On the one hand scenarios are well discernible in the background; on the other hand the ‘espoused theory’ is in denial: ‘We didn’t use scenarios during the strategic thinking’, and ‘I definitely would not consider the method of scenarios’. Another sign of mindlessness is the scenarios’ fragmentation. Almost each driving force generates a stand-alone scenario, isolated from the other forces. For example, the force ‘standardization’ yielded two possible courses: either standard A or standard B will prevail; the force ‘customers’ was also bipolar: ‘The Telco’s crisis posits two alternative courses: one is that they will go bankrupt and be nationalized, the other that they will be forced to find new revenues’. No scenario analyzed the integration of these forces, let alone their mutual influences.</p>
<p>Four facets manifested mental irrefutability:</p>
<list id="list5-1350507611429910" list-type="order"><list-item><p>First, the commitment to previous predictions upon which the strategy had been drawn; once the prediction went awry, they tried to fabricate the reality in order to regain fit.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Second, the availability bias, i.e. the misled judgement of likelihood according to the availability of data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1350507611429910">Nisbett and Ross, 1980</xref>: 18). The bias imbibed from two sources: one, the reliance on existing customers whose area of interest are predefined (by being customers; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350507611429910">Christensen, 1997b</xref>); second, the dedication of special task forces to specific issues, themselves the result of prior theorizing.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Third, the <italic>self-sealing</italic> phenomenon: the environmental scanning is subordinated to the production capacity. For instance, one interviewee declared that he would not look for new technologies unless he was prepared to absorb them.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The fourth and last facet is low esteem of the testing capability; when asked about an attribute contained in the theory (that the market is price-sensitive), the interviewee answered: ‘We assume that the same attribute will hold in the future. Anyway I don’t check it but retroactively’.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Causal ambiguity, the third obstructer to CR theorizing, is what we titled ‘the detachment of the major premise’, as echoed in the following words of an interviewee: ‘the distance between understanding the market [i.e. the descriptive theory] and transforming this understanding to a product [i.e. design theory] is still long’. The problem here is simply the implicitness of the logical basis required for making sense. For example, the statement ‘Only in a niche market a firm of our size can lead’ is a key in IND’s strategy; this is, in syllogistic terms, the conclusion. The minor premise is probably ‘we are a small company’. But what is the major premise, the very target of criticism? Nowhere is the major premise explicated, let alone tested. This absence can explain the ambiguity that the managers faced once the results clashed with the conclusions: ‘We are not alone in the market, so if our product is declined the reason may be that a competitor offered a better or a cheaper product’. Yet the managers stick with the left-hand side falsification route despite the recognized limitations: ‘The best indicator, although too late, is how the product is accepted in the market’.</p>

<title>Conclusions and discussion</title>
<sec id="section25-1350507611429910">
<title>Theoretical validity</title>
<p>The purpose of this essay was to consider the applicability of the CR approach in order to confront the unawareness problem in managerial theorizing. The conclusion is apparently corroborative: the fragments from various accounts of organizational learning compose a coherent theoretical system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350507611429910">Figure 2</xref>), in line with the critical rationalist framework. The model suggests that the right route, which employs the scenarios derivation, enables CR. The main point is that this route does not share the weaknesses imputed to the left route, weaknesses that underlie the inadequacy argument.</p>
<p>Recall that the inadequacy argument denies the applicability of CR on a double basis: first, that every strategic situation is unique whilst CR is restrictively supposed by its opponents to target only universal laws; second, since the theory is tested through organizational action, i.e. intervention in the environment, one cannot draw the line between the tester and the tested. How does the right route of falsification address these allegations?</p>
<p>As for the first, the inadequacy argument is only partly right: most probably there are no universal laws in management, but at the same time the CR method can do without it. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1350507611429910">Popper (1994)</xref> acknowledges that there are no real universal laws in social science, and therefore adjusts the method to fit with their absence. The adjusted method does not address a universal law but rather compares competitive models (‘typical events’) for singling out the better one. Yet in order to comply with the method a fictitious universal law is assumed, flexible enough to resist the chance of refutation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1350507611429910">Popper (1994)</xref> uses rationality (about which further discussion follows). Note that the methodological deviation is quite moderate since the falsification of a universal law is not the sole objective even in the natural sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507611429910">Popper, 1961a</xref>): the theoretical system can be used to negate a sub-theory that is derived from a non-universal law. The substitution of a fiction is by all means better than assigning a law-like status to a specific condition, which underlies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350507611429910">Popper’s (1961b)</xref> criticism of historicism. Since a similar mistake is made by executives upon scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350507611429910">Dutton et al., 1983</xref>), the explication of the ‘law’ is only for the better.</p>
<p>The second opposition to CR concerns the inseparability between the organization as the theorizer and the theorized environment. The heart of the problem, according to the inadequacy argument, is that the testing mechanism is the organization’s actions, so that: (1) the observation changes the observed; (2) the commitment to the action entails a load of judgement biases. Note, on the theoretical system, that both defects affect the left route: the former straightforwardly, the latter through the exposure to the normative influence; at the same time the right route (scenarios) is free of both burdens. In other words, the right route is an option that the CR opponents ignored. Anyway, to require strict compliance with universal laws or complete emotional non-engagement is unrealistic even in the natural science. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350507611429910">Popper (1961b)</xref> notes that in physics exact predictions are limited to basic and simple phenomena in laboratories, but not to real situations (forest fire, for instance). He (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507611429910">Popper, 1961a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1350507611429910">1976a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1350507611429910">1976b</xref>) also denies the myth of the objective scientist, noting that only the scientific method is objective. Sure the management science cannot expect to exceed this standard.</p>
<p>Even if—as we believe—the inadequacy argument is fairly addressed, the application of CR can be further challenged. One may argue: above all, the purpose of CR is to gain knowledge, whilst the essence of the human science is to reach understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350507611429910">Gadamer, 1988</xref>); if so, the adoption is misguided in the first place. Gadamer argues that scientific knowledge is obtainable through a neutral observation language, whilst understanding depends on language that is highly contextual. Hence the methods for understanding are substantially different from methods for acquiring knowledge, as applied in the natural sciences. Ironically, Popper would agree with Gadamer, although from a different angle; because they both reject the inductive approach in science. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507611429910">Popper (1961a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1350507611429910">1976a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1350507611429910">1976b</xref>) does not refrain from any effort to convince that true science is deductive. He also negates the idea that science begins with observation, and instead states that science begins with problems. The deductive approach prevents the risk of misunderstanding from which Gadamer is concerned, because CR is about criticizing understanding rather than achieving it.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1350507611429910">Popper (1976a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1350507611429910">1994</xref>) does not limit CR to the natural sciences; just the opposite. He is very clear about his awareness of the differences between the sciences, and here he demonstrates another interface to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507611429910">Gadamer (1975)</xref>: the recognition of goals as causing factors. Although they differ by how goals are treated, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1350507611429910">Popper (1994)</xref> definitely respects the impact that goals have on human behavior.</p>
<p>We return now to the point of rationality. Beyond a universal law, as we mentioned earlier, the rationality concept sustains the idea of the theoretical system. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350507611429910">Figure 2</xref> presents a coherent link between the goals (included in the normative theory), the action required to attain them (based on the design theory), and the ‘truth base’ of the design (supplied by the descriptive theory). The case that one acts in accordance with all the three theories is the meaning of rationality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350507611429910">Hempel, 1962</xref>: 16):
<disp-quote>
<p>a hypothesis about an agent’s objectives can be taken to imply the occurrence of specific overt action only when conjoined with appropriate hypotheses about his beliefs; and vice versa. Hence, strictly speaking, an examination of an agent’s behavior cannot serve to test assumptions about his beliefs or about his objectives separately, but only in suitable pairs, as it were; or briefly, belief attributions and goat attributions are epistemically interdependent.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even though <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350507611429910">Popper (1961b)</xref> acknowledges that sometimes rationality could be hampered by, say, underutilization of available information (what Simon defines as ‘bounded rationality’), nevertheless, a crack in the rationality does not negate its postulation (as the major premise) since the real target of the investigation is the minor premise. So at the end the premise of rationality is shielded twice: it resists criticism, but if it were criticized it would still be useful.</p>

<title>Implications on further research</title>
<p>For now the falsification obstructers theory is a logical exercise, but the precise specification of the obstructers enables (and invites) empirical corroboration. Specifically, further research has to address the proposition that the ‘right route’, namely the testing of the derived scenarios as if they are the hypotheses, meets the qualities of CR. The hypotheses that such a research should examine accord with both pillars of the inadequacy argument, respectively:</p>
<list id="list6-1350507611429910" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The organization’s environment can be theorized in a falsifiable fashion, and the right route is capable of obtaining unequivocal falsification.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A method is conceivable that can cope with the pertaining falsification obstructers.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Both hypotheses are purposefully existential (i.e. ‘there is’ or ‘can be’) and so they are verifiable. Since they are prohibited by the inadequacy argument, their verification falsifies the inadequacy argument. Therefore in a critical rationalist manner the acceptance of both hypotheses will falsify the inadequacy argument and corroborate the falsification obstructers theory.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-1350507611429910">
<title>Implications for management learning</title>
<p>In the Popper-Kuhn debate, the management literature is clearly one-sided: it draws upon Kuhn for explanations and rejects the applicability of Popper’s method. The consequences are twofold: first, the state of unawareness is conceived of as a necessary evil; second, it is addressed cognitively. Admittedly, the cognitive treatment does not guarantee success. But the literature pays little attention to the common denominator that Popper shares with management, which is the problem-solving orientation. Much has been said in the management literature about the defects of treating assumptions or problems as given (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507611429910">Argyris, 1977</xref>a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350507611429910">Cyert et al., 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1350507611429910">Zaleznik, 2004</xref>), and Popper seems to be concerned about the very same issue. Hence the adoption of the critical rationalist stance, which we showed to be applicable, suggests a new way of dealing with old troubles.</p>
<p>What are the practical implications, or: how can managers utilize the Popperian conceptualization undertaken in this article? Two emphases are worth stating before the details: first, managers already have a theoretical system, although tacitly (stated differently, the model is descriptive). Second, the aim of CR is criticism; one should not expect a tool for ideation or inspiration. The contribution is awareness of false theories (on which the strategy rests) hitherto unknown. The application of CR is a logical structured exercise, exerted in six principal steps:</p>
<list id="list7-1350507611429910" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Since managers supposedly know best what their firms do and why, the design theory is the most accessible point of departure: depict it in a hierarchical means-ends structure (i.e. from strategy to operations).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Assuming that the design theory represents a choice (i.e. there are other alternatives for acting), rationalize the decision twice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350507611429910">Hempel, 1962</xref>). One way of rationalization is the ultimate goals to be attained and the top values to be respected, contained in the normative theory. The other is the outside conditions that justify the selected course of action, or in other words the underlying scenario. (If you fail to rationalize the design theory you have already earned a lesson, although beyond the purpose of the method.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Next is the delicate mission: unveil the descriptive theory that mirrors the design theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507611429910">Popper, 1961a</xref>) and that also allows the derivation of the realized scenario (an exercise like mathematic integration; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1350507611429910">March et al., 1996</xref>). This ‘axiomatization’ is the kernel of the method.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Now you have a descriptive theory that explains the past; falsification can be reached by prediction. For this purpose assume different initial conditions and deduce logical scenarios.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Once you recognize that one (or more) initial condition has changed, compare the real situation with the predicted scenario. If they match, the descriptive theory is corroborated; otherwise it is false.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Have information services that deliver relevant information to critically reflect your theory. Do not request an answer machine, but tools that help to think critically and stay ahead of what can happen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1350507611429910">Wijnhoven, 2012</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Corroborated theory does not guarantee ‘good’ strategy, but false one undermines the validity of your design theory. This is the essence of critical rationalism: it tells the false, not the true.</p>
