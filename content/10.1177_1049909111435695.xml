<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Volunteers see their role as becoming increasingly formalized partly as a response to increasing administrative demands on hospice nurses.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The role that volunteers play in a hospice setting is not simply that of unpaid members of staff.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909111435695">1</xref>
</sup> Volunteers have been considered as occupying “a unique third culture of care” or “middle ground” between the formal care provided by paid staff and the informal companionship of friends and family.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049909111435695">2</xref>
</sup> Perhaps because of the difficulty of conceptualizing and demarcating hospice voluntary work, the contribution of volunteers has not been formally evaluated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111435695">3</xref>
</sup> However, bereaved family members rate the contribution of volunteers positively<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049909111435695">4</xref>
</sup> and also rate hospices, where there is greater use of volunteers per patient, more positively.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049909111435695">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In a cross-sectional survey of hospice volunteers, respondents reported being motivated by humanitarian values, the desire for social networks, increasing self-esteem, and pursuing career goals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049909111435695">6</xref>
</sup> Motivations may vary according to age group, with younger volunteers more likely to be motivated by career goals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049909111435695">6</xref>
</sup> While hospice organizations may have difficulty in attracting male volunteers, as reported in one of the few studies of male hospice volunteers, there was no evidence to suggest that motivations were gender specific.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049909111435695">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In hospices without residential facilities, the proportion of care provided by volunteers is likely to be greater.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049909111435695">8</xref>
</sup> Hospice day care represents a rapidly expanding alternative to “residential” hospice<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049909111435695">9</xref>
</sup> and aims to improve quality of life for patients through its holistic focus on the physical, psychological, social, and existential elements of living.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049909111435695">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049909111435695">10</xref>
</sup> It also provides various activities and therapies in which the patient can participate<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049909111435695">11</xref>
</sup> and allows the chance for socialization while providing respite for carers. Similarly, day hospice can be considered a “day off” and a “day out.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049909111435695">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Previous research involving hospice volunteers has considered the role of volunteers as a function of organizational needs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111435695">3</xref>
</sup> The purpose of this study was to understand volunteers’ experiences of working in a day care hospice with a particular emphasis on their perception of the boundaries that exist between paid and unpaid hospice workers. If positive relationships are to be fostered and volunteers retained, an insight into the issues affecting the dynamics of the nurse–volunteer relationship is needed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1049909111435695" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section3-1049909111435695">
<title>Study Design and Setting</title>
<p>This was a qualitative interview study of volunteers’ experiences of working at a day care hospice located on the outskirts of an urban area in the East Midlands of the United Kingdom. The hospice was established in 1980 delivering day care services between Mondays and Fridays to around 3000 patients each year. On any particular day, the hospice was likely to have 20 day care patients in attendance and 5 volunteers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049909111435695">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Potential participants were day care hospice volunteers. Only volunteers involved in direct patient contact and support within the hospice were invited to participate. Letters inviting volunteers to take part in the interview were distributed by the volunteer coordinator, followed by an information sheet if volunteers expressed an interest in participation. Once volunteers had been given the opportunity to consider taking part, they could opt-in to the study by giving their contact details to the volunteer coordinator with permission that this could be passed on to the study team. These volunteers were then contacted by SFR and an appointment was made at a time and place convenient for the volunteer (typically at the hospice). At this appointment, further details of the study were provided and those happy to proceed with the study were interviewed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049909111435695">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Participants’ experiences were explored through one-to-one semi-structured interviews. Interviews were audio-recorded and length was flexible according to the amount of information volunteers wished to impart, lasting for up to an hour. A prompt guide informed by observations made during informal visits to the hospice identified potential topics to be discussed. The guide was adapted according to each interviewee’s narrative.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049909111435695">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049909111435695">14</xref>
</sup> This technique allowed potentially sensitive issues surrounding the hospice to be explored “in-depth” in a way chosen by the volunteer.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049909111435695">13</xref>
</sup> To ensure that participants had spoken about issues that they felt were salient to them, interviews ended with the question: “is there anything that we haven’t discussed which you feel is important in terms of your motivations and experiences as a volunteer?”. Responses were clarified throughout to affirm shared meaning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049909111435695">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Interviews were transcribed verbatim. Analysis was inductive and thematic. To structure analyses and allow transparency, guidelines by Braun and Clarke<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049909111435695">15</xref>
</sup> were followed. Key themes or concepts were extracted from transcripts in a systematic way (coding) with the intention of reflecting what volunteers had expressed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049909111435695">16</xref>
</sup> A named code allowed data of the “same type” to be identified and examined.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049909111435695">17</xref>
</sup> Subthemes were created when different views or experiences of a theme were encountered or when different elements of a theme were discussed. Both SFR and AA independently, and then in collaboration, read and re-read transcripts and undertook data analysis in an attempt to ensure that participants’ experience had been accurately represented.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049909111435695">18</xref>
</sup> When reporting study findings, participants are given a pseudonym to ensure anonymity. The findings presented in this article relate specifically to the volunteers experience of the nurse/volunteer relationship.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049909111435695">
<title>Ethical Approval</title>
<p>Ethical approval was gained from the University of Nottingham Ethics Committee (ref: L/5/2008) before data collection commenced.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049909111435695">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>A total of 12 self-selecting participants formed the study sample; 2 males and 10 females aged between 18 and 73 years. Participants had volunteered at the hospice for between 6 weeks to 7 years (mean 16 months). Findings are reported under 3 thematic headings: formalization, the division of labor, and working relationships.</p>
<sec id="section9-1049909111435695">
<title>Formalization</title>
<p>All participants reported undertaking a structured induction at the start of their voluntary work with the hospice. They recalled undergoing interviews, the uptake of character references, and the completion of administration forms as part of their application process and the subsequent requirement for a 3-month initial training period before being formally accepted as a hospice volunteer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, participants reported feeling a sense of increasing formalization characterized by recent additions to hospice rules, regulations, restrictions, and policies. Opinions as to the effects of this process differed. A number of participants were grateful for the structure and saw volunteering as a means by which to gradually reintroduce themselves to a “work” or social environment following personal ill health or caring responsibilities. They felt it resembled paid work and the formality they experienced was assisting them to “get back into the swing of life” (Emma). Paradoxically, however, participants explained that it was their perception of informality that attracted them to volunteer initially.</p>
<p>Other volunteers perceived a lesser degree of formality and made specific distinctions between employment and their volunteer role. Their flexibility and freedom afforded by their status as volunteers rather than employees were identified by participants as a key element in their decision to volunteer rather than seek paid work.<disp-quote>
<p>because it’s structured, it gives you, it’s like being at work even though you’re not … it does make you feel like you’re in a work environment … so coming here gives you the confidence to do the things I never thought I’d do (Susan)</p>
<p>That really would make me finish coming if they said well you’ve got to do this…but they don’t tell you you’ve got to do anything. This is the beauty of it…it’s not like a paid job (Angela)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A number of participants who described increasing formality expressed concern that the process could erode the established hospice atmosphere of relaxation and spontaneity. They felt this was an essential quality that they believed to be the key to what initially attracted patients and volunteers to the hospice and kept them loyal to the organization.<disp-quote>
<p>It’s hard I think sometimes to keep a balance between efficiency and hmm …… just so long as we keep the heart of it in there … it’s hard … but I think that’s really important because I think that’s why people come here more than anything. (Christina)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049909111435695">
<title>Division of Labor</title>
<p>Participants agreed that the role of the volunteer within the hospice was unique to each individual and was guided by their particular interests and strengths. Some individuals led creative projects, games, and practiced complementary therapies, while others liked to chat and provide company to patients on a one-to-one basis. Although varied, their roles were predominantly social in nature:<disp-quote>
<p>we encourage the other side of what obviously makes you human not just you know having your physical stuff seen to but just having the social stuff seen to (Emma)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Regardless of individuals’ opinions regarding increasing formality and its effects, there was consensus among volunteers that the current flexible and informal status of their role augmented the quality of nursing care provided and the patients’ subjective experience of hospice. For many volunteers, the distinction between themselves and staff meant that patients felt more able to talk openly to them, perhaps because of a perception that the relationship was one between equals rather than one between a paid service provider and patient. This was seen as having important benefits for patients and staff.<disp-quote>
<p>I think the thing with a volunteer is, you’re actually out of the illness and out of the problem, so therefore patients can come and talk to you knowing you’re not actually a nurse and knowing you’re not actually a family member and actually just…have a laugh…you’re just like a listening ear (Susan)</p>
<p>we might notice something that hasn’t been picked up by the nurses or something, indeed they might not have said to the nurses, something that they perhaps feel unable to talk about. So you know, we are able to pass stuff on if necessary (Emma)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Participants suggested that their role was becoming more orientated toward the physical needs of the patients. This was perceived as being in part a reflection of an increase in administrative demands on the nurses opening a gap in the service that volunteers were increasingly asked to fill.<disp-quote>
<p>The nurses are doing the paperwork now. I can’t personally see the sense of it but one of the nurses said that really, the kind of nursing that she does here is not really nursing, she doesn’t feel so. I can’t see that doing the paperwork and other stuff behind the scenes is, I think is even less nursing and I don’t feel so secure … I used to like having the nurses, somebody that really knew what they were doing (Sam)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A number of volunteers had embraced the opportunity to perform more physically orientated tasks while others felt that this was beyond their remit. Those who expressed concern felt that they were not always “safe” to perform certain tasks and felt insecure when the nursing staff were less visible.<disp-quote>
<p>Perhaps we do a little bit more, like we will go and take someone to the toilet for instance if they’re not too immobile which we didn’t do before so that’s changed. It doesn’t bother me ‘cos I’ve worked in a care home so it’s not really anything that bothers me (Emma)</p>
<p>They did ask us if we’d like to be trained to feed patients and I did say yes but then I don’t think I could. I’d be really worried that they’d choke or something you know … it’s quite a responsibility, I couldn’t do that, and I couldn’t take them to the toilet and wipe their bottoms you know (Jane)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In addition, several volunteers voiced concern that although they had taken on what they saw as more “medical” tasks, they were not always given the information that they believed would help them to perform these tasks satisfactorily. To protect patient confidentiality, details of patients’ medical diagnoses were not provided to volunteers. Some questioned whether keeping this information from volunteers was always in the patient’s best interest.<disp-quote>
<p>so I [wasn’t] meant to give her digestive biscuits but I didn’t know that…we don’t know what’s wrong with people but sometimes we need to know (Susan)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1049909111435695">
<title>Working Relationships</title>
<p>The nature of relationships between volunteers and nurses within the hospice was variable. Those reporting positive relationships with nurses felt that they worked well as a team, were appreciated, and were well supported in their role:<disp-quote>
<p>the nurses treat us with great respect and they’re very glad of us and you know we’re glad of them…they’re wonderful with us (Sam)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Other participants’ experiences were less positive and it was suggested that professional insecurity led to occasional disharmony between the nurses and volunteers.<disp-quote>
<p>Maybe they felt a bit kind of threatened if you like, I don’t know why they would because I mean we’re not professional and you know we’re not nurses…I mean we’re only here to help you know…we’re not looking to take their jobs off them (Diane)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>When participants discussed the recent changes in the division of labor, a degree of role ambiguity became evident, which had begun to influence relationships between volunteers themselves. Tension seemed to stem from the division of those that “worked” physically and those that “sat around” socially.<disp-quote>
<p>in volunteering you do get some that say ‘I’m not doing the toilet duties’ and it’s ‘oh no, I don’t push wheelchairs’ you know…then you get some volunteers who say ‘I’ll do that, I’ll do that’ and its quite difficult in a volunteer situation because then you’ve got some who literally do naff all all day whilst some of you are running around [constantly] (Susan)</p>
</disp-quote>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study provides important insights into how day care hospice volunteers understand and negotiate the boundaries of their work in relation to paid staff and the organizational context. There was a perception among volunteers that these boundaries were shifting in response to increasing formality and a changing interface between paid and unpaid work. These changes impacted directly on working relationships.</p>
<p>There was a perception among volunteers that staff did not always communicate important information required to work effectively within the broadening sphere of hospice volunteering. A previous study of hospice volunteers identified the importance of support from paid staff when organizational change can be perceived as threatening.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049909111435695">19</xref>
</sup> The change spoken of by participants in the present study was not one that had occurred overnight but was perceived as a gradual shift toward a less informal way of working.</p>
<p>Our study found that volunteers had a very particular view of the function of the hospice and their role within it. We did not interview paid staff but there is evidence from previous work that the purpose of hospice care can be viewed in different ways by volunteers and hospice staff.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049909111435695">20</xref>
</sup> There is evidence from a study of patients, staff, and volunteers that within hospices, goals are often stakeholder specific rather than shared across the team; a consequence of, and perhaps a response to, poor understanding of others’ roles.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049909111435695">21</xref>
</sup> In our study, we do not know whether the nurses shared the view of some volunteers that they should be able to access relevant details about a patient's medical condition. In a survey of nurses, just over half felt that volunteers should know patient medical information, and most thought they should be included in team meetings.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049909111435695">22</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Previous work suggests that there can be tensions when volunteers attempt to work across boundaries demarcated by hospice guidelines and when patients or their families unwittingly make requests of volunteers that are outside of those boundaries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049909111435695">23</xref>
</sup> In a survey of volunteers providing hospice bereavement support, more than one in four reported problems of “boundaries,” both between themselves and clients and difficulties in “letting go” but also between themselves and paid professional staff where they felt their work was not always acknowledged.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049909111435695">24</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A review of studies of volunteers suggests that volunteers feeling undervalued by doctors, social workers, and nurses is not uncommon.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049909111435695">25</xref>
</sup> In our study, this was alluded to by some participants, although many praised the nursing staff for contributing to a positive working environment. Nonetheless, as divisions between volunteers and paid workers were redrawn, this had the potential to threaten both “sides” of that boundary. Acceptance by staff and feeling important team members ranks highly among volunteers’ concerns.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049909111435695">26</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Our study has a number of limitations. The sample size was small, although there is no evidence to suggest that it is not representative of day care volunteers at the particular hospice, or indeed of volunteers at other day care hospices in the United Kingdom. The interviewer (SFR) was not connected to the hospice prior to the study, and we believe this gave volunteers the opportunity to speak openly about their working relationships in a way that would have been difficult had the interviewer been an “insider.” However, we are aware that our study is limited to the perspective of one side of the boundary between paid and volunteer hospice workers. It was apparent from the account of the volunteers that nurses were facing new challenges in their own roles but resource limitations meant that we were not able to interview nurses and other paid staff.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1049909111435695">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Volunteers are a key resource in the delivery of hospice day care. As the role of paid staff, typically that of nursing staff, changes this has an inevitable although sometimes overlooked effect on the work of volunteers. The needs of volunteers and their willingness to take on new roles are not uniform. To maintain strong working relationships, nurses, managers, and volunteer coordinators need to be sensitive to how organizational change affects volunteers. For volunteers to feel secure and valued, the process in how boundaries between paid and unpaid workers are negotiated needs to be transparent.</p>
