<p>A.S.P.E.N. has developed parenteral nutrition (PN) shortage considerations to assist its members and other clinicians in coping with PN shortages for their patients.</p>
<p>During an intravenous fat emulsion (IVFE) shortage period, consider one or more of the following measures:</p>
<list id="list1-0884533613498214" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Assess each patient as to the indication for PN and provide nutrition via the oral or enteral route when possible.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Purchase only as much IVFE supply as needed. In the interest of fair allocation to all patients nationally, please do not stockpile.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Compound PN in a single, central location (either in a centralized pharmacy or as outsourced preparation) to decrease inventory waste. Consider a supply outreach to other facilities in your geographic location.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Prioritize supply of IVFE as follows:
<list id="list2-0884533613498214" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>10% IVFE—use for adults and older pediatric patients without fluid restriction; can use dextrose/amino acids or total nutrient admixture formulations</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>20% IVFE—prioritize for neonates and smaller pediatric patients, older pediatric patients, and adults requiring fluid restriction</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>30% IVFE—use for compounding total nutrient admixtures</p></list-item>
</list></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Neonatal/pediatric hospitalized patients should continue the same IVFE as they did before the shortage as the provision of IVFE is critical to these patients.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Adult mild to moderately malnourished hospitalized patients on PN &lt;2 weeks may have IVFE withheld during a shortage unless it is considered essential in the judgment of the healthcare professional.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Adult hospitalized patients on PN &gt;2 weeks should receive a total of 100 g fat weekly, which may be given by whatever method is safe and efficient (minimizing IVFE waste) to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD), with the remainder of nonprotein energy provided by dextrose. Patients should be monitored for EFAD. Signs and symptoms of EFAD include diffuse dry scaly rash, alopecia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and impaired wound healing. Biochemical evidence of EFAD is confirmed by a triene-to-tetraene ratio of &gt;0.4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533613498214">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533613498214">2</xref></sup> For some specific adult hospitalized patients (eg, patients with glucose intolerance, severely malnourished patients, patients at risk for refeeding syndrome, and during pregnancy), IVFE should be provided as a component of daily energy based on current practice prior to the shortage.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Adult hospitalized critically ill patients receiving propofol should not need additional IVFE to prevent EFAD because the soybean oil in the medication will supply needed essential fatty acids.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Home or long-term care patients should continue to receive the same IVFE therapy as they did before the shortage. However, minimize use of IVFE when clinically feasible. At a minimum, patients should receive a total of 100 g fat weekly, which may be given by whatever method is safe and efficient (minimizing IVFE waste) to prevent EFAD, with the remainder of nonprotein energy provided by dextrose. Patients should be monitored for EFAD. For some specific adult home or long-term care patients (eg, patients with glucose intolerance, severely malnourished patients, patients at risk for refeeding syndrome, and during pregnancy), IVFE should be provided as a component of daily energy based on current practice prior to the shortage.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Facilities and practitioners must continue to observe and be compliant with the product labeling (eg, package insert), USP General Chapter &lt;797&gt; Pharmaceutical Compounding–Sterile Preparations, and state boards of pharmacy rules and regulations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Report severe drug product shortage information to the FDA Drug Shortage Program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/DrugShortages/ucm142398.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/DrugShortages/ucm142398.htm</ext-link>).</p></list-item>
