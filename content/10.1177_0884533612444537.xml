<abstract>
<p>A ventricular assist device (VAD) is an implantable mechanical device that is used to partially or completely replace the circulatory function of a failing heart. VADs may serve as a bridge to heart transplantation or as permanent circulatory assistance, also referred to as destination therapy. There is a paucity of information regarding the nutrition complications in VAD patients, and as such, little is presently known of the optimal means of nutrition assessment and management of these complex and often critically ill patients. In this review, a general overview of the VAD, comparisons of nutrition assessment measures, and strategies to meet the nutrition needs of these patients are provided using evidence-based information wherever possible. Because there is a lack of nutrition studies and assessment guidelines specifically for VAD patients, many of the guidelines for care of these patients are currently based on the information available for the care of patients with heart failure. Although the optimal measure to assess nutrition status remains poorly studied, a systematic, thorough nutrition assessment of patients with heart failure and heart transplant candidates prior to VAD placement appears to be important to identify those at nutrition risk and, with appropriate nutrition therapy, decrease their risk for morbidity and mortality. VAD patients with inadequate oral intake may require nutrition support to meet their nutrition needs; however, feeding the hemodynamically compromised patient provides additional challenges.</p>

<body>
<p>According to the National Heart, Blood and Lung Institute, more than 5.7 million people in the United States have been diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF), and approximately 300,000 people die from CHF annually.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612444537">1</xref></sup> Patients with CHF often demonstrate a progressive decline. Patients with severe CHF experience high morbidity and mortality and often become debilitated with a significant impact on their quality of life. Furthermore, patients with CHF may experience nausea, anorexia, and early satiety due to ascites, resulting in weight loss, nutrition deficiencies, and malnutrition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612444537">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612444537"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612444537">4</xref></sup> Because heart transplantation is not an option for most patients with end-stage, medically refractory CHF, other surgical approaches continue to evolve, and their use remains highly individualized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612444537">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612444537">6</xref></sup> One such surgical option is the ventricular assist device (VAD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612444537">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>Ventricular Assist Devices</title>
<p>A VAD is an implantable mechanical device that is used to partially or completely replace the circulatory function of a failing heart. The VAD consists of a pump that can either be implanted or sits external to the patient. The VAD consists of a controller, a power source, and a transcutaneous electrical cable that connects the pump to the controlled and the power source.</p>
<p>A left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is surgically attached to the left ventricle of the failing heart. The inflow cannula is sewn into the left ventricular apex. The inflow cannula delivers blood from the left ventricle of the heart to the blood pump. The blood is then delivered to either the ascending or descending aorta from the pump through the outflow cannula, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0884533612444537">Figure 1</xref>. When an LVAD is implanted, the right ventricle of the heart is responsible for delivering blood through the pulmonary system to the left side of the heart. The LVAD assists the left side of the heart by pumping oxygenated blood to the aorta, where it is then distributed throughout the body. The LVAD is attached to the left ventricular apex and the aorta. The right-sided VAD (RVAD) assists the right side of the heart by pumping blood to the lungs for oxygenation. The RVAD is attached to the right atrium of the heart and the pulmonary artery, and the cannulas are surgically sewn into place while the pump itself sits external to the body. A biventricular assist device (BiVAD) is surgically implanted and assists both the right and left sides of the heart. A paracorpeal VAD (PVAD) can provide support as a LVAD, RVAD, or BiVAD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612444537">8</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0884533612444537">Figure 2</xref> demonstrates a PVAD in the form of a BiVAD (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA).</p>

<p>The VAD is powered by either AC or battery. The controller, which is a small computer, is programmed to run the pump and monitor its functions with settings customized for each individual patient to optimize blood delivery to the vital organs. The controller and batteries are carried by the patient throughout all activities. Since first introduced into clinical practice in 1984 as a bridge to transplant, the VAD design has advanced to produce lighter power sources, reduction in VAD size, and the ability to choose between an LVAD and an RVAD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612444537">9</xref></sup> These enhancements have improved VAD portability, accessibility, and functionality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612444537">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>When patients present with end-stage CHF, they can be evaluated for heart transplantation and/or a VAD implantation. VADs may be used short term as a bridge to heart transplantation or as a permanent circulatory assistance, also referred to as “destination therapy,” in the individual with end-stage CHF who is not eligible for a heart transplant. Transplant candidates who are too ill to wait for transplant are often implanted with a VAD as a “bridge to transplant.” Patients who are not candidates for transplantation due to exclusion criteria are implanted as “destination therapy.” To qualify for VAD destination therapy, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) currently require that patients meet the following criteria: (1) New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV, characterized by severe activity limitations and symptoms while at rest; (2) left ventricular function that is severely decreased with an ejection fraction of less than 25%; and (3) pulmonary stress test that demonstrates myocardial oxygen consumption of 12 mL/kg/min or less, indicating the heart is unable to provide enough oxygen to the myocardium for daily activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612444537">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>VADs have been shown to improve morbidity and mortality and are known to increase the quality of life and functional capacity of patients with severe CHF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612444537">11</xref></sup> Despite the lifesaving benefits provided by the VAD, there are a number of potential complications associated with its use. These include but are not limited to thromboembolism, hemorrhage, multiorgan failure, right ventricular failure, infections, device malfunction, and malnutrition. Abdominal complications include hardware infection, bowel obstruction, gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage, diaphragmatic hernia, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, gastric ulceration, and perforation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612444537">12</xref></sup> Nutrition complications are commonly seen in patients with VADs, as weight loss is expected to occur in 50% of patients with heart failure, likely reflecting the nutrition problems occurring in patients with severe CHF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612444537">13</xref></sup></p>

<title>Nutrition Assessment Prior to VAD Implantation</title>
<p>The assessment of a patient’s nutrition status prior to VAD implantation is important to prevent morbidity and mortality and provide optimal care. The comprehensive nutrition assessment should be individualized based on the individual’s nutrition history, current medical condition, and current degree of malnutrition. Although a variety of different nutrition assessment tools to determine the nutrition status exist, no single nutrition assessment method is universally accepted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612444537">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a paucity of published data regarding nutrition alterations in patients with VADs. However, it is well recognized that patients with severe CHF encounter difficulties maintaining their nutrition status due to the presence of a variety of factors, including anorexia, early satiety, delayed gastric emptying, nausea, and chronic low-grade systemic inflammation associated with heart failure (ie, cardiac cachexia).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612444537">13</xref></sup> This population includes patients who are VAD candidates or following VAD insertion. Early satiety has been noted in patients following LVAD placement, suggesting it may contribute to poor oral intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444537">15</xref></sup> For example, early satiety was observed by Wasler and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444537">15</xref></sup> in a study comparing intraperitoneal (IP) and extraperitoneal (EP) placements of an LVAD. Device-related bleeding, infection, and other intra-abdominal complications were compared in 48 patients. Bleeding rates did not differ significantly between the 2 groups, but device-related infection was more common in the EP group. Early satiety was noted in patients with either the IP or the EP LVAD, suggesting that early satiety may be related to the insertion of the device per se rather than the route of its placement. GI function was studied in 27 patients following LVAD placement using interviews, upper endoscopy, upper GI barium contrast, and Tc sulfur colloid studies of esophageal transit and gastric emptying. Borderline slow esophageal transit and prolonged gastric emptying were found, the latter potentially contributing to the early satiety previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612444537">16</xref></sup> As a consequence of these factors, weight loss is experienced in 50% of patients with heart failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612444537">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cardiac cachexia is a wasting syndrome that can develop in patients with severe heart failure and places them at higher risk for mortality. Indeed, as part of the nutrition assessment process for candidacy for VAD placement at many institutions, an evaluation for cachexia is recommended as it has been shown to be an independent risk factor for mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612444537">17</xref></sup> The wasting that occurs during cardiac cachexia includes loss of lean tissue, fat tissue, and bone mass. Unfortunately, there is no universally accepted method to diagnose cardiac cachexia; however, Anker et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612444537">3</xref></sup> suggest the following definition: body mass index (BMI) &lt;24, weight loss of at least 5 kg over a 6-month period, and current weight &lt;85% of ideal body weight. Using this definition, Mancini et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533612444537">18</xref></sup> noted that up to 68% of patients with cardiac cachexia have muscle wasting.</p>
<p>Assessment tools such as Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) and handgrip strength assessment in the general hospital population have been studied. One large study included patients with cardiac disease, GI disease, and patients who were admitted for general surgery. The handgrip assessment was found to be a reliable tool for classifying malnutrition in contrast to serum albumin results. This study in particular excluded patients with fluid overload due to the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) portion of the experiment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533612444537">19</xref></sup> Even though patients with fluid overload were excluded due to BIA, handgrip assessment may still be warranted as a good tool to assess muscular dysfunction and malnutrition for VAD candidates. Very little data exist regarding specific guidelines for formal nutrition assessment, such as SGA and other tools, specifically in the VAD population.</p>
<sec id="section3-0884533612444537">
<title>Anthropometric Assessment</title>
<p>Current nutrition assessment-related studies on VAD and patients with heart failure focus primarily on anthropometric and biochemical assessment. Anthropometric data are widely used to determine nutrition status in patients with heart failure, specifically BMI. Butler et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612444537">14</xref></sup> examined the influence of BMI on morbidity and mortality following LVAD implantation in 222 patients. Patients were divided into 4 groups based on BMI: group 1, &lt;22.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; group 2, 22.9–26.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; group 3, 26.4–29.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; and group 4, &gt;29.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The degree of edema present was not reported. Patients with a higher BMI had increased risk of reoperation and renal complications; however, those with a higher BMI also had an increased likelihood of survival. Of the 222 patients studied, 84 died while receiving LVAD support. No significant relationship with cardiac index and BMI was found. Survival was best in group 4 (BMI &gt;29.4) and worst in group 1 (BMI &lt;22.9); the survival rate at 365 days following LVAD implantation was 26.2% for group 1 and 65.9% for group 4. This difference was statistically significant. These findings suggest that those patients with a BMI &lt;22.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> should be carefully assessed and considered for oral nutrition supplementation or enteral nutrition (EN) support prior to LVAD implantation. It is possible that the patients with a lower BMI may have had more advanced heart failure as an explanation for their increased mortality rate as compared with the patients with a higher BMI. Another possible explanation is that the malnutrition-inflammation complex syndrome was present, referring to an inverse association between the intensity of inflammation and BMI. Mano et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533612444537">20</xref></sup> found similar results when BMI was measured in 64 patients 3 months after LVAD implantation. Patients were divided among 3 groups based on BMI following LVAD: &lt;16, 16–18.4, and ≥18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Perhaps not surprisingly, the group with the lowest BMI was at greatest risk for mortality. Importantly, each unit increase in BMI was associated with a 38% reduction in mortality. Musci et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533612444537">21</xref></sup> also examined BMI and survival following VAD placement. BMI was divided into the following groups: &lt;20, 20–24, 25–29, 30–35, and &gt;35 in 590 patients. Patients with BMI &lt;20 and &gt;35 were at highest risk for postoperative mortality. Although a higher BMI, to an extent, appears to have a protective effect in patients with CHF, the mechanisms involved remain unclear. The paradox between increased BMI and decreased mortality risk is puzzling; however, a higher BMI appears to play a protective effect on patients with CHF. Nevertheless, it is likely that an increased protection against endotoxins and inflammatory cytokines as well as enhanced metabolic and nutrition reserve play a role.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533612444537">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Oreopolus et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533612444537">23</xref></sup> examined the relationship between BMI, body fat percentage, and lean muscle mass using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). After examining 140 patients with systolic and/or diastolic heart failure, BMI was found to correlate better with lean body mass than body fat percentage. Therefore, the study showed that a higher BMI indicates a higher percent lean body mass rather than higher body fat and highlights the difficulty in using BMI as an accurate tool for assessing nutrition status in patients with heart failure. Evidently, when assessing weight loss in potential VAD patients, it is important to note the degree of fluid retention (eg, edema and ascites) as this will affect their actual weight. Another difficulty in using BMI to assess cardiac cachexia is illustrated in the obese patient with weight loss and muscle atrophy, as the patient would be excluded from the cachexia diagnosis using this definition because his or her BMI is &gt;24. On the other hand, assessing muscle mass in patients who are fit from weight training and fall in the obese category based on BMI warrant additional assessments such as skinfold measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0884533612444537">24</xref></sup> However, there is no current literature available on this patient population.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0884533612444537">
<title>Biochemical Assessment</title>
<p>Despite well-recognized problems with their use, biochemical data remain widely used to assist with the determination of an individual’s nutrition status prior to VAD placement. The most common laboratory markers for malnutrition presently used are serum albumin and prealbumin; however, transferrin, retinol-binding protein, and total and absolute lymphocyte counts have been used in the past to diagnose malnutrition. C-reactive protein (CRP) is also occasionally used to correlate with hepatic protein markers. It has been suggested that these markers be used to evaluate optimal nutrition status prior to surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533612444537">25</xref></sup> Recent studies have demonstrated that, although these markers may be commonly used, the underlying inflammatory state in this patient population strongly influences these values, making their reliability as nutrition markers problematic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533612444537">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Serum albumin level is influenced by many factors. For example, a decrease in serum albumin may occur as a result of a number of problems occurring in this patient population, including fluid shifts between the intravascular and extravascular space, hepatic failure, infection, metabolic stress, nephrotic syndrome, protein-losing states, burns, trauma, postoperative states, kwashiorkor, collagen disease, cancer, corticosteroids, bed rest, and zinc deficiency. An increase in serum albumin may be seen in the setting of dehydration, marasmus, blood transfusions, and after administration of exogenous source of serum albumin. Although prealbumin has a shorter half-life than serum albumin, thus increasing its sensitivity as a nutrition marker, prealbumin also is affected by a number of conditions and does not directly correlate with nutrition status. Prealbumin is decreased in situations such as liver disease, postoperative states, infection, stress, inflammation, dialysis, hyperthyroidism, pregnancy, significant hyperglycemia, and sudden demand for protein synthesis. Prealbumin may also be increased in severe renal failure, corticosteroid use, and oral contraceptives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0884533612444537">27</xref></sup> These factors need to be taken into consideration when assessing nutrition status using serum albumin and prealbumin; however, these markers can reflect stress response as opposed to accurately indicating nutrition status with the above-mentioned circumstances. Nevertheless, the use of these laboratory markers may be worthwhile as a prognostic tool, as noted below.</p>
<p>Patients with CHF are often in an inflammatory state, during which there is a reduction in liver synthesis of prealbumin and an increased synthesis of CRP; the reduction in prealbumin may not accurately reflect the nutrition status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533612444537">26</xref></sup> No studies conducted specifically on LVAD or patients with heart failure patients have demonstrated the relationship of the inflammatory state and nutrition markers, but from other studies of hospitalized patients with inflammation, the relationship has been shown. One study that demonstrated the influence of inflammation on these values was conducted on 101 patients older than 80 years in whom serum levels of prealbumin and CRP were compared. A statistical significance was found between inflammation and the inverse relationship between serum levels of CRP and prealbumin, meaning that, as CRP increased, it directly correlated with a decrease in prealbumin. A subgroup of the patients had normal CRP and depressed prealbumin levels, which may indicate that depressed prealbumin can act as a marker for malnutrition when CRP is in the normal limits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0884533612444537">28</xref></sup> Another study by Davis et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533612444537">26</xref></sup> examined the changes in serum CRP and prealbumin levels in 154 patients receiving ≥60% of energy needs. No significant change in prealbumin occurred in those patients receiving ≥60% as compared with those receiving ≤60% of estimated energy needs. Changes in serum levels of prealbumin correlated inversely with changes in CRP. Even when feeding more calories, prealbumin was not responsive to nutrition intakes. Many studies on the VAD population have used biochemical markers such as serum albumin and prealbumin as prognostic markers of morbidity and mortality risk. One such study by Dang and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0884533612444537">29</xref></sup> studied 99 patients who underwent LVAD implantation from January 1996 through February 2003. They examined 4 preoperative nutrition markers: serum albumin level, total protein level, absolute lymphocyte count, and BMI. Each parameter was categorized as low or normal and compared with patient demographics, device-related infections, bridge-to-transplant rate, total hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, and posttransplant survival. Both the mean ICU length of stay and the bridge-to-transplant rate were significantly longer in patients who had low serum albumin and total protein levels. Poor clinical outcomes, including sepsis, lower bridge-to-transplant rate, and longer ICU stay, were also associated with decreased preoperative serum albumin levels. In patients who received LVAD support, particularly the elderly, poor nutrition status (defined by examining serum albumin, total protein, and absolute lymphocyte count) was associated with decreased immune function, increased infection rate, and impaired wound healing. The authors concluded that nutrition risk should be identified in patients prior to VAD implantation, and those patients with evidence of nutrition risk should receive nutrition supplementation to meet their individualized energy and protein needs. They added that optimal nutrition should continue during the perioperative period. A study by Lietz and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0884533612444537">30</xref></sup> also demonstrated an increased 90-day mortality following LVAD implantation in patients with serum albumin levels ≤3.3 g/dL; however, no information was provided on calorie intake.</p>
<p>To further demonstrate the misuse of prealbumin and the inaccuracy of the marker indicating strictly malnutrition, studies have found that patients who suffer from anorexia nervosa, who undoubtedly are malnourished, have normal serum albumin and prealbumin levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0884533612444537">27</xref></sup> This indicates the inaccuracy that may occur when strictly using biochemical markers to determine nutrition status. Clark et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0884533612444537">31</xref></sup> examined critically ill patients and the changes in protein status throughout the hospital course. This study showed that once patients had a decrease in CRP, they subsequently had an increase in serum levels of prealbumin; however, the patients had a decrease in total body protein, which demonstrates that prealbumin may not be a good indicator to follow changes in protein stores in the early stages of critical illness. Knowing the relationship between inflammation and serum prealbumin or albumin levels, the risk for mortality or medical complications in the above-mentioned studies being defined as related to malnutrition is likely inconsistent because we have seen that even with increasing nutrition intakes, the laboratory markers are not improved until the illness is improved. The use of these laboratory values could be better defined as indicating the patient is at higher risk due to the current state of his or her illness, moving away from relating it to malnutrition alone. The laboratory tests could still be useful for clinicians if there is a decrease in the test in a stable patient that something medically could be awry.</p>
<p>Aside from alterations in the synthesis of acute phase protein markers in patients with CHF, levels of B vitamins have also been closely studied in this patient population. B vitamins influence the production of red blood cells, play a role in energy metabolism, and must be obtained in the diet to maintain adequate tissue stores. B vitamin deficiency in patients hospitalized with CHF has been found to commonly occur. Thiamine (vitamin B<sub>1</sub>) deficiency has been reported to range from 3%–91% in patients with CHF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0884533612444537">32</xref></sup> In 100 patients with CHF, riboflavin (vitamin B<sub>2</sub>) deficiency was found in 27% and pyridoxine (vitamin B<sub>6</sub>) deficiency was present in 38%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0884533612444537">33</xref></sup> Specifically, thiamine deficiency is of particular concern in patients with CHF. Beriberi, a vitamin B<sub>1</sub> deficiency syndrome, leads to sodium retention, peripheral vasodilatation, and biventricular heart failure. Hanninen et al examined vitamin B<sub>1</sub> levels in 100 patients with CHF and compared them with 50 control subjects and found vitamin B<sub>1</sub> deficiency to be present in 33% of the patients with heart failure compared with 12% in the controls. Vitamin B<sub>1</sub> deficiency was associated with increased urine thiamine losses, nonuse of vitamin B<sub>1</sub> supplements, and preserved renal function. Supplementation was suggested to protect against vitamin B<sub>1</sub> deficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0884533612444537">32</xref></sup> In the aforementioned study that examined vitamins B<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>6</sub> status in 100 hospitalized patients with CHF 68% had biochemical evidence of having B vitamin deficiency at least once. Twenty percent of the patients who took B vitamin–containing supplements had a 50% reduction in B vitamin deficiency; however, the deficiency reduction was still not statistically significantly different from those patients who did not use supplements. Even though diuretic use has been suggested as the explanation for excessive loss of water-soluble vitamins, including vitamin B<sub>1</sub>, this study showed no significant difference in the dose or duration of diuretic use and vitamin status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0884533612444537">33</xref></sup> Additional studies are needed to show the benefit of B vitamin supplementation, but it appears reasonable to provide supplementation, especially in patients with poor oral intake or known deficiency.</p>
<p>Other important nutrient deficiencies demonstrated to occur in heart failure include coenzyme Q10, vitamin D, and zinc. In many cases, deficiency was related to inadequate nutrition intake or medications. For example, coenzyme Q10 has been found to be low in the heart failure population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0884533612444537">34</xref></sup> and can be further depleted by the use of “statin” medications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0884533612444537">35</xref></sup> Importantly, some studies showed improved heart function with supplementation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0884533612444537">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0884533612444537">37</xref></sup> but others studies have not.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0884533612444537">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0884533612444537">39</xref></sup> More studies are needed to demonstrate the use for and need of supplementation with coenzyme Q10. Low serum vitamin D levels and elevated parathyroid hormone levels have been associated with higher mortality in patients with heart failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0884533612444537">40</xref></sup> Several studies have demonstrated the role of low vitamin D levels being associated with CHF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0884533612444537">41</xref></sup> and cardiomyopathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0884533612444537">42</xref></sup> Furthermore, vitamin D supplementation has been associated with increased survival in deficient patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0884533612444537">43</xref></sup> Supplementation of vitamin D should be provided to deficient patients, but further studies are needed on the optimal dosing of vitamin D to improve heart failure outcomes. Finally, zinc deficiency has been found to occur more commonly in the patient with heart failure and has been attributed to decreased intake and medications used to treat heart failure. More studies on the benefit of zinc supplementation are needed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0884533612444537">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0884533612444537">45</xref></sup> Nonetheless, if zinc deficiency is present, supplementation would be reasonable.</p>

<title>Strategies to Meet Nutrition Needs</title>
<p>Compared with healthy individuals, patients with CHF have increased total energy expenditure and a negative nitrogen balance. Aquilani et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612444537">4</xref></sup> examined the nutrition intake of 57 nonobese patients with CHF and found that 54.4% were malnourished, 15.8% had protein energy malnutrition (PEM), and 38.5% had protein malnutrition with a normal body weight. They concluded that patients with CHF have insufficient energy intake with an average calorie deficit of –186.3 ± 305 and do not meet estimated energy needs compared with healthy adults. Patients with heart failure also require increased protein needs compared with healthy individuals of the same age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0884533612444537">46</xref></sup> Indirect calorimetry should be considered in this population, and close nutrition intake monitoring is recommended to assess nutrition support needs.</p>
<p>There are no randomized controlled trials of any nutrition intervention in VAD patients, and current recommendations are based mainly on anecdotal data and expert opinion; however, because the general recommendations for VAD patients are similar to those for patients with CHF, the information presented below is based on CHF. When oral intake is possible, a 2-g sodium-restricted diet is recommended.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0884533612444537">47</xref></sup> Arcand et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0884533612444537">48</xref></sup> conducted a prospective study in 123 patients with systolic heart failure to examine the influence of sodium intake on heart failure. Dietary intake was evaluated and assessed through 3-day food records at baseline and at 6–12 weeks. This study showed that patients who consumed ≥2.8 g of sodium/d had a greater incidence of early acute decompensated heart failure by 2.5-fold compared with those patients who consumed under 2.7 g of sodium daily. This study reinforces the benefit of a low-sodium diet to patients with heart failure. In the setting of early satiety, small, frequent meals should be encouraged.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0884533612444537">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fluid restriction of 1.5–2.0 L/d is important in those patients who experience CHF signs and symptoms of fluid retention (eg, edema, ascites, weight gain) or require high doses of diuretics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0884533612444537">49</xref></sup> Oral nutrition supplements have been shown to be a safe and successful method to improve the status of cachectic patients with CHF. Twenty-nine patients with chronic CHF were randomized to consume a 600-calorie, 20-g protein oral supplement for 18 weeks during a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0884533612444537">50</xref></sup> In the 23 patients who received the supplement, a 2.0 ± 1.7–kg edema-free weight gain was seen at week 6, whereas a 2.3 ± 3.1–kg weight gain was seen at week 18. The placebo group consisted of 6 individuals who consumed a similar-tasting formula with only 12 calories per day. No statistically significant changes were observed or reported. Based on DEXA scanning, the weight gained in the experimental group was primarily related to fat mass expansion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0884533612444537">50</xref></sup> If oral supplements are not enough for patients to meet estimated energy needs, nutrition support is a viable option to promote improved nutrition status.</p>
<p>Patients with CHF have an increased risk of malnutrition and cachexia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612444537">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612444537"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612444537">4</xref></sup> Therefore, nutrition support may be needed to reduce the risk of malnutrition in those patients who are unable to meet their estimated energy and protein needs by oral intake alone. When oral intake is insufficient or impossible, EN is less costly and has fewer associated risks compared with parental nutrition (PN) and should be used preferentially whenever possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0884533612444537">51</xref></sup> Aslam et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0884533612444537">52</xref></sup> examined 300 patients who underwent VAD placement and found that 108 developed VAD-related infections, 85 had bacterial infections, and 23 had fungal infections. The only significant factor associated with fungal VAD infections was the use of PN. Importantly, there was a 91% mortality in patients who developed fungal infections compared with a 61% mortality rate in those who developed bacterial VAD infections. When nutrition support is indicated, studies have found greater success and decreased risk of contracting infections through EN as opposed to PN.</p>
<p>Published case studies have reported the success of placing percutaneous feeding tubes in patients with a VAD. Page et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0884533612444537">53</xref></sup> reported the successful placement of a percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube under fluoroscopic guidance on postoperative day 28. EN was required as the patient suffered from neurological deficits and was unable to safely eat by mouth. The patient was able to meet 100% of his estimated energy needs via EN support. Another case study by Slaughter et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0884533612444537">54</xref></sup> reported on a 72-year-old man who required a prolonged period of EN support in which a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was successfully placed. No complications from the PEG insertion or its use were noted over an 11-month period. Finally, Simmons et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0884533612444537">55</xref></sup> reported on a 76-year-old man who received an LVAD and subsequently underwent successful placement of a direct percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy tube. No adverse events were reported. Therefore, if long-term nutrition support is indicated, endoscopic or radiologic placement of a more permanent percutaneous feeding tube for EN appears reasonable.</p>

<title>Feeding the Hemodynamically Compromised VAD Patient</title>
<p>There is a scarcity of data regarding when to feed a mechanical support device patient who is hemodynamically unstable. Many VAD patients may remain critically ill in the pre- and early postoperative periods. In general, there has been much controversy among clinicians whether to provide EN support in the hemodynamically unstable patient with a hypoperfused gut. In the hemodynamically unstable patient, the oxygen demand may be greater than the available supply, leading to bowel ischemia; therefore, feeding the hemodynamically compromised patient can be challenging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0884533612444537">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>Current evidence supports the initiation of EN in critically ill patients within 24–48 hours of admission to the ICU and has been recommended to achieve benefits such as decreased length of ICU stay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0884533612444537">57</xref></sup> Kesek and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0884533612444537">58</xref></sup> recently studied the incidence of complications associated with early EN in patients in a cardiothoracic ICU and concluded that early EN could be safely initiated in this population. They concluded that early EN feeding in the cardiothoracic ICU population, although causing minor hemodynamic alterations, is generally well tolerated and without negative outcomes. Feeding into the small bowel has been shown to decrease the risk of aspiration and gastroesophageal regurgitation and to decrease the length of time required to reach goal feeding rate compared with gastric enteral feeds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0884533612444537">59</xref></sup> Revelly et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0884533612444537">60</xref></sup> studied 9 patients requiring hemodynamic support with catecholamines 1 day after undergoing cardiac surgery. The patients were fed enterally via nasoenteral tubes positioned with the tip distal to the pylorus. During enteral feeding, cardiac index increased (from 2.9–3.3 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>), mean arterial pressure decreased (78–70 mm Hg), indocyanine green clearance increased (527–690 mL/min), and gastric tonometry remained unchanged. They concluded that early EN feeding in the cardiothoracic ICU population, although causing minor hemodynamic alterations, is generally well tolerated and without negative outcomes.</p>
<p>Blood flow to the gut is affected by the content of the diet. Standard polymeric hypo-osmolar formulas without fiber may be initially administered at a “trophic” rate of 10–20 mL/h in patients deemed to be at increased risk of enteral intolerance or bowel ischemia. The rate can be increased to goal as tolerance is demonstrated and the hemodynamic condition improves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0884533612444537">61</xref></sup> A concentrated enteral formula (1.5 kcal/mL) is recommended to provide the greatest amount of calories in a lower volume.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0884533612444537">62</xref></sup> Immune-enhancing diets, including dietary peptides, long-chain fatty acids, and simple carbohydrates, produce maximal vasodilation. Immune-enhancing supplements, including fish oils, have demonstrated improved medical outcomes as infections and length of stay were decreased as compared with immune-enhancing diets without fish oils.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0884533612444537">63</xref></sup> Immune-enhancing supplements containing fish oils may be beneficial for the heart failure and VAD population for reducing inflammatory response and improving overall immune function; however, studies are needed specifically on this population to show their benefit.</p>
<p>Severe GI complications are historically rare following cardiac surgery; however, this may not be the case in the mechanically supported patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0884533612444537">64</xref></sup> Mechanically supported patients are at a significantly higher risk of developing GI complications than patients without preexisting conditions, including renal failure/insufficiency, prior myocardial infarction, and use of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). Postoperative risk factors for mesenteric ischemia following cardiac surgery include mechanical ventilation, low cardiac output, and dependence on vasopressor support. At least one but often all of these risk factors are present after VAD implantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0884533612444537">65</xref></sup> In particular, vasopressors are commonly used in this setting. Vasopressin added to a norepinephrine regimen increases intestinal and gastric mucosal vasoconstriction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0884533612444537">66</xref></sup> However, in a study that evaluated the effect of norepinephrine on jejunal mucosal perfusion using laser Doppler flowmetry and gastric tonometry, mucosal perfusion was monitored in a group of patients with vasodilatory shock following cardiac surgery. The patients were all treated with norepinephrine initially dosed to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 75 mm Hg and then titrated to reach an MAP of 60 mm Hg and then 90 mm Hg for consecutive 30-minute periods. The investigators found that the effect of vasodilatory shock on the patient’s jejunal perfusion was 61% higher than controls and that no change was observed when norepinephrine dosage was increased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0884533612444537">66</xref></sup> In a similar experiment using an animal model, enteral nutrient administration was found to improve both mesenteric and renal blood flow during infusion of vasopressin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0884533612444537">67</xref></sup> The effect of dobutamine on splanchnic blood flow and hepatic metabolic activity in the setting of septic shock was studied by Reinelt et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0884533612444537">68</xref></sup> they found no preferential effect of dobutamine on the splanchnic vascular bed. However, in a porcine model, dobutamine was shown to restore intestinal mucosal blood flow and pH to normal levels in a hyperdynamic porcine shock model and in patients with sepsis.</p>
<p>A recent report on enteral feeding in the setting of vasoactive agent use provides experience-driven recommendations for clinicians when initiating feeding in the hemodynamically unstable patient. The institution of early EN within 24–48 hours of admission to the ICU was recommended along with close monitoring of GI tolerance in the hemodynamically stable patient or the patient in whom vasoactive drug use was below certain dosages, such as ≤5 mcg/min of epinephrine, ≤5 mcg/min of norepinephrine, ≤10 mcg/min of dopamine, ≤0.04 units/min of vasopressin, and ≤0.375 mcg/kg/min of milrinone. They advised against EN use in the hemodynamically unstable patient, those with active bleeding, when MAP &lt;60 mm Hg, when dosages of vasoactive agents are greater than those listed above, and in low-flow states such as cardiac pump failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0884533612444537">69</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>VAD patients have a number of factors that contribute to inadequate oral intake and poor nutrition status prior to surgery, including cardiac cachexia and a variety of GI symptoms often present in the end-stage patient with CHF or after VAD implant. Furthermore, VAD patients seem to be at a higher risk for GI bleeding following device placement, a problem that may interfere with oral and EN intake. Because the VAD is being used both as destination therapy and as a bridge to transplant, it is important to assess the nutrition status of all patients who have undergone VAD insertion and initiate treatment for those who currently are malnourished or who are at risk of malnutrition. Although many institutions use serum prealbumin level as a marker for malnutrition for listing a patient for transplant or VAD candidacy, current evidence shows this test is not an accurate indicator of nutrition status due to the presence of concomitant inflammation. BMI may also be misleading due to fluid retention. Handgrip assessment may be a useful tool for assessment of malnutrition; however, further studies are needed in this patient population. Other nutrition assessment tools need to be developed for assessing this patient population so that transplant institutions can create new guidelines for nutrition candidacy for transplant or device insertion. In the meantime, attention to physical assessment, diet intake, and weight history is required.</p>
<p>To reinforce the importance of patient compliance to diet recommendations, education is important before and after VAD implantation to include sodium and fluid restriction, micronutrient monitoring and supplementation, and other areas as indicated. Previous studies have found that a 1-hour heart failure education session prior to hospital discharge resulted in reduced risk of poor outcomes, increased adherence to recommendations, and decreased the overall cost of care in patients with heart failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0884533612444537">70</xref></sup> Furthermore, education from a registered dietitian regarding a 2-g sodium diet in patients with heart failure has been shown to result in a statistically significant improvement in diet adherence compared with simply providing literature on nutrition guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0884533612444537">71</xref></sup> Ensuring that the patient’s family or caregivers are present at the time of education appears to produce better outcomes than educating patients alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0884533612444537">72</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612444537">Table 1</xref> provides our recommendations for nutrition care for the VAD patient based on review of available literature in the cardiac, heart failure, and/or VAD populations. Appropriate and adequate nutrition support in the VAD patient is important for promoting postoperative healing, minimizing possible complications, and increasing survival rates. Additional studies are needed to better understand the short- and long-term nutrition complications and the optimal nutrition strategies when managing patients before and after VAD placement. Even though there are insufficient data on the utility of supplementation with B vitamins in the VAD patient, this may be a reasonable option in patients who have inadequate oral intake. Vitamin D and zinc supplementation should be considered in patients with known deficiency. The administration of early EN delivered postpylorically is recommended if an oral diet cannot be initiated within 24–48 hours of admission to the ICU in the severely ill pre- or postoperative VAD patient. This should be encouraged for all VAD patients because of the complications that can arise postoperatively. Although VAD placement should correct hemodynamic instability, these patients may remain hemodynamically unstable for a period of time or even require vasopressors in the early postoperative period. Such patients should be considered candidates for EN support, particularly if malnourished at baseline, but should be monitored closely for potential complications and intolerance. Formula selection is important and lower fiber products may have better tolerance. More evidence is needed on the use of immune-enhancing formulations in the VAD population. Clearly, more data are needed in the hemodynamically unstable VAD patient population as the available data are often extrapolated from critical care, animal studies, or general cardiac surgery patients. VAD patients also have other factors that contribute to inadequate oral intake and poor nutrition status prior to surgery, including cardiac cachexia and a variety of GI symptoms present in the end-stage patient with CHF or after VAD implant. Furthermore, VAD patients seem to be at an increased risk for GI bleeding after device placement, which can lead to weight loss. VAD patients’ nutrition status should be monitored both in the short term and the long term by the medical team and referred to a registered dietitian as indicated. Although further study is needed, it is probable that the provision of optimal nutrition will improve VAD patient outcomes, help the VAD patients regain the strength to achieve physical therapy goals, and improve their quality of life.</p>
