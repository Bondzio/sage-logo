<body>
<p>Karl Marx opened <italic>Capital</italic> by stating that, ‘the wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as “an immense accumulation of commodities”’. Indeed, the capacity of the capitalist mode of production to generate vast amounts of commodities is a feature that distinguishes it from prior modes of production. Contemporary ecological critiques of capitalism, especially those insisting on patterns of consumption and the need to ‘de-grow’, insist that we must break away from the ‘productivist’ logic of capital in order to reach ecological sustainability.</p>
<p>It may therefore come as a surprise to find capitalism defined in terms of ‘scarcity’, as does the sociologist Costas Panayotakis in the book under review. Yet, it is a profound mistake (although one often made) to conflate the ‘immense accumulation of commodities’ produced under capitalism with the satisfaction of human needs, as Panayotakis aptly demonstrates. Actually, the gap between the immense productive capacities of the system, and the persistence (even the increase) of poverty and inequalities is a major contradiction of capitalist social relations. Under capitalism, the production of ‘use values’ (the goods and services that satisfy human needs) is constrained by the imperative of value, that is, the need for goods and services to take the form of commodities and, hence, to have an exchange value (a price), in order to generate profits. Decisions over the allocation of investment do not follow the democratic wishes of the people, but are based on private expectations of profit aimed at increasing the accumulation of capital by its possessors, irrespective of the social and ecological consequences of these decisions. And the access to the commodities thus produced is constrained by the possession of money, not by the strength of human needs. Therefore, some of the most pressing and basic (yet insolvable) needs remain unfulfilled, whereas scarce resources are wasted on luxury items, and other socially inefficient (over)productions.</p>
<p>Panayotakis insists that these inequalities and inefficiencies are not marginal to capitalism, but are constitutive of its very logic as an undemocratic form of economic organisation. Indeed, because economic power is monopolised by the owner of capital, economic decisions do not reflect the needs of the vast majority. Moreover, this undemocratic structure of capitalism is at the root of the ecological crisis in that it encourages an inefficient use of natural resources. As the author puts it (p. 150):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Capitalism’s irrationality stems from its undemocratic nature and its subordination of humanity to an abstract logic of profit and capital expansion that escapes human control. It is because of this logic that capitalism’s regular development of its productive potential is inseparable from its threat to inflict unprecedented levels of harm on human beings and the planet.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Yet Panayotakis is equally critical of Marxist perspectives that entertain the possibility of abolishing scarcity altogether under socialism. In his opinion, an economic democracy should not abolish scarcity, but should rather be able to ‘manage it in accordance with ecological sustainability and people’s autonomously formed desires’ (p. 5).</p>
<p>There are really two parts to Panayotakis’s enjoyable book. In the first, the author delineates a Marxist perspective on scarcity (as well as on other important economic concepts which are often marginalised in Marxist discussions, such as consumption) from mainstream economic theories, and shows its superiority to neoclassical perspectives. I found this to be the most interesting and original part of the book, because the author has an impressive command of the North-American Marxian literature which he puts to very good use, in a pedagogical manner. Difficult theoretical discussions are eased with appropriate examples, and a capacity to explain and discuss concepts clearly. It makes for a very good introduction to Marxist economic thought. Panayotakis, an editor of the journal <italic>Capitalism, Nature, Socialism</italic>, is especially good in the chapter on scarcity and ecological crisis, where by drawing on radical political economists such as Joan Martinez-Alier, Joel Kovel or James Boyce, he is able to demonstrate the link between democratic decision making and a sustainable relation to nature.</p>
<p>The second part was the one that originally drew my attention to this book. It discusses economic democracy as a response to capitalism’s destructions and sufferings. Yet although it reviews the work of some of the leading theorists in the field of market socialism and democratic planning (John Roemer, David Schweickart, Michael Albert, Robin Hahnel) it is too thin to make a convincing case. Important references (in my opinion), such as Pat Devine’s <italic>Democracy and Economic Planning</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309816813489943">1988</xref>) or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309816813489943">Michael Löwy’s (2007)</xref> discussion of ecological planning are omitted altogether. The drawbacks of this part’s shortness are not just theoretical but also political in the sense that the propositions for a transition to economic democracy advanced at the end of the book are unfortunately overly abstract (compared with, say, those of Andy Cumbers’s more recent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309816813489943">2012</xref>] book on a similar topic).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this critique, <italic>Remaking Scarcity</italic> provides a very good and easy-to-understand introduction to the Marxist analysis of capitalism, and an account of the destructions and miseries brought about by this economic system. Furthermore, it makes a valuable contribution to the discussion on scarcity, which will be of special interest to those interested in Marxist analyses of the ecological crisis – a very timely contribution, indeed.</p>
