<p><italic>Why Literacy Matters: Understanding the Effects of Literacy Education for Adults</italic> examines humanist scholar Ralf St. Clair’s global interests in literacy and reflects on his idealism with regard to literacy education. St. Clair marshals a trove of research from what he calls the “global north” to position literacy as a problematic that is an ongoing task for most adult educators and policy makers. He presents illuminating, engaging, and substantive arguments to expand the discourse and justify literacy as central to human life. The work is absorbing, original, and a useful resource for professors, graduate students, policy makers, and other literacy advocates and enthusiasts seeking insights into implications for adult literacy education policy and practice. Furthermore, his work presents the pressing issues and complex challenges facing literacy in the age of globalization.</p>
<p>The book situates the author as an authority on the subject of literacy, broadly covering some of the field’s most dominant and thorny issues. This is achieved in a penetrating analysis of the historical and theoretical evidence to demystify areas that are subject to misinterpretation and misunderstanding. St. Clair establishes the fluidity of the term <italic>literacy</italic> while examining it within the parameters of society, family, and individual. His approach is ambitious and far-reaching, with a full range of measures to the reader about the impact of literacy learning on the adult. Comprehension is reached by highlighting the cultural and social competency levels of the individual and assessing its impact for the collective and societal good. The author’s revealing <italic>capability model</italic> is central to the book and advances various hypotheses on literacy and its transformative effect on thinking and learning. The model recognizes a complex set of relationships and interacting outcomes on cognition, social practices, and other realities that include economics, politics, psychology, health, and family.</p>
<p>Most intriguing are the chapters in the second half of the book that touch on the socioeconomic realities of income and employment and other challenging social issues. For example, St. Clair discusses health literacy where, for the first time, he draws heavily from data in developing countries to add the “global south” perspective. Commensurate with this investigation, he examines family values to promote and enhance the capabilities of both children and parents and the ensuing social and political impact; in this regard, literacy capabilities within community context, even when they are at their best, may not address modern social inequalities or inspire social change. This section also brings to life an urgent discourse around the advantages of literacy capabilities, whether from the autonomous view to its functionalist or technical-functionalist arguments with broader socioeconomic implications (p. 99). Despite these triumphs, the text is not without its shortcomings. A missing link in the literacy capabilities model is the place of digitalization and technology, very contemporary and significant phenomena that add meaningful dimension to the timeliness and currency of the arguments in the text. Furthermore, there is a glaring absence of any mention of race, gender, class, and sexuality, which very often intersect and are central to literacy debates.</p>
<p>The subtleties of literacy and education in the text are nuanced and evocative of current debates in the field. Literacy is not the same as education. However, more important to St. Clair’s adult literacy discussion is the divide where adult literacy and schooling become intertwined as sources of data. Even with a primary focus on adults in the arguments, particularly on matters related to work contexts or social factors—self-efficacy, self-direction, confidence, and autonomy—St. Clair sees the two literacies as complementary and to be viewed within the context of lifelong learning where “age and situation of learners is more open”(p. 9).</p>
<p>The layout of <italic>Why Literacy Matters</italic> makes for a sequential and systematic development of thought about literacy capabilities in a region where text has been an important instrument of knowledge for centuries. St. Clair provokes inquiry into literacy perceptions that have shifted temporally and socially while adding intellectual content to the literacy dialectic. Ultimately, we learn how these elements play out in our lives and shape the way we come to understand ourselves and others in society.</p>
