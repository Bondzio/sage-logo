<title>PRQ and the WPSA</title>
<p><italic>PRQ</italic>, formerly the <italic>Western Political Quarterly</italic>, has been owned and published by the University of Utah since 1948. Since 1971, it has been a cooperative endeavor between the University of Utah and the WPSA. The Memorandum of Understanding governing this cooperative effort may be obtained by contacting Bill Haltom (<email>haltom@pugetsound.edu</email>) or Richard Clucas (<email>hprc@pdx.edu</email>). Since 2007, SAGE has served as the publisher of the journal.</p>

<sec id="section5-1065912912463538">
<title>Financial Arrangements</title>
<p>Historically, editors of the <italic>PRQ</italic> have received support both from the University of Utah, owner of the <italic>PRQ</italic>, and the editors’ home institution. Support from the home institution has typically included graduate assistant support, reduced teaching assignment, clerical support, office space, and operational funds. Editorial subvention from the <italic>PRQ</italic> (University of Utah) is provided to the editors. Annually, the editors provide an invoice outlining their intended use for the subvention. Expenses have typically included <italic>PRQ</italic>-related travel, office supplies, reception at conferences, telecommunications, postage, and editorial assistants. Copy editing and printing are handled by SAGE.</p>
<p>Contact Bill Haltom (<email>haltom@pugetsound.edu</email>) or Richard Clucas (<email>hprc@pdx.edu</email>) for information on the subvention amount and other financial matters. Further information about the operation of <italic>PRQ</italic> and the search is available on the WPSA website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wpsa.research.pdx.edu/pub/PRQ.php">http://wpsa.research.pdx.edu/pub/PRQ.php</ext-link></p>
<p>Candidates are also welcome to communicate directly with the current editors, Cornell Clayton (<email>cwclayton@wsu.edu</email>) and Amy Mazur (Mazur@wsu.edu).</p>
