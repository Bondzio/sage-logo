<abstract>
<p>Studies have found that indoor air pollution affects human, especially children and the elderly, more compared to ambient atmospheric air. This study aims to investigate respirable suspended particulate matter (RSP) concentration in selected primary schools with different surrounding human activities, and to establish statistical relationships between indoor and outdoor air pollutant concentrations in each selected schools in Kuala Terengganu. Failure to identify and establish indoor air pollution status can increase health problems for these young students and degrade their learning environment and comfort. Indoor air quality (IAQ) parameters in seven primary schools were conducted during the monsoon season of August 2008 until March 2009. Ineach classroom, RSP, air velocity, relative humidity and temperature were monitored during school hours, and a complete walkthrough survey was completed. Results show a statistically significant difference for the six IAQ parameters between the seven schools at the 95% confidence level. Indoor concentration levels were mainly affected by RSP of outdoor concentration levels, since there are strong relationships of RSP concentration between indoor and outdoor in all schools except for control school. We conclude our findings by confirming the important influence of surrounding human activities on indoor concentrations of pollutants at primary schools in Kuala Terengganu.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11420180"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Indoor air pollution has been identified as one of the most critical global environmental problems in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11420180">1</xref>]. Until the late 1960s, attention to air quality was primarily focused on the outdoors because, by that time, outdoor air pollution was considered responsible for many adverse health effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11420180">2</xref>]. However, many studies have found that indoor pollutants levels are greater than outdoor levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11420180">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11420180">4</xref>]. In fact, a growing body of scientific evidence has also indicated that the air within the buildings can be more seriously polluted than the outdoor air in even the largest and most industrialized city [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11420180">5</xref>].</p>
<p>People spend most of their time indoors and in institutional buildings, such as schools, which represent a significant fraction of the day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11420180">6</xref>]; and since people spend more than 60% to 90% of their time indoors, good indoor air quality (IAQ) is very important. Children are one of the most sensitive population subgroups since proportionally a higher dose of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSP) could be received into their lungs compared to adults due to the greater fractional deposition with each breath and/or larger minute ventilation relative to lung size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11420180">7</xref>].</p>
<p>During the last decades, several research works have studied the relationship between indoor and outdoor concentrations of different air pollutants, in various and different environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11420180">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11420180">10</xref>]. In fact, several studies indicated that indoor air pollutants concentration levels varied primarily and linearly with outdoor air concentration levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11420180">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11420180">13</xref>]. Nevertheless, epidemiological studies have associated short-term peak PM exposures with significant adverse health effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11420180">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11420180">15</xref>]. Therefore, surrounding activities play an important role in influencing the indoor air concentrations. This is more so to building which utilize natural ventilation system as the main source of air exchange.</p>
<p>Due to this fact, an IAQ study was carried out in selected vernacular public schools in Terengganu state, Malaysia. This study is imperative because children spend the majority of 6 to 7 h of their school day in school buildings, especially inside classrooms. Furthermore, few studies have been reported as regards to indoor air pollution status of schools in the East Coast of Malaysia since Kuala Terengganu is still developing and forged ahead towards industrialized state by the year 2020. For that reason, this study is timely and essential as to determine the actual IAQ status especially in the schools, where our nation's so-called future leaders are trained. Therefore, the aim of this research is to determine the concentrations of particulate matter, temperature, relative humidity and air velocity in selected schools in Kuala Terengganu; and also to evaluate IAQ trends in the monitored areas and between samples; comparing them with existing IAQ guidelines and standards; and to establish statistical relationships between indoor and outdoor air pollutant concentrations in each selected schools.</p>

<p>In each school, only classrooms were selected due to the fact that students spend majority of their time in classroom compared to other specific-purposes room such as library, computer lab, science lab, etc. Measurement of RSP concentration levels inside and outside each of the schools’ classrooms was carried out in the month of August 2008 until March 2009. Within each school, three classrooms were randomly selected to be sampled. Randomization procedure was performed using the following formula generated in MS Excel spreadsheet. Participant consenting are approved by the Terengganu Education Department.

<p>This study was conducted in public schools having the same design and identical number of windows, doors and fans inside each classroom. No air-conditioning system existed in any classroom of each selected school. Furthermore, uniform number of pupils in each class (fixed by Malaysian Ministry of Education) and of the same age (all were below eight years old and therefore similar metabolic rate) were included. Besides that, all selected classes were at ground floor of each school. The only difference between these seven schools was the on-going activity outside each school. Therefore, RSP concentration for each school was assumed to be determined solely by these activities. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X11420180">Table 2</xref> shows the selected schools with human activities within 100 m radius and the explanation based on visual assessment.

<p>All of the air-monitoring equipments used in this study were supplied by the Department of Engineering Science, Universiti Malaysia Terengganu (UMT). RSP concentrations were determined by using Casella Microdust Pro, which utilizes forward light scattering technique for 5-min sampling period for each occasion to obtain representative data.</p>
<p>Measurement was conducted in occupied rooms over a 4-day period (3 school days and 1 non-school day) in each school from 8 am to 1.30 pm (school hours). Grab sampling monitoring technique was used in this study. The probe was placed at 0.8 m above the floor, away from windows and doors, and also 0.5 m away from bookshelves and out of reach of children.</p>
<p>The sampling technique for this study was based on the Code of Practice on Indoor Air Quality by DOSH, Malaysia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11420180">16</xref>]. All the data collected were transferred into a spreadsheet, that is, MS Excel for analysis via RS232. Fitness to normal distribution and homogeneity of variance of the data were examined by employing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for goodness of fit and Cochran's test for homogeneity of variances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X11420180">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1420326X11420180">18</xref>]. Where normality and homogeneity of variance of the data were confirmed, single classification analysis of variance (ANOVA) <italic>F</italic> test was performed.</p>

<p>Indoor RSP levels were higher than the corresponding outdoor level. This was in good agreement with studies conducted by Diapouli et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X11420180">19</xref>], and Lee and Chang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1420326X11420180">20</xref>] reported that the measured indoor RSP concentration were higher than outdoor RSP concentration. This was due to housekeeping activities including sweeping and cleaning habits; writing on the blackboard using chalks and erasing using duster; painting and opening windows and doors. Diapouli et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X11420180">19</xref>] found out that indoor particles’ concentration could be influenced by indoor particle generation and by infiltration of outdoor air. In fact, indoor particle generation could result from specific sources or by human activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1420326X11420180">21</xref>]. Building occupants could also contribute to the sources of air pollutants inside the classroom which comprised of metabolic activities such as respiration, perspiration, running and playing. Furthermore, Poupard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X11420180">22</xref>] affirmed that the presence of people indoors could cause higher PM levels. Thus, the high indoor PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations presented in the present work may be attributed to re-suspension and generation of particles by the presence of pupils inside the classrooms.</p>
<p>Overall, there were differences in RSP distributions among all the schools. As the <italic>p</italic> value of the <italic>F</italic>-test in the ANOVA table was 0.03 (&amp;#60;0.05), there was statistically significant difference between the means of the seven schools at the 95% confidence level.</p>
<p>The recommended threshold level for respirable particulates (for particulate ≤10 µm) given by the Code of Practice (COP), Malaysia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11420180">16</xref>] is 150 µg/m<sup>3</sup>. However, the mean RSP concentrations in all schools were within the recommended value.</p>
<p>To better visualize, spatial distributions were illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1420326X11420180">Figure 6</xref> at fixed times only, at 8:00 am, 10:00 am and 12:00 noon. The spatial distribution of RSP for each hour appeared to be well circulated. The small arrows shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1420326X11420180">Figure 6</xref> are the movement of the RSP distribution depending on the wind circulation inside the classroom. Basically, the highest concentration spot would move and distribute to the lowest concentration spot.
<fig id="fig6-1420326X11420180" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Spatial distribution of a class in all schools.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11420180-fig6a.tif"/><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11420180-fig6b.tif"/><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11420180-fig6c.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The spatial distribution of RSP for each selected hour was well circulated and appeared to be different among all the schools. The highest concentration of RSP was at 8:00 am and 10:00 am, where at 8:00 am was at SKBW and SKPP, and at 10:00 am was at SKSS1, SKC, SKGB, SKTAM and SKKGB. The highest of RSP concentration was mostly concentrated near to the blackboard (where usually dust from chalks accumulate), opening windows and doors, and also places where the pupils always gathered, that is, near teacher's desk. The lowest RSP concentration was mostly at places located beneath the fans. This was because particulate under the fans would be dispersed by the fan to other location due to wind circulation. This suggestion was supported by Milner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X11420180">23</xref>] in his study that a high wind speed would enhance dispersion and decrease concentration level. For SKGB, although the RSP concentrations at 10:00 am and 12:00 noon were almost the same, the wind circulation at that time differentiated them, whereby at 10:00 am the wind circulates vertically and at 12:00 noon, the wind circulates horizontally.</p>
<p>Almost all schools had the highest concentration at 10:00 am, which was directly after recess hour, when the pupils begin entering the class and caused the particulate to suspend faster in the class. Most of the highest concentrations were near the classroom window where the outdoor air flows in. This could be due to the fact that all the classrooms were naturally ventilated. Some of the schools had a high concentration of RSP in the morning between 8.00 and 8.30 am because of the high dew point at this time, causing the dew to trap the suspended particle. Moreover, at that time of the day, meteorological conditions (low wind, morning inversion, etc.) were in general, favouring the accumulation of high concentrations of pollutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1420326X11420180">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Indoor and outdoor relationships for RSP concentrations were presented for all schools in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1420326X11420180">Figure 7</xref>; where indoor RSP concentration (<italic>I</italic><sub>RSP</sub>) versus outdoor RSP concentration (<italic>O</italic><sub>RSP</sub>) was exhibited in regression line. There were strong relationships of RSP concentration between indoor and outdoor at all schools that is SKPP, SKSS1, SKC, SKGB, SKTAM and SKKGB, respectively, except for the control school (i.e. SKBW).
<fig id="fig7-1420326X11420180" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Indoor vs outdoor concentration levels for respirable suspended particulate (RSP) matter in all schools.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11420180-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Overall, positive correlation was identified for indoor and outdoor air quality of RSP concentrations in all the schools. The relationships between <italic>I</italic><sub>RSP</sub> and <italic>O</italic><sub>RSP</sub> in all the schools were established using a simple regression linear model analysis, resulting in the equations written in the figures. These correlations were ranked from strongest to weakest. The strongest correlation was at SKPP (<italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 0.966), followed by SKGB (<italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 0.841), SKTAM (<italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 0.832), SKKGB (<italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 0.832), SKC (<italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 0.781) and SKSS1 (<italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 0.750).</p>
<p>According to the ranking, the unplanned residential area had the strongest relationship, which was very close to the kampong area where there was an on-going open-burning activity in the villages nearby. Second strongest was in the industrial area where the cement factory and house construction across the road had contributed to the RSP concentrations. The rest in the order of concentration ranking were in commercial area, planned residential area, coastal area and, lastly, traffic area. Therefore, these correlations indicated an important role of the outdoor particles which had an impact on the indoor concentration levels. However, only SKBW showed no significant relationship between indoor and outdoor RSP concentration. This was expected due to the fact that the school was in a control area where there were no human activities outside SKBW.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1420326X11420180"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study has shown that different activities could contribute much to the concentration of indoor concentrations of RSP. The results showed that children attending primary school in the Kuala Terengganu area could be exposed to significant concentration levels, both indoors and outdoors. Temperature, relative humidity and air velocity levels were almost the same in all the schools. Variation in temperature and relative humidity levels were dependent on the ventilation systems installed in each classroom. Meanwhile, air velocity levels would not be influenced by any surrounding human activities.</p>
<p>There exist strong relationships of indoor and outdoor RSP concentrations, which were demonstrated by the monitoring results at all the schools where the indoor concentrations were greatly influenced by outdoor concentrations due to combustion, industries and traffics. Indoor and outdoor concentration of RSP showed a significant positive correlation. The highest value of coefficient of determination of the regression curve between indoor and outdoor for RSP was at the unplanned residential area where <italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 0.966. Vehicular emissions and industrial activities could be the major anthropogenic sources of the measured outdoor concentrations levels at the studies area, whereas the major natural sources could be mainly windborne dust and sea spray.</p>
<p>Therefore, for building of new school, the Malaysian Ministry of Education should provide a buffer zone between the school and its surrounding activities, especially for schools located in industrial and heavy traffic areas that is, critical area.</p>
<p>Furthermore, preliminary study of air quality status in area planned for building new schools should be performed to determine the baseline concentration. Meanwhile, for existing school located in critical area, mechanical ventilation system that is, air-conditioning must be installed to ensure a conducive and comfortable teaching and learning environment.</p>
