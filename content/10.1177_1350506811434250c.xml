<p>The title of this book, unlike many others, really does reflect the contents. The book draws us into a thought-provoking journey that engages readers with the key participants and their immediate and extended families.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the book was to present an ethnographic longitudinal analysis of how white members of mixed-race families in the Midlands of the United Kingdom deal with race, racism, whiteness and racial identity.</p>
<p><italic>A White Side of Black Britain</italic> explores the thinking and the discourses of white women who have established families with black Caribbean men. The book begins with the introduction of two new theoretical concepts: racial literacy and ethnic capital. It goes on to describe, among other things, how the women in the longitudinal study cope with racism, how their thinking about race and whiteness has been challenged and changed over time, how their whiteness can be viewed either as a social liability or as a source of injury to their families and how they raise their ‘trans-racial’ children to become racially literate.</p>
<p>Twine draws on British race literature to provide an historical context that illuminates ongoing debate and discussion on the notion of ‘identity’ in mixed-race families.</p>
<p>A fascinating aspect of the book is the way Twine uses vignettes from the women’s lives to help illustrate the various coping strategies that they use as a way to grapple with the difficulties they encounter within their immediate and wider families.</p>
<p>The following extract from the first page of Twine’s book draws the reader straight into the main argument of the book:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The issue of being white comes up for me every day. It’s not a theoretical pondering, it’s a day-to-day struggle to make sense of who I am … I live in Brixton … my lover is black; so is the woman I live with. I can cook sadza or curry at the drop of a hat, but I don’t have a clue how to cook roast beef. Yet it is my lifestyle and I am a white person. I’m not trying to be anyone else but me. Nonetheless, I find that when people discover these things about me, they accuse (and it is an accusation) me? of trying to be some kind of ‘honorary black’. It seems to me there isn’t a category to describe people like me. (Twine, 2010: 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I found <italic>A White Side of Black Britain</italic> very well and clearly written. It provided an effortless and stimulating read that provoked debate with friends and colleagues long after I had read it. The enlightening stories vividly illustrated the complex effects and challenges of living in a mixed-race relationship. The discourses drew me in, and I found it hard to put the book down. The photographs added life and reality to the text.</p>
<p>As a ‘visibly’ black person who has been socialized as ‘white’ within a white adoptive family, I could feel empathy with the stories that Twine describes. This is where the concept of intersectionality is particularly relevant as we are not referring to self-contained black, white or gender scenarios but instead stepping into murky waters without any clear definitions of what is black and white when people have been socialized into different ethnic groups. Twine takes on a range of inter-relating themes that emerge within the book as she presents debates around class versus race, race versus gender and/or a combination of all of them. The discussion takes a range of twists and curves, deepening and maturing as the participants’ journeys unfold.</p>
<p><italic>A White Side of Black Britain</italic> raises important questions such as how white women are raising children as members of black–white interracial families, what meanings are attributed to their whiteness and how class inequality, gender regimes and prescriptions for respectable femininity mediate the ways that white women are evaluated in transracial families.</p>
<p>The way in which Twine features and captures the conversations in the book through language and illustrations make the book appealing to a range of audiences.</p>
