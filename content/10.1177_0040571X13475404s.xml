<p>Examining church statistics is a depressing exercise for many denominations, with declines observed nationally being mirrored often locally, as congregations age and diminish. For many, their response is that of the ostrich, and understandably so, when the cultural and demographic challenges faced are seemingly so intractable. But as an unlikely proponent of church growth might say, ‘A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.’ The aim of Robert Warren’s <italic>Healthy Churches Handbook</italic> is to provide travellers with guidance on how to take the first, critical paces towards turning around the decline that has affected so many for so long.</p>
<p>The book builds on extensive experience that has found that quick-fix solutions to the challenges of enabling church growth simply do not exist. Rather, ensuring the growth of churches is incidental to the more important task of ensuring their health; an endeavour that demands time, honesty and commitment. Encouragingly, the book presents experience that shows that the health of churches is independent of tradition or context – urban or rural, catholic or charismatic – all can be healthy and grow.</p>
<p>The book invites churches to develop ‘seven marks of a healthy church’. Healthy churches, identified as those that are ‘energised by faith’, have an ‘outward-looking focus’ and ‘seek to find out what God wants’. They ‘face the cost of change and growth’, ‘operate as a community’, ‘make room for all’ and ‘do a few things and do them well’. The marks are based on empirical research on the characteristics of growing churches and pains are taken to demonstrate that they are not merely pragmatic but are consonant with values expressed by Christ. The point is also made that they cannot be applied in an over-tidy or restrictive fashion and that no single mark is ever determinative; it is their interplay that makes for a church’s health. The book also proposes balancing its left-brain encouragement to consider the marks of health with the use of a right-brain approach to considering the description of what could be described as a church’s ‘angel’; its ethos, culture, personality and vocation.</p>
<p>The strength of the handbook is the detailed advice it gives on how to move beyond merely talking about the ideas it contains towards engaging with them so that action can occur. As well as chapters on facilitation and change management, the book contains comprehensive outlines of approaches that can be used to help churches think about their health and its improvement. Working bottom-up is advocated so that churches can understand their situation, make decisions about becoming more healthy and turn choices made into action and development.</p>
<p>Should this book be used? If I were to describe it in a phrase I’d call it ‘Good Housekeeping for Churches’. Not to care for the household of God would be a strange decision for any church to make. Why not take the step of finding out if this book could enhance the care, and health, of yours?</p>
