<sec id="sec1-1468017312457933"><title>Veronica Coulshed and Joan Orme, <italic>Social work practice</italic>, 5th edn. Basingstoke: BASW/Palgrave Macmillan, 2012, 299 pp., £18.99 (pbk), ISBN 97802303000743.</title>
<sec id="sec2-1468017312457933"><title><bold>Reviewed by</bold>: Isabel Martin, <italic>Argyll and Bute Council, Scotland</italic></title>
<p>This, the fifth edition of the classic <italic>Social Work Practice</italic>, is a wonderful legacy to Veronica Coulshed who together with Joan Orme created the original clear, robust and highly valued text which has been used over and over again during the 24 years since its first appearance. <italic>Social Work Practice</italic> has been a tried and tested text used by students and social work educators as its editions have consistently provided an understandable and straightforward introduction to the themes current in social work according to the context of the time at which they were written.</p>
<p>Things have certainly changed and this is acknowledged in Joan Orme’s preface to the fifth edition where she writes about the challenge of updating the text at a time when the definition and meaning of social work is shifting and changing. However, Joan Orme makes pertinent comment in her conclusion that while social work is all about change and subject to continuous change the prevailing constants concern the individual, relationship, values, culture, organization and society. If you expect this to be a routinely upgraded version of the last edition you will be mistaken! This version catapults the reader straight into the current active themes and debates taking place around all aspects of social work practice. As such it should be essential reading for not only beginners in social work but also for those who need a bit of refresher about what is happening in the practice perspective of our changing profession. What I particularly like is the way that Joan Orme chooses not to dwell on looking backwards at the preceding, though fascinating, path of social work but takes us straight into the current themes, especially the vital role of critical analysis in our professional practice and why practice needs theory. For those of you who wince a little at the mention of theory, read this section as you will learn why you must develop a theoretical understanding in order to provide the best practice you can in these challenging times. This is not to say that June Orme ignores the contribution of previous prevalent ideas, such as the psychoanalytical framework for casework training and practice in the 1970s, and she identifies where earlier models retain vitally important relevance for now, such as in counselling. Remaining the same from earlier editions is a very clearly laid out structure with a comprehensive contents section that sets out at a glance where the items can be found. The text format is easy to read though I think the references to ‘relective’ and ‘relexive’ practice on page 12 are misprints.</p>
<p>The book is structured into three main parts, Social Work Processes, Methods of Intervention and Contexts of Intervention. These sections then concentrate on the critical analysis of assessment, advocacy and partnership, communication, reflection and review. Intervention methods cover critical analysis of counselling, crisis intervention, problem solving, solution-focused and cognitive behavioural work, while the last section provides overviews of work with children and families, adults, groups and communities. The section regarding children and families makes no apology for being an overview, and points the reader to further exploration of the specialized aspects of the work.</p>
<p>As in previous editions each chapter offers a relevant practice focus, case example and outlines points for reflection and signposts for putting the ideas into practice.</p>
<p>If the reader needs an exemplar in critically analytical and reflective writing, this edition of <italic>Social Work Practice</italic> provides it. Joan Orme’s style is an excellent illustration of how to write in the way which is now required from students, educators and practitioners alike. I particularly appreciate how she has consistently made connections between the individual and the context of socio-political factors within which social workers must recognize that they have a role, and she compares and contrasts developments across the UK.</p>
<p>Clearly, this publication cannot aim to develop fully all the ideas contained within it, but hopefully it will provide beginners to social work practice a direction to follow if they are to develop their social work practice today and in the future. I strongly recommend this book as essential reading for all those working in any form of social work practice, as it accurately reflects the current state of social work in the UK. It is not only a map of up-to-the-minute UK social work themes and practices, but an extremely valuable ‘users’ handbook’ which should help us all if we need to find out which way to go, or if we think we might lose our way.</p>
