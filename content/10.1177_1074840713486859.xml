<p>How do you capture the magic of the 10th International Family Nursing Conference (IFNC10) in Kyoto, Japan? Sponsored by the Japanese Association for Research in Family Nursing (JARFN) and chaired by Dr. Michiko Moriyama, Professor, Hiroshima University, the successful IFNC10 was a testament to the vision, courage, and resilience of family nursing colleagues in Japan. It also surpassed all other previous International Family Nursing Conference (IFNC) attendance records with 1007 participants from 34 countries, including 718 participants from Japan and 289 from outside of Japan (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1074840713486859">Table 1</xref>). (IFNC10 Final Conference Program and Abstracts are archived with all previous IFNC conference programs at the Family Nursing Collection, DSpace, University of Calgary <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dspace.ucalgary.ca/handle/1880/49461">http://dspace.ucalgary.ca/handle/1880/49461</ext-link>).</p>

<p>On March 11, 2011, just 3 months before IFNC10, an earthquake registering M9.0 struck Japan, creating catastrophe, death, and international mourning. As Lorraine Wright eloquently wrote in her blog, “Tears are Not Enough: How Can we Help Heal Japan?” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lorrainewright.com/blog.htm">http://www.lorrainewright.com/blog.htm</ext-link>), family nursing colleagues around the world were saddened by this terrible news and committed to help the suffering of thousands of Japanese families. Meanwhile, nursing leaders of JARFN remained steadfastly hopeful and confident that the intense planning for the IFNC10 conference scheduled for June 24-28, 2011 would continue without disruption (for more information about JARFN see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840713486859">Ishigaki, 2013</xref>). Their dreams were realized on a sunny morning in Kyoto on June 25, 2011, when 1,007 conference participants were warmly welcomed at the Opening Ceremonies at the Kyoto International Conference Center. The 18th Annual Meeting of JARFN, chaired by Dr. Naohiro Hohashi, Professor, Kobe University, simultaneously took place in the same venue. The colorful Opening Ceremonies featured a pageant of music, drummers, children, and female dancers in traditional Japanese clothing.</p>
<p>Dr. Michiko Moriyama welcomed conference participants and thanked them for travelling to Japan to show their support for IFNC10 and the people of Japan. The Disaster Memorial Lecture was a poignant address given by Dr. Aiko Yamamoto, Chairperson of the <italic>World Society of Disaster Nursing.</italic> The front page of the Conference Final Program and Abstracts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dspace.ucalgary.ca/handle/1880/49461">http://dspace.ucalgary.ca/handle/1880/49461</ext-link>) included Dr. Moriyama’s acknowledgment of Japan’s enormous disaster:<disp-quote>
<p>I offer my deepest condolences to the victims of the M9.0 earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan’s Tohoku Region on March 11. At the same time, I wish to express my heartfelt gratitude to those members of the global community who have stood up in support of Japan at this difficult time.</p>
<p>Although there are still some political issues to be resolved, the rest of our Japanese population is firmly resolved to move forward by reexamining and reflecting on our values, lifestyles, and social systems in response to this catastrophe. I look forward to your continued guidance and encouragement of our efforts toward reconstruction and reclaiming our lives, families, and communities.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The theme of the IFNC10 was “<italic>Making Family Nursing Visible: From Knowledge Building to Knowledge Translation”</italic>. A variety of conference keynote speeches, symposia, and oral presentations reported efforts being made around the world to make family nursing visible. Family nursing research made visible was featured in a symposium on Family Nursing Research Instruments examining family functioning variables and family nurse variables (with papers by Drs. Kathleen Sawin, Suzanne Feetham, Kathleen Knafl, Britt-Inger Saveman and colleagues, and Ms. Tamaki Miyauchi). As the moderator of this session, I developed a blog which summarized the efforts made by family nurses to develop research instruments: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.janicembell.com/2011/06/family-nursing-research-instruments-developed-by-family-nurses/">http://www.janicembell.com/2011/06/family-nursing-research-instruments-developed-by-family-nurses/</ext-link>. A keynote speech delivered by Dr. Larry Ganong offered an encouraging update (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1074840713486859">Ganong, 2011</xref>) to his original analysis and critique of family nursing research published in the <italic>Journal of Family Nursing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840713486859">Ganong, 1995</xref>) which invited lively commentary from Dr. Virginia (Jinny) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074840713486859">Hayes (1995)</xref> and a subsequent rebuttal by Dr. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1074840713486859">Ganong (1996)</xref>.</p>
<p>An overview about Centers of Excellence in Family Nursing Practice reviewed the foundational knowledge development about family nursing practice made visible through the work of the Family Nursing Unit (2002-2007) at the University of Calgary, Canada and replicated by the Center of Excellence in Family Nursing (1993-present) at the University of Montreal, Canada and the Center for Research in Family Health (2004-present) at Linneaus University, Sweden. In addition, the goals of the newly endowed Glen Taylor Nursing Institute for Family and Society (2008-present) at Minnesota State University, Mankato, USA were also discussed. This plenary session included papers presented by Drs. Janice Bell, Fabie Duhamel, France Dupuis, Eva Benzein, Britt-Inger Saveman, and Sandra Eggenberger.</p>
<p>Knowledge translation of family nursing to practice settings was presented by Dr. Erla Svavarsdottir and colleagues about their groundbreaking work with the Landspitali Family Nursing Implementation Project in Iceland. A focus on how family nursing education is being made visible was offered in special sessions led by Drs. Donna Curry, Shirley Hanson and colleagues, and Naohiro Hohashi. Two special sessions about family nursing in Asian countries made it clear that family nursing is becoming increasingly visible in Hong Kong, Korea, Thailand, Viet Nam, Myanmar, Cambodia, Lao Peoples Democratic Republic, and China.</p>
<p>In 2005 at the 7th IFNC, the <italic>Journal of Family Nursing</italic> honored the vision and dedication of two foundational family nursing leaders in Japan: Dr. Chieko Sugishita and Dr. Michiko Moriyama (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074840713486859">Bell &amp; Moules, 2005</xref>). At IFNC10, four more outstanding nurses from Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1074840713486859">Bell, 2011b</xref>) were honored by the <italic>Journal of Family Nursing</italic> including: Dr. Kazuko Suzuki, Dr. Sayumi Nojima, Dr. Kazuko Ishigaki, and Dr. Nami Kobayashi. Dr. Lawrence (Larry) Ganong was also recognized as “kin” of our family nursing community for his distinguished interdisciplinary family scholarship and contributions to family nursing science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1074840713486859">Bell, 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>The visionary Dr. Chieko Sugishita established JARFN in 1994 and insured that JARFN was accepted as an official academic society in Japan (for more information about the development of family nursing in Japan see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840713486859">Ishigaki, 2013</xref>). Her goal was to grow the science of family nursing through annual scientific meetings, regional forums, and journal publications in the Japanese Journal of Research in Family Nursing (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://square.umin.ac.jp/jarfn/jarfn/">http://square.umin.ac.jp/jarfn/jarfn/</ext-link>). JARFN today is one of only two national family nursing organizations in the world and currently has the largest membership of any country with over 1,400 family nurses. Dr. Sugishita long held a dream that one day JARFN would invite family nurses from around the world to an IFNC in Japan. While her life was ended prematurely by illness in 2007, Dr. Sugishita would have been extremely proud of the enormous effort and dedication of her colleagues who made her dream come true with the very successful IFNC10 hosted in Japan in June 2011.</p>
<p>A generous donation realized by profits from IFNC10 was recently made by JARFN to the International Family Nursing Association (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.internationalfamilynursing.org">http://www.internationalfamilynursing.org</ext-link>) who will, for the first time, be the official host and sponsor of the 11th IFNC in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA in June 2013.</p>
