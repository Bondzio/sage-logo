<sec id="sec1-0265691411428783u"><title>Rachel G. Fuchs, <italic>Contested Paternity: Constructing Families in Modern France</italic>, The Johns Hopkins University Press: Baltimore MD, 2008; xii + 353 pp.; 9780801888328, £36.50 (hbk); 9780801887376, £16.50 (pbk)</title>
<p>In <italic>Contested Paternity</italic>, Rachel Fuchs uses legal documents to consider marriage, <italic>concubinage</italic> (non-marital cohabitation), unmarried motherhood and adoptions in nineteenth- and twentieth-century France. Arguing that women’s legal demands and children’s rights forced changes in legal practice, Fuchs frames her account in terms of two moments that reflected fundamental social changes: the Civil Codes of 1804 and 1912. In this brilliantly recounted story, magistrates and lower- and working-class people – especially women – appear as agents of social transformation.</p>
<p>The 1804 Code, as discussed in Chapter 1, described a social order shaped by the interests of propertied men: a conjugal family centred on a husband and wife in which women were to be passive citizens, the paterfamilias an active citizen, and all property transmitted to its offspring. Natural children threatened the idealized family unit, since recognizing a child entailed rights of inheritance and family name. Although unmarried mothers could not sue biological fathers to recognize paternity, they were considered to retain full power over a natural child even when the biological father provided recognition. Chapters 2 and 3 consider the rights and responsibilities of parents, as judges interpreted the Code. Fatherhood was divided into two forms of responsibility: men could be liable for a child’s maintenance, but had no obligation to give the child <italic>filiation</italic> (a share in inheritance and the paternal name). Unwed mothers were seen as immoral in the first half of the nineteenth century, but they were able to make financial claims against men by demanding legal damages for injury to their person. Judges tried to establish what they believed was moral behaviour by holding men accountable. By the late century, women were being treated as victims, men as seducers – and children as needing protection. The courts tried to balance the rights of children with the idealized bourgeois family. By the late century, <italic>concubinage</italic> was an accepted option for working-class couples who could not afford marriage. Against this background, manly honour increasingly dictated that men take responsibility for natural children. By 1912, the law allowed paternity searches.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 covers the years 1912–1940. Courts attempted to protect men from unjust accusations of paternity, demanding heavy burdens of proof. Marriage remained central to definitions of paternity, with paternity remaining divided between material provision and social roles. As the law recognized <italic>concubinage</italic>, proving sexual fidelity within a marriage-like relationship became more important than demonstrating sexual innocence. Children’s needs were given precedence in legal decisions; no longer did a mother claim on her own behalf, but only that of her child, and men were expected to be responsible fathers. In Chapter 5, Fuchs discusses family formation strategies once legalized paternity searches and child adoption began to chip away at the precedence given to biological families from the early twentieth century. Complicated issues emerged: what did it mean to give a non-biologically related child the family name and inheritance? What happened if a man denied the paternity of his wife’s child? Or, at what point could the state remove parental authority and move the child to a new family if the parents were unfit?</p>
<p>The final chapter considers people’s agency over their private lives and the need to enact many gendered roles outside or within marriage. By the late twentieth century, the biological family unit was only one type, with the possibility of same-sex marriage, reconstituted step-families and <italic>concubinage</italic>. Definitions of family centred on emotional relationships. Since 2005, all French children have had the same rights, regardless of their parents’ marital status. Paternity was still divisible until early in our century, but the use of DNA tests to identify biological fatherhood mean fathers cannot avoid paternity searches. Most significantly, as the concept of paternal authority vested in the unmarried mother has faded, men are now considered to have an equal interest in their natural children. This has given men greater choice in how to act as fathers.</p>
<p>This book is gender history at its most sophisticated. Fuchs treats the family as the locus for everyday gender politics, which allows a rich story to emerge. As she asserts, considering ‘paternity as a category of family history reveals the importance of fatherhood, the family, and the law within the greater context of changing attitudes toward parental responsibility, the development of state welfare, constructions of the family, the rights of children and women’s agency’ (2). This is not an overstatement. <italic>Contested Paternity</italic> is an excellent book, which should be included in the library of anyone who works on gender, family, economy, law or modern France.</p>
