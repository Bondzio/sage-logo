<p>Pharmacotherapy is an important component of asthma and allergy management. Some asthma and allergy educators prescribe medications, some provide education regarding medications, and some do both. No matter what your role is in respect to pharmacotherapy, the one thing that is certain is that we all need to be informed. In this issue, we highlight medications and their use in both our Product Showcase and Roundtable Departments. Additionally, I have asked Antonina Evans, a pharmacist and member of the JAAE Editorial Board, to lead the way with this issue’s editorial.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>Pharmacologic therapy is an integral part of managing asthma and allergies. Significant portions of practice guidelines, including the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Expert Panel Report-3 (EPR-3),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150129713494686">1</xref></sup> Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention, Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150129713494686">2</xref></sup> and Allergic Rhinitis and Its Impact on Asthma (ARIA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150129713494686">3</xref></sup> are dedicated to the proper selection and use of medications. In this issue, the regular departments focus on medications used to prevent and control asthma and allergy symptoms, thereby improving the quality of life of individuals living with these conditions. Before you move onto the articles, please allow me to engage in a little nostalgia.</p>
<p>Over the past several decades we have seen great advances in the medications used to treat asthma. Some of you may recall when routine treatment of asthma included inhaled isoproterenol, oral and inhaled terbutaline, along with daily doses of oral corticosteroids to maintain control. From there we moved to oral and inhaled albuterol, while still using daily or episodic doses of corticosteroids to maintain control. Ultimately, we reached our current standard, preventing and managing symptoms with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists, with occasional symptomatic relief provided by short-acting agonists.</p>
<p>Likewise we have seen advances in the medications to manage allergies. With fall allergies fast approaching, many of us are grateful, perhaps both personally and professionally, that intranasal corticosteroids and nonsedating antihistamines have long since replaced diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, and the seasonal injections of corticosteroid as the standard of care.</p>
<p>The strategies provided by the NAEPP, including use of pharmacotherapy in the EPR-3, have led to a decline in hospitalizations for asthma in the United States since the mid-1980s, with the rates for deaths due to asthma declining since 1999.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150129713494686">4</xref></sup> However, as we are all aware, there remains significant room for improvement in the care and management of asthma.</p>
<p>Our armamentarium will continue to evolve and improve, leading to better outcomes for our patients. As health care professionals and health educators, we have the responsibility to, first, be lifelong learners to educate ourselves on these advancements and, second, to pass this knowledge along to our patients. Toward this goal, I invite you to read on and apply the knowledge to your daily practice.</p>
