<abstract>
<p>During the euro crisis of June 2011, 51 representatives of major French and German corporations launched a political campaign in support of the euro. This study shows that firm size facilitated high-quality business contacts but that variables of economic interest were not associated with a higher probability of campaign participation when controlling for relational variables. Instead, the empirical analysis suggests that Franco-German business leaders joined the campaign because (1) their central network position provided them with informational resources to transcend the interest of their firm, and (2) their social and political embeddedness either led to an internalization of pro-euro values or gave them an incentive to improve their long-term reputation with political decision makers who strongly support the euro as part of the European integration project. Thus, the directors’ corporate and political ties facilitated and motivated corporate political action in support of the euro.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1465116512458837" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Only a decade after the introduction of the euro, its future is at stake. The advent of the debt crisis in 2010, which spread from Greece through Southern Europe and to Ireland, led to the creation of an institutionalized rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), to support eurozone countries in financial difficulty. Although the former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as his German counterpart, Chancellor Angela Merkel, publicly declared their determination to preserve the European currency, its long-term sustainability remains uncertain.</p>
<p>The euro crisis also galvanized the discussion about ambitious reforms of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), with proposals ranging from a break-up of the eurozone or ejecting member states, to deeper integration with jointly issued government bonds. These proposals imply far-reaching political and economic consequences, thus intensifying public debates about the benefits and costs of EMU reforms. In this atmosphere, 51 representatives of major French and German companies launched a pro-euro advertising campaign – ‘The euro is necessary’ – that was published in several French and German newspapers in June 2011. Understanding why business leaders participated in this campaign can illuminate, more generally, the phenomenon of collective action by corporate elites. There are two different theories to explain corporate political behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1465116512458837">Mizruchi, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The first, the political economy approach, assumes that the firm’s economic interest is the primary factor governing corporate political activity. Consequently, this approach focuses on structural factors such as firm size, industrial sector, and trade activities to predict its specific political interest in the euro campaign.</p>
<p>In contrast, the social network approach does not deny that business leaders are self-interested but argues that their behavior is constrained by their social environment. The relationships of managers within the business community and with other socio-political decision makers shape their informational resources and their incentives to engage in political activities. The social network approach would predict that a manager who is well connected to business and political elites is more likely to join the euro campaign than a manager of a company with similar firm characteristics but without those relationships.</p>
<p>The first section of this article will briefly review the initial corporate support for the establishment of the EMU and will then present the demands of the euro campaign. The next sections will discuss hypotheses that might explain corporate euro support. Subsequently, the relevance of these hypotheses is tested in a logit regression analysis.</p>
<p>The empirical analysis shows that corporate networks, the award of an Order of Merit, a career in government or politics, and institutional lobby connections on the European Union (EU) level are associated with a higher probability of campaign participation. Firm size correlates positively with these relational variables but is not a direct predictor of EMU support, whereas the other political economy variables do not seem to play a significant role. Thus, Franco-German business leaders may have decided to participate in the pro-euro campaign because (1) their central network position provided them with informational resources that allowed them to transcend the interest of the individual firm, and because (2) their social and political environment either led to an internalization of pro-European values or gave them an incentive to improve their long-term reputation with political decision makers who strongly support the euro as part of the European integration project.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1465116512458837"><title>Corporate interest in the establishment of EMU</title>
<p>Transnational corporations have been involved in the European integration process through business associations such as the European Round Table of Industrialists (ERT). The ERT consists of chief executive officers (CEOs) of the largest European firms and has been influential in the agenda-setting and implementation of the common market for goods and capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1465116512458837">Apeldoorn, 2001</xref>: 77–78). The ERT did not play a major role in establishing the EMU because it regarded this issue to be secondary to the completion of the internal market. However, the Association for the Monetary Union of Europe (AMUE), another transnational corporate group with about 400 members, actively lobbied in favor of the euro and had several personal ties to the ERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1465116512458837">Apeldoorn, 2001</xref>: 80–81; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1465116512458837">Collignon and Schwarzer, 2003</xref>: 3).</p>
<p>General business support for EMU differed quite substantially between France and Germany. From 1988 onwards, French business support was among the highest in Europe, involving between 80 and 90 percent of the interviewed managers, whereas only 60 percent of German executives supported EMU in 1988 – the lowest level of support in Europe. German support increased after the strong appreciation of the D-Mark in 1995, but German business directors differed from the French in their expectation of future monetary policy: Whereas German support was conditional on the continuation of the Bundesbank’s low-inflation policy, French businesses expected more political control over the European Central Bank (ECB) and an easier monetary policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1465116512458837">de Boissieu and Pisani-Ferry, 1998</xref>: 76–83; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1465116512458837">Moravcsik, 1998</xref>: 391–412; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1465116512458837">Verdun, 2000</xref>: 167–169).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1465116512458837">Table 1</xref> shows the attitudes of elites in France, Germany, and the EU toward the EMU in 1996 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1465116512458837">Spence, 1997</xref>). On a scale of −10 (very much against) to +10 (very much for), business leaders in France (7.5) and Germany (7.0) strongly supported the euro project on average. Politicians, civil servants, the media, and intellectuals also supported the euro nearly unanimously. However, throughout Europe the general public was much less supportive, especially in Germany, where public support for the euro (40 percent) was the lowest in the EU.

<p>French and German decision makers expected similar benefits from the introduction of the euro. However, they were concerned about quite different potential negative effects: French elites tended to fear the loss of national identity and control over economic policies; their German counterparts were mostly concerned about higher inflation rates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1465116512458837"><title>The advent of the Euro crisis and the campaign ‘The Euro is necessary’</title>
<p>The advent of the debt crisis in 2010 led to the establishment of the EFSF, through which solvent eurozone countries guaranteed the loans of highly indebted members. The ECB also began buying government bonds, thus infringing its independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1465116512458837">Marsh, 2011</xref>: 255).</p>
<p>Against this political background, ‘The euro is necessary’ newspaper campaign sprung into existence. It called for unity among eurozone members instead of, for example, evicting members or breaking up the eurozone entirely. It thus favored supporting indebted countries, even if ‘the return to stable financial relations will cost many billions of euros,’ since ‘the European Union and our common currency are always worth this effort.’ And it argued for tougher budgetary rules and institutional reforms in favor of more European integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1465116512458837">FAZ, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The campaign can be classified as an influence strategy to shift public and elite opinion toward a favorable view of the euro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1465116512458837">Beyers, 2004</xref>: 213–216). Its significance stems from its fit with the agenda of the French and German governments just when public opinion in both countries was becoming more skeptical about the wisdom of maintaining a common currency. Since political beliefs depend to a great extent on social proof and elite influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1465116512458837">Kuran, 1997</xref>: 157–175), this pro-euro campaign might have increased the public legitimacy of the EMU.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1465116512458837"><title>Theoretical explanations</title>
<p>Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1465116512458837">Olson (1965)</xref>, the study of corporate political action has generally been understood as a collective action problem. Firms might be able to reach a collective good through political participation that is beneficial for the overall business community (for example, lower corporate taxes). But if a firm’s contribution is unlikely to affect the overall provision of the collective good, the firm would maximize its profits if it does not participate and free-rides on the endeavors of other companies.</p>
<p>However, collective action analysis would not take us far in understanding this campaign, because the monetary benefits from free-riding were minuscule: the initiators paid for a large portion of the campaign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1465116512458837">Büschemann, 2011</xref>). Moreover, the ad concluded with the names of its supporters, thus making it possible to identify non-participants.</p>
<p>Two different approaches – based on political economy and social network analysis – might explain the participation of Franco-German business directors in this campaign. These theories are not necessarily mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1465116512458837">Mizruchi, 2007</xref>). Both highlight the objective opportunities and constraints of agents in their decision-making process, and they are compatible with the rationality assumption according to which agents aim to maximize their utility. However, political economy assumes exogenous and constant preferences whereas preferences are endogenous to the process of social interaction in network analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1465116512458837">Mizruchi, 1994</xref>: 335). This difference in the analysis of preference formation leads to distinct hypotheses about corporate political behavior, which are elucidated below.</p>
<sec id="sec5-1465116512458837"><title>The political economy approach</title>
<p>In the political economy approach, corporate political activity is seen to be essential in influencing economic policies in favor of business interests. The assumptions of this approach are derived from neoclassical microeconomics, according to which firms are assumed to be unitary rational agents and profit maximizers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1465116512458837">Hillman et al., 2004</xref>: 839; Weingast and Wittman, 2008: 3).</p>
<p>The benchmark of this approach is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1465116512458837">Stigler’s (1971)</xref> theory of regulatory capture. Since governments have the resources to coercively implement regulation with far-reaching economic consequences, firms have an incentive to lobby for regulatory policies that would increase their profits. The theory of regulatory capture has itself captured several research areas within political economy, such as international trade theory, in which firms are supposed to demand trade policies according to their profit expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1465116512458837">Hart, 2004</xref>: 54).</p>
<p>We can thus formulate the first hypothesis regarding the pro-euro campaign:<disp-quote>
<p><bold>H1:</bold> Firms that would benefit from the policy prescriptions of the pro-euro campaign were more willing to support this appeal.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Different currency regimes affect corporations in different ways, creating advantages for some groups and disadvantages for others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1465116512458837">Milner and Keohane, 1996</xref>: 4–5). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1465116512458837">Broz and Frieden (2001)</xref> argue that businesses that are strongly involved in intra-currency union trade favor a common currency because it reduces transaction costs through the eradication of exchange rate risks. In contrast, businesses that operate mostly in the domestic economy should oppose a currency union, because they would face stronger internal market competition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1465116512458837">Frieden (2002)</xref> uses aggregate data to show that European countries tended to fix their exchange rate to the D-Mark more strongly than other firms if they had higher trade volumes with Germany and the Benelux states. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1465116512458837">Duckenfield and Aspinwall (2010)</xref> employ survey data to show that British companies tend to prefer EMU membership if they trade heavily with the eurozone. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1465116512458837">Broz and Frieden’s (2001)</xref> argument might also apply to the maintenance of EMU, since the break-up of the eurozone or the eviction of members would cause a return of exchange rate risks.<disp-quote>
<p><bold>H2:</bold> Firms that are heavily involved in intra-European trade were more willing to support the pro-euro campaign.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1465116512458837">Broz and Frieden (2001)</xref> argue that the tradable sector benefits from currency depreciation because its export products become more competitive, whereas consumers and non-tradable industries prefer currency appreciation. This logic might be the driving force behind the pro-euro campaign since its support for highly indebted euro area countries is associated with a depreciation of the euro. Moreover, as shown above, the independence of the ECB was decisively constrained; hence campaign supporters might also expect a looser monetary policy in the long term, which benefits exporters. These incentives give raise to the third hypothesis:<disp-quote>
<p><bold>H3:</bold> Firms of the tradable sectors were more likely to join the pro-euro campaign.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Scholars have also argued that firm size is critical to explaining political activity because larger firms have the economic resources to gain the attention of policy makers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1465116512458837">Andres, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1465116512458837">Grier et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1465116512458837">Hansen and Mitchell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1465116512458837">Mitchell et al,. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1465116512458837">Schuler and Rehbein, 1997</xref>). They are also more likely to have a bigger stake involved in a policy issue, leading to the fourth hypothesis:<disp-quote>
<p><bold>H4:</bold> Firm size is positively associated with willingness to join the pro-euro campaign.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1465116512458837"><title>The social network approach</title>
<p>The political economy approach predicts that it is unlikely that firms would form alliances, since different sectors often have opposing interests. Indeed, business unity is rare; ‘most of the time, there simply is no such thing as “business”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1465116512458837">Hart, 2004</xref>: 49). It is thus extraordinary that the pro-euro campaign unified 51 directors of the largest French and German firms. Social network scholars (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1465116512458837">Emirbayer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1465116512458837">Granovetter, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1465116512458837">Knoke, 1990</xref>) argue that the process of consensus formation in social networks can facilitate such corporate political unity and attenuate the free-rider incentive.</p>
<p>The examination of interlocking directorates has become a common approach in social network analysis to study corporate behavior. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1465116512458837">Pfeffer and Salancik (1978)</xref>, resource dependency is a major reason for corporations to form interlocks. Interlocking directorates reduce environmental uncertainty and information asymmetry since they provide companies with access to external knowledge and resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1465116512458837">Mizruchi, 1996</xref>: 274–276).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1465116512458837">Mizruchi (1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1465116512458837">1996</xref>: 280–283) shows that interlocking directorates between large firms have been a major characteristic of markets in Western countries since the early 20th century. French and German business communities consist of a small core network of interconnected managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1465116512458837">Höpner and Krempel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1465116512458837">Milakovic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1465116512458837">Yeo et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, comparative studies reveal that the density of corporate networks is larger in coordinated market economies, such as France or Germany, than in liberal market economies, such as the UK or the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1465116512458837">Santella et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1465116512458837">Stokman et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1465116512458837">van Veen and Kratzer, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>But, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1465116512458837">Mizruchi (1996</xref>: 280) points out, board interlocks are worth studying only if they have consequences for corporate political behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1465116512458837">Mizruchi (1992)</xref> finds a positive association between connected companies and the similarity of election campaign contributions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1465116512458837">Burris (2005)</xref> shows that managers were more likely to contribute to the same candidate if they shared inter-corporate ties.</p>
<p>Social network analysis explains the diffusion of attitudes or behavior through interaction. Social ties facilitate the transmission of information through mutual communication, and the adoption of a meme (for example, an idea, behavior, or value) depends upon the proportion of surrounding nodes that propagate this meme. Further, the length of the path that a meme needs to travel in the network in order to reach an agent determines the duration of the meme adoption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1465116512458837">Borgatti and Foster, 2003</xref>: 1005). Hence, adoption is a result of cohesion through socialization between neighboring ties. The idea of ‘structural equivalence,’ where diffusion occurs through competition between connected agents, predicts the same outcome. For example, company A lobbies the government to avoid losing influence after noticing that company B has engaged in lobbying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1465116512458837">Burt, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>The concept of meme diffusion also applies to corporate networks in which multiple directorates not only allow managers to receive information from executives with whom they share a direct tie, but also give them access to the experiences of remote executives through the spread of information across the network structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1465116512458837">Alfarano and Milakovic, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1465116512458837">Burris, 2005</xref>: 275–276). Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1465116512458837">Useem (1984</xref>: 56) describes interlocks as a ‘transcendent network’ in which executives have access to the collective wisdom of major sectors of the economy. Consequently, it is the location within the business network that determines the amount of information an executive receives about the practices and concerns of corporations. Given that business networks tend to consist of an inner circle of well-connected executives, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1465116512458837">Useem (1984</xref>: 57) argues in his theory of ‘the inner circle’ that business directors at the network’s center follow a political strategy that is more sensitive to the general interest of the business community compared with managers at the periphery.</p>
<p>Previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1465116512458837">Burris, 2005</xref>: 260) shows that executives of the inner circle are more likely to achieve leading positions in international, national, or sector-specific business associations. They are also more likely to become members of the governance boards of non-profit organizations, political foundations, and think tanks. Since central executives tend to have a better understanding of the general corporate interest, they are an adequate choice to represent the business class in the political sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1465116512458837">Useem, 1984</xref>: 108–111). Like ties across corporate boards of directors, these extra-corporate networks should also have a positive impact on cohesive political action, since they provide additional ties between corporate executives.</p>
<p>In combination, the social network approach and the theory of the inner circle lead to the following hypothesis:<disp-quote>
<p><bold>H5:</bold> A central position of an executive in corporate and extra-corporate networks was associated with similar political action in the pro-euro campaign.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Although business network analysis studies how corporate preferences diffuse across the business community, it does not provide a unique explanation for the initial perception of corporate interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1465116512458837">Mizruchi, 1994</xref>: 336). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1465116512458837">Useem (1984</xref>: 108–115) claims that the inner circle is more pragmatic and consensus oriented in politics, because it pays more attention to the legitimacy of the economic system. However, several studies that evaluated the ideology of the inner circle in the USA found contrary results. Whether inner-circle members exhibit conservative or liberal ideology depends on the time of observation, the model, and the sample specifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1465116512458837">Burris, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The origins of perceptions of business interests are not typically explored in the political economy literature, probably because preference formation is often assumed to be an easy epistemological task for corporations. However, corporations often mis-specify their interests and pursue strategies that fail to make them better off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1465116512458837">Krueger, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1465116512458837">North, 1990</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1465116512458837">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>This implies not that business leaders are irrational but that they often operate in a world of uncertainty where causes are invisible and events are mostly non-repeating and unpredictable, regardless of the amount of information collected about the past.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1465116512458837">2</xref></sup> Hence, the perception of corporate political interest depends on political ideologies that simplify the complexity of the social environment. The origins and circulation of ideologies are essentially driven by elites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1465116512458837">Zaller, 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1465116512458837">Converse (2006</xref>: 64) argues that ‘the broad contours of elite decisions over time can depend in a vital way upon currents in what is loosely called “the history of ideas.”’ Their evolution and the dynamics of ideological adoption have been under-studied, probably because of the difficulty of quantifying the influence of ideologues on political decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1465116512458837">Friedman, 2009</xref>; Schmidt, 2008: 308–309; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1465116512458837">Zaller, 2009</xref>: 78).</p>
<p>There are at least two mechanisms that might explain how ideologies shape corporate political activities through social and political connections:
<list id="list1-1465116512458837" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Managers’ non-business networks might shape their ideological positions. Business directors might be more likely to adopt certain political beliefs the more often they interact in social circles that share those ideas. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1465116512458837">Bond (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1465116512458837">2007</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1465116512458837">Bond et al. (2010)</xref> show that British business directors were more likely to donate to the Conservative Party and to participate in a political campaign if they had attended an elite university and were a member of social clubs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1465116512458837">3</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Belief adoption can also be caused through preference falsification, where people publicly support beliefs that differ from what they privately think is true (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1465116512458837">Kuran, 1997</xref>). Depending on the feedback mechanism of their social circle, managers might have an incentive to engage in preference falsification if they expect to benefit from it via improved career prospects or a better reputation.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Since the Franco-German leadership strongly supported the euro as part of the European integration project, embeddedness of CEOs in these elite networks might be associated with support for the euro through either value internalization or preference falsification.<disp-quote>
<p><bold>H6:</bold> French and German executives were more likely to support the pro-euro campaign, the more often they interacted with social and political elites that share a pro-euro ideology.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The adoption of a certain ideology could also depend on the extent to which a firm participates in, or is affected by, politics. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1465116512458837">Hillman and Hitt (1999</xref>: 828–829), corporations can choose either a transactional or a relational approach to political activity. The transactional approach is a short-term strategy and a reactive corporate response to a public issue that has become salient, whereas the relational approach is a long-term investment in relationships with political decision makers. Which strategy is the optimal choice for a firm depends on the characteristics of the political system: The literature outlines that the institutional environment in coordinated market economies is more conducive to developing long-term relationships because such systems emphasize cooperation among institutionalized bargaining partners. In contrast, in a pluralist system, which consists of several competing interest groups, a transactional approach to political activity might be more fruitful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1465116512458837">Hillman, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1465116512458837">Hillman and Hitt, 1999</xref>: 830, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1465116512458837">Wilts, 2006</xref>: 443–444).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1465116512458837">Cowles (2001)</xref> shows that corporations moved their political strategy towards a relational approach on the EU level in response to the enactment of the Single European Act of 1986 and the increasing transfer of competency to Brussels. With relational business–government interactions, corporations have to provide governments with informational goods in order to gain political access. Moreover, they need a credible reputation in order to establish good working conditions with EU government officials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1465116512458837">Bouwen, 2002</xref>: 376).</p>
<p>A firm’s long-term political relationships can be seen as its political capital. Business directors may try to increase their political capital by demonstrating ideological affinity with the goals of important government officials. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1465116512458837">Woll (2008)</xref> shows that, in the EU and in the USA, the change in the trade policy preferences of telecommunication and air transport corporations, which went from promoting protectionism to demanding open markets, was endogenous to the political process: The adoption of pro-market ideas allowed these corporations to foster access to governments. Similarly, American Express supported the deregulation of trade in services in the USA, although this issue was not very important to the firm, because it fit the ideological agenda of key politicians, which in turn gave American Express access to political decision makers on a wider range of issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1465116512458837">Yoffie and Bergenstein, 1985</xref>: 131).</p>
<p>Therefore, CEOs might have joined the ‘euro is necessary’ campaign to improve their corporate political capital with pro-euro government officials.<disp-quote>
<p><bold>H7:</bold> French and German executives were more likely to support the pro-euro campaign, the more their corporation depends on good working conditions with EU government officials.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1465116512458837"><title>Data and methods</title>
<p>The boundary specification of cases for a sample is a crucial task because biased case selection can lead to a wrong inference. The social network literature distinguishes between two standard inclusion rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1465116512458837">Laumann et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1465116512458837">Knoke and Yang, 2008</xref>: 15–17): Whereas boundary specification is based on the subjective perception of agents in the realist approach, the researcher defines the boundaries according to a conceptual framework in the nominalist approach. For the purpose of this study, the sample should include all companies that were aware of this campaign and decided to join or to abstain from it. The positive cases are the 51 executives of 49 corporations who signed the pro-euro campaign pledge. The list of companies comprised 29 companies with large market capitalization (large-caps – traded on CAC 40 or DAX 30), 12 mid-caps, 7 privately owned firms and 1 state enterprise.</p>
<p>Detecting the negative cases is less straightforward and requires background information about the origins of the campaign. According to the initiators, the campaign was an outcome of the annual Franco-German meeting in Évian, where CEOs, academics, and politicians discuss current issues and topics related to Franco-German relations and European integration. The group of meeting organizers consists of various French and German firms that invite CEOs who might be interested in the annual agenda. However, because the list of invited companies and the list of executives who knew about this campaign are not publicly available, I had to rely on a nominalist strategy. Besides the supporters of the campaign, this sample consists of the CEOs of all other large-cap and mid-cap corporations of the CAC 40, CAC Next 20, DAX 30, and M-DAX 50, with an overall sample size of 156.</p>
<p>There were four reasons for choosing this boundary specification. First, particular firms are chosen by the researcher not purposively but by means of independently compiled indices based on market capitalization. Second, this selection criterion seems to be reasonable because invitations to the Évian meeting are restricted to large companies. The smallest non-financial company that joined the campaign had annual revenues of €315 million and about 1900 employees; it seems unlikely that much smaller companies had an opportunity to participate. Third, the invitation procedure of the Évian meetings suggests that large companies with an interest in the future of the eurozone probably received an invitation to participate, given the assumption that the organizers developed a sufficient understanding of this matter from previous meetings and responses to previous invitations. Fourth, there is also some evidence that the business community was generally aware of the formation of the campaign. The Federation of German Industry (BDI) announced the date of the meeting in a public publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1465116512458837">BDI, 2011</xref>). The former <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1465116512458837">BDI president, Hans-Olaf Henkel (2011)</xref>, knew in advance about the campaign from another non-participant and published a critique shortly after the campaign launch in a German business newspaper.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1465116512458837">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The study consists of the following set of variables. The binary dependent variable indicates whether or not an executive signed the pro-euro campaign. Previous research suggests that stock returns following political events could be an adequate proxy for changes in the profitability of firms (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1465116512458837">Bechtel and Schneider, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1465116512458837">Fisman, 2001</xref>). Moreover, the European Council implemented measures on 21 July 2011 that come close to the demands of the pro-euro campaign: Greece remained in the eurozone and received an additional €109 billion, the autonomy of the EFSF to intervene in the bond market was increased, loan periods were extended, interest rates were cut, and the country leaders pledged budget consolidations.</p>
<p>Consequently, I used the returns of a firm’s stock during the decision-making process for the euro bailout program to estimate the firm’s economic interest in joining the pro-euro campaign. The period of measurement ranged from the end price on 19 July to the starting price on 22 July because it was announced on 19 July that Sarkozy would meet Merkel and ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet in Berlin on the following day to find a common strategy for the European Council. The results of the European Council meeting were announced in the late evening of 21 July and stock prices should have adjusted to this development by the morning of 22 July.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1465116512458837">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The variable ‘European sales’ measures European sales as a proportion of overall sales in 2010. Since European countries that are not EMU members tend to adopt the monetary policy of the ECB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1465116512458837">Plümper and Troeger, 2006</xref>), a distinction between the eurozone and the rest of Europe might be insignificant; especially since almost no Franco-German companies distinguish between the two in their corporate governance reports.</p>
<p>I added a dummy variable for firms that engage in the tradable sector, following the definition of Gregorio et al. (1994), who rely on empirical data from OECD countries for their classification. Industries are defined as tradables if they export at least 10 percent of their domestic production. Following this cut-off point, all manufacturing industries, consumer goods, agriculture, basic materials, technology and transportation are defined as tradables, and business and financial services, construction, and utilities are non-tradables.</p>
<p>Some studies use the number of employees or the size of assets as indicators of firm size, but these definitions would introduce a bias in favor of either labor- or capital-intensive businesses. This study utilizes market capitalization in billion euros because this concept is routinely used in finance for publicly traded corporations.</p>
<p>Whereas all these explanatory variables are based on firm attributes, the variables relevant for the network hypotheses focus on the relationships of the individual executive. A corporate tie exists if two executives are members of the same board of directors. This can be either on the board of one of their companies or on the board of a third company. An extra-corporate tie exists if two executives are members of the same governance board of an organization, regardless of the organizational purpose.</p>
<p>The analysis of these networks requires a concept of centrality because the fifth hypothesis states that a prominent network position is key for political action. There are four standard concepts in network analysis to identify the centrality of an agent in a network: degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1465116512458837">Hanneman and Riddle, 2005</xref>). Degree centrality measures the number of ties of an agent but this might only be a local measurement since it does not consider the impact of neighboring ties. In contrast, the betweenness and closeness centrality concepts are based on the idea of shortest-path distances. High betweenness centrality indicates that an agent connects relatively many short-distance paths of other agents and high closeness centrality indicates that the average distance of an agent to all others is small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1465116512458837">Brandes and Pich, 2007</xref>: 2304–2306). Eigenvector centrality is a sophisticated extension of degree centrality. It also includes the number of ties of an agent and, additionally, it weights those connections according to the centrality of the adjacent neighbors in the overall network. Hence, agents are central if they have many ties to well-connected nodes.</p>
<p>Eigenvector centrality allows for weighted ties if there is more than one tie between agents. It is thought to be a relatively better tool to measure the overall structure of a network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1465116512458837">Hanneman and Riddle, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, it assumes a simultaneous network flow, which is a suitable measurement for influence-type processes, whereas shortest-path concepts assume constrained paths and are more suitable for analyzing flows between adjacent nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1465116512458837">Borgatti, 2005</xref>: 61–62).</p>
<p>These characteristics make eigenvector centrality preferable to other centrality concepts because we are interested in the influence process across the entire network and would like to take weighted ties between agents and high-quality contacts into account, as suggested by Useem’s inner-circle theory. Thus, the CEO network variables are based on eigenvector centrality, which is calculated by UCINET 6 and can vary between 0 and 100 percent, where a higher score indicates a higher degree of centrality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1465116512458837">Borgatti et al., 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1465116512458837">6</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1465116512458837">Figure 1</xref> reveals that the distribution of centrality scores for corporate and extra-corporate networks of business directors is very positively skewed. The fact that they are also very positively correlated (0.60) confirms the findings of previous research on French and German capitalism, namely that only a small proportion of directors is well connected and possesses a central position in the business network.
<fig id="fig1-1465116512458837" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Distribution of CEO network centrality.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1465116512458837-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>I created two variables to measure the network connections of managers to social and political elites that are relevant for the sixth hypothesis. First, the bestowal of an Order of Merit such as the Ordre national de la Légion d'honneur in France and the Bundesverdienstkreuz or Landesverdienstorden in Germany is used as a proxy for the degree to which a manager is socially embedded. Such an award indicates high social standing and national reputation. Second, a measurement for political embeddedness is the previous career path of business directors in government or politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1465116512458837">Faccio et al., 2006</xref>). The dummy variable ‘political career’ indicates whether a director has been a politician, a senior civil servant in the national government, a member of a government commission, or if he achieved a leading position within political party organizations.</p>
<p>The variable ‘EU lobby organization’ is relevant for the seventh hypothesis and uses the EU interest group population dataset to measure whether a corporation has a lobby organization on the EU level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1465116512458837">Wonka et al., 2010</xref>). Such an institution might allow business leaders to interact more frequently with European decision makers. Moreover, this is a relevant measurement of institutional political embeddedness because corporations that have established institutional lobby resources might have a stronger incentive to improve their relations with government officials. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1465116512458837">Hillman and Hitt (1999</xref>: 829) maintain, ‘the existence of these offices (given the expense of having full-time representation in these areas) implies that some firms are regularly concerned with government relations.’</p>
<p>However, identifying any causal inference from the five defined relational variables might be difficult because unmeasured factors could affect network membership as well as the propensity to join the pro-euro campaign.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1465116512458837">7</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1465116512458837">Borgatti and Halgin (2011</xref>: 1178) identify two problems for network analysis and for empirical enquiries in general. These are the problems of endogeneity (whether X causes Y, or the other way around) and omitted variable bias (Z causes X and Y).</p>
<p>A solution for endogeneity is to construct a model that converts a set of inputs at time <italic>T</italic> to an output at <italic>T</italic> + 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1465116512458837">Borgatti and Halgin, 2011</xref>: 1177–8). Consequently, the time of analysis for the relational variables is 31 May 2011, before the campaign was launched.</p>
<p>The analysis includes four additional control variables to reduce potential bias caused by omitted variables. These variables were chosen because, theoretically, they might influence the dependent variable and might also correlate with one or more of the explanatory variables. A dummy variable for French-based businesses is included to control for unobserved country-specific effects. Since French corporations were more supportive than German corporations of a more active monetary policy, one could also expect that French executives had a greater propensity to join the euro campaign.</p>
<p>The variable ‘government ownership’ measures the percentage of shares directly or indirectly owned by the French or German states. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1465116512458837">Dinç (2005)</xref> shows that government ownership has an impact on corporate policies and it might be possible that such an influence existed for the campaign as well. Moreover, this variable might correlate with relational variables because government-owned corporations might prefer CEOs with previous political careers.</p>
<p>In addition to their own corporate and extra-corporate networks, CEOs could also utilize the interlocking directorates of the other officers and directors of their firm to gain informational resources. The variable ‘firm network centrality’ measures the direct ties between the corporations of the sample and is based on eigenvector centrality.</p>
<p>The last control variable is the age of the business leader. Ceteris paribus, older directors have greater professional experience and a proven track record and have had more opportunities to develop business and political relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1465116512458837">McKnight and Tomkins, 2004</xref>). Thus, director’s age might be a key determinant of relational variables such as multiple board membership in corporations and other organizations.</p>
<p>The data for all variables are drawn from the business databases BusinessWeek, OneSource, and Worldscope and from the home pages of the relevant corporations and organizations.</p>
<p>Since the dependent variable is dichotomous, this analysis is based on logit regression analysis, which means that the coefficients do not show directly how strongly they affect the dependent variable. Utilizing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1465116512458837">King et al.’s (2000)</xref> simulation-based approach, I obtain the substantial impact of the explanatory variables by reporting changes in predicted probabilities of the dependent variable when one or more explanatory variables are changed. For this purpose, I used the Stata program <italic>Clarify</italic> to calculate 1000 sets of simulated parameters from the logit model to take estimation uncertainty into account when calculating confidence intervals for the first-difference effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1465116512458837">Tomz et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Ten directors would have been excluded from the analysis because their companies were not publicly traded and consequently had no data for returns and market capitalization. Hence, the particular values are imputed with data of comparable national and eurozone companies with similar characteristics in terms of sector activity, assets, employees, and revenue.</p>

<p>There is a significant positive difference between campaign supporters and other companies as suggested by hypotheses 4–7. Pro-euro campaigners had a larger firm size and tended to be more central in corporate and extra-corporate networks. They were also more likely to have received an Order of Merit and worked in government positions, and their corporations were more likely to have a lobby organization on the EU level. Additionally, French and older CEOs as well as executives of corporations with greater network centrality had a stronger propensity to join the campaign. However, only a statistical analysis in a multiple framework, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1465116512458837">Table 3</xref>, permits one to determine which of the explanatory variables is actually capable of explaining support for the pro-euro campaign while controlling for other factors.

<p>Model 1 includes all explanatory variables that are relevant for the hypotheses of the political economy approach. Contrary to Hypothesis 2, intra-European sales are negatively associated with euro support, with a slightly significant value. Firm size turns out to be strongly significant; it is positively associated with a higher likelihood to participate in the campaign.</p>
<p>Models 2 and 3 add the relational and control variables to the analysis. All five relational variables turn out to be significant: CEO corporate and extra-corporate network centralities, the award of an Order of Merit, a career in government or politics, and the existence of an EU lobby organization significantly predict a higher propensity to join the pro-euro appeal. In these frameworks, there is a U-shaped relationship between director’s age and campaign support. Firm size becomes insignificant, indicating that firm size could facilitate the presence of these four variables but is not a direct predictor of EMU support.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1465116512458837">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Column 4 shows the estimates for the substantial impact of the last model if a particular continuous variable is changed from its mean to one standard deviation above, or if a categorical variable moves along its two categories while keeping all other explanatory variables at their mean. For instance, increasing corporate network centrality from its mean to one standard deviation above predicts a 22.1 percent higher probability to be part of the pro-euro campaign.</p>
<p>In addition to the results of column 4, performing this simulation for both CEO networks in combination yields a 40.1 percent higher likelihood. Furthermore, including the social and political embeddedness dummies in this first-difference effect increases the probability to about 86 percent.</p>
<p>These results allow us to evaluate each of the seven hypotheses. There was not any evidence for the first three political economy hypotheses. The coefficients for stock returns and tradable sector were not statistically significant in any model specification. European sales proportion even turned out to be statistically negative in the first model.</p>
<p>The fourth hypothesis predicts a relationship between firm size and political action. Firm size does not appear to be statistically significant in a multiple framework but it correlates positively with the measures of CEO network centrality, an Order of Merit, and EU lobby organization, indicating that it might be associated with the managers’ high-quality relationships.</p>
<p>The empirical analysis shows that a prominent position in business and extra-business networks, the award of an Order of Merit, a career in government or politics, and a lobby organization on the EU level are associated with a significantly higher probability that an executive signs the pro-euro appeal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1465116512458837">10</xref></sup> This corroborates the hypotheses of the social network approach, but a puzzle remains: why did managers participate in this campaign if their firms did not benefit from it relatively? This study provides three explanations.</p>
<p>First, the significant association between network centrality among business leaders and euro campaign participation indicates that the campaigners had the informational resources to transcend the interest of the individual firm.</p>
<p>Second, the empirical analysis also indicates that a high social reputation and a career in government or politics partly explain participation. Since French and German political elites strongly supported the euro, embeddedness in these social circles may have led to participation in favor of the euro either through value internalization or through opportunistic behavior (for example, fear of loss of social reputation, fear of antagonizing powerful decision makers with whom they frequently interact).</p>
<p>Third, the campaign may have been part of a broader framework of a repeated game in the political arena. Corporations with lobby resources at the EU level were more likely to become euro campaigners because they might have expected to improve their access to political decision makers. This political capital did not turn out to be profitable in the short run but might help them to gain political influence in other, more firm-related, issues.</p>
<p>Consequently, this study confirms the findings of previous network studies that interlocking directorates are crucial to explain cohesive corporate political action. But it extends this research by pointing out that preference formation might have its origin in social networks outside of the corporate world.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1465116512458837" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The political economy approach explains business leaders’ participation in the ‘euro is necessary’ advertising campaign in solely economic terms. However, the empirical analysis suggests that participation in the pro-euro campaign strongly depended on business executives’ social environment. A central position in CEO networks, an award indicating social reputation, previous positions in government or politics, and political capital in the form of an EU lobby organization tended to substantially increase the propensity for cohesive political action among Franco-German executives in support of the euro.</p>
<p>These findings do not imply that the political economy approach can never explain the political behavior of firms. In an environment with clear benefit structures, its predictions are reasonable and powerful. The empirical analysis shows that the significant relational variables are positively correlated with firm size, suggesting that it is easier for the CEOs of large companies to acquire high-quality contacts and/or that such companies are more likely to hire well-connected managers. Moreover, firm size strongly correlates with the presence of an EU lobby organization, indicating that firm size might be crucial to explaining the establishment of networks between business and government on the EU level.</p>
<p>For a spontaneous influential strategy such as the pro-euro campaign, social network theory might explain why Franco-German managers participated even though their firms did not profit from it in the near term. Previous studies (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1465116512458837">van Veen and Kratzer, 2011</xref>) show that the Franco-German business communities consist of densely connected network cores, as confirmed by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1465116512458837">Figure 1</xref>. Their central position might permit these executives to better comprehend the perceptions of several sectors of the economy and to develop a better understanding of the broader perceived interests of large corporations.</p>
<p>They are also better connected to social and political elites. Members of these elites strongly supported the euro, which could have led to the internalization of pro-euro values among business directors. Moreover, since lasting relationships with important political decision makers depend on good working conditions, business leaders might have had an incentive to disregard their short-term economic interest and supported the pro-euro campaign to improve their political capital, from which they might hope to benefit in the long run.</p>
<p>The broader implications for the study of corporate political behavior are that researchers should focus not only on the structural attributes of firms but also on the relationships of business directors inside and outside of the business community. Perceiving businesses’ interest is not an easy epistemological task in a world of uncertainty and this study provides evidence that the informational resources and ideological positions that business leaders acquire from others in their social networks could also shape their political decisions.</p>
