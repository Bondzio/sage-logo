<abstract>
<p>Bullying in schools has become recognized as a significant public health problem. The Olweus Bullying Prevention Program (OBPP) has been identified as an effective means to reduce bullying behavior in schools. The goal of this large population-based initiative was to reduce bullying by producing a quantifiable change in school climate using an established program and standardized measurement tool. Program participants over a 2-year period included 56,137 students and more than 2,400 teachers from 107 schools in 49 counties across Pennsylvania. An age cohorts design was used, and data from two equivalent age cohorts of students were compared at two or more points in time. After 1 to 2 years of program implementation, across cohorts, there were reductions in student self-reports of bullying others, and improvements in student perceptions of adults’ responsiveness, and students’ attitudes about bullying. This study is the largest bullying prevention initiative to date in the United States. This initiative reaffirms the efficacy of the OBPP, emphasizes the importance of an identified coalition, and highlights several positive outcomes. It is recommended that the OBPP be implemented through the establishment of community partnerships and coalitions as consistent with the public health model.</p>

<p>Bullying is an act when a person is being repeatedly exposed to negative actions on the part of one or more other persons and who has difficulty defending himself or herself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839910386887">Olweus, 1993</xref>). Bullying is also described as a “systematic abuse of power” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839910386887">Smith, Pepler, &amp; Rigby, 2004</xref>). Though the high-level school violence associated with the use of weapons and death captures the attention of the public, it is bullying or low-level violence defined as peer aggression in the form of teasing, rumors, intimidation, and physical confrontation that affects approximately 20% to 30% of students on a daily basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839910386887">Meyer-Adams, 2008</xref>). Depression, suicidal thoughts, substance abuse, and an increased predilection to crime are negative consequences associated with bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839910386887">American Medical Association, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839910386887">Gini &amp; Pozzoli, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839910386887">Limber, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910386887">Olweus.org, 2008</xref>). In the classroom setting, students involved with chronic bullying feel unsafe, lack a sense of personal and academic satisfaction, and become fearful and apathetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839910386887">Olweus &amp; Limber, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910386887">Olweus.org, 2008</xref>). Over time, the student observers of bullying have a decreased sense of empathy for other students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839910386887">Olweus &amp; Limber, 2002</xref>). These bystanders may feel unsafe and have difficulty learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910386887">Olweus.org, 2008</xref>). Lower academic achievement, higher dropout rates and school absenteeism are additional burdens placed on students, schools, parents, and society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839910386887">Limber, 2006</xref>). Studies by the U.S. Secret Service and Department of Education revealed that nearly 75% of the attackers in school shootings indicated that they were bullied or otherwise hurt by their peers prior to the shootings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839910386887">Crawford, 2002</xref>). Without intervention, bullies in middle school are three times as likely to have at least one criminal conviction by the age of 24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839910386887">Olweus, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The first major U.S. study on bullying was conducted in 1998 when approximately 15,000 students were surveyed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839910386887">Nansel et al., 2001</xref>). This effort defined bullying in the United States from the perspective of school grade occurrence, gender-specific bullying traits, and social strata prevalence, and along with European studies provided a basis for future U.S.-based program activity and research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839910386887">Espelage &amp; Swearer, 2004</xref>). These aforementioned studies quantified the level of bullying behaviors occurring in schools in the United States and in Europe. One highly effective program that was developed to reduce these bullying rates is the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program (OBPP). The Olweus model is known to reduce school-based bullying by 30% to 50% in schools that implement the program with fidelity, and in July 2009, American Academy of Pediatrics endorsed the OBPP. Supporting comprehensive adoption of the program by schools is a strategic component in bullying reduction efforts. The OBPP uses four areas of concentration to enable schools to address bullying systemically:</p>
<list id="list1-1524839910386887" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>School-wide measures that focus on training the entire school staff, including a coordinating committee whose work drives the program in each building. School rules against bullying are posted throughout the school and students are surveyed yearly using the Olweus Bullying Questionnaire (OBQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839910386887">Olweus, 2007</xref>).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Classroom measures that include discussion, class meetings, role playing, and enforcement of school rules against bullying.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Individual components of OBPP to help guide a school’s response and encompasses on-the-spot interventions, follow-up meetings with the student who is bullied and the student who is bullying, along with increased parental engagement.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Community participation, which includes the involvement of local government, law enforcement, community agencies, media and other community partners who may provide valuable time, resources and information toward the success of the program. Spreading the antibullying message outside the walls of the school is an essential OBPP component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839910386887">Olweus &amp; Limber, 2002</xref>).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Parental involvement is the unofficial “fifth” component of the OBPP. Parents are encouraged to become engaged in school-wide, classroom, and community activities, as well as during individual interventions. Parental involvement is critical to the success of the OBPP.</p>
<p>The health and social issues related to bullying are significant, costly, and have long-term effects. With increased focus on the costs of health care, it has become important for hospitals and health care management foundations to take a proactive approach in promoting health and wellness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839910386887">Masiello, 2008</xref>). A private foundation, the Highmark Foundation, was created in 2000 with funding from Highmark Inc., Pennsylvania’s largest health insurer based on membership. The Foundation supports programs aimed at improving community health. In 2007, the Foundation granted more than six million dollars to fund over several years, two coordinated bullying prevention programs based on the Olweus model, to Pennsylvania schools: HALT! A Bullying Prevention Program and PA CARES (Creating an Atmosphere of Respect and Environment for Success). As part of this initiative, a bullying prevention coalition was also established. The importance of community partnerships and coalitions has long been identified as an important component in local initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839910386887">Weech-Maldonado &amp; Merrill, 2000</xref>). These types of coalitions typically consist of leading experts and organizations in the field, both public and private sectors, including universities, schools, research institutions, state departments of health, and health care organizations. The coalition associated with this particular bullying prevention initiative, included the Highmark Foundation, the Pennsylvania Center for Safe Schools, Clemson University Institute on Family and Neighborhood Life (home of the OBPP in the United States), the Pennsylvania Department of Education, Windber Research Institute, and the program founder Dan Olweus of the University of Bergen, Norway.</p>
<p>The Bullying Prevention Institute (BPI) was also established through this initiative. BPI is committed to reducing the incidence of bullying behaviors in schools by working to promote and advance best practices through professional development and educational sessions. These events provide participating schools with additional knowledge and resources to compliment OBPP implementation.</p>
<p>The overall objective of this initiative is to bring effective and evidence-based bullying prevention strategies to schools and communities without current intervention, and to monitor and evaluate the results.</p>
<sec id="section1-1524839910386887" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Through the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PA CARES) and Windber Research Institute (HALT!), the OBPP was introduced to approximately 100,000 children in more than 70 school buildings in grades K-12. Schools were able to implement the OBPP either in a district-wide manner or on a building only basis. Schools that agreed to district-wide implementation became part of HALT!, whereas districts that chose to implement at the building level became part of PA CARES. For both programs, a certified Olweus trainer conducted the standard OBPP Coordinating Committee and staff trainings prior to implementation. Both programs provided all necessary OBPP materials during the first year, consultation with a certified trainer, and all survey instruments throughout the 3-year evaluation period.</p>
<p>Prior to the start of the school year, coordinating committees and staff were trained. Schools then had approximately 2 to 4 months of planning before the program was implemented school wide.</p>
<p>For HALT!, certified Olweus trainers offered intensive support and onsite consultation, up to 8 hours per week per public school district as needed (3-7 buildings per district), throughout the first year of implementation. For PA CARES, individual public or private school buildings received up to 12 hours of certified Olweus trainer support during the first year of implementation.</p>
<p>The OBQ is used to collect baseline data on students in Grades 3 to 12. The OBQ is not recommended for use with students in grades K-2. The survey was administered prior to the start of the program and at the end of Year 1 and Year 2.</p>
<p>Approximately 100,000 students in western and central Pennsylvania participated in either program during Years 1 and 2 and more than 56,000 surveys were administered during this period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839910386887">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Measures used included the OBQ, which was administered to students in Grades 3 to 12. The Teacher Questionnaire was also administered to teachers in HALT! schools.</p>
<p>The goal of the project was to produce a positive change in school climate by the end of the 3-year implementation period. Change in school climate was measured by looking at changes in students’ perceptions of their teachers’ effectiveness in preventing and intervening in bullying situations, the rate at which students actively intervene in support of their peers, the rate that students express fear of being bullied, and the students’ perceptions as to how much they enjoy school.</p>
<p>A measure of relative change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910386887">Olweus &amp; Limber, 2010</xref>) was used for analysis. This is calculated as the difference in percentages between the baseline (initial) assessment prior to program implementation, and subsequent assessments. As an example, if the percentage of bullied students in elementary school is 20% at Time 1 (baseline) and 15% at Time 2 (after 3+ months of implementation), the relative change score will be 25% [(20 - 15) × 100/20 = -25%]. An age-cohorts design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910386887">Olweus &amp; Limber, 2010</xref>) was used to analyze program effects. Data from two equivalent age cohorts of students are compared at two or more points in time (preimplementation and postimplementation).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1524839910386887" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The OBQ consisted of 42 multipart questions that collected data on bullying problems, attitudes regarding bullying, bystander perceptions of bullying, and general satisfaction with school. Some of the key hallmarks included student reports of being bullied, student reports of engaging in bullying behavior, students’ perception of adult attitudes, students’ attitudes about bullying, and students’ perception of teachers’ responsiveness to bullying.</p>
<sec id="section3-1524839910386887">
<title>General Results From HALT! and PA CARES</title>
<p>Overall, student self-reports of bullying others were reduced among nearly all cohorts and age groups. Results appeared to be particularly positive among high school students, where reductions were observed in bullying others of 15% to 39%, depending on the specific cohort. However, mixed findings were seen in students’ self-reports of being bullied, with some age groups and cohorts showing decreases and others showing no positive program effects.</p>
<p>Almost universally across age groups and cohorts, positive changes were observed in students’ perceptions that adults in the school were actively working to address bullying. With a range of 11% to 53%, fewer students reported feeling like their teacher had done “little or nothing” to address bullying.</p>
<p>Across most groups, increases were observed in the percentage of students who indicated they would try to help a bullied student, and decreases in the percentage who felt they would passively observe or join in bullying. For example, after 2 years of implementation, 27% more elementary students (from HALT! schools) said they would try to help a bullied student.</p>
<p>Very positive findings were observed regarding elementary, middle, and high school teachers’ perceptions of bullying and activities to address bullying at school after 1 year of OBPP implementation. For example, there were marked and statistically significant increases (ranging from 14% to 131%) among elementary, middle, and high school teachers in the likelihood that they regularly (two or more times per month) talked with their classes about bullying.</p>
<p>Consistently positive and significant increases were observed in elementary, middle, and high school teachers’ perceptions that their schools’ rules and policies about bullying had been clearly communicated to students (ranging from 17% to 69%), parents (ranging from 14% to 81%), teachers (ranging from 19% to 30%), and other staff (19% to 34%).</p>
<p>In high schools, there were positive intervention results for student reports of being bullied, bullying others, perceptions of adult responses to bullying, and attitudes about bullying.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1524839910386887">
<title>HALT! and PA CARES Program Specific Findings</title>
<p>Data from the HALT! Cohort 1 schools revealed that many program effects are stronger after 2 years of implementation than after 1 year of implementation. These findings are consistent with those of other studies that have observed the implementation of OBPP as an ongoing process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839910386887">Olweus, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910386887">Olweus &amp; Limber, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>At the end of 12 or more months of implementation of the OBPP in Cohort 1 HALT!, elementary and high schools, positive findings observed included significantly decreased reports of students bullying others and the perception that teachers were doing “little or nothing” to prevent bullying in both elementary and high schools. In addition, high schools had significantly decreased reports of students being bullied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1524839910386887">Figure 1</xref>). There was a reduction in reports of bullying others among elementary students, although this decrease was not statistically significant. Significant decreases were observed in most specific forms of bullying. In Cohort I participating schools were either grades K-6 buildings or Grades 7 to 12 buildings; thus there were no “middle schools.”</p>

<p>Survey Results From HALT! Cohort 1 After 2 Years of Program Implementation</p>
<p>After 2 years of the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program (OBPP) implementation, several positive results were seen. In elementary schools, there were decreased reports of bullying others, significantly fewer reports of teachers doing “little or nothing” to prevent bullying, and significantly more students who reported they would try to help a bullied student. In high schools, there were significantly fewer reports of being bullied, significantly fewer reports of bullying others, and significantly fewer reports of teachers doing “little or nothing” to prevent bullying.</p>

Elementary, middle, and high schools had significantly decreased reports of bullying others and the perception that teachers were doing “little or nothing” to prevent bullying. Middle and high schools had significantly decreased reports of students who believed they could join in bullying, and elementary and middle schools had significantly increased reports of students who would try to help a bullying victim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1524839910386887">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As a result of the efforts of the foundation and the bullying prevention coalition it helped to establish, this Pennsylvania-based bullying prevention initiative serves as the largest and most comprehensive effort to date to systematically and strategically address this public health issue. This group is one of the largest cohorts of children in the world who have been evaluated to determine the effects of a bullying prevention initiative, and this study offers the largest ongoing coordinated implementation and evaluation of the OBPP in the United States. These data also represent the first systematic pilot of the OBPP in high school settings in the United States.</p>
<p>For both HALT! and PA CARES, positive intervention results were seen for student reports of being bullied, bullying others, perceptions of adult responses to bullying, and attitudes about bullying after 1 year of implementation. It is not only important to see decreases in students’ reports of being bullied and bullying others, but it is also to observe changes in students’ perceptions of adults’ responsiveness to the implementation of the OBPP elements. In addition, a more positive school climate is created by decreasing the percentage of students who are “bystanders” when they see bullying occur and by increasing the percentage of students who actively try to help the bullied students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839910386887">Limber, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>For the schools that implemented the OBPP for 2 years, these data reveal that many program effects are stronger after 2 years of implementation than after 1 year, and these findings are consistent with those of other studies that have observed the implementation of OBPP as an ongoing process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839910386887">Olweus, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910386887">Olweus &amp; Limber, 2010</xref>). Year 2 data support the need and importance of implementing OBPP over 2 or more years.</p>
<p>Particularly promising are initial results from students in participating high schools. These findings underscore the need to further understand the current application of the OBPP in high school settings and to develop ways to tailor and improve this implementation. This study’s preliminary results indicate an area of further investigation regarding differences between teacher and student perceptions of bullying behavior and the need for bullying prevention at the high school level.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The OBPP is the most widely accepted, internationally recognized, evidenced-based health promotion program developed to address the issue of school-based bullying—the most common form of violence in our society. This large-scale implementation of the OBPP is the largest and most comprehensive bullying prevention effort to date. Through collaborative relationships among unconventional partners, charitable foundations have the ability to take a leadership role in positively affecting the behavioral and physical health outcomes of a large population of children and adolescents.</p>
<p>In light of rising costs of health care, the nonprofit health insurance foundation’s willingness to invest in health promotion and disease prevention is important. Not only has this project positively improved the school climate, it has also created coalitions, built capacity in schools, and fostered collaboration among health and education professionals across a variety of public and private sectors. The sharing of information and talent has allowed the project to succeed and has helped to establish “best practices” in the growing area of bullying prevention.</p>
<p>In the United States, addressing school-based bullying is often accomplished on a school by school basis, and occasionally at the level of a school district. This study demonstrates the importance of using public health science when embarking on large-scale prevention education initiatives. Recommended strategies for success include the preliminary identification of key partners for financial support and community engagement, utilization of an evidence-based prevention program, commitment of schools or other implementation sites for a period of at least 3 years, prioritizing multitargeted evaluation strategies, and intensive programmatic supports that extend beyond initial training.</p>
<p>Of significant importance is the assertion that effective implementation of an evidence-based program aimed at children and adolescents needs to include synergy between parents and teachers. The engagement of parents in bullying prevention has proved difficult beyond those parents who perceive that their child was or is bullied. Findings indicate that the early involvement of parents in a school’s planning and implementation of bullying prevention programming is essential to its ultimate success. A project of this scale also required significant planning and communication between schools, trainers, coordinators, and evaluators. Building opportunities and protocol for communication prior to the study is a more preferable course than communicating only as needs arise. Additional time was allotted to trainers beyond the OBPP recommendations to assist school-based coordinators related to implementing and sustaining the model with fidelity. Future efforts within this project will include process evaluation for training within the program model, enhanced capacity of trainers to include expertise in working within school systems to effect change, and continuing education specific to administrators for skill development regarding enhanced parent communication, problem solving with more complex issues of bullying, and leadership for staff related to sustainability of the program.</p>
<p>The preliminary impact data from the first 2 years of this multiyear initiative, in response to the well-documented negative health and social effects of bullying, clearly demonstrate the importance of adherence to prevention science and to identifying key partnerships as consistent with the public health model. Through the initiative’s comprehensive and strategic approach to program implementation, partnerships it created, and through the evaluation process, a cultural change has come about in participating schools. Bullying is now an understood behavior that no longer will be tolerated and can no longer disrupt an educational environment without consequences.</p>
