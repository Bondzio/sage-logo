<abstract>
<p>As part of a larger study, we offered Everyday Life Rehabilitation (ELR) as a model for integrated occupational therapy in sheltered or supported housing facilities, to enable meaningful daily occupations for people with psychiatric disabilities. Our aim with this study was to understand how participants made sense of their occupational transformations in the context of their everyday life and life history. We carried out qualitative interviews and field observations with 16 participants with psychosis-related disorders. We used narrative analysis and disclosed stories of “rediscovering agency,” referring to occupational and identity transformations. A parallel outcome study has shown positive results for participants, and by using narrative inquiry we contribute with a deeper understanding of the meaning making of their transformations and mechanisms of the intervention; i.e., hope, extended value of reaching goals, reentering the majority world, transparency of process, and attunement to the individual. The findings support the use of the ELR intervention.</p>

<body>
<p>Individuals dealing with the consequences of long-term psychosis-related disorders often experience extensive difficulties in engaging in meaningful and purposeful daily occupations<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1049732313482047">1</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732313482047">Eklund, Leufstadius, &amp; Bejerholm, 2009</xref>). It is common that they spend a large part of the day asleep or resting, with little time spent doing daily occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732313482047">Leufstadius &amp; Eklund, 2008</xref>). Additionally, medication is less effective in treating so-called negative symptoms such as inactivity and the inability to initiate and perform meaningful occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732313482047">Chugg &amp; Craik, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>People with severe psychiatric disability are commonly cared for in community-based housing facilities where they are provided with assistance to satisfy their daily needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732313482047">Statens Offentliga Utredningar, 2006</xref>). Living in housing facilities is, however, subject to certain constraining risks, in addition to the psychiatric illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732313482047">Fakhoury &amp; Priebe, 2007</xref>). People who have been cared for over an extended period of time risk becoming dependent, suffer from stagnation, become less confident about their capacity, and become less inclined to take initiative in their everyday life. Overall, they experience low control over their lives, which can be expressed as being generally deprived of personal agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732313482047">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000</xref>). Deprived agency is often linked to having limited social interaction, as well as poor health and well-being.</p>
<p>To overcome the difficulties, the importance of flexible and client-centered interventions has been emphasized in contrast to standardized programs with the same content for all. Occupational therapy focuses on enabling people to perform meaningful daily occupations despite their disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732313482047">Haertl &amp; Minato, 2006</xref>). Client-centered occupational therapy can be helpful in developing a stronger sense of agency among institutionalized persons. An assumption we make is that the capacity to perform meaningful daily occupations and agency are interrelated.</p>
<p>Occupations that are generally perceived as meaningful to people with psychiatric disability are those that promote being productive and contributing to society, include social contacts, and result in self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732313482047">Aubin, Hachey, &amp; Mercier, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732313482047">Hvalsoe &amp; Josephsson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732313482047">Leufstadius, Eklund, &amp; Erlandsson, 2009</xref>). Such occupations also offer individuals new opportunities to form alternative identities (Hvalsoe &amp; Josephsson). Still, what constitutes meaningful and engaging occupation is highly individual and therefore challenging to target.</p>
<p>We are interested in the relationship between occupational therapy interventions, the significance of home for occupational transformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732313482047">Lindström, Lindberg, &amp; Sjöström, 2011</xref>), and agency within this group. Researchers focusing on interventions for individuals with severe and long-term psychiatric disability have rarely investigated how clients create meaning about their individual processes of occupational change. If engaging individuals in the pursuit of agency or new identities is central, narratives from participants become crucial to understanding the practice of occupational therapy. Our aim with this article is to understand how participants make sense of their occupational transformations in the context of their everyday life and life history.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732313482047">
<title>Contextual and Conceptual Frames</title>
<p>Based on incipient evidence for some rehabilitation principles, the intervention model Everyday Life Rehabilitation (ELR) was developed by the first author (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732313482047">Lindström, 2007</xref>) as a platform for integrated occupational therapy in sheltered and supported housing. ELR was built on core principles and manualized process steps, allowing for individualized content. Mainly, ELR was developed to clarify the recovery- and occupation-oriented frames and enhance collaboration between professionals and participants.</p>
<p>Results from an outcome study about this intervention model indicated that significant improvements were obtained regarding activities of daily living ability and health factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732313482047">Lindström, Hariz, &amp; Bernspång, 2012</xref>). The outcome components measured at baseline (pre), discharge (post), and 6-month follow-up were goal attainment, occupational performance, activity level, satisfaction with daily occupations, effort and independence in activities of daily living, and reduced symptoms of psychopathology. Statistically significant improvements were found on a group level in most of the variables when comparing pre and post measures, and good stability was found at the 6-month follow-up when comparing pre and follow-up measures. This led us to ask what the changes meant in real life for participants with a long history of psychiatric disability. We designed the current study to analyze the intervention program from the perspective of participants.</p>
<p>Narrative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732313482047">Polkinghorne, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732313482047">Ricoeur, 1984</xref>) can be used to understand the experiences and meaning associated with an event or process in life. Narrating allows the possibility of grasping connections and forming a whole out of parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732313482047">Mattingly, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732313482047">Ricoeur, 1984</xref>). It is also important for self-understanding and a means to create identity in interaction with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732313482047">Polkinghorne, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732313482047">Ricoeur, 1992</xref>). Hence, in this article we use narratives to describe the form, function, enactment, and meaning of occupational patterns in unique individuals within specific contexts.</p>
<p>The concept of personal agency is commonly defined as the capacity to act. We approach the understanding of and conditions for personal agency as a dialectic and generative process between agency and structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732313482047">Giddens, 1979</xref>). The structure in different contexts reflects specific constellations of features at micro, meso, and macro levels that constrain, afford, and/or enable actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732313482047">Giddens, 1984</xref>). Across the episodes of everyday occupations in varying contexts, the individual constantly discovers and refines who she or he is and what she or he is capable of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732313482047">Unruh, 2004</xref>). Therefore, agency is also closely related to identity, choice, competence, productivity, sociality, and relatedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732313482047">Phelan &amp; Kinsella, 2009</xref>). The understanding of agency and structure as highly interconnected and context-bound occurrences emphasizes how the enabling and constraining elements in relation to enactment and meanings vary widely.</p>
<p>Viewing agency from an intrapersonal perspective, people with psychosis-related disorders often perceive a reorganization of the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732313482047">Dimaggio &amp; Lysaker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732313482047">Jeannerod, 2009</xref>), which negatively influences their agentic possibilities, conscious attribution of agency, and abilities to engage in meaningful daily occupations. Individuals with a low sense of personal agency have low standards to which they aspire, and often do not even try to pursue goals. Failure can undermine trust in their own capability, which can lead to consequences such as alienation, amotivation, sedentary lifestyle, helplessness, and antisocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732313482047">Bandura 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732313482047">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The perspective of institutionalization adds to the complexity of understanding a sedentary lifestyle. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732313482047">Thornicroft, Rose, and Mehta (2010)</xref> have described how present-day mini institutions lead to similar problems as former mental hospitals displayed, wherein individuals, despite being located in a seemingly open community, live sedentary lives dependent on and influenced by the community care workers who provide assistance. They adapt to an artificial environment that does not prepare them for community integration and self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732313482047">Priebe et al., 2005</xref>). In conclusion, the lack of agency is not only associated with the psychosis-related disorder, but also with the context in which people exist. Being at home, when living in a housing facility, is more than having an adequate shelter. It is equally about being placed in a particular social and institutionalized world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732313482047">Kellett &amp; Moore, 2003</xref>). Thus, among other aspects, institutionalization restricts agency, and therefore people situated in a marginalized place need adequate strategies to develop personal agency.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>As part of a larger study, we offered an intervention based on the ELR model, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732313482047">Lindström (2007)</xref>; this is a model for integrated, home-based occupational therapy for people with severe psychiatric disability living in sheltered or supported housing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1049732313482047">2</xref></sup> We chose a narrative approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732313482047">Clandinin &amp; Connelly, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732313482047">Polkinghorne, 1995</xref>) to enable understanding of the unique perspectives of participants.</p>
<sec id="section3-1049732313482047">
<title>Recruitment</title>
<p>The intervention was implemented within the social psychiatry organization of a medium-sized municipality in northern Sweden. Occupational therapy services were made available through open announcements, informational meetings, and brochures, and offered free of charge to all citizens with psychosis-related disabilities living in sheltered or supported housing in the municipality. Seventeen service users agreed to participate in the intervention as well as the research study. We acquired ethical approval from the regional ethical review board in Umeå. Informed oral and written consent were obtained from the participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732313482047">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Sixteen of 17 participants (7 women and 9 men) between the ages 27 and 66 years (mean = 48), living in sheltered (<italic>n</italic> = 13) or supported (<italic>n</italic> = 3) housing, completed the intervention program. One participant was unable to finish the program owing to admission to the hospital. The entire group had received a previous diagnosis of schizophrenia or other psychosis-related disorders and had experienced psychiatric disability for between 9 and 48 years (mean = 23). Their social backgrounds were working- or middle class and all were single at the time of intervention. Prior to the intervention, 3 participants went to an activity center part time and 13 had no organized daily occupation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732313482047">
<title>Intervention</title>
<p>The core purpose of ELR (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732313482047">Figure 1</xref>) is to enable participants to engage in meaningful daily occupations in their natural everyday contexts. ELR is based on the following principles and procedures: partnering client centeredness; recovery-oriented perspectives; signification of user preferences throughout the rehabilitation process; goal setting based on user choices; well-matched occupation-based training in real-life settings; individually set timeframes; support during a maintenance phase after goal attainment; and close collaboration between occupational therapist (OT), community care workers (CCWs), and the resident throughout. ELR also contains implemental aspects, such as model education for OTs as well as CCWs and their managers; model counseling for OTs; and information strategies—i.e., brochures, and information meetings with residents, relatives, CCWs, other collaborative persons, and user organizations. ELR has been described in detail elsewhere (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732313482047">Lindström, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732313482047">Lindström et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Client centeredness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732313482047">Rogers, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732313482047">Townsend &amp; Polatajko, 2007</xref>) is based on a good therapeutic relationship and a partnering approach to agree on goals and means in line with client wishes and conditions along the whole intervention process. The key points characterizing a recovery approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732313482047">Bonney &amp; Stickley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732313482047">Chandler &amp; Repper, 2011</xref>) can be summarized as positive and shared risk taking in terms of enabling individuals to make choices about all aspects of their lives, building meaningful and satisfying lives as defined by the persons themselves, enhancing hope, moving away from an illness focus toward one of health and wellness, and being able to take on occupational roles within local communities rather than in segregated services. Real-life challenges are vital, because recovery unfolds within the context of natural environments and occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732313482047">Borg &amp; Davidson, 2008</xref>). Thus, the occupation-based training preferably takes place in natural situations. The OT suggests well-matched strategies to enable participants to overcome their problems and gradually develop occupational competence.</p>
<p>As part of the ELR, the OTs apply the Occupational Therapy Intervention Process Model (OTIPM) developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732313482047">Fisher (2009)</xref>, which provides manualized process steps for a structured but individually flexible process. The process steps include developing therapeutic relationships; identifying resources and limitations within a client-centered performance context; identifying and prioritizing client-reported strengths and problems of occupational performance; observing and analyzing task performance; interpreting cause; selecting the model for intervention; planning and implementing interventions; and reevaluating.</p>
<p>Client-driven goals are central within the ELR, and identifying goals is an ongoing parallel process along the evaluations and different process steps of the OTIPM. Using meaningful daily occupations as goal and means, the OT gradually increases the difficulty of the activities until the participant reaches the targeted goal. The CCWs’ role in this process is to help participants integrate and maintain new abilities over time. The interventions were carried out by two OTs who were specifically employed to work in close collaboration with the usual CCWs. Depending on the goals of each participant, the intervention phase ranged from 2 to 17 months (mean = 6.4). Typically, the OT met with each participant for 1 to 2 hours per week in a home or community setting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732313482047">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Toward the end of the intervention program, the first author conducted repeated informal interviews and field observations with the participants who had taken part in the intervention. Field observations provide direct access to the concrete actions of everyday life, allowing for context-sensitive interpretation of events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732313482047">Hammersley &amp; Atkinson, 2007</xref>). Field observations also encourage spontaneous informal conversational interviews, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732313482047">Patton (2002)</xref>. The field observations facilitated interviews by making the situation more relaxed and also by providing the interviewer with contextual knowledge that facilitated conversations.</p>
<p>The meetings often started by having coffee together in the participant’s home. In the unstructured conversations participants were encouraged to tell stories about the process and give concrete examples. Participants were also encouraged to show the settings where the training took place to facilitate memory recall and further enrich their stories. Each meeting lasted between 45 minutes and 3 hours. Interviews were audio-recorded and observational data were recorded in retrospective field notes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732313482047">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The transcripts from interviews and field observations were subjected to a narrative-type inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732313482047">Polkinghorne, 1995</xref>); that is, a narrative analysis of eventful data to produce explanatory stories. We also used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732313482047">Clandinin and Connelly’s (2000)</xref> three dimensions for analysis of narrative inquiry spaces: temporality, sociality, and place.</p>
<p>Initially, the narratives were read in their entirety to grasp a comprehensive picture, with a focus on descriptions of events. As significant events were identified, data from interviews and field observations were rewritten and grouped into a core story for each participant. The next strategy of emplotment included working with one or more plots of a story to disclose how it was constructed, conveying meaning making. We regarded a plot as the main point or logic of expression that generated meaning through temporal order and progression. This dialectic process of moving back and forth, comparing possible plot structures, was first conducted by two of the authors followed by continuing mutual comparisons among all three. Several possible storylines were then analyzed by all three authors until a negotiated outcome in line with the empirical data was accomplished.</p>
<p>Different theories were brought into analysis to explore different understandings of the storylines. When we found that the narratives often had the form of a “success story,” subsequent analysis was structured by that notion. Another major framework for the analysis was how participants’ narratives seemed to refer to both occupational transformation, regarding capacity to act and to perform desired tasks, and to the start of an identity transformation from a passive into an agentic identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732313482047">Polkinghorne, 1996</xref>). Subsequently, four of the 16 participant narratives were chosen for closer analysis of the meaning making and narrative structure. These cases are presented in some detail and were chosen to represent a variation in manner of narrating, the transformative processes (length of intervention, targeted occupation and place, identity), as well as characteristics such as life and illness history and gender. The resulting storylines presented here are representative of all 16 narratives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1049732313482047">3</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section8-1049732313482047">
<title>Findings: Rediscovering Agency</title>
<p>Our analysis was about rediscovery—an overall occurrence we saw throughout the data. Rediscovering agency goes beyond the attainment of specific goals or skills, but rather addresses occupational and identity transformation. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1049732313482047">Figure 2</xref>, we have analyzed and presented the findings in three different facets: the basis of their narrative structure and the construction of success; the four representative cases demonstrating how transformations occur within individual contexts of life; and four key storylines representing different aspects of rediscovering agency.</p>

<sec id="section9-1049732313482047">
<title>Structuring Transformation as a Success Story</title>
<p>Needless to say, there was divergence in the transformative processes between participants of the intervention. Nevertheless, certain narrative structures and topics reappeared throughout the interviews. It also became obvious how important narration itself was for participants’ understandings of the process of change and in the construction of succeeding in rehabilitative efforts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732313482047">Clandinin and Connelly (2000)</xref> provided a framework to analyze narrative structure in terms of temporality, sociality, and place. In our data, temporality and sociality were the two most dominant dimensions structuring the stories.</p>
<p>Temporality was a central feature used to emphasize the process of transformation and rediscovering capabilities. When portraying the past, the participants’ narratives contained both good and bad pasts. The good pasts related to life before the onset of mental illness, when participants held jobs or studied and had richer social lives. On an individual basis, this was contrasted with the many years of a bad past that followed, characterized by a limited, passive, and isolated everyday life. Depictions of the present were then, at least implicitly, contrasted against the past, thus resulting in success stories. The new accomplishments stood out against the negative experiences from the bad past, but they could also be connected to memories from the good past, thus using a former identity to construe a new identity. Another temporal feature that contributed to the success story was the frequent ordering of events into progressive steps, wherein one accomplishment led to another.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the participants seldom referred to the future in their narratives. The future appeared uncertain, although hope was a recurring theme, which we explore in some detail in a following section. Relating success stories without a vision of a brighter future seems paradoxical. One reason for participants to avoid addressing the future might have been a long history of repeated failures and unfinished tasks, usually associated with long-term psychiatric disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732313482047">Kielhofner, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The sociality of the narratives was structured in relation to the role professionals played in the lives of participants, which was contrasted against loneliness and a lack of genuine relationships with people outside the housing setting. Notably, other service recipients living as neighbors under similar conditions were not constructed as important. Sociality was also about daring to meet other people outside the housing facility, which was explicitly highlighted when participants talked about practicing social skills.</p>
<p>In the narratives, we identified three different ways of talking about the place in which an experience happened: spatial, social, and mental. The narratives were structured by a symbolic contrast of going in and out—of the housing facility, the real world (as opposed to the psychotic world), and the big world (as opposed to the gray world). This referred to going inside and outside the housing facility, and became a vehicle for developing theories about isolation, reintegration, and belonging. To some extent, the comparison of the in/out aspects also addressed a mental state. There was a polarization between the gray, miserable daily life within the housing compared to the big world outside, and it became apparent that if a participant talked about the big world, he or she must also talk about his or her own gray world.</p>

<title>Transformation in Individual Contexts of Life</title>
<p>To provide context for the reader and to explain the storylines and narrative aspects as part of the comprehensive life stories, we present narratives from four of the participants in some detail.</p>
<sec id="section11-1049732313482047">
<title>Elisabeth: Returning to physical activity</title>
<p>Elisabeth received the diagnosis of schizophrenia 20 years previous to the study, when she was 36 years old. She began by telling the interviewer that she was divorced, had a daughter, and had previously worked as a ward assistant. She emphasized her loneliness in the sheltered housing where she lived. She described feelings of being trapped and that she did not have much to do. Previously in life she had enjoyed going for long walks, venturing into the city center for shopping, or visiting the public pools and saunas. Prior to the intervention, she refrained from entering venues with crowds of people, and she was completely unable to go to the city center. As a result, she remained at home most of the time. She contrasted her wishes of being capable with feelings of being afraid, frail, and invisible.</p>
<p>Elisabeth explained how she joined the program to regain her ability to go for walks. She welcomed a structured tactic to rebuild routines for walks and described how she gradually challenged herself in the training sessions. She described how she became much happier as she started to walk again, and how she lacked the energy to tackle this until the occupational therapist helped her get started. She said that the occupational therapist encouraged her to increase walking speed as she became stronger. For Elisabeth, the value of her training extended beyond the task of walking. She described how the occupational therapist also had boosted her self-esteem and encouraged her to venture out more. By conquering her fear of going out of the apartment, Elisabeth had overcome a major barrier and was increasingly in more control of her life. Her narrative illustrates the importance of rediscovering herself as a physically active woman, and how this transcended into social interaction with strangers and general well-being.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049732313482047">
<title>John: Regaining control of money</title>
<p>John received the diagnosis of schizophrenia 40 years previous to the intervention, when he was 24 years old. He began by describing that he used to be a self-employed consultant in the construction industry, but then had a trustee who handled his money and provided him with pocket money once a week.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1049732313482047">4</xref></sup> He mentioned that he had been married but had lived alone in sheltered housing, highly assisted in daily activities for many years. John stressed the importance of doing something. The situation of having a disability pension had resulted in loneliness and limitations in life. John wrote letters with religious messages to relatives and acquaintances in the community and went to church regularly. Because a sense of being needed was very important to John, he was assigned some staff duties, such as carrying out the garbage.</p>
<p>When John joined the program, his top priority was to manage his pocket money. When he managed to regain control of his pocket money within a couple of months, he was surprised that it was so easy. He expressed joy, amazement, and pride, and explained that the effort fueled other changes in life, such as hopefulness, outreach activities, and engagement with others. His positive experience with the program led him toward his old agentic and energetic “I,” and he advocated that others within community mental health services should be provided with the same opportunities to discover meaningful activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1049732313482047">
<title>Carl: Rediscovering a social life</title>
<p>Carl received the diagnosis of schizophrenia 16 years previous to the intervention, when he was 37 years old. Previously, Carl had both a family and a professional life. He described having had severe suicidal thoughts over the years, and also conveyed a lot of nervousness, anxiety, and stress. Carl lived in sheltered housing where daily, preprepared meals were provided and personnel were available around the clock. He enjoyed the accommodation, but felt that he had become “stuck” there. He stressed that he felt very insecure meeting others because of his mental illness, and shame because of his previous alcohol abuse. His anxiety had forced him to avoid certain places and activities from his past that he really wanted to pursue; for example, going to cafés, pubs, church, and hockey games, and going out dancing. Carl related how his lack of willpower and inability to do things drained him of energy. In particular, he stressed that he was shy, embarrassed, and uncomfortable with women, although his first and foremost wish was to meet a woman again. Carl explained that meeting a woman was the main reason why he joined the program. In addition, he wanted to catch up with old friends and have a richer social life outside the housing facility.</p>
<p>As part of the ELR program, Carl joined a social skills training group. He also practiced going to venues of his choosing, first with the occupational therapist and later by himself. Carl believed that he learned a lot in the program and had become more daring in relating to people both inside and outside his housing facility. He appreciated how the social skills training course was very concrete, and that he was pushed to face new challenges. By gradually rediscovering social skills and his capacity to catch up with friends again, Carl was taking charge of his own progress and had a renewed confidence in his own potential.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1049732313482047">
<title>Anne: Preparing healthy meals</title>
<p>Anne received the diagnosis of schizophrenia 35 years previous to the intervention, when she was 25 years old. She recounted that she had suffered from psychosis for most of her adult life, although she had worked at the local tax office when she was younger. She lived alone in her self-contained apartment but received help from community care workers with house cleaning, personal hygiene, and shopping. She described a sparse social network. During the interview she hovered between a humorous attitude and expressing considerable uncertainty, voicing doubts about her ability to tell anything of value. For many years, she had lived almost entirely on a diet of pork chops and sweets. She wanted to change her unhealthy diet, not the least because of her diabetes.</p>
<p>Through the program, she started to think in terms of varying her diet, and she related that she had learned to cook 53 different dishes. Anne’s story was different from the others because the skills she acquired through the program were new to her. Even though she was not rediscovering cooking abilities, she was regaining a sense of capacity, pride, creativity, and of having a varied activity repertoire. Anne expressed how she was rediscovering her old self by finding pleasure and joy in doing something and being able to make the day matter for herself. At the time of interview, she even tried to reshape situations such as the follow-up meeting regarding municipal psychiatric services by inviting the professionals to a “party,” where she served them lunch during the discussion. By doing this she also proved to herself that she was capable of planning and cooking healthy food.</p>

<sec id="section15-1049732313482047">
<title>Key Storylines About the Rediscovery of Agency</title>
<p>The following key storylines represent different aspects of rediscovering agency in the 16 narratives. As participants regained competence in daily occupations and rebuilt broader activity repertoires, they appeared to gain confidence in both their right and ability to make decisions about everyday matters. This seemed to support the transformation into an agentic identity as well as a growing capacity to act in everyday life.</p>
<sec id="section16-1049732313482047">
<title>The emergence of hope in a sedentary life</title>
<p>A common feature in the narratives was how occupational transformation was contrasted against everyday life as gray, lonesome, and passive. When participants described their day-to-day lives, they tended to emphasize how gray and limited their existence was. Elisabeth bluntly related, “I don’t go out. I sit on the couch during the day and look at the wall.” Similarly, Anne highlighted that she had done very little during the 35 years since her diagnosis:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The only things I do by myself are eat and sometimes read books. Once a week, they give me a ride to the store to buy food for the coming week and once in a while we go on outings with personnel, but otherwise I just sit in the apartment most of the time.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Overall, individual participants described their problem as lacking the most basic energy and motivation to engage in new activities, or even manage to go out of the apartment. In part, they attributed this to their mental illness, but also how the cleaning and cooking services they were provided inhibited initiative.</p>
<p>Against the background of how tiring it was to be inactive, the participants depicted how important even the seemingly minor transformations had been to provide energy to pursue further ambitions to change. In Elisabeth’s case, the occupational skill to be able to walk on a sidewalk might appear trivial; however, she expressed that her accomplishments produced energy, courage, and even a drive to look at possible development in the future. Anne described a positive feeling stemming from her efforts compared to her previous situation: “I’ve felt desire, zest, and energy from having something concrete to do. It gave me something else to think about.” Like Anne, participants often talked about the joy and emotional sides of new activities.</p>
<p>Even though participants were cautious about the future, it was possible to identify a sense of hope in many stories. An illustration of this was provided by Carl: “My experience in rehabilitation has helped me to look at myself and others in my surroundings with slightly different eyes. I have found deficiencies in care, but also the hope of change.” Carl even described how he had begun to think more of an alternative life, what a good life might entail, and how others lead their lives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1049732313482047">
<title>The dependency of support from personnel</title>
<p>Caregivers often appeared in the narratives. When recounting ordinary life prior to the intervention, participants talked about their dependence on the CCWs who worked within the housing facilities. In relation to the intervention, the role of the OT was brought to the forefront. Occasionally, participants also used language that was similar to the OTs’. Some participants highlighted the value of this intervention by claiming that it was the first time they had ever been offered any kind of rehabilitative services. By and large, the OTs were portrayed in strongly positive terms. There was not a single case in which OTs were criticized, and one person even described his OT as “angelic.” The stories vacillated between emphasizing how transformations were individual accomplishments and how important the OT had been to the transformative process. The following excerpt from Anne’s interview contains both of these aspects:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You know at first I thought she would help me, but then I realized that she let me do everything that I could handle. And then she just sat at the kitchen table while I kept working. She talked to me while I was doing things, but I had to do everything myself. When I asked her if it was supposed to be like this, she explained that she was there to help me to become more secure and also flexible in how I plan for and prepare meals. She would help me reach my own goals of becoming more and more independent. Afterwards, I thought about what she said and I thought it felt a bit strange that she was there without doing much, and yet observing. I think that after that occasion I began to reflect more about myself and how I usually do things, and what I can actually manage. She almost did not need to help me with anything at all.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here we see how Anne began to reinvent her own role in the process as being goal-directed, taking initiative, and being the expert of her progress. She underlined how passive the occupational therapist was and contrasted how her own expectations switched during the process: “At first I thought she would help me, but then I realized.” She also contrasted how the occupational therapist “just sat at the kitchen table” while she herself “kept working.” Anne also acknowledged that the occupational therapist provided some help, talking to her while Anne did things by herself. Anne contrasted the OT’s approach to that of the CCWs who came to her apartment, doing household chores while she passively sat and watched.</p>
<p>Like other participants, Anne emphasized how the OT explicitly talked about the process. The OT explained her approach. This in turn seemed to inspire Anne to reflect on herself and her occupational abilities. Other participants talked about the value of hands-on advice and being gently pushed. Carl explained,<disp-quote>
<p>First we talked about how to do it and then we did it, and then we talked about what had happened and what I would go for the next time. She was pushing me a bit and based her suggestions on what I wanted. She gave tips and shared ideas, and she encouraged me when I reached my goals.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Several of the participants talked about how they had been encouraged by OTs, but also how OTs had asked them about their opinions and really listened to them. In one statement, Carl explained how it had been crucial to articulate himself to another person because this offered self-understanding: “She showed respect for my personality. It meant that I had to think to come up with what I wanted to develop, and I felt respected and trusted.” Anne similarly said, “She often praised that I was full of ideas, and then I was happy and tried to become even more daring in what I could do. This has been a good arrangement.”</p>
<p>Being part of an intervention project and having an OT coming for regular visits also provided a sense of being acknowledged and feeling important. Many participants portrayed the weekly OT visit as a special episode in the course of everyday life, as exemplified by Elisabeth: “Every Wednesday I have been dressed and ready to walk, and it has always felt good afterwards.” They also expressed appreciation and amazement that the occupational therapist came to their home and also practiced their targeted occupations with them. Elisabeth reported how she felt special: “She traveled thirty kilometers to visit me at my home.”</p>

<sec id="section18-1049732313482047">
<title>Reentering the majority world</title>
<p>A recurring feature within the narratives was the contrast between isolated life in housing and a possible life outside, in the larger community. Terms such as “the majority world” or “outside the housing” seemed significant in the narratives. John described how he was previously involved in the community and compared this with the narrow world of his housing facility:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We live in two kinds of worlds. One is life in the inside world, in a double sense, and the other is life in the real world. Life on the inside, I think, is both the internal one inside my head and being limited to the confined life that comes with sheltered housing. . . . Through the rehabilitation I have come in contact with the big majority world on the outside again, and it makes me think a lot about values, life circumstances, and options.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this excerpt John talked about the majority world in at least three senses. It was “real” in comparison to the artificial environment of the housing, open in contrast to the confinement of the housing, and also provided external relations instead of internal brooding. Rehabilitation had helped him to enter the majority world again, redirecting him toward former experiences from a good past.</p>
<p>To the participants, the majority world appeared to offer crucial social relations that they did not find within the housing facility. As a matter of fact, none of the participants talked about good or enriching relationships with fellow residents at the housing facilities, as was illustrated by a comment from Carl:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There are few sources of inspiration at our housing and also a lot of negative influences from each other. Our world in the housing is a closed one. It is refreshing to get out of here and meet others and see other places. . . . I have opened my eyes a bit and approached the outside again, and it gives me opportunities and encouragement to believe in new relationships.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Overall, participants related positive relational and spatial dimensions to the world outside the housing. According to Elisabeth, “I have become stronger through the program and doors have been opened to more varied activities and actually getting out. It is a great feeling to go outside the housing facility. It feels great to be strong and outgoing.” The sense of raised potentials and reentering the outside world appears to have increased the awareness of and engagement in the participants lives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1049732313482047">
<title>The extended value of reaching goals</title>
<p>Overall, participants reached the goals they set for themselves. Naturally, the occupational skills acquired were important in themselves, but notably, rather than highlighting such intrinsic values, participants seemed to be even more interested in telling about the extended value of reaching goals. In some cases, the value of newly acquired skills extended to contexts that were relatively similar; for example, when Anne used her kitchen skills to invite friends over for lunch. Perhaps a more significant tendency was to emphasize the magnitude of the goals that were set. Anne saw her goal as bordering the highest ambition imaginable. Similarly, all participants portrayed goals as ambitious, and goal attainment could be described as “victories” achieved through acts of courage, like phoning a friend after 15 years. John construed the level of difficulty of his goal by stressing how surprised he was when he managed to reach it. Participants also described how goal attainment helped them to expand their activity repertoires in completely different areas; for example, when they found the courage to leave the premises of the housing by themselves.</p>
<p>Another extended value of reaching goals seems to have been psychological: attaining confidence, hope, and feeling joy over accomplishments. Elisabeth expressed this:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Walking is more than a task: it gets you going. I feel good and energized if I’ve managed to go for a walk. . . . I notice that I have become happier and stronger and a little less afraid when we walk or move in this direction.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She concluded by promising herself, “In the future I will try to struggle to take the walks during the week, because I feel good afterwards.” Carl added the aspect of confidence in his story: “I am more prepared now and confidence is of course an important ingredient. The greatest benefit is that I have started to talk with friends again.” For John, there was also a spiritual dimension in goal attainment: “Now I have a simple and strong belief in rehabilitation. The opening, faith, and hope that rehabilitation brought are similar to the hope that I get from God.”</p>
<p>The list of extended goals could be long, but perhaps the most crucial aspect was how goal attainment opened up the possibility to redefine identities. By attaining the goal of getting control of his pocket money, John was reconnecting to his former identity as an entrepreneur, and also making a connection with his Christian identity. Similarly, Elisabeth regained an identity as a physically capable woman. The common denominator for how identities were reinvented was agency. It seems that the most important value of goal attainment was how it made it possible for participants to construe themselves as active individuals capable of affecting their own life situations.</p>

<title>Concluding Discussion</title>
<sec id="section21-1049732313482047">
<title>Methodological Considerations</title>
<p>In this study, the participants’ narratives contributed to an understanding of how their transformations in everyday life came about. This inductive approach can contribute to the development of methodology for the evaluation of complex psychiatric interventions in terms of better-defined active mechanisms, defined core purposes of the intervention, deeper insight into how the interventions should be delivered, fidelity to certain aspects, instrument development of sociality and process aspects, and deeper understanding of how the transformations are reflected in the participants’ life histories.</p>
<p>A prominent aspect of the data was that they consisted of only success stories; none of the participants discussed failures and few related negative experiences. It is relevant to question whether it would have been possible to get negative stories from the participants, and whether it was the methodological approach that brought out success stories because we used success as an analytical tool or because it reflected a beneficial intervention, or a combination of both. The narrative form might have had to do with the research situation, a reluctance to address failure, or might have been because of the fact that being offered a rehabilitation program is an uncommon practice and therefore perceived as something important at which to succeed.</p>
<p>The trustworthiness might be questioned because the first author both implemented the intervention and was introduced to the participants as the primary researcher. The second and third authors did not interact with the participants directly, but were involved in the analysis. Nonetheless, we regard all research interviews and field observations as events in which the observer and participants played parts in the comprehension of sense making as one quality of the context that was brought into the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732313482047">Mishler, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>For any of these transformations to occur, a context needed to be established which facilitated their emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732313482047">Gergen &amp; Kaye, 1992</xref>). Regarding transferability, these housing facilities appeared ordinary within a Swedish municipal psychiatric service perspective. When considering implementing a similar program, one must reflect on the context and consider whether there are any particular contextual differences. Also, it might be important to bear in mind that the benefit of an intervention can be greater in this type of project than if it is offered as a regular treatment option.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1049732313482047">
<title>The Importance of Agency</title>
<p>Within this article, we have highlighted the promotion of agency. Agency, defined as the capacity to act, can only be understood within the context of social structures in given times and places, and influenced by cultures, social institutions, and norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732313482047">Giddens, 1984</xref>). Because this rehabilitation was conducted in a residential context with long-term perspectives of psychiatric disability, it became important to agency and identity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732313482047">Foucault (1980)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732313482047">Giddens (1979)</xref> have shown how structures can be simultaneously constraining and enabling, pointing at structure and agency as multifaceted and interrelated phenomena. When transferring these theories to the narratives from the participants, the structural forces from both the housing arrangements and the rehabilitative interventions might have had conflicting impact on their daily lives, because they could facilitate agency in some aspects and increase marginalization in others.</p>
<p>One prominent feature in the narratives was that the daily occupations provided the opportunity to work with identity in different ways. Participant stories indicated that engaging in an activity was linked to rediscovery of the capacity to act, so that when they were offered recreation of new or previous daily occupations, there were also opportunities to develop new capabilities, identities, and a sense of agency. The identity transformation involved improved self-confidence, goal attainment, and beginning to view better identity opportunities. This is in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732313482047">Polkinghorne’s (1996)</xref> work on reconfiguring narratives from victimic to agentic. Thus, it appears central for professionals to continuously promote and reflect on service recipients’ agentic possibilities in the context of daily life, housing, and society.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1049732313482047">
<title>Mechanisms of the Intervention</title>
<p>Evaluating the outcome of interventions is crucial for the development of improved methods targeting people with psychiatric disability. Typically, intervention researchers have a focus on the measurement of the outcome of specific interventions. Then again, it is also necessary to know why interventions work and what mechanisms cause improvements. Because the problems and contexts of target groups and interventions are complex, it is very difficult to sort out such mechanisms. To some extent, quantitative research can elucidate specific components that are effective in an intervention. Such studies do not provide ultimate answers, but they do direct us to the areas where we need to probe deeper to acquire a richer understanding of mechanisms. We argue that it is pertinent to apply qualitative methods to achieve that end.</p>
<p>The intervention investigated in this article has been proven to have positive outcomes for participants in a quantitative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732313482047">Lindström et al., 2012</xref>). The narrative analysis presented here provides an understanding of how participants made sense of the process and the transformations they went through. Overall, it seems that the objectively measured outcomes are mirrored by the success stories of the participants. Moreover, our narrative analysis contributes to a richer understanding of the meaning of such interventions in the context of individual life histories and housing circumstances.</p>
<p>Understanding participant experiences of the intervention is important in itself, but it also creates an opportunity to ask questions about what mechanisms might have been involved in the positive outcomes. In the following sections we discuss how the storylines we identified can elucidate the mechanisms of the ELR intervention. In technical terms, the positive outcomes that have been measured relate to ADL ability and psychiatric symptoms. In the narratives, such progress carries a deeper meaning of attaining a more agentic identity.</p>
<sec id="section24-1049732313482047">
<title>The emergence of hope in sedentary life</title>
<p>Given the emphasis of this notion in the narratives, we would like to suggest that hope can be regarded as a mechanism affecting agentic identity. Within the recovery paradigm, which inspired the ELR model, hope is acknowledged as an important feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732313482047">Chandler &amp; Repper, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732313482047">Nekolaichuk, Jevne, &amp; Maguire, 1999</xref>). It is hard to envision someone succeeding in a transformative process without having conceptions about possible improvements in the future. Given a long history of disappointments, sensing hope cannot be taken for granted and needs to be nurtured.</p>
<p>Participants often talked about how minor instances of progress created a sense of hope that provided them with the energy to pursue the goals they had set out for themselves. From the perspective of a service provider, the question of how to activate the mechanism of hope then becomes pertinent. A first observation is what several participants stressed: namely the value of actually being offered a rehabilitative intervention and the notion that someone believes in the possibility of changes. It also seems important that the process is designed in a manner such that the participant can experience minor achievements early on. As a cautionary note, it might be problematic to encourage unrealistic hope in the context of what the service system can provide.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-1049732313482047">
<title>The extended value of reaching goals</title>
<p>It is generally accepted within rehabilitation research that the goal-setting process is significant for the outcome of an intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732313482047">Playford, Siegert, Levack, &amp; Freeman, 2009</xref>). As measured, participants were successful in reaching goals. Remarkably, when relaying their achievements they tended to expand beyond the goals as they were originally set. They expanded activity repertoires in completely different areas, expressed joy over their accomplishments, and generally became more confident. Naturally, hope can also be seen as one such extended value of reaching goals. Thus, it seems that goal attainment is a mechanism affecting the broader end of achieving an agentic identity. From the perspective of a service provider, a first observation is the importance of being careful in the goal-setting phase, both to make sure that goals actually can and will be reached, and to allow the necessary time for the goal-setting phase while being attuned to how goals discussed can have extended values.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-1049732313482047">
<title>Reentering the majority world</title>
<p>With participants emphasizing the experiences of leaving the confinement of their housing facilities, we can see how entering the majority world can be viewed as a mechanism promoting agentic identity. This interpretation is consistent with current theories of participation in life situations and in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732313482047">World Health Organization, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732313482047">Yilmaz, Josephsson, Danermark, &amp; Ivarsson, 2008</xref>). The seemingly trivial enterprise of leaving the housing facility appears to have had strong symbolical meanings as well. The participants talked about experiences that could be interpreted in spatial, social, and mental perceptions. They talked about the value of conquering new places, of establishing new relationships, and expanding the notion of their capabilities. From the perspective of the service provider, the recommendation might appear simple: services need to be organized and funded to ascertain that service users will be supported in venturing out of their home environments. Moreover, such excursions need to be driven from the needs and capabilities of each individual.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-1049732313482047">
<title>The dependency of support from health care personnel</title>
<p>In participant stories, the occupational therapists played a crucial role. The relationship to the OT was complex, and we could detect several mechanisms contributing to agentic identity. Perhaps most prominently, participants talked about their appreciation for the listening attitude of the OT. It created a sense of being respected, and also allowed the participant to express him- or herself and actually make decisions about goals. Another aspect is transparency about the intervention process—the willingness of the OT to explain and discuss the structure of the process with the participant. A third aspect is attunement to the individual and the particularities of each individual process. These aspects are in line with client-centered principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732313482047">Rogers, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732313482047">Townsend &amp; Polatajko, 2007</xref>), and the narratives provided a deeper understanding of how they became important in everyday situations along the transformative processes.</p>
<p>From a service provider perspective, it is worth noting the skills needed for listening, being transparent, and structured, as well as the ability to adjust to each individual. Perhaps equally important is acknowledging the need for organizations to engage appropriate professional competencies and also allow professionals the time required to effectively apply these skills. The narratives contain a contradictive element in how participants depend on personnel to realize an agentic identity.</p>
<p>The mechanisms we have identified bridge the quantitative outcome with the narrative analysis carried out. Our main contribution lies in the detailed and contextualized analysis of the storylines, which sheds new light over our broader understanding of ELR as an intervention. Additional research should be done in this matter to more fully substantiate and expand these influential mechanisms.</p>
<p>We argue that institutions need to shift their perspectives of their practices from a stable ambition into a recovery- and occupation-oriented ambition, with client-centered rehabilitation offered continuously, which meets real-life challenges. Recovery is agency rather than passive adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732313482047">Pitt, Kilbride, Nothard, Welford, &amp; Morrison, 2007</xref>), and messages of hope, person-driven goals, outreach initiatives, and interesting programs are needed to give people the encouragement they require to take risks and grow. The rehabilitation should be an opportunity to redesign and reconstruct one’s viewpoints, capacities, identities, and agency.</p>
