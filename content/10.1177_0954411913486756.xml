<abstract>
<p>Current endoscopes and instruments are inadequate in some respects for complex intra-abdominal surgery because they are too flexible and cannot provide robust grasping and anatomic retraction. Minimal invasive surgery devices represent a sophisticated class of mechanical instruments making use of a range of mechanisms integrated into modular platforms that can be combined to undertake complex medical procedures. Although the machine elements concerned represent classic mechanical engineering devices, issues of miniaturization, surgical procedure compliance and location control conspire to present a design challenge. In order to capture, document and resolve the design requirements for this complex application, quality functional deployment has been applied in combination with design rationale, captured through issue-based information system mapping. This article reports the use of these tools to produce robot designs with improved dexterity and triangulation that are basic requirements in laparoscopy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Minimal invasive surgery (MIS) is a revolutionary technology that decreases pain and scaring by enabling small incisions to be made. One-port, single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) and operating through natural orifices called natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) are recent evolutions of MIS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411913486756">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411913486756">2</xref></sup> The long-term goal is to perform any operation through a natural orifice or single incision successfully and safely. Most single-incision procedures are currently carried out using a camera trocar and two working trocars, both of which are introduced through one umbilical incision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411913486756">3</xref></sup> Olympus America, Inc., introduced an advanced technology platform called TriPort that allows surgeons to perform minimally invasive single-site surgery through the umbilicus. The access system is placed into the umbilical incision, allowing single-port access for up to three surgical and imaging instruments. Instrument triangulation is essential for proper tissue dissection and retraction along anatomical tissue planes. Current devices for SILS that use several parallel instruments make triangulation difficult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411913486756">4</xref></sup> The use of fixation or sling sutures can enable retraction, but this introduces an additional assistant trocar.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411913486756">5</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Although current endoscopes have been widely used in diagnostic and biopsy procedures, they are far from being the most practical application for NOTES. Currently available flexible endoscopes are insufficient to perform transluminal surgical procedures without sufficient dexterity, retraction and triangulation capability. Some research groups and companies have developed endoscopic devices for NOTES. Olympus developed an endoscopic device called the ‘R’ scope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411913486756">6</xref></sup> that has a double curvature capability. Its two working channels allow two instruments to move independently. This form of transport offers a stable platform design (USGI Medical, Inc.) that is based on a stiffening endoscopic over-tube technology called shape-lock.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411913486756">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411913486756">8</xref></sup> This can lock devices in position and allow a suturing device for critical closure issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411913486756">9</xref></sup> USGI Medical, Inc., also developed a device called ‘Copra’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411913486756">10</xref></sup> that attempts to solve the triangulations of NOTES by three independent sub-instruments through its shape-lock-based shaft. The Direct Drive Endoscopic System (Boston Scientific)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411913486756">11</xref></sup> consists of three elements: a pair of articulating instruments, a steerable guide sheath that accommodates a small calibre video endoscope and a rigid rail platform that can control sub-instruments.</p>
<p>Surgical robots have been developed to assist surgeons in performing a wide range of procedures such as laparoscopy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411913486756">12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411913486756"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411913486756">14</xref></sup> minimally invasive surgery and catheter-based therapies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411913486756">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411913486756">16</xref></sup> The technology, however, provides major technical functional challenges for robotics. The automated endoscope system for optimal positioning (AESOP) is an example of one of the earliest minimally invasive surgery robots. It operates as a robotic manipulator by holding and controlling the location and orientation of the endoscope during minimally invasive laparoscopic or endoscopic procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411913486756">17</xref></sup> The da Vinci surgical system is a highly advanced robot for MIS. It is a tele-surgical system that requires the surgeon to view the surgical field from a console and simultaneously manipulate the robotic arms using a haptic device. Some of the major benefits claimed for the da Vinci surgical system compared with traditional approaches are better surgical precision, increased range of motion, improved dexterity, enhanced visualization and improved access.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411913486756">18</xref></sup> Costs, limited dexterity, sensing flaws and a challenging training program, however, make many surgeons hesitant to incorporate it into their medical practice. The ViaCath system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411913486756">19</xref></sup> is a tele-operated robot for endoluminal surgery that has been validated in animal trials. In this system, two distally articulated robotic instruments are advanced in front of the endoscope, enabling two-handed manipulation of tissues. There is only one other instrument offering lighting and visualization. A modular design in the ViaCath system was developed by endoVia for Laprotek that allows individual units to be isolated without redesigning the complete system. A group in Nanyang University recently proposed a surgical robotic system called master and slave transluminal endoscopic robot (MASTER) that is a dexterous and flexible master–slave device based on a flexible endoscope to perform endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and NOTES.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411913486756">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411913486756">21</xref></sup> However, the disadvantages of the robotic system include lack of retraction capability and insufficient force performance.</p>
<p>As indicated, the design of surgical platforms involves consideration of many interrelated issues. Keeping track of the issues and balancing or resolving design constraints is a major concern in medical product design as well as in other design domains. In order to address the issues in systematic manner, use has been made in the work reported here of a series of design tools including quality functional deployment (QFD) to ensure a rigorous approach to specification and use of issue-based information system (IBIS) mapping to enable capture and consideration of decision rationale throughout concept design development phases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411913486756">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954411913486756">23</xref></sup> The use of design tools such as QFD and IBIS in medical engineering has been previously reported in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411913486756">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411913486756">25</xref></sup> Using these tools, the design of a simulated tele-operated robotic system platform for surgical manipulating for SILS and NOTES that is able to effectively function by changing its configuration in uncertain and complex human body conditions has been undertaken and is presented in this article.</p>

<title>Design process</title>
<p>The design domain being explored here is not new. Existing products are available with definable merits albeit each with some limitations or drawbacks. The medical equipment domain is subject to regulation and a wide range of constraints, including procedural, financial and legal. The area of interest here involves safety critical decisions at the design stage as well as constraints that could involve compromise between conflicting issues. Experience in the automotive and aerospace industries, respectively, has suggested the value of using QFD and decision rationale for safety critical design. In this project, the two design goals are (1) to introduce innovative product characteristics and (2) to produce a design solution to meet clinical requirements for the new surgical technologies of NOTES and SILS.</p>
<sec id="section3-0954411913486756">
<title>QFD</title>
<p>QFD is used in some industries such as the automotive sector to deliver high-quality products and services. QFD uses matrix diagrams to assess the relationship between two sets of elements, such as customer requirements and product design functions. QFD charts for product planning and design deployment are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411913486756">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954411913486756">2</xref>. The QFD1 matrix transforms product attributes into functions and provides an indication of the correlation between customer requirements and functions. The QFD2 matrix transforms functions into product parts. QFD is useful to check completion and accuracy of specifications, identify functions that are not met, identify product parts that are unnecessary, establish the relative importance of function and product parts, capture design data and provide flow down of the product requirements.</p>

<p>In the QFD, the team focuses on the requirements from the customers that are most critical to the success of the design they are developing. The scales used to define the relationships between customer requirements and functions can have a significant impact on the prioritization of the output entries. Usually, the team may choose to use relationships with values of 1 through 10. Standard QFD practice usually uses the values 1, 3 or 4, and 9. Output entries with strong relationships to input entries will tend to be given a higher level of priority than output entries related to input entries with moderate or weak values.</p>

<sec id="section4-0954411913486756">
<title>Capturing and ranking clinical requirements</title>
<p>The multidisciplinary team included designers who were researchers from the mechanical engineering department and clinicians from the medicine school and hospitals interested in the research at the same university. Clinical requirements, collected through surgeon/patient survey questionnaires or interviews, were organized and then reviewed by both designers and a clinician’s panel. The clinical requirements are captured in the rows of the matrix in QFD1. In this case, the clinical requirements are broken down in a tree structure including four groups that are ‘safety’, ‘performance’, ‘ergonomics design’ and ‘market competence’. The column marked in grey represents the importance of the requirements based on discussions with clinicians on a 10-point scale. Safety represents a principal consideration for the design. ‘Performance’ refers to the functions required for NOTES and SILS according to surgical procedures, and this item determined the major technical functional characteristics of the device. ‘Triangulation’, ‘tissue retraction’, ‘stable platform’ and ‘dissection capability’ are identified as the most essential performance requirements and given a ranking of 8 reflecting surgeons’ views and experience from current surgical technologies in laparoscopies and other intra-abdominal surgery. By addressing ergonomics at the conceptual design phase, it will be more likely that a product will be developed that will be competitive in the health-care market.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0954411913486756">
<title>Developing engineering characteristics</title>
<p>Engineering characteristics are captured in the columns of the QFD1 matrix. In this case, ‘triangulation’, ‘retraction’ and ‘dexterity’ are the most important requirements that the design must address. For the engineering characteristics, ‘multifunctional channel’, ‘extra insert tools’, ‘reconfigurability’ and ‘triangulation’ meet the requirements of triangulation in surgical procedures. Retraction is considered during design as an important engineering characteristic to address the clinical requirement of tissue retraction, which most of the current devices are not able to realize from the current technology review. Lack of dexterity of current devices is a major obstacle that resulted in current devices not being used in NOTES and SILS because of their constrained operation. In QFD1, ‘dexterity’, ‘manoeuverability’, ‘tele-operated’ and ‘robotics’ are the engineering characteristics that address the clinical requirements of ‘mobility’, ‘dissection’ and ‘stable platform’. Robotics has recently been used to vastly improve dexterity and ergonomics of surgical devices. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411913486756">Table 1</xref>, the engineering characteristics of ‘human interface’, ‘steerability’, ‘navigation’ and ‘orientation’ are listed to improve the ergonomics design for the clinician. ‘Rigid/flexible delivery’ and ‘single access’ are the basic functional requirements for NOTES and SILS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0954411913486756">
<title>Determining the interactions between the clinical requirements and engineering characteristics</title>
<p>QFD1, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411913486756">Table 1</xref>, compared to a standard product design specification pro forma, provides a readily accessible structured approach to requirement management. The QFD1 matrix allows designers to identify clinical and engineering requirements and set the relationships between these two groups of requirements. The relationship between clinical requirements and engineering characteristics is built and the importance between them evaluated. A final design can only be selected by demonstrating that it fulfils all requirements to the acceptance level. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411913486756">Table 1</xref>, the elements in the rows and columns of the QFD matrix can have relationships of different strength. In QFD1, three types of relationships are generally used: low (1), medium (3) and high (9). The last row of the matrix captures the ‘How much values for the functions’. The function removing debris from compact size, for example, has a corresponding ‘How much cell where the channel size is defined to have an outer diameter of less than 30 mm’. The QFD 2 matrix, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954411913486756">Table 2</xref>, translates the relative importance for engineering characteristics into module/component specifications.</p>
<p>The benefits of the QFD method include the following:</p>

<p>After brainstorming, idea incubation and design selection and illumination, the ideas generated were listed in the first column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954411913486756">Table 2</xref>. The left-hand side of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954411913486756">Table 2</xref> lists engineering characteristics and their relative importance that are inherited from the QFD1 matrix, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411913486756">Table 1</xref>. The various modules and components of the reconfigurable robotic system designed to satisfy engineering characteristics are listed in the upper field, and the middle field shows the correlation matrix between the two. The symbols used and scoring methods are the same as in phase 1 QFD in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411913486756">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>The row in the upper field in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954411913486756">Table 2</xref> shows the modules and components of the reconfigurable robotic system. The system can be characterized by the following three modules:</p>
<list id="list2-0954411913486756" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Reconfigurable unit: including grippers, instrumental tools, reconfigurable mechanism, adjustable mechanism, camera and lights, navigation mechanism and positional mechanism.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Delivery unit: extra tools, working channel, controlling channel, endoscopic shaft (NOTES) and rigid shaft (SILS).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Control and interference: remote centre of motion, haptic device and console.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Evaluation of design options can be complicated due to the lack of explicit criteria to judge between alternative solutions. Various quantitative and qualitative techniques have been proposed to support designers and engineers in the process of evaluation. Quantitative techniques put emphasis on identification criteria for evaluation and scoring of different concepts. Qualitative evaluation techniques tend to put emphasis on articulation and capture of arguments in favour or against a particular conceptual solution. This type of argumentative information to support a design approach is generally known as design rationale.</p>
<p>The NOTES and SILS surgical devices represent complex mechatronic systems that contain many components and layers of subsystems that interact with the highly dynamic human body environment in manners that are difficult to manage and predict. The number of stakeholders involved in the design decision progress, for example, clinician, patients, designers, manufactures, National Health Service (NHS) managers, governmental agencies and regulating bodies, and changing requirements from the systems, escalates the complexity of the design progress. The consideration of all stakeholder requirements leads system designers and analysts to design the system and make design decisions from multiple perspectives. Such perspectives include considerations such as human factors, product development, training, marketing, patients, interface design, risk management and public and media relations. Thus, there are four main elements of design and product development that need to be explored:</p>
<list id="list3-0954411913486756" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Product – the design of the device and its geometrical, functional and engineering characteristics.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Process – the tasks used to create the design from initial specification to final product. These include the understanding of the special surgical procedure, analysis of the requirements from clinicians and creation of function and sub-function of the components.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Designer – the capabilities, knowledge and experience of designers.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>User – specifications, clinical requirements and health-care markets.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Each element and relations between these four elements are a potential source of complexity.</p>

<sec id="section7-0954411913486756">
<title>Concept development</title>
<p>The IBIS concept is a graphical method to assist in the capture of design rationale. The IBIS concept was originally developed by Horst Rittel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411913486756">22</xref></sup> and has since been developed in a range of commercial and open-source software platforms such as Compendium and designVUE. The basic elements of the IBIS notation are issue, answer, pro argument and con argument with relationships between elements captured on a network or map using nodes and connecting arcs. The method can be implemented by building a tree, or directed graph, where a node representing an issue to be resolved is linked by arcs to other nodes that represent alternative answers. Use of IBIS tools for mapping requirement capture and deliberation is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411913486756">Figure 1</xref>. The process encourages justification of requirements and offers a means of tracing the evolution of the requirements.</p>

<p>Use of an issue-based information tool to map and explore design issues, define functional attributes and evaluate alternative concepts for SILS and NOTES is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411913486756">Figure 1</xref>. The software, Compendium, using IBIS structures has been applied in order to support the analysis and design of this complex and highly uncertain surgical application. It was visualized graphically and built into a network as more issues are posted and debated. The three key IBIS entities – issues, positions and arguments are formed as icons to contribute greatly to the process of maintaining and evolving the design progress to help construct what led to a decision. To design the system in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411913486756">Figure 1</xref>, three main steps are constructed: (1) The needs of a system design for NOTES and SILS have been raised and all issues recorded and discussed that had been recorded and discussed, (2) all functional attributes of the design have been listed and (3) a detailed argument has been built for the final design reasoning and decision.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954411913486756">Table 2</xref>, the engineering characteristics are listed. However, by using IBIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411913486756">Figure 1</xref>), a clear structure is provided and immediate feedback to designers is given by the indication of the judged status of various issues and their relations in a network graph. An ideal ‘device for SILS and NOTES’ is proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411913486756">Figure 1</xref>, as the response to the clinical requirements. Six question marks are raised as new issues concerning the device for SILS and NOTES. These issues are ‘retraction’, ‘triangulation’, ‘visualization’, ‘orientation’, ‘manoeuverability’ and ‘robotic’.</p>
<p>Evaluation measurements are used and essential for design decision in the IBIS structure through some ordinal ranking among the positions based on the argumentation. Through evaluation, the final design can be selected and shown using the decision node. This signifies that the design has been completed, argued and evaluated in the IBIS structure with provision of adequate information for the design decision or design reasoning.</p>
<p>Current endoscopes and instruments are insufficient for complex intra-abdominal surgery because they are too flexible and cannot provide robust grasping and/or anatomic retraction from the communication with the clinician panel. Following the map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411913486756">Figure 1</xref>, a new design is outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411913486756">Figure 2</xref>. Ideas representing components and unit designs are suggested, with each of these having different supporting arguments, each of which in turn is supported by assumptions. Issues of ‘retraction’ are resolved by design of an annular platform to select a position, thereby leading to a constraint that needs to be satisfied by design objects. Its disadvantages and advantages have been described with <italic>con</italic> nodes identifying that the platform is weak and has a complicated structure and <italic>pro</italic> nodes such as ‘allows insert extra tools’, ‘offers additional DOFs for tools’, ‘offers bigger operation workspace’ and ‘allows for retraction components’ to support the design selections. This issue links to a new map for more detailed discussion by a <italic>map</italic> node. The issue of ‘triangulation’ is solved by three answer nodes that are ‘annular platform’, ‘two grippers’ and ‘one extra tool configuration’ and ‘steerable visualization unit’. This is linked to another map. The answer node ‘Stewart platform’ is the response to the issue of orientation. The position is discussed by <italic>pro</italic> notes that are ‘high stiffness’, ‘full dexterous’, ‘accurate’ and ‘quick response’ and <italic>con</italic> nodes that are ‘difficult for manufacture’ and ‘expensive’. The active instrument is also designed to solve the problem of ‘manoeuverability’. This map results in the final design in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411913486756">Figure 2</xref>. At the start of the operation, the endoscope accesses human body through skin or natural orifices and the reconfigurable unit is folded in the tip of the endoscope as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411913486756">Figure 3</xref>. A photocell camera and lights are used for navigation that is defined by the ‘steerable visualization unit’ in the map of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411913486756">Figure 1</xref>. When the endoscope arrives in the surgical field, the reconfigurable unit is released and expanded using springs, links and cables. In the unit, the annular platform is a 12-bar spherical mechanism that can fully expand and fold. Two grippers have 3/4 degrees of freedom (DOFs) as well as a micro-camera and lighting package mounted on the platform. An IBIS dialogue map is constructed to structure and settle issues by problem-solving groups at different levels for orientation platform design. The orientation platform is a 6-DOF Stewart mechanism that has six legs controlled by cables or flexible shafts. After the device has been expanded, the base device adjusts the position and orientation of the folding platform. When the operating procedure has been finished, the unit is folded and retracted to the tip of endoscope, which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411913486756">Figure 2</xref>. The system is controlled by haptic devices through a console. The design parameters are as follows:</p>
<list id="list4-0954411913486756" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Outer diameter of the manipulator = 20 mm</p>

</fig>
<p>The reconfigurable manipulator can be actuated by a variety of methods. Two grippers are actuated by tendons because of their dynamic properties. The micro-camera is controlled by micro-motors. In the adjusting platform, six legs are driven by a flexible shaft that can transmit rotation directly and with screw leads while the Stewart platform is easy to lock for position and orientation. Reconfigurability of the manipulator is managed by springs that trigger its expansion and retraction.</p>
<p>The manipulation strategy for an operational procedure is illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954411913486756">Table 3</xref>. SILS can be achieved by using a rigid holder to deliver the folding manipulator. Following basic surgical principles, the robot will perform laparoscopic surgery through a small single incision, mostly hidden in a location like the umbilicus. This results in only a relatively small scar and also reduces post-operative pain. When the proposed reconfigurable unit is attached to the tip of a soft tube endoscopy, this could be used for the next evolution of NOTES surgery. Compared with the rigid shaft of the SILS version, the proposed design for NOTES would make possible the delivery of the reconfigurable manipulator by an endoscopic soft tube through natural orifices such as the mouth, anus or vagina.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A reconfigurable robotic system has been designed using QFD to define the specifications and IBIS software to explore and record design decisions. These tools have assisted in the process of capturing and addressing important requirements in the design and provide a record of the design rationale. Design rationale has been recorded by constructing a tree structure map, or directed graph, with nodes representing issues to be solved, linked by arcs to other nodes that represent alternative answers. Argumentation can be recorded on the map providing the designer and clinicians with immediate information on relevant factors and also giving a record of what decisions have been taken and the associated information and influences for these.</p>
<p>Limitations of current endoscopes and instruments include inadequate platform stability, limited tissue mobilization and retraction, inadequate dissection capability, limited ability to appose and secure tissue, inability to rapidly clean the field and inefficient and complicated team interactions. The robotics developed has a single reconfigurable unit at the tip, which vastly improves dexterity, and it has a hollow channel in the tube to insert an extra tool, enabling retraction. Both these features also improve triangulation that is a basic requirement in laparoscopy. The application of design rationale has been demonstrated for a complex set of clinical requirements. The concept design has been approached based on solving the clinical problems recorded in QFD matrices and evaluated by both designers and clinicians through mapping based on IBIS argumentation. Following the design rationale, detailed engineering design is now being implemented.</p>
