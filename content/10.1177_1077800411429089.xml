<abstract>
<p>Haunted by the estranged relationship with his son and the loss of his father three years ago, the author writes in the attempt to gather, to archive what needs to be preserved. The author proceeds by recollecting the positive memories he carries of his father and the troubling thoughts he holds about his son. Structured through fragments, the author accumulates an archival history, one that tells the story of the father his dad was and of the father that the author is to his own son.</p>

<p>It’s been almost three years now, three years since Dad died, and I need to pull him close, to hold him in place. It has been more than three years since I’ve talked with my son, Doug, more than six years since I’ve seen him, and I need to take stock, to see what can be saved. I have, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800411429089">Derrida (1996)</xref> might suggest, archive fever. My driving desire is to preserve, to fight against forgetfulness, to list traces of my father and my son. I wish to turn my dad into the institutional father who commands my attention and allegiance. I wish to be the institutional father who commands my son’s attention and allegiance. I want to put on display their hauntings. I proceed by gathering fragments—what is left and taken, what is here and there, what is slow and fast, and what is stored and tossed. I write against time, against memory’s betrayal, against death. I work for an archival accumulation, for a documentation that insists upon a presence, for a living memorial. I move forward expecting my attempt will be a failure. I continue, nevertheless, driven to satisfy my desire for the impossible.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077800411429089">
<title>What Is Left and Taken</title>
<p>A book. My dad’s hand-printed collection of sayings. Each page filled with lines he thought were worth recording, each page more evidence of what he valued. I thumb through its pages, hearing him speak the copied words: “Here’s one for you, professor: ‘There is so much good in the worst of us, and so much bad in the best of us, that it behooves all of us not to talk about the rest of us.’ Now, that’s good stuff. Robert Louis Stevenson said that.”</p>
<p>“That is good stuff, Dad,” I say.</p>
<p>My books. Trying to write both of them. My father and my son. Trying to provide a glimpse of relational love and relational error. I render Dad as a celebratory story; Doug, as a lament. I make Dad into the ideal, romanticize him; I turn Doug into the antithesis. As I write, I waste words, so many words that cannot find their subject, words Dad will not read, and words Doug is highly unlikely to ever stumble across. I wish I knew if Doug likes to read.</p>
<p>A knife. Eight or nine inches in length. Found in the bottom of Dad’s old fishing box, entangled by lures and fishing line. I am hooked when my brother, Gus, says, “Take it,” hooked into the memory of Dad using that knife to teach my brother and me mumblety-peg, a game where we would stand opposite one another, legs shoulder-width apart, each taking turns sticking the knife in the dirt as close to our own foot as we could to determine the winner, our dad being the final arbitrator.</p>
<p>A pocket knife. Its blade only about two inches in length. The one Doug once kept sharp. Now kept in my tool box for occasional jobs. Each time I reach for it, I think of my then ten-year-old son who flew to Detroit to visit me. “What are you doing with that knife?” I ask, believing even for a kid living with his mother on a farm in rural Missouri, he was too young to have a knife.</p>
<p>“I brought it for protection,” Doug answers.</p>
<p>“Protection?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you know, ‘cause it’s Detroit.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need for you worry about that,” I say, confiscating his weapon.</p>
<p>These knives, my dad’s and Doug’s, are now dull, but I handle them with care, not wanting to be cut.</p>
<p>Clothes. Still hanging in Dad’s closet. Untouched in three years. Next to my mother’s garments—golf shirts, shorts, slacks, a few sports coats and dress shirts, several pairs of polished shoes that, when his feet were swollen, would no longer fit. “I want you to take whatever you want,” Mom says to me. “Your dad had some very nice things. Some things in there he never wore.”</p>
<p>At the thought of wearing Dad’s clothes, I freeze. I cannot put on Dad’s skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077800411429089">Spry, 2011</xref>). I end the conversation with a joke: “My belly is too big to fit in any of Dad’s things.” Mom looks at me closely, but says nothing more.</p>
<p>Clothes. Never touched. Christmas gifts. Wrapped and gathering dust in my closet. Shirts selected for my son who never arrives. Each year his name would be on my list, and each year I would buy him another gift in case he happened to come on Christmas day. Now, I no longer put his name on my list. “If he comes,” I tell my wife, “I’ll write him a check.”</p>
<p>A document. Dad’s laminated obituary that reduces a life to a few column inches. Sent from the mortuary to family members as a keepsake. Buried in my file box. I keep it there, wanting to believe I’m keeping him, wanting his photo to begin to speak, wanting to hear him say, “Why are you keeping that crap. That’s not the whole story.”</p>
<p>A document. A letter. Never mailed. Hand-written by Doug at age twelve. Printed. To his girlfriend, dated June 14, 1982. It is in the file box, resting next to my dad’s obituary. With all the errors of a young author maintained, it reads:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Vicki</p>
<p>High, whats up. Nothing here. I am so bord I could die. I was going to call you but I am at my dads. It would be long distance and he would get pissed off. I was just thinking have you heard any thing about going to Six Flags. You know how eavry body was going to go. It would be fun. I will call you when I get back. I will probly get home befor this letter gets to you. Thoes asshols at the post office don’t know what thair doing. Well got to go. Love ya dearly.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is signed “Doug,” the “D” enlarged so that the “oug” can easily fit inside the loop of the “D.” It must have been left behind after a visit. It must have been something I thought was funny, worth saving. As I read it now, I feel myself, even after all these years, becoming defensive: Was he “bord” when he came to visit? As I remember it, it was “non-stop Doug time.” Did he really think I would have been “pissed off”? Did he even ask? And, as I read it now, I see how quick he was at such an early age to assume that if something did not happen as he wished, he would view it as someone else’s fault. In my current sense making it becomes more evidence I use against him.</p>
<p>Driven to archive, I save objects, objects that are reminders, stories ready to unfold, collected in the hope that they establish connections, fragments that name together, link fathers and sons, sometimes with deep affection and sometimes with deep sorrow. I reach for what I can hold.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1077800411429089">
<title>What Is Here and There</title>
<p>Locations. Blacksburg, Virginia. Doug’s place of birth. Three years spent before his parent’s broken marriage; Festus, Missouri, a place of childhood, with the wrong crowd, the wrong pursuits, the wrong dad; St. Louis, Missouri, a place of searching, each day another unfulfilled promise. Blacksburg, Festus, St. Louis, each a place of trouble, of poor decisions that took root. I was not there. Perhaps, I should have fought for custody; should have said come live with me in Carbondale, Illinois; should have rescued him from his dead end job in St. Louis. Perhaps, I should have remembered what context can do.</p>
<p>Locations. New Orleans, Louisiana. Dad’s place of birth and a life lived; Lake Charles, Louisiana, a place of escape after Katrina hit; his bedroom, a place where his Bible still sits open on his night stand, an artificial flower crossing two pages of <italic>Psalms</italic>, left by the Hospice worker on the night they took his body away. I see him in New Orleans, driving from corner grocery store to corner grocery store to get orders for the Jackson Wholesale Grocery Company, playing solitaire at the head of the dining room table, hitting golf balls in City Park. I’m with him in Lake Charles, seeing his uncertainty, his memory allowing him to think he was still living in New Orleans. Now, when I visit Mom, I glance at his open Bible. I want to close it—it is too strong a reminder—but that is for Mom to do, if she ever so wishes.</p>
<p>Telephone calls. Always unexpected, disturbing. Always coming in times of need or trouble. Always following the same script, the same bottom line: “Hey, old man. It’s Doug,” he always starts.</p>
<p>“Hi, Doug. How have you been?” I say, trying to believe he is calling just to chat.</p>
<p>“I’m okay, but I need a little help, Dad.”</p>
<p>“Well, what’s up?” I ask.</p>
<p>“I just can’t keep doing roofing. It’s killing me. My legs are giving out and that sun this time of year—it’s just too much. It’s a dead end job, like you’ve said. I can’t do it forever.”</p>
<p>“I’ve wanted you off those roofs for years now,” I say.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve got a good chance of doing that. I can get this job putting up sheetrock. After the training period, I can become a union member. I’d make good money. But I need $800 for the training and the tools. I’m hoping you could help me out.</p>
<p>“$800?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Dad. I’d pay you back once I am working full-time.”</p>
<p>“That’s what you always say, Doug.”</p>
<p>“Well, this time I’ll have a good job and I’ll be able to pay you back.”</p>
<p>When the next unexpected call comes, I ask how the sheetrocking job is going. “It didn’t work out,” he says. We do not mention the $800.</p>
<p>Telephone calls. Once a week. A Sunday night ritual. Brief moments of predictable interaction with Dad, framed by extended talk with Mom. “Hi, Dad. How are you doing?” I would begin when Mom handed him the phone.</p>
<p>“I’m fine. How about you?”</p>
<p>“Fine, Dad.”</p>
<p>“How’s the girls?” he asks, referring to my wife and daughter.</p>
<p>“They’re fine too, Dad.”</p>
<p>“And what do you hear from Doug?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t heard anything lately, Dad.”</p>
<p>“That’s not right,” he states.</p>
<p>“I assume if I’m not hearing from him, it means he’s doing okay,” I say, knowing my dad’s assessment is right.</p>
<p>A container. Doug’s car. An old Mustang, battered. Used as a dwelling after an eviction. A reason to be charged with vagrancy. “Hi, Doug. How have you been?” I say, trying to believe he is calling just to chat.</p>
<p>“I’m okay, but I need a little help, Dad.”</p>
<p>“Well, what’s up this time?” I ask. . . .</p>
<p>A container. Dad’s coffin. Purchased by him well before it was needed. Placed in a berth high in a mausoleum. An empty slot by its side, ready for his wife of sixty-eight years when the time comes. I do not want to think of him entombed there, his body rotting next to the putter and golf balls my brother put in his coffin during his funeral. I would rather have placed his ashes in his old company car, a stick-shift Chevy, the one I wrecked the first time he gave me a driving lesson, or surrounding the house on General Pershing Street where he grew up with five siblings, three brothers and two sisters, or on Beau Chen’s golf course, hole number sixteen, where his banana ball found the cup in one shot.</p>
<p>All those places I still visit, all those telephone calls I still hear, all those containers I still see. They are destination points of my imagination, set in time and space, gathered for processing, brought together with more sadness than joy. They become another file. They are neither here nor there.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1077800411429089">
<title>What Is Slow and Fast</title>
<p>Movement. Dad’s steps. So small they’re hard to match. So halting, to maintain balance. So conspicuous they announce age, fragility. Steps that no longer quicken to see how close a birdie putt might be. At the Outback Steak House, I took him by the arm to find the restroom. Step by step, we navigated the tables, the hurrying servers, the customers coming in and out. Step by step, I held on and after about every twenty steps, I would ask, “You doing okay?” and he would nod. Step by step, we made our way to the heavy door I swung open so that he could enter. “There’s a stall right over there, Dad,” I say as he begins his measured steps forward. After a few moments, he says, “I don’t think I have to pee after all.” We make our way back to our table, step by step. We sit, begin to talk and eat our salads that have arrived. Then he says, “I think I have to pee.”</p>
<p>Movement. From apartment to apartment. One step ahead of landlord’s eviction. One step behind the people Doug would call friends. Squatted with them until they had enough, said he’d have to leave, said he’d have to move on. In my desk drawer, I have addresses and phone numbers, too many to know which came first or last, too many to know which I should use if I wanted to make contact.</p>
<p>Talk. Dad’s playfulness. Filled with teasing and joking. Always recognizing the pleasures of quick wit. Always keeping us from taking ourselves too seriously. Always done with love. “You’ve already shanked three balls out of bounds,” he says. “Are you sure you brought enough balls to finish the round?”</p>
<p>Talk. Serious, difficult. Cautious. Troubled by doubt, a history of promises not kept, half-truths, and lies. Ponderous and predictable. Slow to come and slow to leave. “Every time I talk with him I get upset,” I tell my wife, Mimi. “It happens every time. I don’t know why I let him get to me like that.”</p>
<p>Order. Dad’s chest of drawers in his bedroom. Still with everything in place. Lined-up, stacked in careful rows. The socks, the handkerchiefs, the underwear. The bottom drawer filled with mementos, scrapbooks, and souvenirs accumulated over time, some telling of our lives together. He always wanted order. He hated when his papers were not properly filed or when his pills would spill in front of him. He wanted, as I do, everything to be right, in keeping with how things should be, tidy. He wanted, as I do, everything organized, categorized, classified. He wanted, as I do, everything arranged as a defense against chaos. “Give everything,” he would say, “it’s due time.” Time, though, turns order into chaos and chaos into order.</p>
<p>Order. Doug’s clothes. The shirt’s top buttons left undone. The collar and sleeves turned up, the jeans tight. The hair, fixed, greased into place, side-burns growing inches below the ears. An occasional mustache. The clothes, the hair, always fashioned to mark his position in the social order, an order different from mine. He fell quickly, without a pause, like a cut limb from a tree, and landed with a thud. I did not see it happening.</p>
<p>Departure. Dad’s death. Even after ninety-one years, came too quickly. Came at a time when I still wanted more. He is inches away, even as I try to hold on. Come back. Stay longer. Sit with me here. Tell me again one of those stories you always tell. Speak to me in Greek, your childhood language I never learned. I will try to understand. I will listen.</p>
<p>Departure. Telling Doug goodbye after the time spent. Filled with promises that we would not keep. Brief, without regret that our time together had come to an end. We were ready to escape, break away from the judgment of the other, from the reminder of our failure, from the expected, but missing, connections between father and son. He would leave and I would feel relieved, free from the burden and disappointment of it all. I would feel guilty. I would, as quickly as I could, return to my life. I would, on most days, forget.</p>
<p>The movements, the talks, the order of things, and the departures find their way, learning their pace, sensing what they have to carry. At times, I linger; other times, I hurry by. I feel their cadence, their tempo. I have the chronology, but I pause, not knowing if I am managing time right, not knowing if I should speed up or stop, not knowing if time will tell. It is a painstaking process. I want to progress with haste, to settle into the right rhythm. In time, I say, lying to myself, I’ll know what will and what should be kept.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1077800411429089">
<title>What Is Stored and Tossed</title>
<p>A look. Doug’s sideways glance. Sizing me up, strategic. Calculating the next move in the con. Figuring whether or not he should push on or back off, whether or not his mark is ripe, whether or not he’ll score. That look conceals its deceit as well as a whale can hide in short grass. “Quit trying to con me, Doug,” I say, when I feel I’ve heard enough.</p>
<p>“I’m not trying to con you,” he returns, pretending to be indignant. “I’m telling you the truth.”</p>
<p>“What you’re saying is hard for me to believe.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know why you don’t trust me.”</p>
<p>“Because over the years you’ve given me little reason to trust you.”</p>
<p>“I may not have always told you the whole truth, but this time everything I’ve said is absolutely true,” he insists.</p>
<p>“Doug, I wish I could believe you.”</p>
<p>A look. Dad’s straight on survey. Sizing me up, intense. Trying to insure that his son is safe, happy. Wanting me to know he is there if anything might be wrong. “So, everything is going okay,” he repeats.</p>
<p>“Yeah, Dad, everything is fine,” I answer again.</p>
<p>“You’re okay with money?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Dad.”</p>
<p>“Everything okay at home?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Dad. Everything is fine.”</p>
<p>“How’s the job?”</p>
<p>“Fine, Dad.”</p>
<p>An image. Doug’s high school graduation night. Standing beside his mother for a quick photo. His graduation hat skewed too much to the side. His date looking on, ready for the night, ready to be free. A quick goodbye, his mother and I left in the parking lot as he drives away faster than he should. “It’s been a long, hard road,” she says with a sigh. I nod. We look into the empty space down the street. It’s dark, darker than we imagined.</p>
<p>An image. Dad’s Santa hat put on before everyone would arrive. A “ho, ho, ho” each time the doorbell would ring. A strong hand for the men, a kiss on the cheek for the women, and a knee for young ones. He was there to give—a present, a drink or some food, a smile. He would pose for pictures, his grandchildren draped on him, wanting more. He would count, making sure everyone was there. After opening his presents, he would joke, “I think I came out ahead again this year.” He was the gift.</p>
<p>A story. Set. A summary that drops all details. Used to explain without explaining. Used when saying more seems too much: “Yes, I have a son from my first marriage. He’s had a difficult road to travel. I haven’t seen him for a while now.”</p>
<p>A story. Told over and over again. One of regret, confession, in the hope that the telling might make it right. “When I was a young man, someone asked me if there was another Gus M. Pelias. I stupidly shot back, ‘There’s only one Gus M. Pelias.’ You know, acting like a big man. I just wasn’t thinking. This got back to your Uncle Gus, my namesake, and he never forgave me for what I said.” He told the story with sorrow, in penance, as a lesson.</p>
<p>Advice. A list of shoulds, marking disappointments. Given to Doug over and over again. Never taken. Met with “Yes, but. . . .” I would try to be helpful, try to offer good fatherly counsel, try to guide him down the right path. I would feel the frustration coming, then the anger, as I believed nothing I would say would have any consequence. Doug would not listen. He would not change, at least, not in the ways I desired. There would be displays of agreement, promises, and perhaps, in the moment, the intent, but never the steps that I thought were needed to get to a better place. I would say such things as: “You ought to go back to school. Your roofing job is a dead end job.” “You need to get away from the guys you hang out with. They are nothing but trouble.” “You might consider passing on that Nine Inch Nails concert in Chicago so you can buy a fridge instead.” I would say such things with hope. I should have said such things in a better way.</p>
<p>Advice. A list of possibilities. Offered to me in support. Given when needed, always considered, more often right than wrong. I would listen, taking Dad’s words in. When I was smart, I would let his counsel guide me; when I thought I knew better, I would often regret my choice. He never said, “I told you so.” At age twenty-one, I announced I wanted to get married. In the pronouncement, I was still the child who wanted his parent’s blessing. I was seeking permission. “Well, you want to get married,” Dad began. “Your mother and I were younger than you are when we got married. Those were different times. I know when I told your grandfather I want to marry your mother; there was nothing he could have said to stop me. I’m sure you feel the same way I did. That’s a big decision, getting married.” He said nothing more. I should have asked him to elaborate. I should have heard his warnings. I should have been a better listener.</p>
<p>Looks, images, stories, and advice are stored, kept, kept as facts. They are recorded as a partial history that gives an explanation. Much is loss, forgotten, repressed. Much is tossed, considered unimportant. Much is judged against my interest to share. I continue the work, keeping what I need to keep.</p>
<p>The struggle to archive is to hold time steady, to control it. The past changes, though, as quickly as it is put in place, filed away. What is collected now collapses into tomorrow’s past, present, and future. Archiving is never done, never complete. The fever never breaks. What is written here I feel is worth keeping. It is essential, crucial, central. I mark it as valuable and vital. What is written here is part of what remains. I cling to the fragments that speak of fathers and sons. It is more than debris, wreckage, waste. What is written here is what I have.</p>
