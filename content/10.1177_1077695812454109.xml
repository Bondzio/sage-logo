<abstract>
<p>Although communication program faculty have traditionally not enjoyed large grants for research, administrators are pressuring them to garner external funding. This article examines the success rate of securing external funding that communication administrators reported for their units. Results show that while the pressure has increased on most communication programs, the success rate for getting those grants has not. In addition, support for seeking grants is not growing with the pressure, and there seems to be little difference in support between high research-oriented programs and those in lower Carnegie classifications, with the exception of help from graduate students.</p>

<p>The economic downturn since the early 2000s has not made it any easier for faculty in communication and other disciplines who are facing mounting pressure to secure external dollars for their programs. Although some faculty in all academic disciplines experience pressure to generate external revenue, those in disciplines such as communication that are located in the humanities or social sciences face an even steeper incline.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077695812454109">1</xref></sup> The situation is less dire in the hard and applied sciences such as physics and engineering, respectively, but it is also quickly changing toward greater competition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077695812454109">2</xref></sup> This study examines the conditions within which faculty in the disciplines of journalism and mass communication (J/MC) and human communication (HC) are pressured to generate external research revenue for their departments and institutions. As “get grants or perish”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077695812454109">3</xref></sup> is fast becoming the modus operandi of the academy in these disciplines, it is imperative to research the norms surrounding faculty external grants activities. This study investigates organizational factors and characteristics that are associated with external grant-seeking activity and acquisition, by addressing gaps in the literature as explained later.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077695812454109">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Scholarship on university faculty research and funding of that research does exist, but it is not abundant. What follows is a review of that limited research. Payne and Siow suggest that from 1972 to 1998 increased funding from the federal government did result in greater research output, although those researchers did not measure quality of output.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077695812454109">4</xref></sup> Increased incentives for garnering external funds in European and Australian universities did not boost faculty productivity. In fact, the incentives may actually create more dysfunction at universities, as the efforts become more focused on getting grants rather than producing scholarship and researchers focus more on topics for which they can obtain funding rather than the pressing questions in their discipline or what interests them individually.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077695812454109">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Generally, the scholarship on faculty productivity in J/MC and HC is fractured among studies on gender equality in productivity,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077695812454109">6</xref></sup> and among studies on research articles and citations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077695812454109">7</xref></sup> Much less emphasized are research grants as indicators of faculty productivity. This is because funded research and published articles may be isomorphic to a great extent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077695812454109">8</xref></sup> However, pressure on faculty to engage in external grant activities has been mounting because administrators feel dissatisfied with faculty performance in this area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077695812454109">9</xref></sup> This pressure may be the result of declining monetary support of public universities by various stakeholders,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077695812454109">10</xref></sup> including “public budget cuts [that] have pushed institutions to pressure their faculty to do more funded research.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077695812454109">11</xref></sup> Federal funding for research in mass communication has dropped precipitously,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077695812454109">12</xref></sup> and yet “[t]he value of college endowments declined by an average of 23 percent from 2008 to 2009, socked by the one-two punch of record investment losses and a precipitous drop in giving.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077695812454109">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the mid-1980s, Schweitzer examined faculty productivity in J/MC programs,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077695812454109">14</xref></sup> starting with a call for more industry-related research from the academy. In follow-up work,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077695812454109">15</xref></sup> he found that schools with doctoral programs published more than nondoctoral programs, and while intrinsic motivations (personal satisfaction) were the most influential predictor of research success among faculty, a supportive administration was important in facilitating research activity among faculty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077695812454109">16</xref></sup> He concluded that while expectations of research productivity may vary among institutions,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077695812454109">17</xref></sup> administrators who created cultures that enhanced and supported research through funding and rewards (travel money, etc.) were more likely to have faculty with higher research productivity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077695812454109">18</xref></sup> Nearly fifteen years later, Beard in one study and Morton and Beard in another study examined communication research productivity including two factors that earlier research did not address: external funding or grants and (Carnegie) institution classification.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077695812454109">19</xref></sup> Beard surveyed administrators of J/MC programs and found that a slight majority of programs (51.9 percent) had succeeded in securing at least one externally funded grant in the year prior to the study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077695812454109">20</xref></sup> The mean rate for programs achieving an externally funded grant was 1.13. Programs located on doctoral campuses were more likely (93.5) to engage in external grant activities than programs housed in either master’s (60 percent) or baccalaureate institutions (50 percent). While programs with established graduate programs, especially ones with doctoral programs, were more likely to report higher levels of external grant activity and acquisition than those that didn’t have graduate programs, it wasn’t the case that differences were significant in this regard between doctoral programs and master’s, or between master’s and bachelor’s. Moreover, when compared to master’s or baccalaureate schools, doctoral programs were perceived by faculty to encourage more networking or collaboration among members with similar grant or research interests and to provide greater opportunities for such networking.</p>
<p>Morton and Beard analyzed the content of 223 mass communication educators’ vitae based on a modified version of the 1994 Carnegie classification system, limiting the analysis to three of the five levels: Research I and II, Doctoral I and II, and Master’s I and II. In terms of the dollar value of external grants, there were very few differences among programs in the different classifications.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077695812454109">21</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section2-1077695812454109">
<title>Department size as a predictor of external grant productivity</title>
<p>Although little research has examined the relationship between external grant acquisition and faculty size, the literature on scholarly productivity in general is instructive. Also, Bland et al. suggest that faculty size is important because a critical mass is necessary for a unit to accomplish its research goals amid other professional obligations in the academy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077695812454109">22</xref></sup> Stephen found that “the number of publishing faculty in a [communication] program is strongly related to positive perceptions of faculty quality.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1077695812454109">23</xref></sup> In addition, once the number of nonpublishing faculty was controlled for, the correlation between number of faculty in the communication unit and the number of publications associated with the unit was high. These findings are consistent with earlier work concerning a different discipline,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1077695812454109">24</xref></sup> and with other research on more than 3,600 research–doctoral programs in the United States that found that the strongest predictors of faculty research productivity include the size of program and number of faculty who publish articles in peer-reviewed journals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1077695812454109">25</xref></sup> Bland et al. also found that highly productive departments included “a large portion of the faculty [who] were grant-getters.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1077695812454109">26</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1077695812454109">
<title>Institutional/unit culture and external grant productivity</title>
<p>Another relevant line of research concerns organizational culture. Bland et al.’s synthesis of studies on faculty research productivity concluded that working in an institution that is highly conducive to research strongly predicts faculty members’ research productivity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1077695812454109">27</xref></sup> This finding was later confirmed by Bland et al., who also found other organizational culture factors (e.g., existence of a university mission on grants) and several other factors (i.e., coaching faculty in identifying potential sponsors, graduate student assistance) that distinguish units that tend to engage in grant-related activities versus those that don’t.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1077695812454109">28</xref></sup> Schweitzer’s research, contending that the devotion to doing research is not likely to bear fruit unless the organization’s culture embraces a research commitment, is also consistent with these findings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1077695812454109">29</xref></sup></p>

<title>Gaps in literature on faculty external grant activities in J/MC and HC</title>
<p>Previous research is helpful in explaining how external grant productivity has been conceptualized and has accounted for it in terms of organizational attributes and organizational culture. This study capitalizes on five gaps in the meager research about the J/MC and HC disciplines to facilitate a more robust understanding of the norms and context within which external grant productivity transpires:</p>
<list id="list1-1077695812454109" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>It remains unclear how much the external grant funds a communication unit’s faculty generates are associated with the degree of research support and research organizational culture present in the communication unit and host university. Illuminating these relationships may provide valuable clues toward generating precious external dollars.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Earlier research has not examined how the communication unit disciplinary emphasis (i.e., J/MC, J/MC and HC, HC) varies with the degree of research support faculty receive, the pressure or commitment to seek external funding, or the amount of external funding acquired, nor has it examined how these three variables are linked to existence of a graduate program in a communication unit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1077695812454109">30</xref></sup> Doing so might help to establish what disciplinary or organizational emphases are more amenable to external grant activity success.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Most earlier research has not tested for Carnegie classification differences, therefore eschewing variations within doctoral, master’s, and baccalaureate campuses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1077695812454109">31</xref></sup> Although Morton and Beard used the 1994 Carnegie classification, more recent versions exist.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1077695812454109">32</xref></sup> The 2005 Carnegie classification (the one used in this study) is an improvement of previous editions in terms of funding measures beyond federal sources.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1077695812454109">33</xref></sup> Analysis of how such classification differences relate to grant activity might help to establish how the degree of research emphasis in a program matters to grant activity success.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Although the number of faculty, number of students per communication unit, and number of students per university impinge on faculty research productivity,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1077695812454109">34</xref></sup> it remains unclear how they are related to the degree of research support faculty receive, the pressure or commitment to seek external funding, or the amount of external funding acquired. Determining whether institution or communication faculty size matters may have important implications for what organizational characteristics are better suited for research grant activity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Little research has examined the attitudes of administrators in communication units regarding whether there is increased pressure to find external funding since the economic downturn. While that would seem to be self-evident, it is worth exploring because there may be similar relationships to the increased push for outside funding and the type of institution that houses the communication unit.</p></list-item></list>

</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077695812454109" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This study utilized a national Web survey (<italic>N</italic> = 136) of communication programs. The original sampling frame was a list of 330 programs obtained by downloading a compiled list of programs posted on the National Communication Association home page, a resource meant to be a complete list of all “communication” programs, which is therefore more likely to capture both human and mass communication programs than others such as an Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication program listing (although the list of J/MC programs surveyed each year by the Grady College of Journalism &amp; Mass Communication, University of Georgia, numbers about 475). Program heads were contacted via email and asked to either complete the survey themselves or delegate the task to the person in the academic unit best able to answer questions about external funding of research. The response rate was 39 percent, including a sample representative of a broad cross section of programs.</p>
<p>Slightly more than 38 percent of respondents said their program was evenly split between HC and mass communication. Close to 35 percent reported that their program mostly or entirely focused on HC. A little more than 26 percent reported that their program mostly or entirely focused on mass communication.</p>
<p>Roughly one in five respondents (20 percent) reported that their program included a doctoral program. Another 42 percent reported having at least one master’s program. In terms of faculty size, the programs were relatively evenly split among those with ten or fewer, eleven to twenty, and more than twenty faculty members. More than half the programs (56.5 percent) reported having fewer than five hundred students, and 13 percent reported having more than one thousand students.</p>
<sec id="section8-1077695812454109">
<title>Dependent and Independent Variables</title>
<p>Although a survey such as this can only hope to show association and not causation, we have chosen to use the phrases “independent variable” and “dependent variable” in cases where a logical time order would seem to exist. There may be other mediating variables, such as the degree to which a program emphasizes professional tracks and/or teaching rather than research and thus eschews focusing on research grant activities. It is also possible that a faculty member may be a professional or clinical professor who is not expected to compete for grants or may be a tenured professor who does not prioritize bringing in grants.</p>
<p>However, we do mean to suggest that one variable likely precedes the other. For example, when we ask the research question “Does the amount of research support vary depending on what type of (if any) graduate program it has?” we do not mean to say that the graduate program automatically leads to increased research support. Rather, we mean to say that it is logical to assume for this study that the more graduate work being done in a unit, the more likely those graduate students are to help faculty with research, and therefore provide (and need) more research support.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1077695812454109">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>This study has three measures that primarily serve as dependent variables: (1) research support for faculty seeking external funding, (2) pressure placed on faculty to seek external funding, and (3) the total amount of external funding a communication unit received in the previous year.</p>
<p>Research support for faculty seeking external funding was measured using a twelve-item scale (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077695812454109">Table 1</xref>). For each item, the respondent could check a box to indicate if the communication unit provided a specific support, such as internal grants or release time. The process was repeated so the same questions could be answered about university support. Boxes left blank were coded as zero. Boxes that were checked were coded as a 1. The answers from both unit and institution questions were then combined into a twenty-four-item additive scale. While the highest possible score on this scale was 24, the <italic>actual</italic> scores ranged from 0 to 20, with a mean of 6.4 and a standard deviation of 4.7.</p>

<p>Pressure placed on seeking external funding was measured in the same manner, asking first about the respondent’s unit, then following with the same items, focused on the respondent’s institution, as follows: encouraging outside funding of research, outside funding important in evaluation of faculty, a strong culture of grant-funded research/projects, little support in procuring it and/or managing external funding (reverse coded), view of outside funding of research important for a unit’s survival, historical culture of seeking outside funding for research. Possible answers were <italic>strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree</italic>, and <italic>strongly agree</italic>. The twelve items (mentioned in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077695812454109">Table 1</xref>) were combined for an index with a Cronbach’s alpha of .83. The average on the 5-point Likert-type scale was 2.9 (range = 1–5), with a standard deviation of 0.74.</p>
<p>The total amount of external funding a communication unit received in the previous year was measured by asking respondents to report how much external research funding their unit generated that year; multiple-year grants were averaged for a per-year basis. The average was $42,797, with a standard deviation of $150,731.</p>

<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>A total of nine independent variables were employed for this study. They included a common set of seven variables that, as mentioned earlier, were applied to RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3:</p>
<list id="list5-1077695812454109" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>The communication discipline a program emphasized was operationalized with a question requiring respondents to choose from exclusively, mostly, or equal amounts of either mass or human (e.g., interpersonal or organizational) communication. The first two choices were collapsed and the last two choices were collapsed, so the three categories were all or mostly mass communication, equal amounts mass communication and HC, all or mostly HC.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Type of graduate program (if any) offered was measured in terms of the six options respondents were asked to choose from, including no; “sort of”: it’s in combination with another program on campus; yes, one master’s degree program only; yes, more than one master’s degree; yes, master’s and doctoral degree; yes, but a doctoral degree only. The first two choices were collapsed together, the third and fourth choices were combined, and the final two choices were integrated. The three resulting categories were no graduate program, a master’s program only, and a doctoral program.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Size of faculty was operationalized in terms of a question asking respondents how many full-time communication faculty were within their unit.

<list-item><p>Research classification of university was operationalized using the 2005 Carnegie Foundation’s classifications to create eleven exclusive options, including very high research activity (RU/VH); high research activity (RU/H); doctoral research university (DRU); larger master’s programs (L); medium master’s programs (M); smaller master’s programs (S); baccalaureate colleges–arts &amp; sciences (Bac/A&amp;S); baccalaureate colleges–diverse fields (Bac/Diverse); baccalaureate/associate’s colleges (Bac/Assoc); don’t know, but I wish to provide my institution name; and don’t know, but I do NOT wish to provide my institution name. The three categories of master’s program were collapsed into a single category, as were the three categories for bachelor’s programs. Those who selected “don’t know, but I do NOT wish to provide my institution name” were excluded from the analyses including this variable.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Size of the university was measured by asking respondents to approximate how large their institution was (keeping in mind their specific <italic>campus</italic> location, not the system of institutions in their state/city).

<p>All dependent variables (described earlier) were measured at the interval or ratio level, while independent variables were measured at the nominal or ordinal level.

<p>The eighth independent variable concerned perceived increase in pressure to land external funding in recent years. Respondents were asked to express their level of agreement on a 5-point Likert-type scale (<italic>strongly disagree</italic> to <italic>strongly agree</italic>) with a pair of questions: “Our unit has begun to emphasize external funding of research much more in the last two years than in the past” and “Our institution has begun to emphasize external funding of research much more in the last two years than in the past.”</p>
<p>The ninth independent variable focused on the degree to which respondents perceived their university.

<p>Nearly 62 percent of respondents reported that in the past fiscal year the communication unit had brought in no external funding, and another 22 percent reported bringing in less than $25,000. Just less than 3 percent reported bringing in $500,000 or more.

<p>Also, the larger the faculty, the greater the perceived pressure described (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Respondents on faculties with more than twenty people reported more pressure than those on faculties of ten or fewer or on faculties of eleven to twenty people. There was no significant difference between small and midsized faculties.</p>
<p>Moreover, pressure increased with the percentage of faculty expected to conduct research (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), but the difference was significant only when comparing faculties with less than half the people doing research to those with at least three-quarters of faculty conducting research. Furthermore, programs whose universities were classified as “very high research” (RU/VH) exerted significantly more pressure than did programs of any other classification. Although there was a general trend toward more pressure with a higher classification, “large master’s” (L) programs bucked the trend by offering the second highest level of pressure despite being the fourth highest classification.</p>
<p>Also, results show that the larger the university, the higher the level of the pressure reported (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Universities with fewer than 10,000 students exerted less pressure than schools with 10,000 to 20,000 students, which in turn exerted less pressure than schools with more than 20,000 students.</p>
<p>Similarly, the general trend was that the larger the program, the more the perceived pressure (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Although respondents at programs with fewer than 500 students reported less pressure than respondents at programs with either 500 to 1,000 students or 1,000-plus students, there was no significant difference between midsized (500–1,000) and larger (more than 1,000) programs.</p>

<sec id="section15-1077695812454109" sec-type="discussion|conclusions">
<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>We employed a survey of communication programs around the country to examine the degree to which those programs are getting external funding for their faculty research and whether certain variables (such as size of program, level of research support, emphasis of program) were associated with the level of funding.</p>
<p>Although this study did not employ longitudinal data, it provides some evidence of many programs reporting greater emphasis by the university and their own communication unit than ever to bring in external funding, yet very few have been successful to date. More than half of respondents report that their university has increased pressure to land grants, but fewer than four in ten communication programs reported bringing in even a single grant in the previous year. Results of the present study suggest that the rate of securing grants in the communication disciplines may have dropped well below the mark identified by previous research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1077695812454109">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although some differences between this study and previous research may make a comparison difficult (e.g., previous research included only ACEJMC accredited programs; this study was more comprehensive), this does not alter the finding in this study that a large majority of communication units did not report any external grant acquisition. Moreover, the majority of those that did land a grant brought in less than $25,000.</p>
<p>We went beyond earlier research by investigating the relationship between pressure to generate external funding and acquisition of external funding.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1077695812454109">36</xref></sup> A case can be made that expectations for communication programs to generate external funding are growing faster than the support services to get that funding. As mentioned earlier, on a 24-point additive scale of support services, the mean score was 6.4, which is just barely above the first quartile or 25 percent. In addition, as reported earlier, more than 60 percent of respondents agreed with the notion that other programs on campus receive more support than the communication program. These results are consistent with previous research that suggested that although administrators of communication units reported some institutional support for grant-related activities (e.g., existence of a campus-sponsored research programs office),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1077695812454109">37</xref></sup> they were either neutral or dissatisfied with the level of support given to their units’ external grant activities (e.g., a streamlined “recognition and reward system” for grant winners or showing faculty how to get sponsors).</p>
<p>One goal of this project was to identify those variables that predict success in landing grants. In a nutshell, the finding regarding the most successful communication programs in terms of bringing in research funding resonates with earlier research’s determination that programs on doctoral campuses were overwhelmingly more likely to engage in external grant activities compared to those housed in either master’s or baccalaureate campuses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1077695812454109">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, this study failed to find any significant difference regarding whether a program focuses on mass communication, HC, or both, nor did the study find any significant difference in terms of what percentage of faculty members are expected to do research, which suggests that doing research or getting published and getting external grants are not necessarily isomorphic, as has been proposed by some researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1077695812454109">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, as some prominent U.S. journalism schools (e.g., University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of Missouri at Columbia, Northwestern University) have demonstrated, if landing grant money is the goal, it may not be necessary to have a faculty full of researchers. Although additional research is required to reach a firmer conclusion, it seems likely that the best strategy is to have a mixture of faculty members with different skill sets and marching orders. For example, instructors who can teach a large number of courses can free up time for research-oriented faculty on reduced loads to go after grants. However, it should be noted that programs with more than twenty faculty members are significantly more successful than are smaller programs. Previous research suggests that faculty size is important for a unit’s capacity to accomplish its diverse professional goals in the academy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1077695812454109">40</xref></sup> It is likely that smaller programs simply do not have the luxury of giving faculty members the release time they need to successfully compete for grants.</p>
<p>Although the level of support offered was correlated with funding success, the correlation was smaller than the correlation between pressure and success. While a support system is clearly important, it may well be that establishing a culture where externally funding success is seen as valuable may be even more crucial.</p>
<p>Communication programs at universities with the highest Carnegie classification brought significantly more external funding, even though the gaps in support and pressure are far less robust when making comparisons across groups. Even if this study’s findings cannot be directly compared with findings from earlier research because of the different versions of the Carnegie classification systems involved,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1077695812454109">41</xref></sup> this study identified a discernible pattern of programs with the highest classification (i.e., RU/VH) securing significantly more external funding than programs in most of the remaining classifications. But like previous research, this study found few robust differences between the different categories within classifications and between classifications.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1077695812454109">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although programs in the RU/VH classification do appear to have more resources and pressure, there would seem to be more to the story. The missing link may be the greater access faculty in these programs have to researchers in other disciplines on their campus who are successful in landing grants. Indeed, research that was noted earlier found that a major distinguishing factor of communication programs that are active in grant-related research is the emphasis on networking among peers who share similar grant and research interests.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1077695812454109">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus, no university’s Carnegie classification comes down to the success or failure of its communication program. Research in medicine and the hard sciences typically accounts for a great deal of a university’s external research funding. Many grants in the hard sciences have a communication component. Communication researchers who have the ability to partner with hard scientists on their campus who already have a track record of landing external funding would appear to be at a decided advantage. But even within the communication disciplines, growing areas such as health communication have provided notable grant opportunities. This has led to the mushrooming of health communication components in a number of J/MC programs as well as HC programs.</p>
<p>Although this study has extended explication of the norms of external funding in the communication disciplines, future research can capitalize on the findings herein by directly tapping the perceptions of faculty rather than just the views of administrators and also complementing quantitative data with qualitative data such as what focus groups of faculty can provide. Furthermore, it would be helpful to utilize a sample that reflects a more balanced distribution of predominantly J/MC programs versus predominantly HC programs to minimize sampling bias. Comparing data obtained from self-report studies such as this one to data generated from archival sources could also generate additional insights.</p>
<p>These limitations notwithstanding, this study not only is a solid update of previous studies on this important subject but also, as discussed above, has illuminated challenges (e.g., support of faculty that is out of sync with the pressure to seek grants) as well as some recipes for success (e.g., having a doctoral communication program and a large faculty of at least twenty). Thus, administrators and communication faculty can operate from a more informed perspective toward greater external grant achievement.</p>
