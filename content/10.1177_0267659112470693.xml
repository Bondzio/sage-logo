<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although modern techniques of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and better circuit designs have minimized the fatal cases of massive air embolism, recent investigations suggest that systemic microembolization derived from extracorporeal sources still represents a common problem during conventional CPB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112470693">1</xref></sup> High numbers of air microemboli (GME) are one factor contributing to cognitive deficits and long-term neuropsychologic impairment. Cognitive decline after cardiac surgery, known as postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), is a common complication and has been reported in approximately 50% of patients at discharge, 36% at 6 weeks, 26% to 33% at 1 year, and 42% at 5 years postoperatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112470693">2</xref></sup> Cerebral microemboli, caused by gaseous, organic, or inorganic particles generated during the procedure, have been hypothesized to be a primary predictor of cognitive decline after cardiac surgery. These embolic signals are assumed to represent air bubbles delivered into the systemic circulation as a result of air retained in the components of the extracorporeal circuit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112470693">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>While a number of factors, most notably transition from bubble oxygenators in the mid-1980s to today’s membrane oxygenators, have reduced the rate of gross air embolism over the several decades, recent design improvements and current strategies of CPB, in some instances, have not been proven to reduce the risk of gross air embolism during CPB; they may, in fact, increase this risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112470693">4</xref></sup> During CPB, both air and solid emboli (ie, fat, clots, platelet aggregates, atherosclerotic plaque material) may be delivered to the brain. Solid emboli, in particular, are more likely to be associated with adverse neurological events such as stroke and, perhaps, cognitive deficits. Some studies have suggested that, during CPB, solid emboli are more frequently released during certain surgical maneuvers. Drug injection, aortic cannula type and placement, internal properties of the oxygenator and filters, levels of vacuum (&lt;40 mmHg), high blood flow rates (6 L/min), temperature gradient, and long CPB duration are still sources of increased microemboli production and updated recommendations for precaution should be noted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112470693">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Risk recognition and risk stratification have received wide acceptance in cardiac surgery over the past decade. Researchers focus on factors associated with patient risk, and develop and test strategies designed to improve the margin of safety and lead to risk neutralization. With respect to the age and physical condition of the patients, many surgeons have found a shift toward older, frailer adults. The patient population referred for coronary revascularization (CABG) has become more challenging. The results of this displacement could be altered to the benefit of the patients undergoing open heart surgery by continual improvement of the operative techniques as well as the technology of CPB systems. High-risk cases necessitate suitable detection devices and a high index of suspicion. POCD is also reported to be insignificant in routine patients, but significantly higher in high-risk groups in many of the previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112470693">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Clinical indicators are, unfortunately, late signs of embolism. Moreover, they are non-specific. Novel real-time emboli detection and classification systems employ ultrasound technology to detect individual GME in blood flowing through an extracorporeal circuit. Multiple sensors are placed around the extracorporeal circuit tubing and ultrasound channels, standard with each unit, allow for real time, simultaneous emboli detection at each sensor. This allows the locating of the source of GME generated by the CPB machine or associated tubing. The units count rates exceeding 1000 emboli per second, with diameters from 10 microns to the connector diameter and with flow rates between 0.2 L/minute and 6.0 L/minute.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112470693">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this report, the powerful precept of preoperative risk assessment has been applied to examine, prospectively, the association between the intensity of intraoperative GME, the systemic inflammatory response, myocardial protection, perioperative regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2), neuropsychological testing and the clinical outcome in high-risk patients undergoing CABG.</p>

<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<sec id="section7-0267659112470693">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Institution (2011-023). Informed consent was obtained from each patient included in the study.</p>
<p>Over a six-month period, GME activity was monitored in 102 Euroscore 6+ patients during CPB with a conventional 32-micron arterial filter simultaneously by a non-invasive, real time ultrasonic device (M3, Spectrum Medical, Fort Mill, SC), detecting and sizing at a detection level of 2% of circuit diameter.</p>
<p>Cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted on a roller pump (System 1, TCM Heat exchanger, Terumo, Ann Arbor, MI) via an open system with a hard-shell reservoir (Compactflo Evolution, Sorin, Mirandola, Italy). Exclusion criteria consisted of known coagulopathy, endocarditis, and inability to obtain informed consent. The remaining patients who did not correspond to the exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study with respect to preoperative Euroscore classification.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0267659112470693">
<title>Neurocognitive Testing</title>
<p>Each patient underwent a standard battery of neurobehavioral tests, including those recommended by a consensus conference.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112470693">8</xref></sup> Patients were tested before surgery (baseline), before hospital discharge (1 week), and one month after the surgery.</p>
<p>Patients completed the following tests: Line bisection (distribution of visual-spatial attention), the Stroop test (interference resolution, attention), Finger tapping (a computer-based version of the fine motor movement skill), and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (immediate memory, verbal learning, proactive and retroactive interference, recognition).</p>
<p><bold><italic>The Line Bisection Test</italic></bold> is a test of a quick measure to detect the presence of unilateral spatial neglect (USN). The patients are asked to place a mark with a pencil (with their preferred or unaffected hand) through the center of a series of 18 horizontal lines on an 11 x 8.5-inch page. The test is scored by measuring the deviation of the bisection from the true center of the line. A deviation of more than 6 mm from the midpoint indicates unilateral spacial neglect (USN). The omission of two or more lines on one half of the page indicates USN.</p>
<p><bold><italic>The Stroop Test</italic></bold> involves showing words that are the names of colors in the participant’s native language. The letters making up each word are printed in a color of ink different from the color name the word represents. Patients were asked to quickly respond with the color ink they saw, and ignore the printed word. Once a given stage started, they were asked to use the keyboard left and right arrow keys to give responses. At the end of each stage, the task displayed the score (number correct and time).</p>
<p><bold><italic>The Finger Tapping test</italic></bold> asks patients to place their dominant hand palm down, fingers extended, with the index finger resting on a lever that is attached to a counting device. Individuals were instructed to tap their index finger as quickly as possible for ten seconds, keeping the hand and arm stationary. This trial was repeated five to 10 times until the examiner had collected counts for five consecutive trials that were within five taps of each other. Before the start of the test, the patients were given a practice session. They were also given brief rests between each 10-second trial, and one- to two-minute rests after every third trial. This entire procedure was repeated with the non-dominant hand. The test took approximately ten minutes to complete.</p>
<p><bold><italic>The Auditory Verbal Learning Test</italic></bold> evaluates a wide diversity of functions: short-term auditory-verbal memory, rate of learning, learning strategies, retroactive, and proactive interference, presence of confabulation of confusion in memory processes, retention of information, and differences between learning and retrieval.</p>
<p>Patients were given a list of 15 unrelated words repeated over five different trials and were asked to repeat. Another list of 15 unrelated words were given and the patient, again, had to repeat the original list of 15 words and then, again, after 30 minutes. Approximately 10 to 15 minutes is required for the procedure (not including the 30-min interval).</p>

<title>Operative Technique</title>
<p>Anesthesia was induced by fentanyl (35 µg /kg) and muscle relaxation was established with pancronium (0.1 mg/kg). The patients were intubated endotracheally and ventilated with 100% oxygen. A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed via the internal jugular vein. Patients were administered full dose 300 IU/kg heparin (Liquemine, Roche Products Ltd., Welwyn Garden City, UK), with a target activated clotting time (ACT) over 480 s. The ACT was measured by a Hemochron 801 (International Technodyne Corporation, Edison, NJ.). The setting up of the circuits in the study was designed to exclude as many as possible of the interfering inflammatory reactions attending CPB. Cardiotomy, suction and left ventricle decompression lines were not connected to the circuit. Shed blood was not re-transfused, but processed in a cell-saver (Dideco-Shiley Therapeutic Autotransfusion System, Covidien, Mansfield, MA). The ascending aorta was cannulated for arterial inflow and the right atrium for venous return, the patients were cooled down to 30°C and blood flow was maintained at 2.0-2.4 L/min/m<sup>2</sup> during CPB. After cross-clamping of the aorta, the heart was arrested with 4:1 blood cardioplegia, 10-15 mL/kg, and maintained at 20-minute intervals. Warm blood cardioplegia was administered before the aortic cross-clamp was released. Prime for CPB was identical for all patient groups; 60 ml of mannitol 20% + 1000 ml of hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven 130.4, Fresenius, Istanbul, Turkey) and 300 ml of crystalloid (Plasmalyte A, Eczacibasi, Istanbul, Turkey) with a total of 1360 cc.</p>

<title>GME Detection</title>
<p>Sensors were placed on the extracorporeal circuit tubing at the arterial outlet after the in-line arterial filter and recordings were transferred to the monitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112470693">Figure 1</xref>). The detector calibrates automatically as soon as it is switched on. The detector is capable of measuring two independent flow channels, each with flow and emboli detection. The sensor system uses ultrasonic signal phase variations to determine actual flow rates and uses direction and changes in ultrasonic signal amplitude to detect emboli. Data were simultaneously stored throughout the whole extracorporeal circulation time, detecting and sizing at a detection level of 2% of the circuit diameter. The system is designed to measure percent incremental of the circuit diameter up to a maximum 2%.</p>

<title>Blood Samples and Assays</title>
<p>Complete blood count (hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte, white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts) was recorded. The results of standard blood and urine chemistry, especially serum albumin and globulin fractions, were documented. Blood samples were collected in potassium-EDTA (ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid) tubes using a radial or femoral artery catheter at the following intervals: baseline (T1); at the end of the CPB (T2) and 24 h (T3) postoperatively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0267659112470693">
<title>Perioperative follow-up</title>
<p>For each patient, the following factors were evaluated before discharge and documented: hemodynamic parameters, perfusion and cross-clamp duration, intubation period, postoperative hemorrhage, the use of blood (as units) and fresh frozen plasma (blood product-as units) during the hospital stay, the incidence of arrhythmia, the use of inotropic support, complications and infection, the duration of ICU stay and hospital stay, perioperative mortality, the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, and Doppler echocardiography. Comparisons among groups were performed retrospectively.</p>

<sec id="section13-0267659112470693">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Normally distributed variables are reported as means and their SDs. Continuous variables were compared by unpaired <italic>t</italic> tests if normally distributed or the Mann-Whitney test for non-normally distributed variables. Proportions were compared by <italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Logistic regression analysis was used to measure the relationship between GME counts and the incidence of POCD. Associations between continuous variables were examined using correlation and linear regression analyses. All tests used <italic>p&lt;</italic>0.05 as the critical value of statistical significance. Analyses were performed using SPSS (Version 16.0).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite an older and more morbid cardiac surgery population, major negative outcomes after CABG continue to decline. As significant complications, such as death, stroke, and renal and pulmonary failure, decrease, attention is focused on more subtle adverse outcomes, such as neurocognitive decline. It is not uncommon to encounter a patient in the early weeks after surgery with the complaint that they are not thinking as clearly as they were before the operation. The patient is often able to describe instances where they can no longer comprehend reading material that they could have previously or are unable to complete concentration-related activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659112470693">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112470693">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The association between microemboli during CPB and POCD has been controversial. Some studies have found that patients undergoing CABG with higher emboli counts were more likely to experience cognitive deficits or higher rates of frontal lobe dysfunction, but others have found that there is no correlation between emboli counts and neurological symptoms or cognitive deficits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659112470693">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659112470693">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several methodological issues may account for the variability among these studies, including small sample sizes, differences in intensity thresholds used to detect emboli, artery location (carotid versus middle cerebral artery), unilateral or bilateral recordings, type of ultrasound device, quality of transcranial Doppler ultrasound recordings, inconsistency of signal reviewing techniques (automatic versus manual), and the effects of several confounding variables such as the duration of CPB and core body temperature. We sought to overcome these limitations by studying a large number of high-risk patients undergoing CABG, who are more likely to be affected by POCD, by using a real-time ultrasound detector, reviewing embolic signals closest to the source within the extracorporeal circulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267659112470693">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>We tried to categorize patients in similar clinical situations. They usually had similar operations, medications and preoperative clinical situations. The only difference was the emboli count. But, of course, it is not possible to claim that these differences are only due to the emboli count.</p>
<p>The use of different POCD definitions and techniques for counting emboli makes it difficult to compare results among studies. We believe that our study achieved appropriate sensitivity by using scores for practice effect and well-established criteria for POCD. We tried to use the neurocognitive testing as extensively as possible. Memory test outcome was summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267659112470693">Figure 2D</xref>. The highest emobli group was much more impaired, but not statistically different. The follow-up was much better in the one-month controls.</p>
<p>Patients with cerebral microembolism have higher cognitive deficits; the cumulative effect of the embolism is thought to be the cause. Three out of four neurocognitive tests were significantly impaired in the high emboli count group. We also need to underline that these disturbances are temporary and vanish within the first postoperative month.</p>
<p>Our findings are important for two reasons. First, they suggest that the majority of microemboli that occur during CPB consist of air. Although gaseous microemboli may not cause as much cerebral injury as atherosclerotic emboli, we believe that minimizing the occurrence of emboli of any type is important. The second important observation from this study is that gaseous emboli are able to traverse the arterial filter. We used a 32-μ filter in the arterial line for all patients, yet air was able to be transported from the venous reservoir to the aorta. On separate occasions, we observed a massive number of microemboli occurring without obvious cause. Shortly thereafter, the surgeon realized that the venous line was sucking air from the right atrium. When the venous cannula was repositioned, the microemboli immediately stopped. The method by which air traverses the arterial filter is not entirely clear, but, perhaps, it involves distortion of the bubbles into a “sausage” shape to fit through the pores or the coalescence of fragmented bubbles distal to the filter. Although arterial filters have been demonstrated to reduce the number of cerebral emboli and their use is standard, it is obvious that these devices do not remove all emboli. We have documented GME detection in different types of extracorporeal circuits in our previous publications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112470693">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112470693">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Strategies to remove air bubbles during CPB and to potentially decrease neurologic complications include attaining the Trendelenburg position, carotid compression, ascending aorta venting, stopping the pump if the arterial catheter is filled with air, de-airing of the heart if air is from the heart, increasing the mean arterial pressure, initiating pulsatile flow, the use of 100% oxygen, packing the head in ice, rapid systemic cooling to electroencephalographic near silence, and/or retrograde cerebral perfusion. We have employed all the current precautions for every single patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659112470693">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the most important outcomes would be to improve surgical or perfusion strategies, following the realization of air circulating through the extracorporeal system. In this study, we have only documented GME and correlated the inflammatory response and clinical outcome. Groom et al. demonstrated the positive contribution of air detection technologies in their clinical practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659112470693">16</xref></sup> Through this approach, they were able to assess the effectiveness of changes in technique and technology aimed at reducing microembolic activity. Their initiatives to redesign the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit through both clinical process and circuit redesign resulted in an 87.9% reduction in microemboli detected in the outflow of the CPB circuit, and a 77.2% reduction in microemboli detected in the cerebral arteries. Ultimately, changes in the CPB circuit lowered the CPB outflow count present to below the cerebral microemboli count.</p>
<p>Non-invasive, real-time ultrasonic GME monitoring is a useful technique to quantify and detect the source of microemboli during CABG and may be useful in assessing new operative strategies, the quality of the perfusion, and, potentially, as an indicator for the treatment in the operating room in patients with high GME counts. This method is a direct measurement of GME circulating within the circuit and more practical and easy-to-use with respect to Doppler techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659112470693">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The body of evidence linking embolization to clinical outcome and procedural cost is growing. This has prompted considerable debate regarding the feasibility of using pharmacologic cerebral protection during bypass procedures, which may only be justifiable in high-risk groups such as those with large numbers of emboli. In the interim, anesthetic and surgical techniques are slowly being modified in an attempt to reduce the numbers of emboli that form. In doing so, and assuming a causal relationship between embolization and outcome, both the complication rates and duration of hospitalization may be reduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112470693">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The main limitation of this study is that our findings may be specific to our CPB circuit, without correlation to Doppler evaluation or additional brain imaging. Our initial aim was to underline the presence of substantial air bubbles after the arterial line filter and a link with POCD in high-risk patients. Also, we tried to understand the need for real-time monitoring of intraoperative emboli.</p>
<p>Multicenter studies with a large number of patients and standardized monitoring protocols are needed to elucidate the clinical significance of emboli detection during CPB.</p>
<p>Another limitation is that the neurocognitive battery is limited to a few tests based on reaction time and does not cover a broad range of higher cognitive functions</p>
<p>Future studies could also target high-risk patients with a high burden of atherosclerotic disease who are more likely to be exposed to a larger embolic load. Another patient population that warrants further study is that with pre-existing cognitive impairment that may be at an increased risk for further decline after surgery.</p>
<p>Until the results of these studies are known, however, we think it is reasonable to suggest the minimization of air in any extracorporeal circuit to decrease the risk of POCD.</p>
