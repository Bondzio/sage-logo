<abstract>
<p>This article investigates satisfaction with time pressure for men and women with different hours of paid employment using data from the 2006 ‘Negotiating the Life Course’ project. In Australia, part-time employment is a common strategy adopted by women with dependent children to reconcile paid work and family responsibilities. However, women employed part-time are not a homogeneous group. This study differentiates between women employed for minimal part-time, half-time and reduced full-time hours, as well as women employed full-time and not in the labour force, to investigate differences in perceived time pressure. Three dimensions of time pressure are examined: overall time pressure, time pressure at home and time pressure at work. We find gender differences in time pressure at home and differences among women in overall and work time pressure. We conclude that being employed part-time does not alleviate time pressure for all women.</p>

<p>Australian women are much more likely to be employed part-time compared to men, particularly if they have young children. In Australia, part-time employment is broadly classified as working fewer than 35 hours per week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1440783311419907">ABS, 2008</xref>). In 2008, 63 percent of Australian women with dependent children were employed in the labour force, with 60 percent of them employed part-time. In contrast, only 7 percent of employed men with dependent children worked part-time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1440783311419907">ABS, 2008</xref>). Why is there such a marked difference in employment patterns for women and men with children? Research suggests that women with children generally work part-time as a strategy to reconcile the competing time demands of paid work and family life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1440783311419907">Hosking and Western, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1440783311419907">Morgan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1440783311419907">Russell and Bowman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1440783311419907">Thornthwaite, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1440783311419907">Wolcott and Glezer, 1995</xref>). Despite the widespread uptake of part-time employment by Australian mothers, there is disagreement about whether it delivers work–family balance or reduces time pressure for women with dependent children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1440783311419907">Bittman and Brown, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1440783311419907">Pocock et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1440783311419907">Qu and Weston, 2005</xref>). In fact, very little research has directly tested whether part-time employment does reduce time pressure for mothers with young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1440783311419907">Craig and Mullan, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a growing body of recent Australian research that examines the quality of part-time employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1440783311419907">Campbell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1440783311419907">Chalmers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1440783311419907">Chalmers and Hill, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1440783311419907">Chalmers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1440783311419907">van Gellecum et al., 2008</xref>). This research finds that part-time employment tends to be inferior in terms of job security, training and benefits (such as leave and superannuation). Thus, while part-time employment makes it possible for women to fit employment hours around their family commitments, it comes at a cost to their careers and economic security.</p>
<p>At the same time, research has also found that part-time employment can provide benefits. For example, it enables people with caring responsibilities to maintain workforce contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1440783311419907">Abhayaratna, 2008</xref>). In addition, British research has shown that women employed part-time were just as likely as full-time employees to value the intrinsic and expressive benefits of paid work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1440783311419907">Tam, 1997</xref>: 188). Paid employment for women has also been found to enhance self-esteem and increase satisfaction in providing a positive role model for their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1440783311419907">Folbre, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In Australia, scant research attention has been paid to the implications of variations in employment hours for women’s perceptions of work–family balance. Moreover, most research has focused on the dichotomy between part-time employment, usually defined as 1–34 hours, and full-time employment, usually defined as 35 or more hours per week. This approach overlooks the large variation in women’s employment hours within these broader categories. While part-time employment for mothers is a common feature in a number of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations, including the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and the UK, Australia stands out as having an exceptional number of mothers working casual or part-time hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1440783311419907">OECD, 2002</xref>). Indeed, the most common practice in Australia for mothers, whether partnered or single, is for them to work part-time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1440783311419907">Chalmers, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous research has found that the number of hours worked per week was a consistent predictor of work–family conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1440783311419907">Bellavia and Frone, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1440783311419907">Hosking and Western’s (2008)</xref> study found that some types of part-time employment, including casual contracts, night or weekend work, worsened work–family conflict for parents; whereas more standard part-time employment was associated with improved work–family balance. Yet a detailed examination of the effect of variations in work hours on perceptions of time pressure is lacking in Australian research. Our article attempts to fill this gap.</p>
<sec id="section1-1440783311419907">
<title>Gender divisions and part-time employment</title>
<p>There are several theoretical insights from recent research that are helpful in explaining why satisfaction with time pressure for women may not be assured by part-time employment. One of these is the finding that women have little real choice about whether to take main responsibility for unpaid domestic and care work, and consequently that women’s movement into part-time employment is their only option in an institutional framework which provides few alternatives for combining paid and unpaid work. Feminist scholars have argued that imbalances in time spent on domestic and care work reflect a persisting gender power inequity which allows men a ‘choice’ about whether to engage in unpaid work not afforded to women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1440783311419907">Connell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1440783311419907">Folbre, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1440783311419907">Hochschild, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1440783311419907">Oakley, 1985</xref>). Hence women with children may transition to part-time employment as a means of dealing with increased caring responsibilities, but time demands may then accrue for women who become responsible for managing the work–home interface.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that fractional employment does not relieve women from domestic and care responsibilities, or time pressure, to the same degree as men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1440783311419907">Pocock et al., 2009</xref>). So although many women with children may opt to work part-time, the expectations and pressures of unpaid responsibilities are not necessarily diminished. Further, others have argued that the problem of reconciling work and family demands is intensified for women because caring work is unrecognized and undervalued by the broader society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1440783311419907">Fraser, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1440783311419907">Lewis, 2006</xref>). This invites the question: are time pressures across different contexts also unrecognized?</p>
<p>Gender theorists have suggested that it is ‘gendered moral rationalities’ that have most influence over the amount of paid and unpaid work women and men undertake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1440783311419907">Duncan and Edwards, 1999</xref>: 235; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1440783311419907">Lewis, 1991</xref>). These gendered moral rationalities pertain to the non-market, shared understandings around parenthood and paid work that influence ‘who does what’ in households. Research shows housework and childcare tasks tend to be divided along gender lines, with men doing mostly outdoor and women mostly indoor chores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1440783311419907">Baxter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1440783311419907">Craig, 2002</xref>). In regard to childcare, mothers tend to take care of the physical needs of children such as feeding and bathing, while fathers do more discretionary tasks such as playing with children. In this context it seems part-time employment is a gendered option in that it allows women to continue to fulfil gendered expectations around child care and domestic tasks.</p>

<title>Time use and time pressure studies</title>
<p>Several empirical studies have provided a picture of how Australian women and men spend their time and perceive time pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1440783311419907">Baxter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1440783311419907">Bittman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1440783311419907">Craig, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1440783311419907">Pocock et al., 2009</xref>). In a recent report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1440783311419907">Baxter et al. (2007)</xref> found employment hours, domestic labour and child care were key areas that contributed to feelings of time pressure for women. The researchers also noted that how time is spent varies according to a person’s life-course stage. The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) study found that when men became fathers their hours of employment increased, with more than nine-out-of-ten working fathers employed 35 or more hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1440783311419907">AIFS, 2005</xref>). In contrast, mothers with infants were most likely to be employed fewer than 16 hours per week, although maternal employment hours increased with the age of their youngest child and as children grew older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1440783311419907">AIFS, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Parental status and the age of dependent children are also associated with time stress and pressure. Australian women are delaying having children, with most first-time mothers in 2003 aged 30 or over, a trend associated with women prioritizing education and career before having a family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1440783311419907">Gray et al., 2008</xref>). However, studies suggest that once children are born, employed women with dependent children have the longest work weeks of all groups when paid and unpaid hours are combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1440783311419907">Craig, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1440783311419907">Craig and Mullan, 2009</xref>) and the younger the dependent children are, the greater the total workload of women compared to men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1440783311419907">Sayer et al., 2009</xref>: 538). For women this is typically due to increased time spent on care and unpaid work, while for men there is evidence of long hours in paid employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1440783311419907">Craig and Mullen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1440783311419907">HREOC, 2007</xref>). This is likely to influence feelings of time pressure.</p>
<p>Recent research shows that women and men with dependent children were more likely to experience time pressure than those without dependent children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1440783311419907">Baxter et al., 2007</xref>). Further, women and men with children under the age of 5 years were most likely to experience time pressure, with 58 percent of mothers, and 48 percent of fathers feeling rushed or pressed for time. These findings support earlier research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1440783311419907">Bittman (2004</xref>: 161) who found that married women, women with preschool children and sole parents were most frequently ‘always rushed or pressed for time’. Lone mothers were found to be less likely than partnered mothers to be employed in flexible jobs and have access to family or personal leave and were therefore at particular risk of time pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1440783311419907">Baxter et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>More recently, the 2009 Australian Work and Life Index (AWALI) study measured a range of work life experiences including the ‘frequency of feeling rushed or pressed for time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1440783311419907">Pocock et al., 2009</xref>). This study showed that women were far more likely than men to feel rushed or pressed for time, regardless of whether they worked full- or part-time. Overall, 47.1 per cent of men reported feeling often or almost always rushed for time compared to 62 per cent of women. This study also found that part-time employment protected men more than women from feelings of time pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1440783311419907">Pocock et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Other research finds that women employed part-time may experience more time pressure than men because they spend as much time on unpaid work as women who are not in the labour force, resulting in very long hours overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1440783311419907">Craig, 2002</xref>). Thus, women employed part-time may still perceive high levels of time pressure despite their shorter employment hours. While this research indicates that part-time employment may allow women to combine paid and unpaid work, there may be a threshold beyond which employment hours start to have a negative effect on feelings of time pressure. In addition, time pressure may be experienced differently by women and men across home and work contexts. Thus, although Australian women are using part-time employment as one of the few available strategies to balance work and family demands, we suggest that further investigation is needed to determine how effective it is in terms of alleviating time pressure.</p>
<p>Our study thus investigates whether, and at what point, part-time employment hours ease feelings of time pressure. We differentiate between three types of part-time employment: ‘minimal part-time hours’ (1–14 hours/week), ‘half-time hours’ (15–29 hours/week) and reduced full-time hours (30–4 hours/week). Previous Australian research suggests that this more refined definition of part-time employment more accurately reflects women’s work hours preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1440783311419907">Glezer and Wolcott, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1440783311419907">Qu and Weston, 2005</xref>). We build on previous Australian research on part-time employment and work–family balance in several ways. This is the first known study to investigate whether feelings of time pressure vary in relation to different hours of part-time employment. Arguably, women’s perceptions of time pressure are an important indicator of work–family conflict. We also examine whether perceptions of time pressure vary according to gender and parental status. We are interested in whether men and women perceive time pressure similarly and whether time pressure is more acute for parents compared to their childless counterparts.</p>
<p>Finally, we add to previous Australian and international literature by considering different kinds of time pressure, including satisfaction with overall time pressure, satisfaction with time pressure at home and satisfaction with time pressure at work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1440783311419907">Greenhaus et al. (2003)</xref> support the notion that satisfaction, although subjective, is a valid measure to use in order to assess work–life indicators such as time pressure. This approach contrasts with most previous studies which examine time pressure in general, but do not differentiate between work and home contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1440783311419907">Baxter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1440783311419907">Bittman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1440783311419907">Craig and Mullan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1440783311419907">Pocock et al., 2009</xref>). Why are home and work context distinctions important to understanding time pressure? As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1440783311419907">Wacjman (2008</xref>: 65) explains, ‘housework is unpaid and never done, resulting in highly gendered temporalities that do not coincide with the temporalities of paid labour’. Likewise, caring for children cannot be calculated according to linear or clock time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1440783311419907">Morehead, 2005</xref>). These temporal differences highlight the importance of considering the contexts of home and work separately in an investigation of time pressure. We investigate whether these contextual distinctions may be important for understanding how different aspects of work and family contribute to feelings of time pressure.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>The data source is Wave 4 of the Negotiating the Life Course (NLC) survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1440783311419907">McDonald et al., 2008</xref>). This is a national longitudinal study broadly concerned with understanding the ways in which men and women negotiate paid and unpaid work over the life-course. The first wave of data was collected in 1996/7, comprising 2231 respondents aged between 18 and 54 randomly selected from listed telephone numbers in the electronic white pages. Within households respondents were randomly selected from all eligible adults. The data were collected using computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI), with a response rate of 63 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1440783311419907">McDonald et al., 2000</xref>). The Wave 1 sample was comparable to the Australian population at the time for age, marital status, family status and employment status, but had a higher representation of women, 56 percent women compared to 50 percent of men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1440783311419907">McDonald et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The survey covers a range of issues, including employment history, relationship history, unpaid work, social attitudes and a range of demographic and health characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1440783311419907">McDonald et al., 2008</xref>). Participants were re-interviewed in 2000, 2003 and 2006.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1440783311419907">1</xref></sup> The current article used data from Wave 4 for two reasons. First, this was the most recent wave available and was therefore likely to reflect current trends. Second, it included a top-up sample of 2000 respondents added to the original sample, which increased the overall sample size and corrected for loss of representativeness with the broader Australian population. These 2000 respondents included an additional 629 people aged 18–26 years to increase numbers in the younger age group. The Wave 4 sample comprised 3138 respondents, of which 1169 were men and 1969 were women. We excluded missing values on the dependent variables: ‘overall time pressure’ (missing = 2), ‘time pressure at home’ (missing = 4), and ‘time pressure at work’ (missing = 50). We also excluded missing values on the independent variables: domestic work hours (missing = 16), marital status (missing = 2) and 118 respondents including 47 men and 71 women, who worked irregular hours and could not be coded for employment hours. Our final analytic sample was 1113 men and 1872 women. For some analyses we further confined our sample to mothers (<italic>n</italic> = 993) and fathers (<italic>n</italic> = 484), defined as those with one or more dependent children (aged under 18) living in their household.</p>

<title>Variables</title>
<sec id="section5-1440783311419907">
<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>We used three dependent variables to capture different aspects or contexts of time pressure: overall time pressure, time pressure at work and time pressure at home. These measures were based on the following three questions:</p>
<list id="list1-1440783311419907" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>How satisfied are you with the amount of time you have to do the things you want to do?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How satisfied are you with the amount of pressure you are under at home?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How satisfied are you with the amount of pressure you are under at work?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>For the purposes of this study the first measure is referred to as ‘overall time pressure’, the second is referred to as ‘time pressure at home’ while the third is ‘pressure at work.’ While the second and third questions could be interpreted as referring to a broader conception of pressure, the consecutive placement of the three questions in the survey suggests they are most likely to measure perceptions of time pressure. Levels of satisfaction were measured on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (extremely dissatisfied) to 9 (extremely satisfied).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1440783311419907">
<title>Key independent variable</title>
<p>Our key independent variable is hours spent in paid employment. ‘Employment hours’ is a continuous variable derived from the survey question asking respondents how many hours per week they usually work in their main job. Responses to this question ranged from 2 to 120 hours per week. Our study divided this variable into discrete work hours categories for analysis. For women our work hours categories included: 1 = not in the labour force, 2 = minimal part-time hours (1–14), 3 = half-time hours (15–29), 4 = reduced full-time hours (30–4) and 5 = full-time hours (35 or more). These categories of part-time employment were developed and used in previous Australian research to identify women’s work hours preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1440783311419907">Glezer and Wolcott, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1440783311419907">Qu and Weston, 2005</xref>). For men our work hours categories included: 1 = not in the labour force, 2 = part-time hours (1–34) and 3 = full-time (35 or more hours). As only a small proportion of men were employed part-time compared to women, we did not divide men’s part-time work into discrete categories.</p>

The measure of domestic work hours was derived from a question asking how many hours the respondent spent each week on meal preparation and clean-up, shopping for food and other essentials, and housework chores including vacuuming and laundry. Relationship status comprised single, co-habiting and married, with single as the reference group. Research has found that women and men in cohabiting relationships spend more equal amounts of time on domestic work compared to their married counterparts, and that lone parents spend more time than their partnered counterparts in work and child care, thus these different relationship states are likely to affect perceptions of time pressure differentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1440783311419907">Baxter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1440783311419907">Craig, 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>We use two indicators of parental status. The first indicates the number of dependent children in the household (aged less than 18 years). Second, we include two separate measures for the presence of pre-school children (1 = child aged 0–4 years) and school-aged children (1 = child aged 5–15 years). As previous research suggests, the presence and ages of dependent children are important for the amount of time men and women spend on domestic labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1440783311419907">Baxter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1440783311419907">Craig, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Analytic approach</title>
<p>Analyses proceeded in two main stages. First we investigated differences in satisfaction with time pressure for men and women with and without children. We compared mean scores on overall time pressure, pressure at home and pressure at work by conducting t-tests to determine whether the differences in mean scores were significant. Second, we undertook an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis to investigate the effect of employment hours on satisfaction with the three measures of time pressure. In this analysis we first ran a baseline model (Model 1) estimating the association between hours in paid employment and time pressure. We then estimated a model (Model 2) controlling for relationship status, domestic work hours and the number and age of children. All models were run separately for men and women as we expect gendered differences in the association between the independent variables and perceptions of time pressure.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The analyses presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1440783311419907">Table 2</xref> assessed gender differences in men and women’s satisfaction with time pressure overall, at home and at work. The average score on satisfaction with time pressure overall, at home and at work lies around the middle (between 5 and 6) of the 1–9 response scale. Overall, men tended to score higher than women on all measures indicating greater satisfaction with time pressure. But this difference was only statistically significant for time pressure at home. Results showed that women were significantly less satisfied with time pressure at home than men (<italic>p</italic> &lt;.01). Further, women with children were significantly less satisfied with time pressure at home than men with children (<italic>p</italic> &lt;.001). Interestingly, men with children reported less satisfaction with time pressure at work than women with children, but the difference does not attain statistical significance. In summary, this bivariate analysis indicated that while there were gender differences in satisfaction with time pressure, the home context emerged as an important site for gender differences, where women were less satisfied with time pressure than men.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1440783311419907">Table 3</xref> we present the results of the regression analyses for men. The results suggest that men in full-time employment had significantly lower levels of satisfaction with overall time pressure and time pressure at work than men who are employed part-time. These findings remained constant in Model 2 when the control variables were added. In contrast, the results for satisfaction with time pressure at home suggest that men employed full-time had significantly higher levels of satisfaction with time pressure at home than men employed part-time or men not in the labour force. This finding was consistent in both Model 1 and Model 2. This is an interesting result and suggests that when men are employed full-time they experience little time pressure in relation to home duties such as housework and caring responsibilities.</p>

<p>There were some interesting results for the control variables. Both the number of children and the presence of a preschool child had a negative effect on satisfaction with time pressure in the home for men. Further, men with pre-school and school-aged children had lower satisfaction with time pressure overall. These findings may be linked to fathers’ greater involvement with the care of their children than in the past, including an expanded repertoire of child care related tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1440783311419907">Bittman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1440783311419907">Cabrera and Tamis-LeMonda, 1999</xref>). Alternatively, it may be that men’s perceived feelings of time pressure are associated with combining longer employment hours with what Baxter calls the ‘hard parts of the family day’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1440783311419907">Baxter, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1440783311419907">Table 4</xref> we report the OLS results for women; in these analyses we differentiated between different hours of part-time employment. The results indicate that women employed for half-time hours or more had lower levels of satisfaction with time pressure overall and at work compared to women not in the labour force. These findings suggest that working longer part-time hours does not relieve time pressure for women in these two contexts. In contrast, results for women’s levels of time pressure at home indicated that those employed half-time and full-time hours had higher levels of time pressure at home than those not in the labour force. However, once other factors are controlled in Model 2, the results showed that employment hours were no longer significantly associated with time pressure at home. In this model the results indicate that spending more time on domestic work and having more children was associated with significantly lower levels of satisfaction with time pressure at home. Domestic work hours and children also lower women’s satisfaction with overall time pressure, but employment hours remain statistically significant. Interestingly, married and cohabiting women report higher levels of satisfaction with time pressure at home than single women, and married women report higher levels of satisfaction with time pressure at work than single women.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study, we investigated the relationship between employment hours and satisfaction with time pressure. Building on previous research we differentiated part-time employment for women according to variations in employment hours and we investigated the association between employment status and perceptions of time pressure across three contexts of time pressure: overall time pressure, time pressure at home and time pressure at work.</p>
<p>Our bivariate analysis revealed the importance of the home as the main site where gender differences in perceptions of time pressure prevail. Women, including those with dependent children, had significantly lower levels of satisfaction with time pressure at home. In contrast, fathers, but not men generally, reported lower satisfaction with time pressure at work in comparison to mothers. This may reflect the fact that fatherhood is a time when most Australian men are likely to be employed full-time, developing their careers and working long hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1440783311419907">HREOC, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1440783311419907">OECD, 2005</xref>). Australian fathers still tend to be the primary breadwinners and take prime responsibility for the financial security of the family. Yet, while full-time employment decreased satisfaction with overall time pressure and time pressure at work, it alleviated time pressure in the home, possibly by relieving men from responsibility for domestic work.</p>
<p>In contrast, part-time employment did not affect satisfaction with time pressure in any context for men. This may be due to the relatively low percentage of men employed part-time (12%). However, our analysis revealed that women who work half time, reduced full-time and full-time hours had decreased satisfaction with time pressure overall and at work, even when other relevant variables were held constant. These findings confirmed earlier AWALI research that women in part-time employment still experienced high levels of stress and pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1440783311419907">Pocock et al., 2007</xref>: 46). It may also indicate that part-time employment frees women to take on higher levels of unpaid work in the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1440783311419907">Morehead, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results have implications for understanding how women and men experience time pressure. It appears that experiences of time pressure are gendered, where women experience more time pressure in the home than men, but similar levels of pressure overall and at work. This is consistent with the arguments made by gender theorists, who emphasize the importance of situated contexts. Traditionally the home is viewed as a woman’s domain, and one in which women have a higher level of responsibility and care for household tasks thus increasing the pressure they feel at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1440783311419907">Craig and Mullan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1440783311419907">Messner, 2004</xref>). Yet our results suggest that men also experience pressure from the presence of children. What remains unknown is whether this pressure stems from more time spent with children or other factors. In contrast, pressure at home for women may be related to men’s lack of contributions to domestic tasks.</p>
<p>Our study highlights the importance of differentiating between different types of part-time work. As our findings demonstrated, medium to long part-time hours, and full-time hours, did not offer relief to women in terms of time pressure overall, or at work. These findings suggest that part-time employment is therefore not homogeneous, but creates varying pressure depending on the number of hours worked. Further, although our research has not investigated the quality of employment, it may be important to consider not only the hours spent in part-time employment, but the quality (including flexibility, security and sociability) of the hours worked in evaluating how well part-time employment facilitates work–family balance and eases time pressure. Improving the quality of part-time employment may make working part-time a more attractive option for fathers as well as mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1440783311419907">Chalmers et al., 2005</xref>). Further, considering more closely the types of part-time jobs women and mothers typically hold would shed more light on the issue of work pressure.</p>
<p>The implications of our finding that working minimal part-time hours was associated with higher levels of satisfaction with time pressure overall and at home also needs to be considered in the broader contexts of the labour market. For example, previous research indicates that minimal hour part-time jobs also tend to be precarious or of lower quality than permanent part-time and full-time jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1440783311419907">Campbell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1440783311419907">Thornthwaite, 2004</xref>). Therefore, even though working minimal part-time hours for women may seem like a way to achieve work–family balance, it may also be a potential ‘trap’ in terms of locking them into secondary earning and primary caring or domestic roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1440783311419907">Hill, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1440783311419907">Tam, 1997</xref>). The prevailing social policy context in relation to women and work in Australia is broadly supportive of gender specialization in the division of domestic labour while at the same time endorsing a neoliberal push to increase the participation of women in employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1440783311419907">O’Connor et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, the majority of Australian women have little choice but to work part-time while their children are young because of these two countervailing pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1440783311419907">Baxter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1440783311419907">Hill, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>We suggest that further research is needed to explore strategies that can ease time-pressure and assist work–family balance. As Lewis suggests, policy in western nations needs to better address how care is to be valued and shared between the domains of the family, the workplace and the state (2006: 104). We suggest that work–family policy in Australia needs to look beyond its reliance on mothers employed part-time and towards alternative ways to promote this balance. In addition, while part-time employment has enticed mothers into paid work, it has not enticed fathers to do unpaid work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1440783311419907">Morehead, 2005</xref>). If this is the case, then it may not be the most equitable system because it limits the choices women and men can make in regards to meeting their paid work and family responsibilities.</p>
