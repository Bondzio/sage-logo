<p>The Journal Publications Committee of the American Educational Research Association (AERA) invites nominations and applications for the inaugural editorship of <italic>AERA Open</italic>. The Committee is seeking an innovative and experienced scholar to serve as editor(s) for a three-year term.</p>
<p><italic>AERA Open</italic> was approved by AERA Council in April 2013 as the first open access journal in the AERA suite of publications. As stated in its mission statement, <italic>AERA Open</italic> is a peer-reviewed, open access journal published by AERA. With an emphasis on rapid review and dissemination, <italic>AERA Open</italic> aims to advance knowledge through empirical and theoretical study across arenas of inquiry related to education and learning. Publication of AERA Open will commence in 2014.</p>
<p>The Journal Publications Committee seeks a leading scholar(s) with a zest for breaking new ground to assume this key editorial position. The ideal candidate(s) should bring breadth of vision, initiative, and innovation; a passion for excellence; and dedication to advancing scholarly knowledge and dissemination of the best research across a broad range of inquiry encompassed by <italic>AERA Open</italic>. Applicants should also possess managerial and organizational skills, as well as publishing/editorial experience. Finally, the ideal candidate(s) should show an interest in initiating and leading a journal based on principles of accessible knowledge and data for all.</p>
<p>The editor or editorial team is responsible for accepting and rejecting manuscripts on the basis of the quality of the scholarly work presented and the suitability of <italic>AERA Open</italic>, guiding manuscripts through the review process using a designated Web-based system, and overseeing revisions. In addition to an honorarium, the Association provides an annual discretionary grant to directly support editorial work on the journal.</p>
<p>Appointment is projected to be made in the fall of 2013. This editorship will be for a three-year term and may be extended for one to two years. Extension will be by mutual agreement of AERA and the appointed editor(s).</p>
<p>Applications and nominations of potential candidates are welcomed. Those wishing to nominate others are encouraged to do so as soon as possible so that potential candidates can be contacted about their interest in applying. Applicants and nominees will be sent a letter of instruction on how to apply. Please submit all inquiries and nominations to <email>publications@aera.net</email>.
