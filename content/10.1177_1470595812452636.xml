However, the adaptation of leadership styles to national culture is under pressure mainly due to the professionalization of leadership grounded in a formal knowledge base that is predominantly derived from research in Anglo-American cultural settings and performed by Anglo-American leadership researchers. In this paper, we argue that the forces leading to a drift away from cultural adaptation are partly counteracted by three mechanisms tying leaders to the cultural context in which they operate. This theoretical perspective allows us to understand better observed leadership in a national setting as equilibrium between cultural forces and institutional forces grounded in culturally biased formal research and leadership education based on this research. To illustrate the added value of this perspective, we develop some specific propositions concerning the three mechanisms and their relative strengths under a variety of cultural conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Culturally adapted behaviours</kwd><kwd>cultural values</kwd><kwd>experiential learning</kwd><kwd>institutional perspective</kwd><kwd>role of values</kwd><kwd>value internalization</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The main purpose of this paper is to explore three mechanisms by which cultural values may lead to the cultural adaptation of leadership. While most normative models for effective leadership are based on Anglo-American data and thinking, much leadership is obviously enacted in multicultural settings or cultures that differ from the Anglo-American in important respects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470595812452636">Hofstede, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1470595812452636">House et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Comparative research in cross-national settings strongly indicate that follower responses to specific leadership styles or facets are highly dependent on follower<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470595812452636">1</xref></sup> values, which in turn are partly reflected by their national cultural backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470595812452636">Den Hartog et al., 1999</xref>). Leaders<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470595812452636">2</xref></sup> who behave consistently with important follower values elicit responses such as positive emotions and thoughts, and supportive and motivated behaviours such as innovation, knowledge sharing and generally higher levels of effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470595812452636">Brown and Trevino, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470595812452636">Fiebig and Kramer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470595812452636">Foss et al., 2009</xref>). Leaders whose behaviours are in conflict with important follower values elicit negative emotions, sometimes characterized as ‘white hot’, negative thoughts and attitudes, such as intentions to leave the organization, and behaviours such as resistance, sabotage, unwanted turnover, and a generally lower level of work effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812452636">Gooty et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>This provides a strong argument for adaptation of leadership style to follower cultural values. However, culturally adapted leadership, which may be seen as a natural form of leadership in a national setting, is under pressure. Mainstream textbooks used for educating a new generation of leaders are predominantly transferring Anglo-American values and implicitly creating norms for good leadership which may be alien to the cultural setting and possibly lead to value destruction rather than value creation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470595812452636">Chin, 2010</xref>). Second, sometimes leaders seek advice from professional management consultants in order to improve their leadership work. Management consultants, however, rely on the same body of thought, i.e. Anglo-American leadership theory, and provide increased impetus away from cultural adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1470595812452636">Gerson, 2005</xref>). Third, ownership is increasingly globalized. This may lead to the composition of culturally incompetent boards and provide subtle incentives to move leadership away from the cultural setting in which it is performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1470595812452636">Tuselmann et al., 2002</xref>). Performance implications of such shifts in leadership are poorly understood, and empirical research on these issues is badly needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470595812452636">Child and Kieser, 1979</xref>).</p><p>We argue that these forces are partly counteracted by three mechanisms that may protect leaders from movement away from culturally adapted styles. First, leaders are often members of the culture in which they lead. This implies that personal values of leaders are congruent with follower values. As a person’s value system exerts a strong influence on the person’s thinking and behaving, local leaders are better positioned to enact culturally adapted leadership. Second, sophisticated leaders understand that their capacity to create value is mediated by positive rather than negative responses to their behaviours (including decision-making and process design). Hence leaders, regardless of their personal value systems, will seek to lead in a way that is consistent with their followers’ value systems. Third, organizational life is increasingly observed and scrutinized by the general public. For example, organizations that operate in conflict with public opinion is likely to be sanctioned by customers, regulators, and possibly financial institutions. Public opinion about organizations’ behaviour is partly a reflection of shared cultural values. Hence, shared cultural values function as a framework within which leaders make their choices, regardless of their or their followers’ values.</p><p>The interrelationship between national culture and leadership behaviours is at the very core of research on cross-cultural leadership. Hence, much knowledge has been accumulated on how leaders adapt to the aspects of national culture and the effects of (non) adaptation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470595812452636">Adler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470595812452636">Black and Porter, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470595812452636">Elenkov and Manev, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1470595812452636">Neelankavil et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1470595812452636">Shahin and Right, 2004</xref>). However, up to this point, a coherent account of the mechanisms by which leaders are influenced by national culture has not been fully explicated. This is an important area for theory development, because better understanding of these mechanisms is required for designing interventions in cases where cultural adaptation is deemed crucial for organizational goal achievement as well as leader and employee wellbeing (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470595812452636">Agarwal et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470595812452636">Gao and Gudykunst, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1470595812452636">Newman and Nollen, 1996</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we present three potential mechanisms by which national culture may influence leadership styles. From a micro-level perspective, we propose that leaders’ personal values, being culturally patterned, produce correspondence between their leadership styles and cultural values. From a meso-level perspective, we suggest that subordinates of the same cultural background form value communities and show similar responses to different leadership behaviours. Leaders can explore subordinates’ cultural values by transforming their experiences of subordinates’ reactions and use this knowledge as a foundation for exhibiting culturally adapted behaviours. From a macro-level perspective, we argue that societal values have certain legitimating effects on organizations in a particular national setting, which influence organizational phenomena and serve to limit the behaviours of leaders in organizations. We also attempt to present an analysis of the potential link between national culture and the strength of each proposed mechanism under different cultural settings.</p><sec id="section1-1470595812452636"><title>Culture and leadership interface: A brief review of existing literature</title><p>The ongoing debate between researchers as to whether leadership is governed by universal principles or culture-dependent has led to the development of two schools of thought, i.e. a realist and a relativist school. Those who support the realist approach (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470595812452636">Bass, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470595812452636">Bolman and Deal, 1991</xref>; Kouzes and Posner, 1988) contend that, since all leaders perform similar functions, the core leadership processes should be similar, regardless of cultural differences. The realist researchers are often interested in testing US-based leadership theories and models in non-American societies to see if they are generalizable to other cultures beyond the American context. The other school of thought, which might be labelled as relativist, supports the idea of cultural differences in leadership behaviours and leadership preferences (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470595812452636">Dorfman and Howell, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470595812452636">Hofstede, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470595812452636">1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1470595812452636">House et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1470595812452636">Triandis, 1993</xref>). This stream of research results from a realization that the uncritical adaptation of management models and techniques evolved in the context of Anglo-American cultural values may not be effective in other socio-cultural environments. Researchers from this school of thought contend that all leadership behaviours may not be universally effective, rather effectiveness of such behaviours is closely associated with the national culture where leadership is enacted. This suggests that leadership styles that are linked to leader effectiveness in one country may not be equally efficacious in other national settings. The basic logic for this position is that, because national societies are different in terms of their cultural values, organizations are influenced in their strategies and practices by the cultural values of the national society to which they belong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470595812452636">Hofstede, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1470595812452636">House et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1470595812452636">Schwartz, 1994</xref>). Importantly, followers’ responses to a given leadership behaviour may be strongly dependent on their cultural values (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1470595812452636">Yan and Hunt, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Many cross-cultural studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470595812452636">Den Hartog et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1470595812452636">Offermann and Hellmann,1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1470595812452636">Pasa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1470595812452636">Ralston et al., 1997</xref>) lend credence to the latter approach by reporting differences among countries with regard to perceptions of effective leadership and use of specific leadership behaviours. Together, these studies suggest that leadership effectiveness is a function of culture and that managers need to know what constitutes effective leadership in different cultural settings. Managers who have a good cultural awareness and perform behaviours that conform to the values of a particular national culture are likely to be more effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470595812452636">Fu and Yukl, 2000</xref>). The bulk of work on the culture–leadership link, however, has focused on culture-specific perceptions and patterns of leadership behaviour without specifying the mechanisms by which the relationships are produced.</p><p>Nonetheless, there are a few studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470595812452636">Dickson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470595812452636">Fu and Yukl, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470595812452636">Hanges et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1470595812452636">House et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1470595812452636">Lord and Maher, 1991</xref>), which suggest a number of ways by means of which national culture may influence leadership behaviours. Given these studies, the need to present a holistic depiction of the processes by which national culture influences leadership styles still remains there. These studies are either follower-focused or organization-centric in their approach to studying the influence of culture on leadership behaviour and attributes. The present study is unique in the sense that it offers a comprehensive explication regarding the influence of national culture on leadership by clarifying processes that are leader, follower and organization-centric. It may have implications for leadership in local organizations, leaders in foreign subsidiaries and in organizations with culturally diverse workforces. The study attempts to contribute to the existing literature by addressing the following questions: what are the mechanisms by which cultural values lead to cultural adaptation of leadership styles; and how do cultural differences influence the strength of each potential mechanism?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470595812452636">Figure 1</xref> provides an overview of the proposed conceptual framework where leader personal values, follower values and societal values link national culture through different adaptation processes to leadership in organizations, which in turn influence leadership styles. The arc-like structure which connects three lines in this figure, represents interaction among the mechanisms. In the figure, differences in cultural values among national cultures are posited to impact the strength of proposed mechanisms.</p><fig id="fig1-1470595812452636" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Conceptual Framework of Cultural Adaptation of Leadership Styles.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1470595812452636-fig1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="section2-1470595812452636"><title>Leadership cultural adaptation and mechanisms of influence</title><p>In our development of mechanisms leading to cultural adaptation, we draw on three different literatures: literature on cultural embeddedness (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470595812452636">Hofstede, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1470595812452636">1983</xref>), experiential learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1470595812452636">Kolb, 1984</xref>) and neo-institutional theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1470595812452636">Scott, 1995</xref>). The literature on cultural embeddedness posits that, once socialized in a society, people’s identity or sense of self is largely shaped by national culture, which may be characterized by a distinct set of values. In fact, a manager’s thinking is conditioned by views and assumptions characteristic of a national culture through formal and informal socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470595812452636">Hofstede, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1470595812452636">1983</xref>), which may in turn be reflected in leader personal values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1470595812452636">Kanungo and Jaeger, 1990</xref>). Reviewing and integrating this stream of literature, we propose that managers who belong to a particular national culture develop personal values that partially reflect the native national culture. Experiential learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1470595812452636">Kolb, 1984</xref>) posits that learning occurs through transformation of experiences. Drawing from ELT, we argue that managers through experiences of reactions may learn employee values. By reflecting upon such experiences leaders may develop ideas and concepts that act as guiding maps and over time produce correspondence between their behaviours and follower values. New institutional theory contends that institutional expectations influence features and characteristics of organizations operating in a particular cultural setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470595812452636">DiMaggio and Powell, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1470595812452636">Scott, 1995</xref>). Drawing on neo-institutional theory, we argue that organizations comply with societal values and norms of acceptable behaviour to achieve legitimacy and societal approbation, which in turn influences the entire organizational phenomenon, including leadership.</p><sec id="section3-1470595812452636"><title>Personal values and leadership cultural adaptation: A value internalization perspective</title><p>Every individual attaches meaning to the self through the concept of personal identity and tends to act in furtherance of his or her own goals and desires. Personal identity underscores a sense of individual autonomy rather than adopting a group’s perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470595812452636">Hewitt, 1997</xref>). This sense of distinctiveness is, however, not simply produced by the individual’s self-definition as a unique entity different from other members of the collectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470595812452636">Gecas, 1982</xref>), rather it is constituted by the individual’s value commitments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1470595812452636">Hitlin, 2003</xref>). That is, people belonging to a social group may possess the same values, but the extent to which a particular value has been incorporated varies between individuals. Broadly speaking, personal values reflect the values of the collectivity, but ranking of specific values in terms of their importance is somewhat individualized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1470595812452636">Rokeach, 1973</xref>). For instance, people may have both self-transcendent and self-enhancement values but differ with respect to the degree of priority placed on each of the values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470595812452636">Fu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>As a function of such interpersonal variance in the ranking of values, individuals tend to differ in their actions and behaviours that may be value consistent. Individual values thus serve as the basic constituents that may determine a person’s self construal or sense of personal identity. But an individual’s self-concept that he or she experiences as unique and distinct is socially patterned through his/her personal values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1470595812452636">Hitlin, 2003</xref>). As argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1470595812452636">Hitlin (2003</xref>: 121), an individual’s personal values, which form his/her sense of uniqueness, keep the self connected with social structure as ‘values develop in social contexts and draw on culturally significant symbolic material’, and in their developmental process they are subject to social patterning and communication. Any attempt to grasp the notion of self-construal or individual identity without tracing its social link, therefore, neglects the fact that personal idiosyncrasies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1470595812452636">Turner et al., 1987</xref>) are not easy to understand unless social definitions are used as a lens to observe and interpret them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470595812452636">Deaux, 1996</xref>).</p><p>This suggests that values that are seen as personally important are not only a product of individuals’ distinct make-up; rather, through socialization processes individuals tend to internalize socially desirable values, which may become part of the repertoire of one’s personal value preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470595812452636">Allport, 1955</xref>). This is apparent from the fact that some value commonality may be evidenced among members of each national society. Individuals in every society are exposed to the same institutional structures and governmental systems, which give rise to societal norms and practices that reflect some degree of cultural value similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1470595812452636">Sagiv and Schwartz, 2007</xref>). Thus, people in some countries may be, on average, higher on a certain value type than people in other countries due to systematic differences in the cultural structure (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470595812452636">Gatignon et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1470595812452636">Markus and Kitayama (1991</xref>) argue that culture influences the people’s perceptions of themselves, others and the relationship of self with others. For instance, people from individualist cultures tend to attach greater importance to personal agendas and individual autonomy over the welfare of collectivity and their interdependence with their social unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470595812452636">Hofstede, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1470595812452636">Schwartz, 1999</xref>). In collectivist cultures, people tend to put group welfare ahead of individual interests, and their sense of self is largely shaped by their embeddedness in the collectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470595812452636">Hofstede, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1470595812452636">Markus and Kitayama, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1470595812452636">Schwartz, 1999</xref>). As result of exposure to views and assumptions specific to a national culture and different means of socialization, people belonging to collectivist and individualist cultures may develop collectivist and individualist values respectively as distinct patterns of psychological tendencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1470595812452636">Markus and Kitayama, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1470595812452636">Triandis, 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1470595812452636">Triandis (1989</xref>) argues that the values that reflect individualist orientation, i.e. personal autonomy and welfare, tend to characterize people from individualist cultures, while the values that reflect pro-social behaviour, such as emphasizing a group purpose, are likely to be associated with individuals belonging to nations that predominantly espouse collectivist values.</p><p>From a leadership perspective, values which leaders judge as personally important are partly shaped by the predominant values in the national society, and tend to act as an inner locus of control on choice and display of culturally correspondent behaviours (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1470595812452636">Kanungo and Jaeger, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1470595812452636">Kanungo et al., 1999</xref>). In fact, as a result of socialization to a different set of cultural values, managers assimilate social meanings and assumptions into their individual values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1470595812452636">Van Maanen and Laurent, 1993</xref>) and carry this influence into their leadership roles and responsibilities (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470595812452636">Geletkanycz, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1470595812452636">Schneider and DeMeyer, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1470595812452636">Shane, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1470595812452636">Van Maanen and Laurent, 1993</xref>).</p><p>The foregoing discussion lends credence to Hofstede’s (1980, 1983) argument that cultural values serve as mental programmes for all societal members and the influence of this programming reaches every individual through means of socialization. This brings about deep social patterning of managers’ personal values as these values in their development are deeply influenced by national culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470595812452636">England, 1975</xref>). Thus, managers native to a national culture do not simply extract legitimacy from the cultural environment, rather culture deeply interpenetrates in their individual values (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1470595812452636">Kanungo and Jaeger, 1990</xref>). That is why their actions and decisions are largely constructed by the same value system that determines reactions of the target subordinates.

Values influence people’s perceptions and interpretation of different situations, which resultantly makes certain objects, events or activities and probable outcomes attractive for observers, while certain others are less attractive or even aversive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470595812452636">Feather, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470595812452636">1992</xref>). Based on this definition of values, it is expected that an employee’s construal of leadership behaviours and management practices as attractive or aversive may in part depend on his/her values. However, individuals hold different values and give prominence to certain values over others, which actually influence an individual’s interpretation of a situation and lead them to act in a value-consistent way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1470595812452636">Verplanken and Holland, 2002</xref>). Managerial and motivational practices may be differently viewed as negatively or positively valent by followers holding different sets of values. For example, people holding self-enhancement values will positively evaluate managerial practices that provide opportunities for individual accomplishments. People driven by self-transcendent values, on the other hand, will experience enhancement when certain leader behaviours promote collective welfare and success. Importance of these two values to varying degrees for different employees makes it possible to predict follower reactions to different leadership behaviours (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470595812452636">Fu et al., 2010</xref>). Logically, it may be expected that subordinates who hold a high level of self-enhancement values will react negatively to leaders who contribute to collective goals.</p><p>A number of prior studies show strong evidence for the notion that values play an important role in shaping organizational members’ reactions to different events they encounter at their workplace. As evidenced by many empirical works, values have been found to be related to organizational commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470595812452636">Glazer et al., 2004</xref>), self-efficacy and high performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470595812452636">Earley, 1994</xref>), job involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470595812452636">Brockner et al., 1988</xref>), prosocial behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1470595812452636">McNeely and Meglino, 1994</xref>) and cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1470595812452636">Wanger, 1995</xref>). The findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1470595812452636">Jung and Avolio’s (2000)</xref> study showed that individual values mediated the effects of transactional and transformational leadership on performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1470595812452636">Probst and Lawler (2006</xref>) in their study found that cultural values of employees moderated their reactions to organizational announcements of downsizing and employee layoff.</p><p>Values can be used as a powerful lens for predicting employee reactions to leadership and management practices and developing behaviours that are closely adapted to employee values. However, for such adaptation there should be some value commonality across individual organizational members. In the absence of such commonality, each organizational member’s reactions would have to be understood independently and an adaptation to values would mean adaptation of leader behaviours to individual organizational members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1470595812452636">Lines, 2006</xref>). National culture, being a community of values for its members, serves as a strong homologizer of individual values. As noted earlier, the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470595812452636">Hofstede (1980</xref>) suggests four dimensions of national culture along which members of a particular society show substantial commonality in their values. Empirical research strongly supports that reactions of organizational members to management initiatives and practices differ across national cultures in ways predicted by differences in cultural values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1470595812452636">Kirkman and Shapiro, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1470595812452636">Probst and Lawler, 2006</xref>). Practically speaking, then, in order to enhance acceptance or reduce resistance to various managerial approaches in different cultural settings, managers should develop knowledge of those potential sources that may relate to followers’ acceptance or resistance to certain leadership behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1470595812452636">Kirkman and Shapiro, 1997</xref>). This suggests that managers not only need to observe how subordinates react but also discover the underlying sources of followers’ reactions. Clearly, followers’ values are not inscribed on their faces, however, given time, managers as ardent observers may learn the true values that followers hold.</p><p>Traditional concepts of leadership have focused on how leaders create value mediated by one-way processes by which followers are influenced to work differently or harder in the pursuit of organizational goals. For example, transactional leaders influence followers by offering rewards in exchange for performance driving behaviours. Transformational leaders exert influence on followers by providing a compelling vision of the future along with a new set of values, presumably seen as attractive also for followers, leading to the enactment of behaviours in the pursuit of leaders’ visions and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470595812452636">Bass and Riggio, 2006</xref>). We argue that these concepts do not sufficiently allow for an active role played by followers in the leader–follower relationship. Rather than presenting followers as passive stimulus-response puppets, we argue that follower characteristics represented by their value systems make up an important facet of the context in which leadership behaviours are enacted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1470595812452636">Rubin et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, the effectiveness of a particular leadership behaviour is highly dependent on how it is viewed by followers using values as criteria for assessing its appropriateness. Hence, we see leaders’ learning about and adaptation to followers’ values as crucial processes underlying effective leadership.</p><p>ELT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1470595812452636">Kolb, 1984</xref>) offers a theoretical framework that could immensely help our understanding of how managers learn followers’ values and use that knowledge as a foundation to make behavioural adjustments. ELT defines learning as ‘the process whereby knowledge results from the combination of grasping and transforming experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1470595812452636">Kolb, 1984</xref>: 41). The theory suggests a learning cycle comprising four learning modes through which experiences can be grasped and transformed, resulting in creation of new knowledge. ELT juxtaposes concrete experience and abstract conceptualization as learning approaches to grasp experience and posits that experience may be transformed through learning modes of reflective observation and active experimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1470595812452636">Kolb, 1984</xref>). People engaged in learning tend to develop four basic learning styles, i.e. diverging, assimilating, converging, and accommodating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1470595812452636">Joy and Kolb, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1470595812452636">Kolb and Kolb, 2005</xref>), but in an idealized learning loop, they may touch all the modes in the learning cycle. That is, they create knowledge through being involved in an experience of tangible reality which provides a basis for reflections. By integrating and distilling those reflections, ideas and abstract concepts are developed which may serve as potential implications for further actions and decisions, and upon putting them into use they may lead to creation of new experiences.</p><p>While managing employees in organizations, managers may frequently get involved in concrete experiences, may engage in reflecting on those experiences, analyse them logically and develop abstract concepts that may serve as guiding maps to adopt different patterns of behaviour for employees holding different cultural values. We suggest that the underlying mechanism for this correspondence is a learning process by which leaders experiment with different leadership behaviours, and based on the observation of follower responses, they gradually develop implicit theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1470595812452636">Kolb, 1984</xref>) of followers’ value systems. Subsequently, leaders are likely to develop behavioural alternatives presumed to be consistent with the content of these value systems, enact these behaviours and observe follower responses anew. The leaders’ experiential learning may gradually lead to more accurate mental models of the underlying value systems of followers and tend to produce correspondence between leadership styles and follower cultural values.</p><p>Consequently we suggest the following proposition:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>P2: The influence of follower values will produce correspondence between leadership styles and cultural values.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="section5-1470595812452636"><title>Societal values and leadership cultural adaptation: An institutional perspective</title><p>Organizations have to conform to normative, cognitive and regulatory domains of a country’s institutional environment to seek legitimacy from the society in which they operate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1470595812452636">Scott, 1995</xref>).

The existence of hierarchies in the family system (e.g. between older and younger members), in education systems (between teachers and students) and in informal and formal organizations (between subordinates and superiors) indicate large power differences and inequalities between people. The people who are located at lower hierarchical levels are supposed to subjugate their own ideas and opinions to those of the people who are incumbents of the upper echelons in the hierarchical structure. For instance, in such cultures children, students and subordinates are generally expected to show obedience to parents, teachers and superiors respectively (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470595812452636">Hofstede, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1470595812452636">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1470595812452636">Ralston et al., 1997</xref>), and expressing any candid differences of opinion are considered as tantamount to disrespect. Contrarily, in low power distance societies inequalities among members are not emphasized as there is less acceptance of vertical structures. Because hierarchies are less valued in such societies, people tend to recognize each other as moral equals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470595812452636">Booysen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1470595812452636">Sagiv and Schwartz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1470595812452636">Yan and Hunt, 2005</xref>).

This implies that, for leaders’ culturally non-adapted behaviours, value-based communities are predicted to develop more frequently among employees of high collectivist societies, revealing their values to leaders through negative responses.</p></sec><sec id="section15-1470595812452636"><title>Power distance (PD)</title><p>In high PD cultures, the status of leaders in organizations is legitimized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1470595812452636">Schwartz, 1999</xref>)<bold> </bold>and in view of the perceived legitimacy linked to leadership positions, it is expected that followers will accept managerial actions even in the absence of perceived value congruence.

On the other hand, employees from low PD cultures participate in decision-making and have access to information which enables them to predict the likely consequences of various managerial actions.

They tend to build cordial relations and avoid behaviours that lead to confrontational situations with others. Thus, followers of masculine cultures may readily and strongly react against leader behaviours that hinder material success and do not foster a competitive and ambitious environment.

Leaders in such societies are regarded as being more knowledgeable and able to assume the responsibility of providing guidance and making decisions for their subordinates. Contrarily, in low paternalistic cultures, followers tend to be cautious about separation of official and private life. They evaluate managers on the basis of how they perform in their official life rather than making appraisals based on managers’ personal interest in followers’ off-the-job activities.

Thus, to better understand a collectivist culture one not only needs to know the regulatory domain of a country but also correctly interpret the deep and complex structures of the cognitive and normative institutional elements. As argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1470595812452636">Kostova and Zaheer (1999</xref>), the cognitive and normative domains are harder to observe, understand and interpret correctly than the regulatory domain of a country’s institutional environment, foreign subsidiaries may be at a disadvantage in establishing legitimacy in the host culture until they correctly explore and interpret the complex web of cognitive and normative institutional elements. For instance, Cargill, a famous multinational company, could not thrive in the Indian market and finally had to retreat, not due to regulatory requirements but for paying negligible heed to the Indian norms and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1470595812452636">Kostova and Zaheer, 1999</xref>).

The desire for autonomy rooted in freedom and independence may lead to the poor development and perpetuation of socially accepted norms and traditions, hence social behaviour is likely to be mainly regulated and determined by laws and legal enactments. This suggests that societal values in collectivist cultures will put greater demands on organizations to closely adapt their practices to the host culture to establish and maintain legitimacy.</p></sec><sec id="section21-1470595812452636"><title>Power distance (PD)</title><p>High PD societies support adherence to established standards in social interactions.

The primary focus of organizations on high material success place them in a situation of fierce competition, and organizations, whose strategies and goals are not geared towards high economic gains may find their survival at risk.

Organizations in feminine cultures, being not solely driven by the agendas of economic growth, may carry out their operations in a considerably less competitive environment.

Societal laws in such cultures influence organizations to adopt management practices that reflect paternalistic characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1470595812452636">Martinez and Dorfman, 1998</xref>). For instance, in Turkey, when an employee loses his job, the employer pays a reasonable amount to its outgoing worker, keeping in view the probability of post-severance economic problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1470595812452636">Pellegrini and Scandura, 2008</xref>). In such societies, benevolent practices in organizations primarily develop in response to strong cultural support. Contrarily, lack of humane orientation in low paternalistic cultures renders social relationships contractual and transactional. In cultures with low humane (paternalistic) values, state structures might fill this gap by securing the social and economic needs of its people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1470595812452636">House et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, organizations operating in high paternalistic cultures need to respond to cognitive, normative and regulatory elements, while in low paternalistic cultures the pressure may only emanate from the regulatory domain. This suggests that in high paternalistic cultures organizations may face multiple institutional pressures to adapt to the host culture to establish and maintain legitimacy. Based on this analysis we propose the following:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>P6: Societal values may influence managers’ display of culturally correspondent leadership styles via a process of external regulation, such that the relationship is likely to be stronger when a culture is high on collectivist, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity and paternalistic values.</p></list-item></list><p>The three proposed mechanisms can operate independently, but it is not unlikely that they closely interact with one another. The influence of mechanisms is likely to be parallel or they may interact with one another in a complex way. For example, high intensity influence exerted by societal values may strengthen influence produced by leader personal values, because leaders in such cultures tend to be in a permanent state of conforming to the modes of behaviour that have wider social acceptance, which may lead to increased social patterning of leader personal values. On the other hand, in a society where subordinate values are likely to exert greater influence on leadership adaptation, influence of leader personal values on adaptive behaviours may be less vigorous. The underlying rationale is that when follower reactions to leadership behaviours are evident, leaders may exert effort to learn the underlying values for those reactions. As a result, new information related to follower values is assimilated into leaders’ existing cognitive structures. When leaders frequently observe follower reactions, they tend to develop more accurate knowledge structures of follower values (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1470595812452636">Payne et al., 1993</xref>). Development of refined cognitive elements of follower values may take leaders away from the use of pre-existing categories and beliefs for understanding a situation (e.g. follower reactions). Thus, leadership styles in such cultural settings are less likely to be produced by stored scripts for behaviour.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section25-1470595812452636"><title>National cultures and strength of mechanisms</title><p>Our discussion so far explicates the way a single cultural dimension may influence the strength of proposed mechanisms, but to diagnose the vigour of each mechanism in a national setting the intensity of all cultural dimensions needs to be determined. This is for the reason that all national cultures embody multidimensional characteristics and each cultural dimension may be high, low or moderate in terms of its intensity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1470595812452636">Yan and Hunt, 2005</xref>). For instance, we earlier suggested that the influence of leader personal values on culturally adapted behaviours will be stronger in cultures high on collectivist, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, femininity and paternalistic values, but interestingly the value constellation of many national cultures may not fit exactly in the proposed order. There are only a few societies which typify all these characteristics, there are certain other cultures which are either high or low on majority of the above dimensions, or present a midway pattern by being high on some dimensions and low on certain others. For instance, Turkey shows consistently high ranking on Hofstede’s (1980) cultural dimensions, and as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1470595812452636">Pellegrini and Scandura (2008</xref>), Turkish culture is also characterized by high paternalism. China, in addition to showing high paternalistic values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1470595812452636">Kim, 1994</xref>), also ranks high on power distance and collectivism. Conversely, US ranks low on all of the cultural dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470595812452636">Hofstede, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1470595812452636">Northouse, 1997</xref>). The intensity of influence enacted by leader personal values, subordinate values or societal values may range from very high to very low for a culture, depending upon whether cultural dimensions have parallel effects, neutralize or weaken the influence of other value dimensions as per our proposed pattern.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1470595812452636">Table 1</xref>, we present a map regarding the predicted strength of each potential mechanism in different cultures, which reflects the joint influence of cultural dimensions. For example, cultural setting 1 is typical of Turkish cultural values (collectivism, high PD, UA, femininity and paternalism), where influence of leader personal values is assumed to be very high, influence of follower values is predicted to be moderately low and influence of societal values is anticipated to be high. The main mechanism of influence on adaptation of leadership in a cultural scenario like that of Turkey is, therefore, assumed to be through leader personal values. Cultural setting 6 is a representation of US culture (individualism, low PD and UA, low femininity and low paternalism), where major influence on leadership adaptation is presumed to emanate from follower values. Scenario 20 represents Chinese culture (collectivism, high PD, low UA, low femininity and high paternalism) and the strength of both personal values and societal values on leadership cultural adaptation is anticipated to be moderately high, while the influence stemming from follower values is predicted to be moderately low, which implies that in China follower reactions would have a negligible role in leadership adaptation.</p><table-wrap id="table1-1470595812452636" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Anticipated strength of proposed mechanisms in different national cultures.</p></caption><graphic alternate-form-of="table1-1470595812452636" xlink:href="10.1177_1470595812452636-table1.tif"/><table><thead><tr><th>Cultural setting</th><th>Collectivism</th><th>Power distance</th><th>Uncertainty avoidance</th><th>Femininity</th><th>Paternalism</th><th>Influence of personal values</th><th>Influence of follower values</th><th>Influence of societal values</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table-fn1-1470595812452636"><p>1 = very high, 2 = high, 3 = moderately high, 4 = moderately low, 5 = low, 6 = very low.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec id="section26-1470595812452636"><title>Study limitations, directions for future research and practical implications</title><sec id="section27-1470595812452636"><title>Study limitations and directions for future research</title><p>Prior research on the link between cultural values and leadership styles has mainly focused on the culture and leadership interface without clearly spelling-out the mechanisms by which the cultural influence is enacted. This paper fills the existing gap in the culture–leadership relationship literature and forms a foundation for empirical research: first, by exploring the potential mechanisms which may lead to cultural adaptation of leadership styles; and secondly, by conceptualizing the moderating effects of cultural dimensions on the strength of each potential mechanism.</p><p>Although our study offers deep theoretical and practical insights on leadership cultural adaptation, nonetheless a number of factors may limit the generalizability of our model in a cross-cultural setting. First, the study mainly focuses on moderation by national culture from a unidimensional perspective, and does not develop clear propositions regarding the strength of each potential mechanism after conceptualizing the net effect of all cultural dimensions, which may limit future testability of the model. Another limitation of this study is that it offers a brief description of interaction between the proposed mechanisms that provides partial clarification as to which mechanism will actually have influence on leadership adaptation in a cultural setting. Furthermore, the study does not include any discussion on moderating effects of organizational-level and individual-level factors such as organizational culture and leader’s education and age on the relationship between cultural values and leader culturally adaptive behaviours.</p><p>To better understand the process of cultural adaptation of leadership behaviours, future research in the first place, may examine the potential contribution of each mechanism by investigating the effects of leaders’ personal values, subordinates’ values and societal values. Second, research might determine if each of the proposed mechanisms is equally active in every national culture irrespective of a specific culture’s value constellation, or the strength of each mechanism is enhanced or diminished when certain value dimensions are high or low in a cultural setting. Relatedly, it would be interesting to discover if each mechanism operates independently or may influence and, in turn, be influenced by other potential mechanisms. The need is then to explore if the intensity of a value system is associated with specific leadership styles and such leadership styles are in turn related to follower performance outcomes. It would be equally useful to understand the relation of different value dimensions in each value system to certain leadership styles and the way such leadership styles are related to leader effectiveness.</p><p>Third and finally, the moderating effects of organizational culture and leader’s education and age on the relationship between cultural values and leader culturally adaptive behaviours need to be examined. Research may determine if the national culture and culture of the domestic firms is characterized by the same value dimensions. Relatedly, it would be exciting to find out if non-resident companies tend to maintain the same values of their home cultures, or such organizations differ in their inclination or capability to adopt the cultural value system of the host country. It is further warranted to discover whether the strong organizational culture of a foreign subsidiary, characterized by the home national values, exerts a negative influence on the adoption of local cultural values. Future research may indicate whether local managers employed by ethnocentric organizations (organizations with values strongly rooted in the home country) are acculturated to the leadership behaviours preferred by such organizations, and whether such socialization weakens the congruence effects between national culture and their leadership styles.</p><p>The constructs in our proposed model can be measured using existing instruments and measurement approaches. For instance, leaders’ individual, follower and societal values can be assessed by asking participants to indicate which values are personally important to them, which values are strongly endorsed by most members of their respective group of followers and what is their perception about endorsement of a certain value by an average member of their national society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470595812452636">Fischer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1470595812452636">Wan et al., 2007</xref>). To measure values at three different levels, the same value survey can be used. Internalization of cultural values may be assessed by asking respondents to rate each item on a certain value type with regards to its importance as a source of intrinsic motivation in one’s life. External regulation can be measured by eliciting participants’ perceptions of importance of a value dimension in terms of the associated societal rewards or punishment, and approval of a cultural group for valuing a certain cultural dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470595812452636">Chirkov et al., 2003</xref>). It is, however, important to note that this study has included paternalism as a separate cultural dimension, which has mainly been tested in eastern cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1470595812452636">Redding et al., 1994</xref>) that concurrently possess high power distance values. Our theoretical model, therefore, needs to be carefully tested in cultural settings, where earlier research on cultural values lacks sufficient evidence regarding paternalism as an independent cultural dimension.</p></sec><sec id="section28-1470595812452636"><title>Implications for managerial leaders</title><p>Our discussion of leadership adaptability to the national culture has significant practical implications for managers. First and foremost, managers should recognize that the manner in which followers react to different managerial approaches is related to their cultural values. Managers should therefore develop sufficient knowledge of follower cultural values to gain important insights into why different leader behaviours garner diverse responses from subordinates. Managers enacting leadership and implementing human resource strategies may improve their effectiveness if they, as ardent observers, understand and interpret follower reactions and explore underlying values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1470595812452636">Lines, 2006</xref>). Knowledge of follower values may be used for predicting reactions to changes in leadership behaviours and for developing strategies and approaches that may gain follower acceptance, and even turn out to be stimulating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1470595812452636">Lines, 2006</xref>). One specific implication in this regard is that in cultures where subordinates are not likely to reveal their values through vehement reactions silence does not imply that such employees are satisfied with deviant leader behaviours. Their reactions may rather be implicit and deviant behaviours may have a negative impact on their performance. This may warrant leaders closely scrutinizing employee responses by determining which managerial strategies are likely to be better received and which might adversely impact such groups of employees.</p><p>Another practical recommendation for managers and organizations is that to achieve and establish legitimacy in a cultural setting, specifically in cultures where influence intensity springing from societal values is high, all institutional domains in a national environment need to be monitored to explore deep structures of cultural values. The effort may appear easy but is more challenging as normative and cognitive elements are less visible and less explicit than their regulatory counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1470595812452636">Kostova and Zaheer, 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section29-1470595812452636"><title>Implications for recruitment and selection of leaders</title><p>This study offers a number of implications for recruitment and selection of managers in different cultures. Our theoretical model and table can be used to find out which mechanism or mechanisms operate with greater or lesser influence in a specific culture. Once the relative strength of each potential mechanism is determined in a particular country, specific strategies regarding recruitment, selection and training of managers may be introduced and implemented. For instance, in a culture where influence of personal values is assumed to be low and the strength of societal values is not high either, i.e. cultural scenarios 5, 6, 10 and 11, individuals are likely to have different values than those of average people in the society. In such a cultural setting, at the time of recruiting and selecting managers, people need to be assessed for their values to see the degree of their compatibility with the cultural values of that country, in addition to making assessments for skills and competence. Conversely, in cultures with high influence strength of personal values and/or societal values, emphasis in selection should be on skills rather than on cultural values. Potential managers in such cultures are likely to have values closely aligned with those of the average person in society, or they may exhibit socially approved behaviours in the face of intense social pressures and expectations. Foreign companies operating in such countries should preferably recruit local managers rather than assigning many leadership positions to expatriate managers.</p><p>In cultures where high influence is likely to emanate from follower values, for selection as managers, people should be tested for cognitive and behavioural complexity because they are likely to be frequently involved in framing and reframing of behaviours in the face of subordinate reactions. Managers in such cultures need to be exposed to multi-frame leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470595812452636">Bolman and Deal, 1991</xref>) development programmes to enable them to see follower reactions through different lenses and integrate them into logically sound conceptualizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1470595812452636">Kolb,
