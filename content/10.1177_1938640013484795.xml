<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to prospectively compare preoperative findings on musculoskeletal ultrasound evaluation to observed intraoperative findings for patients undergoing surgical correction of plantar plate tears. Fifty consecutive patients with forefoot pain and a suspected unilateral plantar plate tear at the second metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint were identified. The same examiner performed a 2-plane (longitudinal and transverse) musculoskeletal ultrasound on the painful second MTP joint. The contralateral second MTP joint was used for comparison. Longitudinal ultrasound images were graded as “torn” or “intact.” Transverse ultrasound images were used to localize the suspected pathology. Results of the ultrasound were compared with observed intraoperative pathology. Forty-five plantar plate tears were identified intraoperatively. Longitudinal ultrasound images correctly identified 40 plantar plate tears. The longitudinal ultrasound had a sensitivity of 91.1%, a specificity of 25%, a positive predictive value of 91.1%, and a negative predictive value of 25%. Transverse ultrasound images identified 36 plantar plate tears correctly localizing only 19 tears. Musculoskeletal ultrasound has been widely used to identify and localize pathology in many soft tissue structures. Whereas the longitudinal ultrasound images were useful in identifying plantar plate tears, the same cannot be said about the ability to localize the tear on the transverse ultrasound images. Therefore, ultrasound may not be as good an imaging modality as magnetic resonance imaging for identification and localization of plantar plate pathology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plantar plate pathology has become more commonly recognized as a cause of forefoot pain and deformity. The plantar plate is a broad, thick, trapezoidal to heart-shaped ligamentous structure that spans the plantar aspect of the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640013484795">1</xref></sup> Composed primarily of type 1 collagen, the dorsal aspect of the plantar plate forms the firm, distal attachment to the proximal phalanx via medial and lateral longitudinal bundles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640013484795">2</xref></sup> The plantar aspect of the plantar plate’s collagen bundles are arranged transversely, forming lateral attachments to the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640013484795">2</xref></sup> The more mobile, proximal attachment of the plantar plate blends with the capsular tissue of the lesser MTP joint and the periosteum of the lesser metatarsal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640013484795">2</xref></sup> A longitudinal section of a second MTP joint can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640013484795">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>The Normal Ultrasound Appearance of the Plantar Plate</title>
<p>On the longitudinal image, the plantar plate is a slightly echoic band with a grainy but homogenous appearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484795">3</xref></sup> extending from the proximal insertion on the plantar aspect of the distal metatarsal shaft to the base of the proximal phalanx. A relaxed position of the foot will show a curvilinear structure adjacent to the metatarsal head. Dorsiflexion of the toe causes the curvilinear structure to become more taut.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484795">3</xref></sup> The change of the plantar plate with movement of the MTP joint allows for dynamic evaluation of plantar plate integrity.</p>
<p>The flexor tendon overlies the plantar plate on the longitudinal view. This tendon has a fibrillar echotexture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484795">3</xref></sup> that is distinct and separate from the plantar plate. Sagittal plane movement of the lesser digit will reveal the plantar plate becoming more taut while the flexor tendon has a gliding motion. Normal longitudinal ultrasound of the plantar plate can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938640013484795">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>On the short axis (or transverse plane) images, the plantar plate shows a curvilinear, slightly echoic and more mottled structure overlying the metatarsal head with less delineated and more subtle borders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484795">3</xref></sup> The plantar plate is more mottled in this view because of the nature of the longitudinal collagen bundles that form the dorsal two thirds of this structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484795">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640013484795">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The flexor tendons can be seen adjacent to the plantar plate on the transverse section as well. Ovoid in nature and more echoic than the plantar plate, the long flexor tendon rests closest to the metatarsal head whereas the short flexor tendon is farther from the metatarsal head.

<title>Abnormal Ultrasound Appearance of the Plantar Plate</title>
<p>Abnormal appearance of the plantar plate can have a few different characteristics. Loss of homogenous appearance can occur where normal echoic tissue is replaced with focal hypoechoic defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484795">3</xref></sup> The plantar plate is most likely to tear at the distal insertion (base of the proximal phalanx), therefore, a defect in this area would suggest a tear. Similarly, if the plantar plate appears intact but there is a defect noted with dorsiflexion of the digit, a plantar plate tear may be present.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484795">3</xref></sup> Vascularity present in the region may suggest inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484795">3</xref></sup> and the presence of fibrosis may alter the appearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484795">3</xref></sup> or the thickness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640013484795">5</xref></sup> of the plantar plate and the surrounding tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484795">3</xref></sup> Similarly, tendonosis or tenosynovitis can increase the aechoic region surrounding the tendon sheath with loss of sharpness of the edges of tendons and surrounding osseous structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484795">3</xref></sup> Pathology of the plantar plate can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1938640013484795">Figure 4</xref>.</p>

<p>Previous literature has shown that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be as accurate at 95% for imaging tears of the plantar plate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640013484795">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640013484795">7</xref></sup> and MRIs are frequently ordered to assess this structure. However, MRI is a costly imaging modality. Therefore, less costly imaging modalities have been investigated for detection of plantar plate pathology. In the few studies present in the literature investigating ultrasound as an imaging modality for the plantar plate, the plantar plate was not routinely inspected on intraoperative exam for all of the patients enrolled in the study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640013484795">6</xref></sup> Therefore, the purpose of this study is to prospectively investigate the ability of the musculoskeletal ultrasound to both identify and localize the presence of plantar plate pathology utilizing intraoperative examination as the standard of reference.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Fifty consecutive patients with unilateral forefoot pain scheduled for surgical intervention were included in this study. Without knowledge of the surgical intervention scheduled, one examiner (reconstructive foot and ankle fellow) performed all ultrasound exams. This examiner was blinded to clinical exam findings, radiographic exam findings, and MRI results for all included patients.</p>
<p>All ultrasound examinations were conducted by the same examiner in 2 planes using a Sonosite M-turbo ultrasound (Sonosite, Inc, Bothell, WA) and a linear 15-6 MHz transducer.</p>
<p>The longitudinal ultrasound images were used to identify whether a tear was present or “tear accuracy.” This image answered the question “<italic>Is</italic> the plantar plate torn?” As such, images were graded as either intact or ruptured.</p>
<p>Transverse ultrasound images were used for “localization pathology” or the ability of the ultrasound to correctly show and the examiner to correctly read the location of the tear. This ultrasound image answered the question “<italic>Where</italic> is the plantar plate torn?” Images were graded as intact, partial medial rupture, partial lateral rupture, complete rupture, or unable to identify location.</p>
<p>The read of the ultrasound examination was then compared to the intraoperative exam findings. The method of surgical repair is beyond the scope of this article. The technique and outcomes have been reported elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640013484795">8</xref></sup> Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, negative predictive values, and overall accuracy were calculated.</p>

<title>Tear Accuracy</title>
<p>Tear accuracy was defined as the ability of the ultrasound to accurately identify that a defect in the plantar plate was present. This was calculated from the longitudinal ultrasound images being graded as “intact” or “ruptured.” Forty-five longitudinal ultrasound images were graded as “ruptured” and 41 of these were found to actually be ruptured on intraoperative examination. Five longitudinal ultrasound images were read as intact; however, 4 of these were found to be ruptured on intraoperative examination.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The plantar plate has historically been a difficult structure to image. Plain radiographs can identify local, traumatic or systemic pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis, Friedberg’s infarction, fracture, infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640013484795">5</xref></sup> Plain radiographs will be able to identify underlying problems and deformities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640013484795">10</xref></sup>; however, radiographs will not be able to identify plantar plate pathology as the plantar plate is a soft tissue structure that is better imaged with soft tissue imaging modalities.</p>
<p>Initial attempts at plantar plate imaging included the use of arthrography.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640013484795">11</xref></sup> A positive plantar plate tear has been defined as extravasation of the contrast into areas adjacent to the plantar plate (ie, flexor tendon sheath).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640013484795">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640013484795">12</xref></sup> A study of 58 patients found that joint arthrography was abnormal preoperatively in patients found to have plantar plate tears intraoperatively. Post operative arthrography lacked the extravasation of the contrast dye seen preoperatively, with the lesser MTP joint demonstrating a more normalized appearance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640013484795">11</xref></sup> Arthrography, however, is invasive and results of the study can be obscured if the contrast is not adequately placed in the lesser MTP joint.</p>
<p>More recently, MRI has come to the forefront as a way to image the plantar plate and was thought to be better than arthrography for detection of plantar plate tears if a small coil was used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640013484795">12</xref></sup> An early study found a focal hyperintense signal in 8 of 13 patients where plantar plate ruptures were suspected. These ruptures were confirmed on all 5 patients who elected to have surgery for this problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640013484795">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most recently, MRI has been found to be both a highly sensitive and a highly specific modality for imaging of the plantar plate. This study included the use of a metatarsal planar reconstruction image and using 0.2-mm cuts through the metatarsal and was able to highlight the plantar plate. Preoperative MRIs, done without contrast, were obtained in 45 patients. Of the 45 patients included in this study, 39 were read as torn whereas 6 were read as intact. Of the 39 read at torn, all 39 were confirmed as torn on intraoperative examination. Of the 6 read as intact on MRI, 4 were confirmed as intact whereas 2 were found to be torn. This particular MR protocol was found to be 96% accurate with 95% sensitivity and 100% specificity with a positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 67%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640013484795">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although MRI has clearly become a good imaging modality for the plantar plate, it is a costly exam that can be uncomfortable for the patient, particularly if an extremity coil or an open machine is not available. Therefore, musculoskeletal ultrasound has been investigated as a potential alternative for imaging when MRI is unavailable, medically contraindicated, too costly, or unacceptable to the patient.</p>
<p>Sparse evidence exists on the correlation of plantar plate pathology and musculoskeletal ultrasound in the current scientific literature. A 2006 cadaveric study aimed to correlate MRI and ultrasound imaging with histology on 6 soft embalmed cadavers (24 plantar plates).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640013484795">14</xref></sup> MRI and ultrasound images were obtained prior to dissection and sampling for histology. Twenty-three plantar plate tears were found on direct inspection. Ultrasound detected 23 tears whereas MRI detected 22 tears. Ultrasound and MRI both falsely reported one tear and MRI failed to detect one tear. Ultrasound was found to have a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 0%, a positive predictive value of 96%, and a negative predictive value of 0%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640013484795">14</xref></sup> The overall accuracy of ultrasound in this study was found to be 96%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640013484795">14</xref></sup> MRI was found to have a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 0%, a positive predictive value of 96%, and a negative predictive value of 0%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640013484795">14</xref></sup> MRI was found to have an overall accuracy of 92%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640013484795">14</xref></sup> The authors concluded that ultrasound was better able to identify and evaluate the plantar plate, particularly in deformed toes as the ultrasound probe can be moved easily to study the anatomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640013484795">14</xref></sup> In contrast, MRI typically cannot do this.</p>
<p>A 2006 prospective study compared the ability of ultrasound and MRI to detect plantar plate pathology in both symptomatic and asymptomatic feet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640013484795">6</xref></sup> Ultrasound detected 75/160 and 139/160 torn plantar plates in the asymptomatic and symptomatic feet, respectively. This translated to a sensitivity of 96% with poor specificity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640013484795">6</xref></sup> Intraoperative exam was performed on a small number of patients in this study. The authors statistically demonstrated that MRI had only fair correlation with intraoperative findings, longitudinal ultrasound images correlated moderately with intraoperative findings and transverse ultrasound had a higher correlation with intraoperative findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640013484795">6</xref></sup> These findings suggested that ultrasound had a higher resolution than MRI for imaging of the plantar plate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640013484795">6</xref></sup> However, it should be noted that the correlation to intraoperative findings were only available for 10 of the 160 metatarsals involved, a weakness of this study’s design.</p>
<p>This study adds to the current literature by imaging 50 patients suspected to have plantar plate pathology prospectively and preoperatively. All patients were able to have the plantar plate inspected and graded<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640013484795">9</xref></sup> in the operating room. Ultrasound is an efficient preoperative imaging modality and the ability to detect the presence of pathology of the plantar plate preoperatively was fairly high. However, the ability to localize the pathology was very low leaving this modality with a fairly low accuracy rating.</p>
<p>The strengths of this study include the prospective study design and the use of intraoperative examination as the standard of reference. The weakness of this study, however, is the inability to compare sonographic images of asymptomatic regions to the intraoperative examination of this region, as that is highly unethical.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Ultrasound is a potential alternative to the MRI for imaging of the plantar plate. There have been reports of ultrasound being the superior imaging modality for this structure; however, the current study suggests a low accuracy for sonographc evaluation. Ultrasound can be quick, easy, and without the concern for potential claustrophobia during the exam; however, ultrasound is highly dependent on the technician with the best sonographic images being captured by a technician who is highly skilled and who understands the anatomy and potential pathology of this region. Therefore, ultrasound is of potential use in detecting plantar plate pathology; however, it should not replace the use of MRI in all cases.</p>
