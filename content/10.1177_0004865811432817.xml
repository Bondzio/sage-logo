<p>Two handbooks head this issue’s list of new review titles: <italic>The Sage Handbook of Criminological Theory </italic>edited by Eugene McLaughlin and Tim Newburn and <italic>The Routledge Handbook of Critical Criminology</italic> edited by Walter S DeKesedery and Molly Dragiewicz.</p>
<p>There are three new books on prisons: <italic>Penal Exceptionalism? Nordic Prison Policy and Practice </italic>edited by Thomas Ugelvik and Jane Dullum (Routledge) provides a very interesting comparative analysis of a Scandinavian penal system often presented as an alternate model to that prevailing in the United States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand; <italic>A Plague of Prisons: The Epidemiology of Mass Incarceration in America </italic>by Ernest Drucker (New Press) applies basic public health concepts to analyse imprisonment trends in the United States; while different trends in punishment are also highlighted in <italic>Resisting Punitiveness in Europe?: Welfare, Human Rights and Democracy </italic>edited by Sonja Snacken and Els Dumortier (Routledge).</p>
<p>Comparative research is also a hallmark of <italic>The Drug Effect: Health, Crime and Society</italic> edited by Suzanne Fraser and David Moore (Cambridge University Press), which brings together research from the Australia, the United States, Britain and Canada.</p>
<p>Recent arrivals from Routledge include: <italic>Handbook on Sexual Violence</italic> edited by Jennifer Brown and Sandra Walklate; <italic>Dangerousness, Risk and the Governance of Serious Sexual and Violent Offenders</italic> by Karen Harrison; and <italic>Offending Girls: Young Women and Youth Justice</italic> by Gilly Sharpe.</p>
<p>Two very different titles have been published by Ashgate: <italic>Exploring Courtroom Discourse: The Language of Power and Control </italic>edited by Anne Wagner and Le Cheng; and <italic>The Right Not to be Criminalized: Demarcating Criminal Law’s Authority</italic> by Dennis J Baker.</p>
<p>Finally, a new journal, <italic>State Crime, </italic>will commence publication in 2012. For details, see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://statecrime.org/journal">http://statecrime.org/journal</ext-link></p>
