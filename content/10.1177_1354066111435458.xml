<p>Standing Group on International Relations</p>
<p>European Consortium for Political Research</p>
<p><italic>European Journal of International Relations</italic></p>
<p>Call for new editoral team</p>
<p>The Standing Group on International Relations (SGIR) is looking for a new editorial team to take over the running of <italic>EJIR</italic> during early 2013. <italic>EJIR</italic> was launched in 1995, and is one of the leading international journals in the field. Its previous editors included Walter Carlsnæs, Friedrich Kratochwil and Barry Buzan. The present editorial team consists of Tim Dunne, Lene Hansen and Colin Wight.</p>
<p><italic>EJIR</italic>’s statement of aims says: ‘The <italic>Journal</italic>’s remit is to represent the wide range of interests encompassed by the SGIR, covering the whole of International Relations. Building on its European base, the content of the journal has evolved during its first decade to reflect global subjects and cutting edge theory debates that address and reflect the whole of the International Relations community wherever located. <italic>EJIR</italic> has become a major independent voice in the worldwide scholarly debates about international relations. The <italic>Journal</italic> represents no particular school or approach, nor is it restricted to any particular methodology. Instead, it seeks to foster an awareness of methodological and epistemological questions in the study of International Relations, and to reflect research and developments of a conceptual, normative and empirical nature in all the major sub-areas of the field. The <italic>Journal</italic> also seeks to strengthen ties with cognate areas in social science and beyond, in particular with international history, international law and international economics. Its purpose is to stimulate and disseminate theory-aware research and scholarship in International Relations throughout the international academic community.’</p>
<p>The SGIR wishes to maintain both the broad remit of <italic>EJIR</italic> and its high international standing as a world-class journal based in Europe. It is therefore looking for an editorial team with the strength and institutional support to sustain the tradition and position established by the previous editors.</p>
<p>The post will preferably be filled by an editorial team, which may be headed by one person. The successful team must be based permanently in a European university or research institute, be fluent in English and have an internationally recognized track record of scholarship. It is possible for teams to be made up of colleagues in several universities (as is presently the case), as long as they provide evidence of clear lines of communication. The editorial position carries no remuneration, but financial assistance is provided to support office staff salaries equivalent to approximately two days per week, and possibly some other office expenses if necessary. Some editorial travel expenses are also provided by the publisher, but the successful application must be able to demonstrate appropriate, and guaranteed, institutional support for the editorship. The length of tenure is expected to be four years, with the possibility of extension to a fifth year.</p>
<p>Information and informal discussion about how to apply can be obtained from the Chair of the Search Committee, Thomas Diez, <email>thomas.diez@uni-tuebingen.de</email>. Further members of the Search Committee are Karin Fierke (St Andrew’s) and Pinar Bilgin (Bilkent University). The deadline for applications is 31 March 2012. Applications should be sent by e-mail to the above address. Shortlisted applicants will need to be available for interview at the University of Edinburgh on 20 June 2012 in connection with the BISA–ISA joint conference. The decision about the new editorship will be made, based on a report from the Search Committee, at the next meeting of the Steering Committee of SGIR on 22 June 2012. It is envisaged that the handover process will be completed by 31 March 2013.</p>
