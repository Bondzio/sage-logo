<p>This admirable book covers key historical and contemporary theories which underlie different approaches to Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC). The authors have devised an excellent format which locates approaches to practice in a clear theoretical framework and also invites practitioners to engage in critical reflection, to develop their own distinct practices. This is a much needed strategy in a field where practitioners have often lacked the critical edge which could put them in the driving seat of their own practice. Thus, the inclusion of critique at the end of every chapter allows the reader to take a measured look at the often persuasive but subtly different approaches that ECEC has advocated.</p>
<p>The book focuses on themes that are mainly relevant to ECEC in the United Kingdom and this rationale is used to omit a stronger focus on theorists such as Dewey and Isaacs who, although they have been massively influential to the field in general, have not been central to trends in UK early education. The first chapter, nevertheless, includes some reference to their contribution among other key theorists, before covering the theoretical and analytical positions; foundational and contemporary theories that are included in detail in the following three parts of the book.</p>
<p>In Part 1, psychoanalytic and postmodern theories are differentiated and outlined in turn by Julia Manning-Morton and Deborah Albon. Manning-Morton, in her chapter on psychoanalytic ideas and early years practice, makes an important point about the need for the early years professional to cross the boundaries of a range of professional disciplines. Of particular note, is the chapter by Deborah Albon, on postmodern and post-structuralist perspectives which is so good that it should be compulsory reading for all students of early childhood; such is the informative exposition of what is often opaque and difficult territory for those in this field. This chapter also neatly supports critique of the subsequent historical and contemporary theories and approaches. Indeed, the call to bear in mind the ‘interrelatedness of theories’ (p. 4) is a key point that the editors (Linda Miller and Linda Pound) make with regard to the mission of the book and the pattern of the chapters supports this aspiration well.</p>
<p>The chapters in Part 1 pave the way for a historical overview of foundational theories in Part 2. These are presented in relation to the influential figures of Froebel (Tina Bruce), Montessori (Martin Bradley et al.) and Steiner (Jill Tina Taplin). The editors cite Conroy et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476718X12443027">2008</xref>: 16), in order to point out that the enduring contribution of Montessori and Steiner to ECEC may rest on an increasing contemporary emphasis on individual ability and the affective domain, with which they are concerned. Overall, these chapters on the familiar pioneers of ECEC provide an important explanation of their contrasting philosophies and this prevents them from being parcelled together, as is sometimes the case. Most importantly, their ideas are presented as sets of evolving practices which also respond, to some degree, to current issues in education. The need for this, as the editors point out (p. 4), is highlighted by Bruce who asserts the importance of the curricula ‘revisionists’ who make changes to a prescribed curriculum so that its ‘dynamic quality’ is maintained.</p>
<p>Whereas Part 2 presents theory as linked to individual pioneers, Part 3 exemplifies contemporary theories through chapters on key approaches, with only Vivian Gussin-Paley (Trisha Lee) as an example of a key pioneer. However, it is heartening to see the work of Paley celebrated in this way as, despite providing an intelligent and creative reflection on the challenges of ethical ECEC practice, her work often falls between books centred on research and those centred on practices. The other approaches outlined in Part 2: High Scope (Ann Epstein et al.); Forest Schools (Blackwell and Pound) and Te Whariki (Anne Smith); may be more familiar to readers but they are presented with both passion and balance to enable the reader to integrate the different stances they represent. Further reading, throughout the book is also helpfully given under different level headings, to guide the reader in developing further.</p>
<p>The only surprising, or arguably interesting, feature of the book is that the contribution of Reggio Emilia is dealt with in the more general Chapter 1, rather than as a stand alone chapter. This seems to signal that ‘Reggio’ approaches have become so pervasive in the discourse of ECEC that they are now fundamental to dialogue about the field. Miller and Pound endorse this by suggesting that the Reggio Emilia system of education ‘embraces the key themes covered by the chapters in this book’ (p. 9). To endorse this, the final chapter of the book, in which Miller and Pound tie together the critical issues raised in the preceding chapters, includes Reggio Emilia as significant to the themes. These are identified as: the nature of Early Childhood Education (ECE); the politicization of childhood; enabling environments and communities of practice. These themes allow the issues raised by the chapters to be reconfigured for the reader. This enables the historical approach to theories and approaches to learning in the early years to inspire future theories. This design reinforces a view taken by Peter Moss which is cited by the editors. He says (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1476718X12443027">1999</xref>: 8) that looking at other approaches ‘provides us with a sort of lens for looking at our own situations’. Miller and Pound have produced a text that enables us to do just that.</p>
