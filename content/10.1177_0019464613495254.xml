<p>The fundamental premise of this book—that classical Sanskrit literary sources present us with an important source for understanding cities and urban experience in early India—is both a valuable and important contribution to scholarship. In <italic>Imagining the Urban</italic>, Shonaleeka Kaul takes up a task inaugurated by A.K. Ramanujan in an important essay published in 1970 and picked up by B.D. Chattopadhyaya over twenty years later, but hardly developed further—the interpretation of literature as a way of understanding the perception and experience of the city in early India. Literary texts, due to their perceived conventional and idealised nature, have been too quickly rejected as historically useless by both archaeologists and historians alike, from D.D. Kosambi to D.K. Chakrabarti. Kaul seeks to challenge this assessment through a new approach to the Sanskrit literary canon. For literary texts are no less real than pots and bricks and provide the historian with invaluable impressions, perceptions and meanings that relate to the city. Kaul rightly maintains that any understanding of urbanism in early India would be incomplete without some account of this evidence.</p>
<p>Having created an interpretive space for her analysis, Kaul goes on in the next four chapters to explore the city on a largely thematic basis. Chapters one and two, the most interesting of the book, deal with the physical features and spatial ambit of the city, including its chief architectural features, its internal organisation and its boundaries. In each case, Kaul focuses on the representation of a particular urban spatial feature, its meaning and associations in the literary corpus. Kaul is not constrained narrowly by the boundaries of the city as such, and considers places beyond it as integral to the urban imagination. The cremation ground, the market, the religious hermitage and the monastery, and perhaps most tellingly, the grove, garden and forest, all form ‘outsides’ of the city that were intimately connected to the urban. This is a brilliant and hugely important insight, one that very fruitfully shifts our attention from the archaeological record to the mental indices of the city we find in <italic>kāvya</italic>. In chapters three and four, Kaul draws out the ‘urban characters’ of Sanskrit <italic>kāvya</italic>—the courtesan, the man about town, the libertine, false ascetic, the merchant and, of course, the king—that embody the social values of aesthetics, pleasure and ethical individualism. Here the work is less original, drawing from a number of recent works in the field of early Indian history, but Kaul nonetheless is able to bring this ensemble of characters together to sketch a lively picture of the city. In the final two chapters, Kaul speculates more generally on the values associated with the city in Sanskrit literature and the city as a kind of ‘civilizational’ symbol or marker.</p>
<p>Kaul’s readings are often exceedingly astute and penetrating, and <italic>Imagining the Urban</italic> will take its place among a new generation of studies of early Indian history that have moved beyond the older approach to literature as a repository of occasional facts, encased in bombast and convention, to be extracted by the historian and corroborated with more ‘reliable’ sources. Her arguments are often wide ranging and fundamental and definitely merit extended discussion and debate. Here I would like to touch on three issues raised by the book—one methodological and two interpretive. Though Kaul declares that her aim is to understand the experiential structures of <italic>kāvya</italic>’s vision of the city, her reading method tends to see the ‘experience’ recorded in literary texts as essentially unmediated sensory data. Such an understanding leads, particularly in the first two chapters, to an overly simplistic correlation of literary representations with the existing archaeological record (see Appendix 2). While careful to add the qualification that ‘not all early cities were how the kāvyas describe’ them, Kaul suggests that an ‘adequate number … had elements of these descriptions which lodged as impression in the literary mind and thereby produced the representations that we have of the urban’ (121). Here the ‘literary mind’ serves as a kind of blackbox recorder of sensory data that is accessed by the historian. Yet surely the contribution of structuralist and phenomenological approaches to space in the last thirty years (from Bachelard to Foucault) have taught us that cognitive and ideational space gains its significance from its multiple relations with ‘real space’. The image of the hearth as the centre of the home, for example, may long outlive successive technologies of domestic heat production. This slippage or dissonance is particularly the case with spatial representations in literature—European poetry of the middle ages, Curtius tells us, drew its representation of nature and forests not from direct experience but schooling in the classics. In the case of Sanskrit <italic>kāvya</italic>, a poetic enterprise no less conventional in nature, should we not be open to the possibility that representations of the city, particularly when <italic>nagaravarṇana</italic> was a mandated part of some literary genres like the <italic>mahākāvya</italic>, was as much constrained by established literary tropes about the city as it was by direct experience? I raise this in no way to discredit the evidence of the literary (which becomes all the more significant given this slippage), but instead to suggest we entertain more complex relations between literature and reality. Such interpretive tensions between literary description and archaeological record could have been put to excellent use in a study of urbanism in early India, particularly in the context of diachronic historical change.</p>
<p>Kaul’s emphasis on the urban moorings of <italic>kāvya</italic> is explicitly critical of the court-centric approach of the current reviewer’s work. I accept this criticism in part, but would only note that my emphasis on the court over the city was not an entirely unconsidered one. Most of the ostensibly ‘urban’ scenarios of Sanskrit <italic>kāvya</italic>, in my reading, seem to have a pronounced courtly orientation. This is clearly reflected in the fact that kings, palaces and royal streets dominate most of the spatial representations of the city and that a king or prince forms the protagonist in the great majority of Sanskrit poems and dramas. Even in the obvious exceptions, like the <italic>Mṛcchakaṭika, Cārudatta</italic> and the <italic>Caturbhāṇī</italic>, the royal court is never far off from the action. The point then, is not so much that cities were non-existent, or insignificant, but only that the culture of ‘urbanity’ was dominated by the ways of the court. Put another way, and in light of European historiography, there seems in early medieval India to have been no autonomous urban ethos that was not deeply entangled with aristocratic and courtly ways. Given the predominance of the agricultural economy in early medieval India, I chose to formulate this close imbrication city and court as one that was based ultimately on aristocratic rather than urban or mercantile orientations. While this point seems clearly indicated to me by some of the same evidence that Kaul treats as fundamentally ‘urban’—like conceptions of wealth found in the <italic>Mṛcchakaṭika</italic> and <italic>Cārudatta</italic>—the publication of <italic>Imagining the Urban</italic> makes it clear that an important and very welcome discussion is now long overdue in our field on the relations between court and city in early medieval India. I can only hope that these remarks can stimulate such a conversation.</p>
<p>A final theme of the book that I would like to take up here is the contention that the city in early India symbolised a kind of historical and social dynamism—marked by upward social mobility, anonymity and material opportunity. Among the chief values of the city emphasised in <italic>kāvya</italic>, according to Kaul, are aesthetic pleasure, hedonistic self-realisation and ethical individualism. Yet she also points out that the city implied a kind of popular ‘congregationalism’ (a rather unfortunate word choice given its Protestant connotations). Sanskrit <italic>kāvya</italic>, according to Kaul, often took a critical stance towards received morality, religion and political authority, suggesting that it at least in part formed a critique of the elite ways. The city, she concludes, can be equated with ‘civilization’. Overall, this interpretation has many merits, particularly in a historiography where the urban has been consistently neglected in favour of theorisations of rural and courtly power, as indicated above. Yet the picture has a familiar ring to it, for it is the predominant image of the city in Western historiography as the space of human enterprise, the harbinger of social change and the origin of everything good. Such assumptions have been a hugely important trope in the writing of European history and have cast a long shadow over the non-Western world. In this light (or shadow) the <italic>goṣṭhī</italic> appears as a sort of Indian ‘salon’, the <italic>Mṛcchakaṭika</italic> as an early bourgeois romance and <italic>kāvya</italic> more generally an early form of ‘rational communication’ (a la Habermas). At one level, such an interpretation is welcome, in that at the very least it will stimulate further discussion on the interpretation of these complex texts. A perhaps unintended, but equally salubrious effect of this argument, could be to take some of the wind out of the sails of recent interpretations by our erstwhile medieval and eighteenth-century colleagues, that have argued that these same values were not introduced by the British but can be found for the first time in South Asia during its ‘early modern’ period. Clearly the roots of civility in India are older. Yet I can also envision a book that might claim that Sanskrit <italic>kāvya</italic> and its image of the city merely continued earlier innovations found in the earlier Pali and Prakrit literatures of the Jains and Buddhists. What is troubling about such revisionism, however, is not so much its tacit acceptance of the underlying developmentalism of an earlier generation of Marxist scholarship (whatever its claims to the contrary)—but its sometimes cavalier rejection of the great advances made by that generation— particularly around the topic of class exploitation and power. This has led to the contradictory tendency in many recent histories of combining more complex archives and reading strategies (a surely positive development) with often more simplistic theories of social interaction. The value of a book like <italic>Imagining the Urban</italic> is its capacity to refine, extend and complicate the work of an earlier generation, rather than to simply dismiss it.</p>
