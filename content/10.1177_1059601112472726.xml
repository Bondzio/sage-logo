<abstract>
<p>This study examined the role of job satisfaction, relational identification with supervisor, and work-family conflict in explaining the influence of family-friendly supervision (FFS) on supervisor-rated citizenship behavior and task performance using data from a Chinese pharmaceutical company. Hierarchical regression analysis results revealed that job satisfaction mediated the relationship between FFS and supervisor-rated citizenship behavior, whereas relational identification with supervisor mediated the relationship between FFS and supervisor-rated task performance. We also found that work-family conflict moderates the relationship between FFS and job satisfaction. We discuss implications of these findings for theory and practice.</p>

<p>Globalization and the resulting competitive pressures have made organizations more dependent than ever on employee performance as a source of sustained competitive advantage. Consequently, contemporary organizations increasingly see the ideal worker as one who “not only demonstrates high levels of task performance but also engages in high levels of contextual performance or OCB [organizational citizenship behavior] as well” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059601112472726">Bolino &amp; Turnley, 2005</xref>, p. 740). In tandem with the emergent view of an ideal worker are changes in family forms and the recognition of effective management of the work-family interface as a major influence on employee work-related attitudes and behaviors. Consequently, a growing number of organizations have introduced family-responsive policies to promote a family-supportive work environment in order to positively influence employee work attitudes and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059601112472726">Allen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059601112472726">Frone, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059601112472726">Hammer, Kossek, Yragui, Bodner, &amp; Hanson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1059601112472726">Perlow, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1059601112472726">Thompson, Beauvais, &amp; Lyness, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1059601112472726">Wang &amp; Walumbwa, 2007</xref>). However, perhaps because of the difficulty of measuring performance, work-family researchers have shied away from studying the relationship between work-family variables and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059601112472726">Jahn, Thompson, &amp; Kopelman, 2003</xref>), relying mostly on self-reported, attitudinal measures as dependent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059601112472726">Allen, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study constitutes an initial attempt to advance knowledge in this area by focusing on non-self-reported OCB and task performance. The two-component performance model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601112472726">Borman &amp; Motowidlo, 1993</xref>) consisting of task performance and OCB is a widely accepted conceptualization of employee performance (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059601112472726">Lynch, Eisenberger, &amp; Armeli, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1059601112472726">Setton, Bennett, &amp; Liden, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1059601112472726">Wayne, Shore, &amp; Liden, 1997</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1059601112472726">Rhoades and Eisenberger (2002)</xref> suggested that performance measures in organizational support research should include both performance of standard job activities (in-role performance) and actions beneficial to the organization that go beyond prescribed job duties (extra-role performance). Therefore, our investigations are important, because if evidence of performance gains is found, organizations will be more motivated to create a family-friendly workplace.</p>
<p>In addition to developing and testing a model of the effect of a family-friendly supervision on non-self-reported individual performance, this study also investigates how and when family-friendly supervision is related to employee task and contextual performance. To date, researchers have paid less attention to identifying the conditions under which family-supportive work environment is more or less effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059601112472726">Bagger &amp; Li, in press</xref>). Moreover, although a handful of studies has demonstrated that family-supportive work context influences <italic>attitudinal</italic> work-related outcomes (e.g., job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and turnover intention) indirectly through reduced work-family conflict and perceived control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059601112472726">Anderson, Coffey, &amp; Beyerly, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601112472726">Mauno, Kinnunen, &amp; Pyykko, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1059601112472726">Thomas &amp; Ganster, 1995</xref>), relatively few studies have explored how and why OCB and task performance are influenced by family-friendly supervision (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059601112472726">Bagger &amp; Li, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1059601112472726">Miao, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Drawing on organizational support theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601112472726">Eisenberger, Huntington, Hutchison, &amp; Sowa, 1986</xref>), we consider two categories of intermediate variables—relational identification, defined as the “extent to which one defines oneself in terms of a given role-relationship” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601112472726">Sluss &amp; Ashforth 2007</xref>, p. 11) and job satisfaction, to provide an insight into why family-friendly supervision affects both OCB and task performance. We also draw on social exchange theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059601112472726">Blau, 1964</xref>) to explain how work-family conflict interacts with family-friendly supervision to influence relational identification with supervisor and job satisfaction. Thus, we contribute to the literature by exploring the boundary conditions (e.g., moderators) that serve to either promote or impede the effectiveness of a family-supportive work environment and by unraveling two pathways through which family-friendly supervision influences employee performance.</p>
<p>Our final goal was to contribute to work-family research by testing the proposed relationships in a Chinese context. In view of the relative dearth of research on family-friendly supervision in non-Western contexts, our use of a Chinese sample is particularly important given “the differing values that cultures may place on the role of culture and hierarchy in solving work-family conflicts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059601112472726">Hammer et al., 2009</xref>, p. 853). In a collectivistic culture such as China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059601112472726">Hofstede, 2001</xref>), the ideal employer–employee relationships may be more family-like, in that the employer often takes a paternalistic interest in the employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1059601112472726">Powell, Francesco, &amp; Ling, 2009</xref>). China also has a strong diffusing culture in which people tend not to mark their work life (public life) and family life (private life) as two segmented life spaces and, instead, allow others access to their private life space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1059601112472726">Trompennaars &amp; Hampden-Turner, 1998</xref>). Therefore, employees may feel more comfortable or even expect their supervisor (a member of public life) to discuss and provide emotional support for issues experienced in their family life (private life). With the expectation for a more personal employer–employee relationship, Chinese employees may respond more positively to supervisory family support than employees in societies with a strong individualistic and less diffuse culture. Thus, cultural differences between Chinese and most Western contexts highlight the need to understand the role of family-friendly supervision in a Chinese context. This study therefore further enhances our knowledge of family-friendly supervision and its outcomes in an underrepresented context.</p>

<title>Theory and Hypothesis Development</title>
<p>Our proposed theoretical model is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059601112472726">Figure 1</xref>. As shown in this figure, we propose that family-friendly supervision positively relates to employee OCB and task performance, and that this relationship is mediated by both relational identification with supervisor and job satisfaction. We also propose that work-family conflict moderates the relationships between family-friendly supervision and both relational identification and job satisfaction. Below, we provide theoretical rationale for the hypothesized relationships.</p>

<title>Family-friendly Supervision, Task Performance, and Citizenship Behaviors</title>
<p>According to organizational support theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601112472726">Eisenberger et al., 1986</xref>), when an employee believes that his or her work organization or immediate supervisor is supportive (i.e., “on my side”) and cares about the employee’s well-being, he or she (employee) will demonstrate more favorable work-related attitudes and behaviors. These beneficial attitudes and behaviors include organizational commitment, job satisfaction, identification, task performance, and OCB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1059601112472726">Rhoades &amp; Eisenberger, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>As a specific type of perceived supervisor support, family-friendly supervision aims to help employees achieve a viable balance between work and family life. We define family-friendly supervision as supervisory behaviors such as recognizing, empathizing, and identifying with employees’ desire to achieve work and family balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1059601112472726">Thomas &amp; Ganster, 1995</xref>) and it has been shown to be conceptually different from general supervisor social support. Research suggests that work-family-specific support from the supervisor operates differently from general supervisory social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059601112472726">Kossek, Pichler, Bodner, &amp; Hammer, 2011</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059601112472726">Kossek et al. (2011)</xref> point out, future work-family studies should avoid confounding the referent used (e.g., organization or supervisor support, general or content-specific support) in the same construct.</p>
<p>Although research has distinguished between instrumental and emotional support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059601112472726">Hammer et al., 2009</xref>), we focused on the latter in this study. Examples of emotional supervisory family support include considering employees’ family and personal life commitment, demonstrating respect, understanding, sympathy, and sensitivity with regard to family responsibilities, or making employees feel comfortable discussing family-related issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059601112472726">Hammer et al., 2009</xref>). We elected to focus on the emotional component of supervisor family-support for three reasons. First, it is consistent with the definition of family-friendly supervision as supervisors’ behaviors that are empathetic to an employee’s desire to seek balance between work and family responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1059601112472726">Thomas &amp; Ganster, 1995</xref>). Second, although it is important to explore the instrumental component of family-friendly supervision (i.e., granting employees’ schedule requests for flexibility to respond to employees’ work and family needs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059601112472726">Hammer et al., 2009</xref>), social support research suggests that emotional support is the most important and effective type of social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059601112472726">Berkman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1059601112472726">Sarason, Sarason, Brock, &amp; Pierce, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1059601112472726">Semmer et al., 2008</xref>). In a meta-analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1059601112472726">Viswesvaran, Sanchez, and Fisher (1999)</xref> reported that emotional, non-tangible support has a stronger relationship with all types of stress outcomes than other social support types. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1059601112472726">Semmer et al. (2008)</xref> found that emotional instrumental support is often interpreted as helpful due to the positive emotional meaning that is associated with it, such as signaling caring, understanding and esteem. Finally, contradictory arguments exist in the literature regarding the effect of supervisor emotional support in Chinese culture and employment situation. On one hand, the societal emphasis on interpersonal relationships may increase the effectiveness of managers’ efforts aimed at providing emotional support and facilitating emotional bonds among people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1059601112472726">Wang, 2008</xref>). On the other hand, some scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601112472726">Beehr &amp; Glazer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059601112472726">Glazer, 2006</xref>) have argued that supervisor emotional support is not compatible with an Asian (i.e., Chinese) culture that values harmony, conservatism, and hierarchy. The provision of supervisor emotional support to an individual may single out and place that individual in a disadvantageous position in relation to his or her coworkers. He or she may be seen as incompetent and may be resented by coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601112472726">Beehr &amp; Glazer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059601112472726">Glazer, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>These inconsistent perspectives on the role of supervisor emotional support call for more empirical research in a Chinese context to understand how and when supervisor emotional support influences important performance outcomes. Drawing on organizational support theory, we expect that when employees perceive that their supervisor is family supportive, high levels of citizenship behavior and task performance are likely to occur. By supporting employees’ pursuit of a balance between work and family responsibilities, organizations and their agents (e.g., supervisors) may alleviate employees’ high stress level and thereby signal care and concern for the well-being of their employees. This favorable treatment will trigger a felt obligation on the part of employees to reciprocate the receipt of family support by demonstrating citizenship behaviors and high levels of performance. In support, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059601112472726">Bagger and Li (in press)</xref> found that perceived supervisor family support is related to task performance and supervisor-directed citizenship behavior using a sample of 225 American workers from a variety of companies. Therefore, we propose to test the following:</p>

<title>Mediating Role of Relational Identification in the Family-Friendly Supervision–Performance Relationship</title>
<p>As previously noted, we propose that relational identification with the supervisor constitutes an underlying mechanism through which family-friendly supervision is related to employee OCB and task performance. Relational identification reflects the interpersonal self that defines oneself in terms of a given role-related relationship, such as that of the supervisor and direct report relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601112472726">Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1059601112472726">Sluss, Ployhart, Cobb, &amp; Ashforth, 2012</xref>). As an extended sense of the self (“who I am”), relational identification is built upon the individual’s role relationship with the supervisor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601112472726">Slush &amp; Ashforth, 2007</xref>). For people with high relational identification with the supervisor, their self-value is shaped by whether their behavior is appropriate and acceptable to the supervisor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059601112472726">Brewer &amp; Gardner, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059601112472726">Andersen and Chen (2002)</xref> suggested that relational identification with the supervisor has implications for self-definition, self-evaluation, and self-regulation, thus comprising one of the key processes through which supervisors achieve their motivational effects on followers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059601112472726">Kark, Shamir, &amp; Chen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1059601112472726">Walumbwa, Avolio, &amp; Zhu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1059601112472726">Walumbwa &amp; Hartnell, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1059601112472726">Sluss and colleagues (2012)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1059601112472726">Uhl-Bien (2006)</xref> have both pointed out that relational identification with supervisor offers a different perspective to the dyadic leadership process relative to leader-member exchange theory. Leader-member exchange or LMX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059601112472726">Graen &amp; Uhl-Bien, 1995</xref>) concerns the perceived quality of the relationship between a subordinate and his or her manager. Relational identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601112472726">Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2007</xref>) concerns the extent to which subordinates define themselves in terms of their relationship with their supervisor. In support, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1059601112472726">Sluss, Cooper, Morrell, and Thompson (2008)</xref> found that LMX and relational identification were empirically distinct, although the two constructs were positively correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .48).</p>
<p>Turning back to relational identification, Sluss and colleagues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601112472726">Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1059601112472726">Sluss et al., 2012</xref>) have argued that the resource one derives from a relationship influences the formation of relational identification. Specifically, these authors suggest that relational identification with the supervisor is a result of one’s supervisor’s positive role-based behaviors (i.e., the manager provides important resources for doing the job) and positive personal attributes (i.e., the manager is considerate). Similarly, organizational support theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1059601112472726">Rhoades &amp; Eisenberger, 2002</xref>) suggests that supportive behaviors from the organization and supervisors fulfill employees’ social emotional needs, which, in turn, lead employees to incorporate organizational membership into their self-identity. Family-friendly supervision helps employees manage their work and nonwork life and, thus, involves providing resources that fulfill employees’ socioemotional needs, such as those for respect, caring and approval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059601112472726">Allen, 2001</xref>). These behaviors will lead to the development of a positive emotional bond and shared identity between individual employees and the supervisor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059601112472726">Blau, Tatum, &amp; Ward-Cook, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1059601112472726">Lweicki &amp; Bunker, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059601112472726">Masterson, Lewis, Goldman, &amp; Taylor, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1059601112472726">Organ, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601112472726">Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1059601112472726">Sluss et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1059601112472726">Walumbwa, Cropanzano, &amp; Hartnell, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, identification with the target (i.e., supervisor) has been shown in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1059601112472726">Lavelle, Rupp, &amp; Brockner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1059601112472726">Olkkonen &amp; Lipponen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1059601112472726">van Dick, Wagner, Stellmacher, &amp; Christ, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1059601112472726">Walumbwa et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1059601112472726">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1059601112472726">Walumbwa &amp; Hartnell, 2011</xref>) and meta-analytical reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1059601112472726">Riketta, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1059601112472726">Riketta &amp; van Dick, 2005</xref>) to positively relate to employee OCB and task performance. One of the reasons why identification is related to these performance outcomes is that it motivates individuals to take the target’s (e.g., supervisor’s) perspective and to experience the target’s goals and interests as their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1059601112472726">Lavelle et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1059601112472726">Sluss et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1059601112472726">van Knippenberg, 2000</xref>). As a result, employees with high relational identification with their supervisor may be intrinsically motivated to contribute on behalf of the supervisor, thereby increasing their citizenship behaviors and task performance. We therefore propose to test the following:</p>

<title>Mediating Role of Job Satisfaction in the Family-friendly Supervision–Performance Relationship</title>
<p>Previous research has reported a positive relationship between supervisor support for work-family balance and job satisfaction (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059601112472726">Allen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1059601112472726">Thomas &amp; Ganster, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1059601112472726">Thompson &amp; Prottas, 2005</xref>). Consistent with prior research, we expect a positive relationship between family-friendly supervision and job satisfaction. By providing emotional family support (i.e., acknowledging employees’ family-related needs, empathizing employees’ work-family interference, etc.), supervisors create a caring work environment and help employees to effectively combine their work and family responsibilities. These positive workplace experiences can facilitate the development of more favorable attitudes toward work among employees. In support of our argument, previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1059601112472726">Li &amp; Bagger, 2011</xref>) found that supervisory family-support increased employee job satisfaction.</p>
<p>Job satisfaction has been shown to influence OCBs and task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059601112472726">Chang, Rosen, &amp; Levy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1059601112472726">McGregor, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1059601112472726">Organ, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1059601112472726">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1059601112472726">Whitman, Van Rooy, &amp; Viswesvaran, 2010</xref>). Workers who are satisfied with their job feel obligated to reciprocate with behaviors that enhance organizational productivity and effectiveness, such as enhanced performance and increased cooperation with colleagues at work. Taken together, family-friendly supervision is predicted to relate to employee job satisfaction and, subsequently, OCBs and task performance. Thus, we propose to test the following:</p>
<list id="list3-1059601112472726" list-type="simple">

<title>Moderating Role of Work-Family Conflict</title>
<p>We argue that employees’ work-family conflict will moderate the effects of family-friendly supervision on job satisfaction and relational identification. Social exchange theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059601112472726">Blau, 1964</xref>) suggests that people feel obligated to return benefits they receive from another party. In this exchange process, people will cognitively conduct a cost and benefit analysis to determine whether the worth of social benefits received and the value of social benefits returned are comparable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059601112472726">Ekeh, 1974</xref>). Therefore, workers with a higher level of work-family conflict are more likely to perceive work-family emotional support from the supervisor as more beneficial and valuable and will be more appreciative of the supervisor’s effort to help them balance work and family responsibilities than those with less work-family conflict. Employees with high work-family conflict will, as a result of supervisory support, be more satisfied with the job and identify to a greater extent with the supervisor than individuals with lower levels of work-family conflict. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1059601112472726">Wang, Lawler, and Shi (2011)</xref> suggest that the effectiveness of family-friendly organizational policies is influenced by whether employees perceive such policy support as important and necessary. Thus, we propose to test the following:</p>
<list id="list4-1059601112472726" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 7</italic>: Work-family conflict will moderate the relationship between family-friendly supervision and job satisfaction. Specifically, family-friendly supervision will be more positively related to job satisfaction when work-family conflict is high than when it is low.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 8</italic>: Work-family conflict will moderate the relationship between family-friendly supervision and relational identification with supervisor.

<title>Participants and Procedure</title>
<p>We collected our data from a major pharmaceutical joint-venture in China. Separate questionnaires were completed and returned by 76 supervisors and 209 immediate direct reports in a useable form, thus constituting 209 supervisor–subordinate dyads. Employees received a survey packet via email containing a cover letter from the researchers and endorsed by the Human Resource department. The cover letter explained the purpose of the study, provided assurances of participant confidentiality, and informed participants that only group data would be reported to the organization. Participants provided personal information including age, sex, and tenure, and completed measures of family-friendly supervision, job satisfaction, relational identification, work-family conflict, as well as control variables, including demographic characteristics and family-friendliness of the organization. Each participant was assigned a unique survey code so that responses could be matched with supervisors’ ratings. All completed surveys were returned directly to the researchers via email. The response rate was approximately 78% (209 responses from 268 survey packets distributed). After all data from employees were coded, immediate supervisors (<italic>n</italic> = 76) rated their direct reports’ OCB and task performance (100% response rate). As with employees, supervisors were also assured of confidentiality.</p>
<p>Of the 209 direct reports, 54% were male and they reported an average age of 32 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.9 years), average organizational tenure of 5 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.5 years), and average supervisor–subordinate tenure of 2.5 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.8 years). Over 80% had an equivalent of United States (U.S.) community college diploma and all respondents were full-time employees. About 41% had at least one child and 64% were married. Of the 76 supervisors, 53% were men and they reported an average organizational tenure of 8 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.7 years), an average age of 37 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.9 years), and over 85% had an equivalent of a U.S. community college diploma.</p>

<sec id="section12-1059601112472726">
<title>Work-family conflict</title>

<sec id="section13-1059601112472726">
<title>Organizational citizenship behavior (OCB)</title>
<p>We measured OCB using 24 items from a Chinese version of the OCB scale originally developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1059601112472726">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Moorman, and Fetter (1990)</xref>. This scale measures five dimensions of OCB: Conscientiousness, sportsmanship, civic virtue, courtesy, and altruism.

In the present study, the five dimensions were found to be very highly correlated (an average <italic>r</italic> of .79). We therefore conducted an exploratory factor analysis of the 24 items and found only one factor with an eigenvalue greater than 1.0.

<sec id="section15-1059601112472726">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>We included employee demographics (i.e., gender and job tenure) as controls in our hypothesis tests because they can potentially bias regression results relating to job and contextual performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059601112472726">Allen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059601112472726">Cook, 2009</xref>). We also controlled for tenure with supervisor, measured as the number of years the subordinate in question had been a direct report of the supervisor, to take into account possible temporal effects of supervisor influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059601112472726">Lord, Brown, &amp; Freiberg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1059601112472726">van Knippenberg, van Knippenberg, De Cremer, &amp; Hogg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1059601112472726">Wang &amp; Rode, 2010</xref>). Finally, we controlled for family friendliness of the organization to enhance the predictive validity of our family-friendly supervision measure and because it has also been found to relate to employee attitudes and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1059601112472726">Mesmer-Magnus &amp; Viswesvaran, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1059601112472726">O’Driscoll et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Family friendliness of the organization was assessed using a 4-item scale developed by the Families and Work Institute.

A bilingual speaker performed the initial translation after which the questionnaire was given to another bilingual speaker who was asked to back-translate the same items into English without having access to the original survey. The second translator was also asked to comment on any item that was seen as ambiguous. Finally, we gave the same survey to two additional native Chinese speakers, who examined the surveys to ensure that items were interpretable in Chinese.

<p>Results showed that the hypothesized four-factor measurement model that included family-friendly supervision, family-friendliness of the organization, job satisfaction, and relational identification with supervisor fit the data well (<italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic>= 65.99, <italic>df</italic> = 48, TLI = .97, CFI = .98, GFI= .95, RMSEA = .04, AIC = 125.99). Relative to the hypothesized model, an alternative model in which indicators of family-friendliness of the organization and family-friendly supervision were set to load on a single construct fit the data significantly worse (<italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic>= 217.66, <italic>df</italic> = 51, TLI = .75, CFI = .81, GFI = .83, RMSEA = .13, AIC = 271.66), as did a second alternative model in which indicators of job satisfaction and relational identification were set to load on a single construct (<italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic>= 178.95, <italic>df</italic> = 51, CFI = .85, GFI = .87, RMSEA = .11, AIC = 232.95). In addition, a comparison of the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) values suggested that the four-factor model showed a better fit to the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1059601112472726">SPSS, 2011</xref>). Taken together, these results provided support for the discriminant validity of family-friendly supervision, family-friendliness of the organization, job satisfaction, and relational identification.</p>

<title>Hypothesis Tests</title>
<p>We tested our hypotheses using the four-equation hierarchical regression approach to testing direct and indirect effects recommended by Baron and colleagues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059601112472726">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601112472726">Kenny, Kashy, &amp; Bolger, 1998</xref>). Specifically, Baron and his colleagues proposed a four-step procedure to test the mediation effect of M in the X→Y relationship: (1) X predicts Y, (2) X predicts M, (3) M predicts Y, and (4) the strength of the relationship between X and Y is reduced (partial mediation) or is not significant (complete mediation) when M is added to the model as a mediator. Note, however, that recent research suggests that condition 1 does not have to be met for mediation to exist, especially when considering more distal effects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059601112472726">Collins, Graham, &amp; Flaherty, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059601112472726">MacKinnon, Krull, &amp; Lockwood, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1059601112472726">Shrout &amp; Bolger, 2002</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601112472726">Kenny et al. (1998</xref>, p. 260) note, “Step 1 is not required . . . the essential steps in establishing mediation are Steps 2 and 3.” For clarity, we report the direct effect results first.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059601112472726">Table 2</xref> presents the results of the regression analyses we used to test our hypotheses.

As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059601112472726">Table 2</xref> (Model 1 and Model 2) family-friendly supervision was positively and significantly related to both task performance (β = .17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, Model 1) and OCB (β = .17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, Model 2).

<p>Hypotheses 2 and 3 stated that employee relational identification would mediate the relationships between family-friendly supervision and both employee task performance and OCB. Results of Hypotheses 1 and 2 confirm condition 1. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059601112472726">Table 2</xref>, family-friendly supervision was positively and significantly related to relational identification with supervisor (β = .46, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, Model 3) and job satisfaction (β = .15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, Model 4). Thus, condition 2 is met. In support of conditions 3 and 4, results revealed that relational identification was positively and significantly related to task performance (β = .23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, Model 5) and the effect of family-friendly supervision on task performance was reduced to nonsignificance (β = .09, n. s., Model 5). These results suggest that relational identification with the supervisor fully mediated the relationship between family-friendly supervision and task performance. Therefore, Hypothesis 3 was supported. However, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059601112472726">Table 2</xref> (Model 6) shows that Hypothesis 4 was not supported, as relational identification with supervisor was not related to OCB (β = −.05, n. s.) when both family-friendly supervision and relational identification with supervisor are included in the regression equation.</p>
<p>Hypotheses 5 and 6 stated that job satisfaction would mediate the relationship between family-friendly supervision and both task performance and OCB. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059601112472726">Table 2</xref>, Hypothesis 5 was not supported because job satisfaction was not significantly related to task performance (β = .04, n. s., Model 5), thus not meeting condition 3 for the mediation effect of job satisfaction. Hypothesis 6 received support. Specifically, as shown in Model 6, job satisfaction was positively and significantly related to OCB (β = .28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, Model 6) and the effect of family-friendly supervision on OCB was reduced to non-significance (β = .15, n. s., Model 6). Thus, our results suggest that job satisfaction completely mediated the relationship between family-friendly supervision and OCB.</p>
<p>To further explore the significance of the mediation effects, we followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1059601112472726">Preacher and Hayes (2008)</xref>’s bootstrapping procedure for multiple mediators. Using the SPSS version of the macro command set provided by Preacher and Hayes, we bootstrapped the indirect effects of family-friendly supervision on task performance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1059601112472726">1</xref></sup> Results showed that 95% bootstrapping confidence interval (CI) for relational identification with supervisor was from .03 to .24, whereas the 95% CI for job satisfaction was from −.03 to .06. Relational identification with supervisor was the only significant mediator of the family-friendly supervision–task performance relationship, as zero is not contained in the confidence interval. Using the same procedure, we bootstrapped the indirect effects of family-friendly supervision on OCB. We found that the 95% CI for relational identification with supervisor ranged from −.08 to .05, whereas the 95% CI for job satisfaction ranged from .001 to .084. Therefore, job satisfaction was the only significant mediator of the family-friendly supervision–OCB relationship.</p>
<p>Hypotheses 7 and 8 proposed that family-friendly supervision and work-family conflict would interact to predict job satisfaction and relational identification with supervisor. To test both hypotheses, we entered the control variables, work-family conflict, and family-friendly supervision followed by the interaction of work-family conflict and family-friendly supervision. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059601112472726">Table 2</xref>, the interaction term of family-friendly supervision and work-family conflict significantly predicted job satisfaction (β = .15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, Model 7); however, the interaction term of family-friendly supervision and work-family conflict is not significantly related to relational identification with supervisor (β = .00, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .1, Model 8). Thus, Hypothesis 7 received support but not Hypothesis 8.</p>
<p>We graphically plotted these interactions to further explore the nature and form of the interaction using a cut value of one standard deviation below the mean and one standard deviation above the mean of work-family conflict and family-friendly supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059601112472726">Aiken &amp; West, 1991</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1059601112472726">Figure 2</xref>, the family-friendly supervision–job satisfaction relationship is more strongly positive for those who perceive more work-family conflict than those who perceive less work-family conflict. These results provide further support for Hypotheses 7.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of the present study offer several notable findings. We found family-friendly supervision has a direct influence on both employee OCB and task performance. Our results suggest that job satisfaction mediates the relationship between family-friendly supervision and OCB, whereas relational identification with supervisor mediates the influence of family-friendly supervision on employee task performance. In addition, our results show that work-family conflict moderates the relationship between family-friendly supervision and job satisfaction. We discuss implications of these findings below.</p>
<sec id="section21-1059601112472726">
<title>Theoretical Implications</title>
<p>Our findings make several important contributions to the work-family literature. The first contribution is that our study examined the link between family-friendly supervision and supervisor-rated OCB and task performance. Specifically, our findings suggest that an important benefit of family-friendly supervision is improved OCB and task performance. Moreover, unlike previous family-friendly supervision research that relied heavily on self-reported measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059601112472726">Allen, 2001</xref>), we used non-self-reported OCB and task performance measures to help address this limitation in the literature. In contrast with the argument that supervisor emotional support is not compatible with Chinese culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601112472726">Beehr &amp; Glazer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059601112472726">Glazer, 2006</xref>), our results instead suggested that supervisor emotional support is beneficial to productivity in Chinese context.</p>
<p>The second contribution is that we found that work-family conflict serves as a boundary condition for the relationship between family-friendly supervision and job satisfaction. Perhaps, with supervisor’s emotional family support, employees with high work-family conflict experience their work-family interface as less stressful and thus perceive work as more pleasant and satisfying. By contrast, employees with low work-family conflict may not perceive their supervisor’s emotional family support as beneficial and therefore it does not impact their affective reactions to their work. We did not find support for the proposed moderating role of work-family conflict in the relationship between family-friendly supervision and relational identification with the supervisor. Regardless of work-family conflict, employees develop relational identification with the supervisor if their supervisor provides emotional support directed toward work-family balance. Maybe people who do not experience work-family conflict still form positive expectations about how their supervisor will treat them if they were to experience work-family conflict in future. As a result, they may develop favorable attitudes toward the supervisor, such as trust, emotional attachment, and relational identification with the supervisor.</p>
<p>The third contribution of our study is that we identified one aspect of self-identity—relational identification—as a potential underlying mechanism through which family-friendly supervision relates to employee OCB and task performance. Organizational support theory suggests that a psychological mechanism underlying the consequence of perceived supervisor support is the cognitive merging of close relationships into one’s self identity. However, few studies, if any, have included self-identity variables as mediators in the perceived support–work outcome relationships. By focusing on relational identification with supervisor as a key mediator, we not only contributed to the literature by filling the research gap but also by uncovering the differential mediating influence of relational identification.</p>
<p>Specifically, we found that relational identification with supervisor did not mediate the relationship between family-friendly supervision and OCB, but mediated the family-friendly supervision–task performance relationship. Our finding suggests that relational identification is a stronger predictor of employee task performance than employee OCB. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059601112472726">Ajzen’s (1988)</xref> principle of compatibility theorized that stronger attitude–behavior relationships exist when the target of an attitude and a related behavior match. Similar arguments have been made by other scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059601112472726">Fisher, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059601112472726">Hammer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059601112472726">Harrison, Newman, &amp; Roth, 2006</xref>), who have suggested that the strength of the predictor–outcome relationship is higher when both constructs match in specificity and context. Task performance is the traditional and primary focus of exchange in the employment relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059601112472726">Kamdar &amp; Van Dyne, 2007</xref>). Monitoring and improving employee performance is an important function of supervisors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1059601112472726">Yukl, 1989</xref>). In contrast, as discretionary extra-role behaviors, organizationally directed citizenship behaviors benefit the organization rather than the supervisor. Relational identification implies a supervisor focus as it is a feeling of “we” in employees’ social relationship with their supervisor. The perceived “oneness” with the supervisor may result in more immediate and significant effects on task performance than citizenship behaviors that are organizationally directed. Furthermore, in view of the importance of interpersonal relationships in a Chinese workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059601112472726">Hui, Lee, &amp; Rousseau, 2004</xref>), direct reports who have benefitted from the emotional family support provided by the supervisor will feel particularly obligated to reciprocate with behaviors that directly impact on the supervisor’s effectiveness.</p>
<p>In addition, our results also showed that job satisfaction mediated the family-friendly supervision–OCB relationship but not the family-friendly supervision–task performance relationship. These results are consistent with prior research that suggests job satisfaction has a stronger impact on OCB than it has on task performance (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1059601112472726">Organ, 1988</xref>). In line with this argument, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059601112472726">Bateman and Organ (1983)</xref> also found job satisfaction demonstrated a stronger impact on performance when the performance measure includes OCBs rather than only task-specific performance. Perhaps task performance is more constrained by job-specific knowledge and other situational factors. Drawing on Vroom’s expectancy theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1059601112472726">Vroom, 1964</xref>), even though a satisfied employee desires to work harder, his or her effort may not necessarily result in higher performance if he or she does not have the appropriate resources (e.g., raw materials, correct information, time) and lacks the relevant skills to do the job. Employee dissatisfaction does not necessarily result in lower task performance because organizational sanctions deter poor performance. By contrast, OCBs are discretionary behaviors beyond the job requirements. Employees who enact OCBs are not directly rewarded by the organization nor are they punished for failing to do so. Therefore, employees’ voluntary acts of goodwill directed at the organization are likely to be influenced by their attitude and affect at work. Furthermore, relative to task performance, one’s OCBs are less constrained by job-specific knowledge, individual skills, and other situational factors.</p>

<sec id="section22-1059601112472726">
<title>Practical Implications</title>
<p>The preceding findings have some practical implications. First, our findings provide actionable knowledge that organizations can leverage to enhance OCB and task performance. The influence of family-friendly supervision on the two performance measures suggests that the provision of family-friendly emotional support from supervisor is beneficial to employee productivity in a Chinese context. These effects on productivity provide strong support for the argument that developing family-friendly supervision is a legitimate business interest. An important part of the training program for Western expatriates sent to China may include educating expatriates to be sensitive and empathetic to employees’ concern about work-family conflict. Second, this research found that family-friendly supervision resulted in a greater degree of job satisfaction among people who experienced more rather than less work-family conflict. This finding suggests that managers should identify employees’ work-family conflict situation before providing family-friendly emotional support.</p>

<sec id="section23-1059601112472726">
<title>Limitations and Directions for Future Research</title>
<p>This study has some limitations and by discussing them, we are simultaneously highlighting directions for future research. First, employees provided ratings of the independent variables and mediators such as family-friendly supervision, work-family conflict, job satisfaction, and relational identification. Although reliance on self-reports raises concerns about common method variance, these constructs are perceptual in nature and can only be measured by the use of self-report. To address this potential limitation, we obtained ratings of the dependent variables from the direct supervisors of the respondents. The fact that some of the relationships reported in this study are not significant while others are significant further suggests that our results are not primarily attributable to common-method bias. Nevertheless, future research should obtain data on independent, mediator, and dependent variables from different sources to minimize common method bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1059601112472726">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &amp; Podsakoff, 2003</xref>). The second limitation stems from the cross-sectional design of our study, which constrains our ability to infer causality. For example, although supervisory family-support related to employee performance, it is intuitively plausible that high-performing employees are more likely to receive supervisory family-support. Future research that employs a longitudinal design may be better placed to establish the causal status of the relationships we examined. Third, we combined the five dimensions of OCB into a global measure so we were unable to ascertain the differential influence of the antecedents on these dimensions. Although this approach is consistent with previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059601112472726">Bommer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059601112472726">Hoffmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059601112472726">LePine et al., 2002</xref>), future research is needed to examine the effect of family-friendly supervision on each dimension of OCB and on OCBs directed toward supervisors, coworkers, and the organization. Fourth, our sample was drawn from a major pharmaceutical joint venture in a single country—China—therefore calling into question the generalizability of our findings to employees in other industries or countries. In view of the demonstrated influence of culture on the experience of the work-family interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059601112472726">Aryee, Fields, &amp; Luk, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1059601112472726">Powell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1059601112472726">Yang, Chen, Choi, &amp; Zou, 2000</xref>), future research in cross-cultural contexts will help ascertain the generalizability of our findings. For example, a useful direction for future research would be to investigate whether and how a particular cultural value (i.e., harmony, hierarchy, etc.) moderates the effect of supervisor emotional support on work-related outcomes.</p>
<p>Fifth, this study measured family-friendly supervision at the individual rather than organizational level. We did not model family-friendly supervision as group-level phenomenon because employees in the same organization or work unit may differ in their perceptions of supervisor family-friendliness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059601112472726">Lambert &amp; Waxman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601112472726">Mauno et al., 2005</xref>). Although this approach is consistent with previous work-family research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601112472726">Mauno et al., 2005</xref>), future research might benefit from using aggregation methods to assess the level or strength of agreement at the group level in order to investigate group-level outcomes. In addition, future research should examine the effectiveness of other components of family-supportive work environment, such as family support from coworkers that we did not measure in this study. Sixth, although we recognize that relational identification provides a different perspective to understanding dyadic leadership process than LMX theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601112472726">Slush &amp; Ashforth, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1059601112472726">Sluss et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1059601112472726">Uhl-Bien, 2006</xref>), there is obviously some conceptual overlap between the two constructs. Therefore, we encourage future investigators to consider including LMX in their studies either as a potential control or to determine whether relational identification is distinct from LMX. Seventh, although our finding that relational identification and job satisfaction differentially mediated the influence of family-supportive supervision on task performance and OCB is interesting, these are only two of several intuitively plausible mechanisms through which family-supportive supervision may influence performance outcomes. Future research should examine other variables such as trust and self-efficacy as additional pathways through which family-supportive supervision may influence these outcomes. Lastly, results of the moderated analysis revealed work-family conflict to differentially moderate the influence of family-friendly supervision on job satisfaction and relational identification with supervisor. Future research that draws on Chinese cultural values such as traditionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601112472726">Chen &amp; Aryee, 2007</xref>) that shape employees expectations of the supervisor–subordinate relationship will help understand the boundary conditions of the family-friendly supervision–employee work experience relationships.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although organizations have responded to difficulties employees face in combining work and family responsibilities with formal family-friendly policies, supervisors play a critical role in the effective implementation of these policies through the informal family support they provide. The findings of our study have highlighted not only the influence of family-friendly supervision on employee performance but also the differential mediating influence of relational identification and job satisfaction on OCB and task performance, respectively. We hope the findings reported here will motivate future research to examine how and why a family-supportive work environment (formal and informal practices) influences important employee work-related attitudes and behaviors.</p>
