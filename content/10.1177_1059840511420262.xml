<abstract>
<p>Influenza pandemic was a global event in 2009 and intraschool transmission was its main spread method. The present study was designed to evaluate the absenteeism rate during the type A influenza epidemic. Four hundred and eight students from both a guidance school and high school in the Iranian capital were recruited in this retrospective study. The number of days of absenteeism, since the beginning of the school year until the end of the epidemic was recorded. Two hundred and thirteen students missed school during the disease epidemic because of related causes. In other words, 581 person day absences were reported during this period. The influenza pandemic has led to an increase in the absenteeism rate and may negatively affect the academic performance of the students. Teaching precautionary measures is an effective tool in reducing the number of days of sickness.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Swine Influenza (swine flu), first isolated from pigs in the 1930s, is a respiratory disease caused by type A influenza. The human-to-human transmission of the virus was first reported in the 20th century, following the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918. Two other, less deadly flu pandemics struck in 1957 and 1968. The world witnessed a novel H1N1 influenza pandemic in early 2009, when more than 2,000 cases of swine flu were detected in Mexico. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared swine flu pandemic by June, the same year. This was the first influenza pandemic in this century and the fourth since first flu pandemic reported during the World War I. The event not only affected a large number of individuals worldwide but also increased the number of daily visits to the medical centers. The disease was believed to be life threatening among the elderly, children, pregnant women, and those already suffering from underlying conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840511420262">Cox &amp; Subbarao, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840511420262">Neuzil, Wright, Mitchel, &amp; Griffin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840511420262">Principi, Espostico, Marchisio, Gasparini, &amp; Crovari, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840511420262">Simonsen, 1999</xref>). The high incidence of the disease led to a high number of days of sickness absenteeism among both the workers and students, leading to substantial problems. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840511420262">Brouwers, Cakici, Camitz, Tegnell, &amp; Boman, 2009</xref>)</p>
<p>Latest figures have revealed that about 60% of those diagnosed with type A influenza aged less than 18 years, adding that intraschool transmission accounted for the majority of the infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511420262">Cauchemez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511420262">Fraser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840511420262">Novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus investigation team, 2009</xref>). A large study conducted in the United Kingdom showed that the parents of the school children are 2 to 3 times more likely to become infected with the disease. Controlling the spread of the disease in the schools, therefore, is considered one of the most important strategies in fighting the global pandemic of influenza.</p>
<p>Studying the sickness absenteeism trend in schools during the peak of the disease plays a critical role in helping policy makers come to helpful decisions in preventing the spread of the disease. Moreover, considering the fact that sickness absenteeism is an important index in evaluating the function of the students in school, influenza is believed to negatively influence the educational function of the students by increasing the number of their days of sickness absenteeisms.</p>
<p>The present study was designed to determine the prevalence of sickness absenteeism among the students of schools in Tehran, the capital of Iran, during the peak type A influenza pademic, which had started at the same time as 2009–2010 school year (September 23, 2009 to May 12, 2010).</p>

<title>Study Setting and Population</title>
<p>The present retrospective descriptive study was conducted in an educational institution with 408 students studying in different grades of the guidance school and high school, located in Tehran. Students studying in the 6th to 8th grade of the guidance school along with those studying in 9th to 12th grade of high school were recruited. It should be noted that two different buildings, far apart from each other, were allocated for the guidance school and high school, indicating that students studying in each of these schools did not have any close contact. The students were all male and were in a similar socioeconomic status (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840511420262">Table 1</xref>). The mean time spent in school was similar for the students studying in different grades and schools and was equal to 8.5 hr/day (35% of the day) and 51 hr/week (30% of the week).</p>

<p>Precautionary measures were adopted against influenza in both school setting and included regular hand washing in break times, using masks regularly, leaving classrooms during break, leaving the door and windows of the classroom open during the day (in order to lower the viral load in the room), daily washing of the classrooms and corridors, and cancelling the exercise and swimming classes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1059840511420262">
<title>Case Identification</title>
<p>Since the initiation of the school year, all the students presenting influenza symptoms were referred to the clinic for further evaluation. The school physician thereafter recommended them to adopt the necessary measures, such as taking a rest, wearing mask, adding fruits and vegetables to regular diet, and regular hand washing, or to take the required medications, including antihistamines and acetaminophene, based on their symptoms. The students were dismissed from the school in case there was a strong suspicion for influenza in the presence of symptoms including severe coreaza and myalgia, headache, nausea, fever, and chills.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1059840511420262">
<title>Absenteeism Record System</title>
<p>Teachers were asked to report the number of students absent in each school day to a trained individual, unaware of the objectives of the study, who would call the student’s parents to seek the reason for their absenteeism. The name of the students who were absent, the date of absence, and the reason for missing school (such as illness, travel, emergencies, etc.) were recorded in a pre-prepared sheet. The students were asked to bring a document from their physician or parents explaining their reason of being absent. The completed sheets were kept in school office.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1059840511420262">
<title>Human Subjects Approval Statement</title>
<p>This project was approved by the Ethical Board Committee of the Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Institute in accordance with Helsinki declaration and the guidelines of the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education. All the parents agreed to participate in the study and therefore signed an informed consent.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The interval between the time the first and the last suspicious case of influenza was detected by the school practiosioner was considered the alert period. The phase started on October 18, 2009 in the guidance school and lasted for 12 days. In the high school, on the other hand, it started on October 24 and lasted for 15 days (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059840511420262">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The number of sickness absenteeisms to the point at which this study was conducted was 267 days for high school students and 314 for the guidance school students, showing a 3 and 10 times increase in the numbers reported at the same time in the previous year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059840511420262">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1059840511420262">2</xref>). Two hundred and thirteen students (102 from highschool [46%] and 111 from the guidance school [58%] missed school during the alert phase because of related causes. In other words, 581 person absence days were reported during this period. The ratio of this period to school days was 36% and 32% in the high school and guidance school, respectively. Some 68% of the absences in the high school and 70% of that in the guidance school occurred in the same period of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1059840511420262">Figure 3</xref>). Some 46% of the high school and 59% of the guidance school students were absent during the alert phase. The average absenteeism of a high school student and guidance school student was about 1.8 and 2 days, respectively. The frequency of those with a single absence was 59 and 75 in the high school and guidance school, respectively. For the high school and guidance school, the number for 2 consecutive days was 32 and 29, for 3 consecutive days was 24 and 11, and for 4 consecutive days was 6 and 2, respectively. Two high school students were absent for 5 and 6 consecutive days, each. No student was absent for more than 4 consecutive days in the guidance school.</p>

<p>The mean number of days missed by the guidance school and high school students during the epidemic was 2 and 1.8 days, respectively. Considering the fact that the epidemic lasted for 12 and 15 hr in each school, the absentees in the guidance school and high school missed about 16% and 11% of the school hours due to influenza during the epidemic; these rates were as low as 6% and 5% in a similar time last year (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1059840511420262">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The number of days absent is an important index in evaluating the students’ learning outcome and therefore is commonly used as a basis for further decision making. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511420262">Blumenshine, Vann, Gizlice, and Lee (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840511420262">Wolfe (1985)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840511420262">Fowler, Johnson, and Atkinson (1985)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511420262">Logan, Simons, Stein, and Chastain (2008)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840511420262">Harter (1988)</xref> have similarly studied the impact of the number of absent days in their studies on school performance.</p>
<p>In a study conducted with 5819 Icelandic students with the aim of evaluating the influence of adopting certain hygienic measures on their educational function, the mean number of absenteeism was 1.44 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511420262">Inga et al., 2007</xref>). Principi, Espostico, Marchisio, Gasparini, and Crovari (2003) studied 3771 students to evaluate the effect of influenza on the Icelandic population. About 352 of the students were diagnosed with influenza during the school year; 52% of them were infected with type A strain of influenza. The mean number of days absent was 5.1 days in the children diagnosed with influenza and 4.25 days for the others.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840511420262">Li and Leader (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840511420262">Glezen and Couch (1978)</xref> who also conducted several studies revealed similar results regarding the influence of influenza pandemic on the increased absenteeism rate among school children. They suggested the increase in the number of school absentees as the most important index altering at the time of an influenza epidemic, stressing that the rapid spread of the disease in schools may be behind this finding.</p>
<p>Considering the results of the present study, it could be concluded that the disease has a negative influence particularly on the educational function of the students. It also imposes economic burden to the country as schools should compensate the missed hours by planning makeup classes. Moreover, those who stay at home also need home care, a condition that per se forces parents not to attend work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840511420262">Sadique, Adams, &amp; Edmunds, 2008</xref>). These parents are also 2 to 3 times more likely to be diagnosed with influenza, a condition that makes them lose their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840511420262">Sadique et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the number of infected cases and the days absent, the classes and corridors were cleaned daily with Cresol solution 5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840511420262">Park &amp; Park, 1994</xref>). The trash cans in the school yard were emptied every break. The door and the windows of the classrooms were kept open during the break time, regardless of the fact that they were open during the class hours or not. All the schools’ sport programs were cancelled during the alert phase.</p>
<p>Certain precautionary measures such as hand washing and controlling the spread of particles while sneezing or coughing are considered the most effective methods in fighting influenza pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840511420262">Jefferson, Rivetti, Harnden, Di Pietrantonj, &amp; Demicheli, 2009</xref>). Such simple measures have shown promising results in preventing a large number of diseases. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840511420262">Mears et al. (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840511420262">Reichert et al. (2001)</xref> have also tried to show the efficacy of school-based vaccination in controlling the influenza pandemic in a society. This strategy not only imposes a heavy burden to the society but also is not always feasible because of possible adverse or hypersensitivity reactions to vaccine reported in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840511420262">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). The technique is not completely effective and therefore should be used in association with other methods.</p>
<p>School closure is another strategy devised by some countries at the time of severe epidemic of the disease. The technique has shown promising results in lowering the infection rate by 15% during the pandemic and 40% at the time of epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511420262">Cauchemez et al., 2009</xref>). While closing the schools can control the influenza epidemic, its negative effects on the educational function of the students should not be forgotten. The strategy also imposes heavy burdens to the educational system.</p>

<title>Implications for School Nurses</title>
<p>School nurses are the professional group responsible for controlling disease outbreaks in the schools. A structured plan for the prevention, early diagnosis, and management of possible epidemics in schools can minimize the spread of the disease and its complications, and subsequently lower the absenteeism rate among students. This systematic plan should certainly consist of family education as well as school environment improvement programs. All the students, their parents, and school staff should be aware of different components of these plans in order to react effectively during outbreaks. Thus, school nurses play a vital role in achieving educational goals in schools by controlling and reducing absenteeism rate during outbreaks.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Considering the cross-sectional nature of the study and the fact that the present study, to our knowledge, is the first such research conducted in Iran, the authors were not able to generalize their results to other schools in the country. It should be added that there is no registry for recording the school absentees in Iran. Establishment of such a registry might be helpful.</p>
