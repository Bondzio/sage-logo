<p><bold>Shorter Shifts for Medical Interns May Not Boost Patient Safety</bold>. <italic>U.S. News &amp; World Report</italic>, March 25, 2013. In 2011, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education established a national policy that “reduced the continuous-duty hours of first-year resident physicians from 30 to 16 hours.” Contrary to the findings of a larger study of 2,323 interns, a recent study at Johns Hopkins University reported that these changes did increase the duration of the interns’ sleep periods, but the authors reported “a significant increase in the number of potentially dangerous handoffs of patients from one resident to another.” The shorter hours also decreased the number and variety of training opportunities.</p>
<p><bold>Do We Need Humans?</bold> TED Radio, February 25, 2013, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.npr.org/2013/02/25/172900833/do-we-need-humans">http://www.npr.org/2013/02/25/172900833/do-we-need-humans</ext-link>. In this 40-minute, three-part presentation on human-robot interaction by MIT faculty, Sherry Turkle wonders, <italic>“Why are we at a point in our history when we would want to construct false relationships? Because when we construct robots, we are changing ourselves.”</italic> Turkle argues that “the social media we encounter on a daily basis are confronting us with a moment of temptation. Drawn by the illusion of companionship without the demands of intimacy, we confuse postings and online sharing with authentic communication.” But she suggests that digital technology is still in its infancy, and there is ample time for us to reshape how we build and use it. She also asks the intriguing question regarding replacing people with emotion-sensing robots: “Why are we outsourcing the thing that defines us as people?”</p>
<p><bold>Car Extras You’ll Love</bold>. <italic>ShopSmart</italic>, April 2013, pp. 75–77. This article describes many cutting-edge features that were formerly available only on more expensive models. These include foot-operated trunk and tailgate release systems, inflatable seatbelts, fatigue-monitoring systems, and active noise cancellation systems. The article also describes new “driver-cockpit”-specific features, including infotainment systems that allow the downloading of apps, blind spot-monitoring systems, collision warning systems, portable music inputs (via USB), displays with fuel range and economy, and backup cameras. Some vehicles are returning to the use of “old school, regular buttons and knobs for common radio and climate controls.”</p>
<p><bold>Your Car May Be Invading Your Privacy</bold>. By Chris Woodyard and Jayne O’Donnell, <italic>USA Today</italic>, March 25, 2013. Black-box accident recorders, providing details leading up to a crash (e.g., speed, steering and braking behavior, seat belt use), may be mandatory in new vehicles by 2014. These Electronic Data Recorders “are already built into 96% of new cars.” Connected car technology promises to make driving safer and reduce collisions, but this technology also collects driver and vehicle performance data (e.g, GPS tracking, travel patterns identified by analysis of wireless toll payment systems). Although data obtained from these and similar systems provide useful information to HF/E professionals engaged in highway and automotive cockpit design and vehicular safety, the systems are seen as threats to individual privacy. Various courts are arguing about using these data as evidence in criminal activities and accident investigation.</p>
<p><bold>Fines Slashed in Grain Bin Entrapment Deaths</bold>. By Howard Berkes &amp; Jim Morris, NPR, March 24, 2013, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.npr.org/2013/03/26/174828849/fines-slashed-in-grain-bin-entrapment-deaths">http://www.npr.org/2013/03/26/174828849/fines-slashed-in-grain-bin-entrapment-deaths</ext-link>. Approximately 180 people, 10% of them teenagers, have been killed in grain bin entrapments since 1984. This first article in a series addresses the process known as “walking down the grain” and the dangers of the grain silo quicksand effect. In addition, since 1972, about 480 victims were trapped at facilities where federal record-keeping was not mandated. Strategies for preventing such incidents can be reviewed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.npr.org/2013/03/27/175502091/simple-strategies-can-prevent-grain-bin-tragedies">http://www.npr.org/2013/03/27/175502091/simple-strategies-can-prevent-grain-bin-tragedies</ext-link>.</p>
<p><bold>New Video Technology Detects Likelihood of Ergonomic Injuries</bold>.

A video analytic technique developed by HFES Fellow Robert Radwin assesses the probability of repetitive motion injuries.</p>
<p><bold>Health Care Workers Face Ergonomic Challenges</bold>. By Laura Walter, <italic>EHS Today</italic>, December 26, 2012, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ehstoday.com/health/health-care-workers-face-ergonomic-challenges">http://ehstoday.com/health/health-care-workers-face-ergonomic-challenges</ext-link>. Electronic record keeping increases the likelihood of MSDs among medical personnel, according to HFES Fellow Alan Hedge.</p>
