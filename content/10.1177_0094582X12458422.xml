<abstract>
<p>Canadian trade and investment in Latin America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, an element of British world hegemony and its particular form of free-trade imperialism, laid the groundwork for Canada’s first independent foreign policy toward Latin America. The Canadian state’s articulation of its interest in Latin America in the 1940s was associated with the end of British hegemony and the rise of the United States as the new world hegemon. It is apparent that Canada’s location as a wealthy though politically less powerful nation within the core of the capitalist world system dates to the late nineteenth century and that Canadian capitalists played a significant role in this articulation.</p>
<p>El comercio de Canadá y la inversión en América Latina en el siglo XX y principios del XIX, característico de la hegemonía mundial británica y de su forma particular de imperialismo del libre comercio, sentó las bases de la primera política exterior independiente de Canadá hacia América Latina. La articulación del Estado canadiense de su interés en América Latina en la década de 1940 estuvo asociada con el fin de la hegemonía británica y el surgimiento de los Estados Unidos como potencia hegemónica del nuevo mundo. Es evidente que la ubicación de Canadá como una nación rica, aunque políticamente menos potente, en el centro del sistema capitalista mundial se remonta a finales del siglo XIX y que los capitalistas canadienses tuvieron un papel importante en esta articulación.</p>

<p>The question of Canadian relations with Latin America has been treated in academic and policy discussions only with the relatively recent development of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The political scientist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0094582X12458422">John Rochlin (1994)</xref> sees 1942, when Ottawa first declared Canada’s national interest in Latin America in an official memorandum, as the beginning of these relations. The memorandum stated that the Canadian national interest in Latin America involved (<italic>a</italic>) support of U.S. efforts to bring political and economic “stability” and “prosperity” to the region, (<italic>b</italic>) the securing of a position of commercial opportunity equal to that of the United States in accordance with the “traditional doctrines” of the Department of State in Washington, (<italic>c</italic>) the expansion of trade for the “mutual benefit” of Canada and Latin America, and (<italic>d</italic>) the further establishment of cordial relations with countries of Latin America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0094582X12458422">Government of Canada, 1942</xref>).</p>
<p>This policy position must be seen, however, as emanating from relations of decades before. Through a combination of the use of primary sources with an analytical approach to the development of the world capitalist economy, it is demonstrated here that Canada’s place as Britain’s sole “settler-dominion” in the Americas is the historic structure within which the relationship between Canada and Latin American nations developed. Canada’s proximity to the world’s economic and political leader in the early twentieth century made for a position of strength for Canadian capitalists and the Canadian state vis-à-vis Latin American states and capitalists, and it was this position that Ottawa sought to maintain by aligning itself with the U.S. political-economic program for the Americas in 1942.</p>
<p>Through an examination of the policy debates of the 1930s, it is further shown that Ottawa’s deliberate fostering of alliances with the United States to safeguard economic opportunities for Canada in Latin America—as had its not-so-deliberate historical alliance with Britain—could not have occurred any earlier than the 1940s because of Canada’s relationship with Britain and the empire. Britain had been Canada’s principal military and trading partner since at least the 1870s, and this had kept the Canadian state from breaking with it until a war-torn Western Europe gave new economic and political importance to the Americas. Canada thus emerged as an independent nation of the Americas in the 1940s, with the Canadian state taking charge of its own foreign interests for the first time. All of these historical developments—destruction in Europe, the diminishing power of Britain, and Ottawa’s embrace of the political and ideological goals of the United States in the Americas—contributed to the emergence of the United States as the world’s new hegemonic power.</p>
<p>The history of economic relations between Canada and Latin America in the early twentieth century is pertinent to current trends in international capital flows, trade relations between nations, and North-South inequality. The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were a time of economic volatility resulting from liberalized world trade and capital flows. Attempts by Latin American states to bring stability to national economies and promote economic development involved the introduction of policy measures to regulate capitalist activity. Canadian investors in the booming economies of Latin America resisted these measures by turning to the political force of a state that shared their expansionist interests—a dynamic that has more recently expressed itself in the Canadian state’s pursuit of “foreign investment protection agreements” with India, Indonesia, China, and Brazil and, similarly, bilateral trade agreements incorporating protections for Canadian mining companies and other investors (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0094582X12458422">Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Foreign Trade, 2002</xref>). Although the exchange of commodities between Canada and countries of Latin America was not extensive in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Canadian commodities enjoyed access to Latin American markets while Canada pursued protectionist policies toward Latin American exports. This configuration of inequality is echoed today in a range of bilateral and multilateral trade agreements (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0094582X12458422">Valiani, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Canada’s geopolitical location in relation to two great powers—Britain and the United States—in an earlier moment of world capitalist expansion has methodological implications for both historical and contemporary analysis. It invites an analytical reframing of world economic relations wherein the roles of wealthy but politically less powerful nations tend to be overlooked or underemphasized in favor of the role of the wealthiest and most powerful nation, the hegemon. Similarly, reflecting the separation of the political from the economic in Western liberal thought, the activities and agendas of capitalists and states are rarely traced historically in relation to each other. In reconstructing the dialectic between state power and Canadian investment in Latin America, the combined activities and interests of capitalists and states are shown to have been foundational to the power of the hegemon as well as to the power of the ensemble of nations understood as the core of the capitalist world system.</p>
<sec id="section1-0094582X12458422">
<title>Venturing Canadian Capitalists in the Early Twentieth Century</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X12458422">Giovanni Arrighi’s (1994)</xref> theoretical formulation, capitalism is a historical process that began unfolding in the sixteenth century, with the first-time fusion of the state and capitalist elements such as money changers, merchants, brokers, and wholesalers. While capitalist elements had existed in Eurasian and other trading systems prior to the sixteenth century, only in Europe did they come together with states, this powerful fusion propelling European states into the territorial conquest of Asia, Africa, and the Americas and leading to the development of a capitalist world economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X12458422">Arrighi, 1994</xref>: 11).</p>
<p>Arrighi traces four “systemic cycles of accumulation” in historical capitalism: the Genoese (ca. 1450–1640), the Dutch (ca. 1640–1790), the British (ca. 1790–1925), and the U.S. (ca. 1925–present). Each cycle consists of a phase of material expansion followed by a phase of financial expansion. A phase of material expansion is one of steady growth of the capitalist world economy along a well-defined path. During this phase, the activity of capitalists tends to be in productive sectors as aggregate demand and profit rates increase and investment follows. A phase of financial expansion is one of discontinuous change in which the established path has reached its limits and the world economy shifts onto another path via radical restructuring and reorganization. During this phase, given the ongoing nature of the pursuit of profit, capitalists tend to invest in speculative activity because demand and rates of profit in the productive sectors in which they have typically invested have shifted to a downward curve.</p>
<p>Though clearly an important category in Arrighi’s formulation of world systems theory, capitalists and their activities are given less historical attention than states in most world-systems analyses. Given what is considered here the key role of Canadian capitalists in shaping the policy direction of the Canadian state vis-à-vis Latin America, the business activity and political positioning of Canadian capitalists in Latin America must be traced with historical specificity without losing sight of the structural political-economic dynamics involved. As in Arrighi’s formulation, imperialism is seen here as a political-economic force propelling both capitalists and states and inherent in historical capitalism. In contrast to orthodox Marxian treatments, in which capitalists and waged workers are the fundamental categories of capitalism on a national scale, world-systems approaches consider states, capitalists, waged workers, slaves, and various types of peasants producing for the world economy crucial components of a capitalist system that is seen as evolving since the fifteenth century (for a full discussion of theoretical categories in world historical approaches, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0094582X12458422">Valiani, 2012</xref>: Chap. 1). Using Arrighi’s theoretical formulation, then, as a springboard, the activities of North American investors of the early twentieth century may be traced in the context of the British cycle of accumulation extending from the early nineteenth century to the 1920s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X12458422">Arrighi, 1994</xref>: 160).</p>
<p>After some 30 years of free trade based on the international gold standard, capital markets in London were teeming with money and credit by 1870. From 1870 through the 1920s, this money and credit traveled to many corners of the world, and Canadian as well as U.S. investors made the best possible use of it in productive and speculative economic activities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094582X12458422">1</xref></sup> Canadian investors, for the most part, either belonged to or tapped into a tightly knit financial community centered in Toronto and Montreal. The Canadian “financial village” in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries consisted of six large banks accounting for 43.4 percent of all bank assets in Canada, six insurance companies accounting for 84 percent of the Canadian life insurance market, and a handful of building societies and mortgage and savings and loan companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X12458422">Armstrong and Nelles, 1988</xref>: 6–8). Between the stronger individuals of this community there was much interplay. They sat on each other’s boards of directors, engaged in business deals, and promoted joint ventures, mostly in the financial and utilities sectors in Latin America, where an export boom offered a myriad of lucrative investment opportunities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0094582X12458422">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Bank of Montreal, for example, was closely tied to the Canadian Pacific Railway, the Halifax shipper and banker John Stairs, and the Sun Life Insurance Company, which had considerable investments in Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X12458422">Armstrong and Nelles, 1988</xref>: Preface). In Toronto, Senator George Cox was president of both the Bank of Commerce and the Canada Life Assurance Company, which had considerable investments in Cuba. He had close ties with Sir William Mackenzie, founder of the Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company, the utility company from which arose what has been called “Canada’s utilities imperialism” in Brazil, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Spain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0094582X12458422">McDowall, 1988</xref>: 6).</p>
<p>U.S. corporations, for their part, had begun outdoing their European rivals in industry by the late nineteenth century and continued expanding into Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean in the early twentieth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094582X12458422">Gilpin, 1975</xref>: 6). This had certain consequences for Canadian investors, industrialists, workers, consumers, and the governments of various provinces of Canada. The case of the utilities sector—a key sector for Canadian foreign investors—reflects some of the struggles involved in the expansion of the United States as an economic power and demonstrates that Canadian investors fared quite well in spite of the circumstances.</p>
<p>In 1903, Sir William Mackenzie and two other Toronto investors acquired the last franchise available for a hydroelectric plant on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls. The other two franchises had already been bought by two U.S. enterprises aiming to export electricity to the urban and industrial power markets of upstate New York (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X12458422">Armstrong and Nelles, 1990</xref>: 167–170). Though Mackenzie and friends had found a way into the Ontario hydroelectric market at a moment of increasing concentration by U.S. capitalists in the Canadian electrical utilities sector, their company, the Electrical Development Company, did not find much opportunity for growth in Ontario. The antimonopoly sentiment of industrialists and workers in Canada interested in cheap and secure power to further industrialization and increase living standards led to political mobilization, with the result that by 1910 the Ontario government had created the publicly owned Ontario Hydro. Ontario Hydro then set out to absorb Mackenzie’s hydroelectric plants and the two U.S. enterprises into its own operations. By 1921 Ontario Hydro had also managed to push Mackenzie to sell his other two companies, the Toronto Electric Light Company and the Toronto Street Railway Company, to municipal-level public corporations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X12458422">Armstrong and Nelles, 1990</xref>: 171, 172).</p>
<p>Because of the tensions caused by the “smallness” of the Ontario market, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X12458422">Armstrong and Nelles (1988</xref>: 25) put it, but, perhaps more important, the Ontario government’s interest in capturing it for the benefit of home-grown industrialization in Ontario, Mackenzie calculated higher, more easily attainable returns outside Canada. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0094582X12458422">McDowall (1988</xref>: 49) emphasizes, in early-twentieth-century Brazil Mackenzie came upon a state willing to preserve the rights of foreign capital as it exploited Brazilian resources—a far cry from the Ontario government’s active nurturing of industrial capital and labor at home. Montreal-based utilities companies such as the International Power Company and Montreal Engineering faced a slightly different situation of crowding-out from that in Ontario. Because the Quebec hydroelectric sector had been monopolized by U.S. companies, the Montreal-based companies sought and found markets in places such as Venezuela, Bolivia, El Salvador, and Jamaica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X12458422">Armstrong and Nelles, 1988</xref>: 251–253).</p>
<p>Canadian investors in the financial sector exemplify the more typically cited reasons for foreign expansion. Having monopolized and saturated Canadian markets with their services, Canadian banks and insurance companies opted for Latin American markets that were relatively nearby and showed promise given their export-based economies and liberalized investment markets. The manager of the Montreal branch of the Merchants Bank of Halifax, E. L. Pease, for example, was impressed by the flair of U.S. Americans and Britons who had been investing in sugar, tramways, and railways in Cuba. Pease made a trip to Cuba to investigate the possibility of opening a branch of the Merchants Bank in Havana in the late 1890s. By 1899 he had convinced his board of directors of the advantages of this plan, and the Havana branch was established, launching the previously “conservative” Merchants Bank of Halifax—which changed its name to the Royal Bank of Canada in 1901—into the realm of international operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X12458422">Ogelsby, 1976</xref>: 106, 107). Between 1899 and 1927 the Royal Bank established more than 65 branches in Cuba alone and more than 20 in the major cities of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Peru, and Venezuela (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X12458422">Ogelsby, 1976</xref>: 87, 93–99, 101–108, 113, 114, 145).</p>

<title>Economics Before Politics</title>
<p>As Britain’s sole settler-dominion in the Americas in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and a vast one at that, Canada was of vital importance to the British empire. Economically, it was a significant source of grain to Britain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094582X12458422">Cain and Hopkins, 1993</xref>: 272). Militarily, it was a source of soldiers for imperial wars. Geopolitically, with the growing reach of U.S. corporations and parallel growth of U.S. political influence Canada was important as the symbol of the empire in the Americas. The Canadian state was therefore kept subordinate to Britain in the management of Canadian external economic and political relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0094582X12458422">3</xref></sup> Both the Canadian state and Canadian foreign investors benefited from this relationship. Where institutional leverage was required in trade and investment-related dealings with Latin American states and capitalists, they relied on His Majesty’s representatives in the region and other parts of the British imperial machinery. The arrangement allowed Canada to excel in economic relations with Latin America well before establishing political and diplomatic ties with states of the region.</p>
<p>Prior to 1935, Britain had arranged several trade agreements for Canada, usually more favorable to Canada, with countries of Latin America including Venezuela, Argentina, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, and Brazil. By 1937 Brazil, among others, had begun requesting that Canada accord Brazilian commodities the most-favored-nation treatment that Canadian commodities had been accorded by Brazil years before through Britain’s efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12458422"><italic>Canada Gazette</italic>, 1937</xref>). After 1935, when the secretary of state for external affairs in Canada began negotiating trade deals subject to the permission of the secretary of state for Dominion affairs in London, the Canadian state continued to rely on British assistance in cases of conflict. In 1937 the secretary of state for external affairs asked Britain to intervene in trade negotiations with the Dominican Republic, which was displaying hostility toward Canada because of Canada’s abstention from the purchase of Dominican goods and its policy of heavily taxing Dominican dried fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0094582X12458422">PRO, Foreign Office, 1937b</xref>). The Dominicans had good reason to be hostile. For the years 1932 and 1933, the balance of trade between Canada and the Dominican Republic was highly unfavorable to the latter. In 1935 the Dominican Republic exported nothing to Canada while purchasing Canadian products to the value of Can$169,481 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0094582X12458422">PRO, ForeignOffice, 1937a</xref>). Clearly Canada was protecting its own fish and other primary-goods producers against Dominican producers of the same and similar goods. Because of Canada’s position of privilege as Britain’s settler-dominion in the Americas, it was able to pursue protectionist policies in trade dealings with Latin American states.</p>
<p>Especially in the 1920s and 1930s, Canadian investors involved in the fast-paced export-driven economies of Latin America were confronted by Latin American states attempting to regulate foreign investment and other aspects of their economies. Canadian investors were also confronted by Latin American people protesting foreign ownership and control of Latin American resources and by growing competition from Latin American capitalists. The increasing resistance to foreign investment and inclination toward regulation were not particular to Latin America. Throughout the early twentieth century, Europeans and European states were resisting the free flow of capital across national boundaries in an effort to protect national currencies and national economies in general from the volatility resulting from British-led free trade and the international gold standard (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0094582X12458422">Polanyi, 1944</xref>). Amidst this social and political upheaval, Britain’s representatives in Latin America found themselves charged with defending the interests of Canadian investors. The case of the Sun Life Assurance Company in Mexico demonstrates, on the one hand, the attempts of Latin American states to control capital flight and stabilize financial markets and, on the other hand, the responses of Canadian investors fortified by the clout of His Majesty’s representatives.</p>
<p>In 1935, an executive of the Sun Life Assurance Company called upon Mr. Murray, His Majesty’s representative in Mexico City, for assistance in the event of any “precipitate action” by the Mexican government. The contention was around Sun Life’s refusal to invest 70 percent of its reserves in Mexican securities in accordance with Mexican insurance law. The company was unwilling to comply with the law because it had begun closing down its operations in Mexico five years earlier and claimed to have only 3,000 policyholders left. Sun Life also claimed that there were not enough “gilt-edged” securities in Mexico to conform to the requirement of the law. Upon consultation with the Foreign Office, His Majesty’s legation in Mexico City agreed to defend Sun Life’s claims, smoothing the way for its complete divestment from Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0094582X12458422">PRO, Dominions Office, 1935</xref>).</p>
<p>The case of the Canadian Life Insurance Company in Cuba brings out the challenges presented to Canadian companies by rising Latin American capitalists in a context of newly introduced taxation schemes aimed at redistributing some of the wealth being accumulated in highly profitable sectors. Rather than meeting the challenge of competitors within the sphere of the market, Canadian companies sought the help of Britain to defeat competitors by wearing them down through lengthy legal battles. Britain provided this help even though it posed some threat to the welfare and security of British insurance companies in Cuba at a highly sensitive time. In March 1935 the Canadian Life Insurance Company submitted a complaint to His Majesty’s minister in Havana, Grant Wilson, concerning a Cuban company that had taken the name “Canadian Mutuality Corporation.” The Canadian insurance company objected to the Cuban company’s adoption of a Canadian-sounding name, which it felt was intended to “get clients for their business.” Upon consulting the provincial governor in Cuba, Wilson learned that the Canadian Mutuality Corporation was officially registered and entitled to operate as a mutual association and that the Canadian Life Insurance Company would have to lodge a formal complaint to pursue the matter further. The Canadian Life Insurance Company was wary, however, of overtly denouncing the Canadian Mutuality Corporation for fear that the situation would be used by “unscrupulous people” as a pretext for an attack on foreign companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0094582X12458422">PRO, Foreign Office, 1935a</xref>).</p>
<p>Evaluating the situation as an urgent matter of “national importance,” Wilson proposed sending the lawyer of the British legation in Cuba to take the appropriate action with the provincial governor. The British secretary of state for foreign affairs, Sir John Simon, was uncomfortable with the proposal because of the possible risks involved for British insurance companies operating in Cuba. What was more, in response to an inquiry by the Foreign Office about Canadian patent laws, the Department of External Affairs in Ottawa had identified at least two Canadian companies—Cuba Properties Limited and Cuba Real Estate Corporation Limited—that had been patented with names including the names of foreign countries on the basis of “necessity and expedience.” Despite the complications and contradictions, the Foreign Office in Britain decided that the matter demanded legal action via the British legation in Havana. By July 1935 five more Canadian insurance companies were raising complaints through the legation against two more Cuban companies with non-Cuban sounding names, the English Confederation and the London Assurance Company. Besides questioning the names of these Cuban companies, the Canadian companies claimed that they were evading the new taxes being levied on insurance companies by the Cuban government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0094582X12458422">PRO, Foreign Office, 1935b</xref>).</p>
<p>Where the stakes were especially high and the necessity therefore arose, the Canadian government actively participated in assisting Canadian investors in Latin America. The case involving President Gerardo Machado of Cuba and the Royal Bank of Canada is perhaps the prime example of the Canadian state working with His Majesty’s representatives in the defense of private Canadian interests in Latin America. Alongside its 65 branch banks in Cuba, the Royal Bank of Canada had made vertical investments in sugar, the country’s major export—in the Cuban Canadian Sugar Company, the Sugar Sales Corporation, and sugar mills in Tacajo, Baguanos, and Oriente, to mention a few (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X12458422">Ogelsby, 1976</xref>: 108). Commanding substantial amounts of sugar and capital in the Cuban economy and with close ties to the Cuban dictator, the Royal Bank was identified by journalists in Havana as a likely target of Machado’s opponents. When a panic among the bank’s customers ensued, Machado had the Cuban treasury forward US$7 million to assist the Royal Bank, thereby confirming the close cooperation between the bank and the dictator and further tarnishing the bank’s reputation. As political unrest mounted in Havana, the Royal Bank became an official target of Machado’s opponents in 1931.</p>
<p>Concerned about the situation, Hume Wrong, a member of the Canadian legation in Washington, wrote in August 1931 to the under-secretary for external affairs in Ottawa, Dr. O. D. Skelton. Skelton’s reply was sketchy but clear: he expressed “sympathy” for the revolutionary movement on “general principles” but regarded Machado’s continued dictatorship as the “lesser evil” given his willingness to protect Canadian interests in Havana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X12458422">Ogelsby, 1976</xref>: 108, 109). In early September 1931 the Royal Bank’s head office in Havana was bombed, and in the familiar pattern of British intervention on behalf of a Canadian company the British minister in Havana contacted Machado for confirmation of his continued assistance to the bank. By 1933 Machado was in need of asylum, which the Canadian government readily provided despite the negative political implications of such a move in a time of rising world fascism. The National Congress of the Unemployed in Ottawa protested the fallen dictator’s entry to Canada, linking it to the development of fascist movements in Canada and the rise of Hitler in Germany (<italic>Le Devoir</italic>, September 8, 1933). The manager of Sun Life Assurance Company and other officials of Canadian companies in Cuba also denounced Machado’s asylum in Canada, suddenly condemning the state terror and crime that they had quietly witnessed between 1927 and 1933.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0094582X12458422">4</xref></sup> Protests aside, by 1935 Machado wished to return to Canada, and upon being informed of this by the president of the Canadian Car and Foundry Company in Cuba the Canadian government granted him reentry to settle his unfinished financial affairs with the Royal Bank of Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X12458422">Ogelsby, 1976</xref>: 109).</p>

<title>The Politics of Economics: Policy Debates in the 1930s</title>
<p>Canadians in the 1930s were well aware of the upsurge of global economic and political instability and the questions this raised for Canada. The views of federal politicians, provincial leaders, industrial capitalists, and policy analysts differed on the subject of Canadian relations with Latin America, with only a minority arguing for expanded trade and the development of formal political ties with Latin American countries. An even smaller minority of Canadians called for the reassessment of Canada’s relationship with Britain and the empire that expanded trade and formal political ties with Latin America would have implied.</p>
<p>Canadian industrialists were some of the first advocates of Canada’s independence in the management of its external affairs. Seeing this large policy issue specifically through the lens of economic opportunities in Latin America, they considered it critical to build diplomatic relations that would strengthen trade between Canada and Latin America. The 1931 Canadian Goodwill and Trade Mission, consisting of 85 businessmen and 60 women, Sir George H. Perley (MP), four provincial government delegates, and the presidents of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Canadian Manufacturers’ Association, made path-breaking recommendations that led to debates in the Canadian Senate on Canadian trade with Latin America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0094582X12458422">PRO, Dominions Office, 1931</xref>). Apart from stressing the “modern” and organized nature of the countries visited (Cuba, Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil, Trinidad, and Bermuda) in an effort to undo Canadian perceptions of ongoing political instability in Latin America, the mission report made detailed suggestions for increased trade. Underlining the possibility of trade in complementary goods, it suggested that Canadian manufactures such as radiators, steam fittings, gas stoves, agricultural implements, and paper products could find markets in Latin America while Canadians could import more “fruit, hides, kuerbrace (a tanning extract), and casine (a milk product)” from Latin America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094582X12458422"><italic>Gazette</italic>, 1931a</xref>). For Elmer Davis, president of the Canadian Manufacturers’ Association and co-leader of the mission, the key to developing this new trade relationship was an upgrading of the status of Canadian trade commissioners in Latin America, giving them equal standing with representatives of other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094582X12458422"><italic>Montreal Gazette</italic>, 1931b</xref>).</p>
<p>In line with this recommendation, Senator C. Beaubien proposed, in a Senate debate, the appointment of Canadian representatives of diplomatic status to Latin America to rectify the “wholly impractical arrangement” whereby Canadian trade commissioners had to deal with Latin American governments through His Majesty’s representatives, who were in his view primarily charged with promoting British interests in the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0094582X12458422">PRO, Dominions Office, 1931</xref>: 423). Also concerned with British competition in the region but making a distinction between the political functions of diplomats and the commercially oriented functions of consuls, Senator Casgrain favored the creation of a Canadian consular service in Latin America similar to that of the United States. Casgrain envisioned an elaborate structure containing separate departments for transportation and shipping issues, commercial expansion, banking and insurance, and internal politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0094582X12458422">PRO, Dominions Office, 1931</xref>: 425). Clearly, for Canadian industrialists and their supporters in the Senate, Latin America was worthy of institutionalized economic relations, if not diplomatic relations as well.</p>
<p>For entirely different reasons, leaders in Quebec were making clear calls for formalized political relations between Canada and Latin America by the mid-1930s. These Francophone leaders were picking up on the gestures of Chilean, Brazilian, Mexican, Argentine, and other Latin American leaders who, since the 1920s, had been interested in developing political relations with Canada through the Pan-American Union to strengthen regional solidarity in face of the growing power of the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0094582X12458422">Rochlin, 1994</xref>: 12). Campaigning for Canada’s membership in the Pan-American Union, the publisher of Montreal’s well-respected <italic>Le Devoir</italic>, Henri Bourassa, saw the Pan-American Union as a means by which Canada and Latin America could defend themselves against U.S. “imperialist designs,” which were of vital concern to Francophone Quebec in a predominantly Anglophone continent (cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0094582X12458422">Rochlin, 1994</xref>: 13). For Latin American leaders, the sense of commonality was more rooted in Canada’s ties with Britain and Europe in general, as exemplified by Canada’s membership in the League of Nations, which many Latin American republics had also joined. Membership in the league was seen as indicative of Canada’s ideological affinity to European notions of international law and justice in contradistinction to the United States, which had kept its distance from the league (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X12458422"><italic>La Prensa</italic>, 1941</xref>).</p>
<p>As for elected officials in Ottawa, the question of managing Canadian political and economic external affairs was far more complex and of global dimensions. The principal debate in the House of Commons involved the weighing of two issues at the macro-level: Canadian security and trade opportunities for Canada, which was understood at the time to be “the world’s fifth-largest exporting nation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094582X12458422">PRO, Foreign Office, 1934a</xref>: 531). A small group of members of Parliament argued that Canadian independence in the management of its external affairs was crucial. Mr. Luchkovich (MP) of the Vegreville United Farmers of Alberta initiated the 1934 House of Commons debate on the need for a Canadian foreign policy. He argued that it was precisely because of Canada’s awkward geopolitical placement within both the empire and the Americas that it was necessary to identify its role in a changing world. While described in a telegram to the Dominions Office in London from a British representative in Ottawa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0094582X12458422">PRO, Foreign Office, 1934b</xref>) as “a radical in politics” because of his “dispassionate” views on the “British connection” given his Ukrainian origins, what is notable is Luchkovich’s unabashed utilitarian approach to the formulation of a Canadian foreign policy.</p>
<p>Luchkovich saw Canada within a triangular scheme with Britain at the apex and the United States as a powerful but friendly neighbor. Ties with the United States would offer surplus Canadian goods access to the flourishing markets of China, Japan, and New Guinea—practical replacements for European markets rife with “bankruptcy and economic nationalism” since World War I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094582X12458422">PRO, Foreign Office, 1934a</xref>: 532). Following such new directions, according to Luchkovich, would mean placing Canada’s interests above the general interests of the empire, ultimately moving Canada away from the obligation of backing Britain in the widely anticipated war in Europe.</p>
<p>While Luchkovich’s mention of Pacific trade was a warm one, probably largely because of the positive findings of the 1930 Canadian trade mission to East Asia, his reference to relations with Latin America was markedly cold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094582X12458422">PRO, Foreign Office, 1934a</xref>: 532, 533). The contrast highlights Luchkovich’s identification of the need to coordinate Canada’s foreign political relationships with its economic relationships. With regard to Latin America, Luchkovich asserted that Canada should not undertake the political risks of joining the Pan-American Union, thereby involving itself in struggles over U.S. expansionism and other “contentious issues” between Latin American republics and the United States, when Canada’s interests in Latin America were “merely remote and indirect” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094582X12458422">PRO, Foreign Office, 1934a</xref>: 531).</p>
<p>Quite apart from Canadian industrialists, French Canadian leaders, and the likes of Luchkovich, Canada’s chief politicians were far more hesitant and even unable to question Canada’s obligations to Britain and the empire. At the same time, they were well aware of the sacrifices involved for Canada in maintaining these obligations. Officials therefore held seemingly contradictory views. The Conservative Prime Minister Bennett urged that Canada maintain its “passivity” in world affairs given its lack of an army or navy, reflecting the inability of Canadian officials to contemplate the potential growth of an independent Canadian military, much less an independent Canadian foreign policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094582X12458422">PRO, Foreign Office, 1934a</xref>: 539, 541). Reflecting the nationwide distaste for the idea of Canadian participation with Britain in another war, Major General McRae, once quartermaster-general of the Canadian Overseas Forces and chairman of the Conservative Party Convention, expressed unwillingness to sacrifice Canadian lives in “another European war” while at the same time refusing to envision a place for Canadian grain surpluses outside of the British empire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0094582X12458422">PRO, Foreign Office, 1934c</xref>: 341).</p>
<p>On the whole, “the myths of empire” (as they were termed by a dissident voice of the time) were quite alive for the Canadian political elite throughout the 1930s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X12458422">Canadian Institute of International Affairs, 1938</xref>: 7). As illustrated above, this is because these “myths” were materially grounded. Economically and militarily Canada was fundamentally dependent on its ties with Britain and had been for over 50 years. To undo this dependency would involve the orchestration of a host of new policy goals, roles, and relationships—a project of change in which the established Canadian elite was not prepared to invest as long as Britain remained powerful on a world scale.</p>
<p>Discussions of Canada’s membership in the Pan-American Union in the Canadian Institute of International Affairs further demonstrate this unwillingness to invest in change. A “Latin American connection,” as opposed to one with the empire, was seen as “artificial” for Canada, and expanded trade with the region was seen as yielding few benefits given the noncomplementary nature of leading Canadian and Latin American export products. The political apprehension about joining the Pan-American Union was that it would be a step toward “dominance” by the United States. Hesitation about such dominance was rooted not in the subjugation—economic and otherwise—that it might have implied for Canada but in the perceived lack of U.S. experience in leading world affairs. The United States’ inability, for example, to persuade Pan-American Union member countries to adopt a position of neutrality in the coming war was seen as reflective of poor leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X12458422">Canadian Institute of International Affairs, 1938</xref>: 7, 8).</p>
<p>As late as November 1938, when chief Canadian officials were admitting to the likelihood of Canadian cooperation with the United States in interregional security matters for a temporary period during the war, they remained reluctant about joining the Pan-American Union. In a speech made during an official visit to Washington in November 1938, Prime Minister Mackenzie King responded to President Roosevelt’s Pan-American defense plan by saying that the plan “struck a note of cooperation on a matter of common interest and concern” but that the upcoming Pan-American Union conference in Lima “was not a pressing matter so far as Canada was concerned” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X12458422">PRO, Foreign Office, 1938</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the British imperial superstructure in the late 1930s and early 1940s there were various readings of and reactions to the idea of Canada as an independent nation of the Americas. In the covering dispatch of a communication regarding Canada’s commercial agreement with Brazil, a member of the chancery in Rio referred to the Canadian secretary of state for external affairs as the “minister of external affairs,” striking the wrong chord at the Treaty Department of the Dominions Intelligence Unit in London (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0094582X12458422">PRO, Foreign Office, 1937b</xref>). The error and the Treaty Department’s curt note bringing attention to it are indicative of the varying reactions to the gradual distancing of Canada from Britain. While the departments in Britain still preferred to maintain the image of Canada as a subordinate settler-dominion, to British representatives in Latin America it was becoming apparent that direct links between Canada and Latin America were in the making.</p>
<p>Representatives of Britain in Canada adopted a defensive stance similar to that of the government departments in Britain. In writing home about the prime minister’s visit to Washington, a British representative at the Office of the High Commissioner in Ottawa drew more far-reaching conclusions regarding Canadian-American cooperation than Canadians themselves were willing to make. The representative anticipated that King and Roosevelt would discuss not only the Pan-American defense plan but also “the ultimate aim” of U.S. defense policy in the Americas, Canadian trade interests in Latin America, and a “programme of economic activity” to check German and Italian incursions into the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X12458422">PRO, Foreign Office, 1938</xref>). Meanwhile, as suggested by the front-page headline of the <italic>Globe and Mail</italic> (November 17, 1938), “King, Roosevelt to Debate Defence and Jewish Haven—White House Conference Viewed as Significant, Two Trade Agreements will be Signed Today,” the Canadian focus was on the discussion of the defense plan, the mounting refugee problem, and the “Anglo-American-Canadian solidarity” symbolized by the reciprocal trade agreements signed by Canada and the United States and Britain and the United States. The principal Anglophone newspaper of Montreal, the <italic>Gazette</italic> (November 17, 1938), homed in on the same themes, making very little reference to Canadian trade with Latin America and none at all to a program of economic activity of any kind.</p>
<p>In the early 1940s, as the war-torn economy in Britain made the retention of British imperial extensions all the more imperative, the Foreign Office began seeing advantages in an independent Canadian presence in the Americas, specifically through Canada’s participation in the Pan-American Union. In a Foreign Office meeting in August 1940, the idea of a Canadian delegation to the union was favored because a Canadian delegation could use its influence to prevent resolutions adversely affecting “the future of British possessions in the West Indies” and counter the efforts of Argentina and Guatemala “to raise the problems of the Falkland Islands and British Honduras.” The idea was not proposed to Ottawa in 1940 because the Foreign Office was “virtually certain” that it would be met with “a rebuff” and because Britain’s principal requirement of Canada at the time was continued support in the war against the Axis powers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0094582X12458422">PRO, Foreign Office, 1940</xref>).</p>
<p>By December 1941 the Foreign Office saw Canadian membership in the Pan-American Union as “the thin end of a wedge,” the “thick end” being eventual membership for the UK, the Netherlands, and even France, given all of their territorial possessions in the Western Hemisphere. Once again, however, because of preoccupation with the war, the ideas were not brought up for discussion with Ottawa. Furthermore, the Foreign Office was hesitant because such discussions would raise “far-reaching questions, constitutional and otherwise,” pertaining to the national status of Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0094582X12458422">PRO, Foreign Office, 1941a</xref>).</p>
<p>For its part, Washington was very keen on Canada’s increased involvement in hemispheric affairs from the late 1930s onward. After the fall of France in June 1940 and following from the 1938 proposal for a Pan-American defense plan, the White House announced a plan to unite 22 countries of the New World, including Canada, in a cartel controlling foodstuffs, raw materials, and other exportable items of wealth of all member nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0094582X12458422"><italic>News Chronicle</italic>, 1940</xref>). No mention of the Pan-American Union was made in the plan, Washington’s interest in including Canada in the cartel being part of a broader strategy for consolidating the economic and political power of the Western Hemisphere to foil the flourishing of fascism in Europe. The Bretton Woods institutions of a few years later would flow from a similar spirit of consolidating economic and political power for the stable management of exchanges between nations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0094582X12458422">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Within this setting of increasing destruction in Western Europe and the relatively unscathed Americas, the Canadian minister of trade and commerce began organizing the first official trade mission to Latin America in 1940 with the aim of fostering commercial opportunities to replace the dwindling markets of Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094582X12458422">McKenna, 1995</xref>: 70, 71). Also in 1940, diplomatic relations were established with an insistent Brazil interested in more Canadian investment like that of the Brazil Traction, Light and Power Company. Ottawa then began making arrangements for diplomatic relations with Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Cuba (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0094582X12458422">Rochlin, 1994</xref>: 15).</p>
<p>Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor in early December 1941, Ottawa began petitioning to attend the next Pan-American Union meeting, scheduled for February 1942 in Rio, where urgent and longer-term military and economic issues were to be discussed. The agenda of the meeting was divided under the headings of “Protection of the Western Hemisphere” and “Economic Solidarity within the Americas” and included such topics as the curbing of alien activities within the Americas, export controls for the conservation of basic and strategic materials, the supply of essential imports for the maintenance of domestic economies, and the development of objectives for the reconstruction of world order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0094582X12458422">PRO, Foreign Office, 1941b</xref>).</p>
<p>These moves by Ottawa beginning in 1940—the official trade mission to Latin America, the establishment of diplomatic relations with Brazil, and the attempts to attend the 1942 Pan-American Union meeting—should be seen as the Canadian state’s launching itself into the orchestration of new policy goals, roles, and relationships, the project of change that it had resisted throughout the 1930s. Why did the Canadian elite finally accept the possibility of Britain’s demise and the notion of Canada as separate from and independent of the empire, with interests of its own to elucidate and manage? Simply put, it was the concreteness of the effects of war on Britain, to the east of Ottawa, and the material threat posed by the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, to the west of Ottawa, that forced the Canadian elite to begin relying on itself and stake out a place for Canada as an independent nation in the Americas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0094582X12458422">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Though Washington blocked Canada from attending the Pan-American Union meeting of February 1942 because it regarded Canada as a mere front for British interests in Latin America, the State Department did issue a policy recommendation for Canada’s membership in the Pan-American Union in 1944.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0094582X12458422">7</xref></sup> By this time Ottawa had declared Canada’s national interest in Latin America along ideological lines that were consistent with the U.S. vision for the Americas, and the United States was fully convinced that Britain was no longer capable of intercepting its full exercise of the Monroe Doctrine in the Americas.</p>

<sec id="section4-0094582X12458422">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Because of its economic, geopolitical, and military value for Britain and the empire, Canada’s external relations were closely scrutinized and largely determined by Britain until 1940. Though constraining in certain respects, this historically grounded arrangement allowed major Canadian trade and investment interests to advance in Latin America, where they were sheltered by Britain’s well-established imperial institutions. Canadian investors fared particularly well in the booming markets of Latin America with the help of political leveraging from Britain when tensions arose between Canadian investors and Latin American states and capitalists. This success and the means by which it was achieved were formative in the shaping of Canada’s national interest in Latin America, as first declared in Ottawa’s 1942 “Memorandum on Canadian Policy in Latin America.” Not only was the national interest framed heavily in terms of material concerns but its ideological thrust reiterated Washington’s prescription of open commercial relations as key to stability and prosperity for all nations.</p>
<p>Needless to say, there was nothing in the 1942 memorandum relating to the aim of countering U.S. imperialism as proposed by Latin American and French Canadian leaders in the 1920s and 1930s. In witnessing the mounting destruction of war in Western Europe and the unexpected attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan, the Canadian elite was confronted with the growing economic and political significance of the Americas and Canada’s place within it. The Canadian state thereby began forging a role for Canada as an independent nation of the Americas. Given the nature of the existing trade and investment relations between Canada and countries of Latin America and the eagerness of Canadian industrial capitalists to penetrate Latin American markets, it became imperative for the Canadian state to align itself with rather than oppose the United States and its vision for the Americas. In this way, the Canadian state contributed to the emergence of the United States as the new hegemonic leader of the Americas and the world.</p>
<p>In focusing on the little-known history of economic and political agents of a wealthy but politically less powerful nation, this study brings out some of the ways in which such nations participate in shaping and benefiting from the structures of a stratified world economy. The less prominent but constituent role of these agents and nations of the core of the capitalist world system must be addressed and contended with, along with the role of the most powerful nation, if significant social change is to be achieved on a global scale.</p>

<p>Liberalized trade and capital flows tend to give rise to activities that are productive and speculative at the same time. Many of the service-sector activities described in this study may be seen as such. Even investment in the processing of sugar in the early twentieth century can be seen as at once productive and speculative. This type of investment made for the bear markets of the 1920s.</p>
