<p>In recent years, there have been many research studies developed in the field of natural fibre-reinforced composites. Natural fibres offer many advantages such as low cost, low density, acceptable specific properties, biodegradability and availability of renewable resources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684413481863">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684413481863">2</xref></sup> Studies have already indicated that natural fibres could be used as reinforcement in polymeric composites replacing some non-renewable synthetic fibres such as fibre glass, especially in low-pressure laminating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684413481863">3</xref></sup> However, the natural fibres do suffer a few limitations such as low compatibility with the polymeric matrix because of their typical hydrophilic characteristic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684413481863">4</xref></sup> Unsaturated polyesters are extremely versatile in properties and applications and have been a popular thermoset used as polymer matrix in composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684413481863">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684413481863">6</xref></sup> This matrix has been used for many years in broad technology fields such as naval construction, offshore applications, waterlines and building construction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684413481863">2</xref></sup> The reinforcement of polyester with various cellulosic fibres has been widely reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684413481863">6</xref></sup> Rajulu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684413481863">7</xref></sup> used bamboo fibres as reinforcement with epoxy/unsaturated polyester blend for tensile properties and chemical resistance. Brahim and Cheikh<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684413481863">8</xref></sup> extracted alfa fibre with soda and observed the influence of fibre orientation of their unidirectional fibre in the composite with unsaturated polyester matrix. All the lignocelluloses based on natural fibres consist of cellulose micro-fibrils in an amorphous matrix of lignin and hemi-cellulose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684413481863">9</xref></sup> Most of the lignocellulosic fibres in Brazil have been used as reinforcement in composites in car seats stuffing, helmets for cyclists and in textile industries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684413481863">10</xref></sup> The natural fibres can be extracted from different parts of plants such as stems, leaves, roots, fruits and seeds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684413481863">9</xref></sup> Usual sources of fibre are cotton, jute, coconut, sisal, banana, bamboo, pineapple, sugarcane, rice, curauá and kenaf. These fibres present a vast diversity of applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684413481863">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684413481863">10</xref></sup> The mechanical properties of a plant fibre–polymer matrix composite are controlled to a large extent by the efficiency of the bonding at the fibre–matrix interfacial boundary. The principal function of the interface is to facilitate the transfer of stress from matrix to fibre. Cellulose fibre is, however, known to exhibit poor bonding characteristics with a polymeric matrix. This is mainly due to the presence of organic and inorganic substances on the fibre surface, and the hydrophilic nature of cellulose, which prevents effective adhesion between the fibre surface and the polymer matrix. The surface of plant fibre such as sisal fibre is usually not suitable for creating a strong bonding with a polymeric matrix. The bond strength has, however, been successfully improved by modifying the fibre surface with either chemical or physical surface treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684413481863">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In previous works, composites with peach palm fibres in unsaturated polyester matrix have been studied, including thermal and morphological characterisations of the fibres, their chemical treatment, the effect of the size range and loadings of particles, as well as the orientation effect of fibres in the mechanical behaviour of these composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684413481863">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684413481863"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684413481863"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684413481863">15</xref></sup> The aim of this work was to investigate the feasibility of new unsaturated polyester resin in the preparation of composites with variable kenaf fibre percentage using an UV irradiation technique. This study focused on the effect of fibre content on flexural, impact, tensile strength behaviour and water absorption profile of such unsaturated polyester resin-/fibre-reinforced composites. Gel fraction study was conducted to determine the degree of curing and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to show the evidence of the enhancement of the compatibility between fibre and polymer matrix.</p>

<p>The main setup consisted of a 500-mL reaction flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer (2000 r/min) with dry nitrogen inlet and outlet. A mixture of palm oil (162.26 g) and 0.1% sodium hydroxide were placed in the reaction flask, 27.74 mL of glycerol (within the molar ration 1:2.2) was put inside the dropping funnel which was fitted to the reaction flask and was added in a drop-wise manner.

In the following step, a small amount of sample was taken out by means of a glass rod to test the solubility in ethanol. The test continued until solution was obtained where no emulsion or white spots were observed. Then the mixture was cooled in ice water, and poured into a sealed beaker for the next experiment.</p>

<p>The main objective of this study is to synthesise a new UPRC<sub>a–e</sub> of variable kenaf fibre percentage using a ultraviolet irradiation technique in the presence of styrene as cross-linking agent and IRGACURE 1800 as photoinitiator. MG monomer was prepared by the interaction of palm oil and glycerol in the presence of sodium hydroxide as basic catalyst. UPR based on palm oil were prepared with various MG: MA ratios as illustrated before in a previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684413481863">18</xref></sup> by the interaction of the corresponding MG monomer, with different equivalents of MA, in the presence of 2-methylimidazole as catalyst. Finally, UPRC<sub>a–e</sub> composites of various kenaf fibre percentages were synthesised using ultraviolet curing technique in the presence of styrene and free radical initiator IRGACURE 1800. Kenaf fibre loading at 25% is considered as the maximum kenaf fibre percentage used for the preparation of the investigated UPRC. Composite with 30% kenaf fibre was not completely cured. This may be attributed to unavailability of the ultraviolet radiation to penetrate the thicker fibre mat.</p>
<p>The various characteristics of the resulting UPRC<sub>a–e</sub> including mechanical properties (tensile, flexural and impact), gel fraction and dimensional stability (water absorption and thickness swelling) test were determined and the data were discussed. In addition, SEM study of UPRC was also investigated as shown below.</p>
<p>Gel fraction refers to the degree of curing that occurs for each prepared UPRC. From the results given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684413481863">Figure 1</xref>, it can be clarified that all the presented UPRC formulations have gel fraction values ranging from 83.88% to 94.78%. UPRC<sub>b</sub> shows the highest gel fraction value of 94.78% (± 0.22) whereas UPRC<sub>e</sub> shows the lowest gel fraction value of 83.88% (0.62). The order of gel fraction values for all UPRC formulations is in the following sequence: UPRC<sub>b</sub> &gt; UPRC<sub>a</sub> &gt; UPRC<sub>c</sub> &gt; UPRC<sub>d</sub> &gt; UPRC<sub>e</sub>. There is no significant difference in the gel fraction between UPRC<sub>a</sub> and UPRC<sub>b</sub>. However, it decreases for the other formulations which have high percentages of kenaf fibre. This may be attributed to the increase of kenaf fibre in these formulations which has resulted in the reduction of UV light transmittance. Hence, UV energy is insufficient to cure the composite and subsequently composite with lower gel content is obtained. In other words, composites with higher kenaf content produce composite with lower degree of curing due to the blockage of UV light.
<fig id="fig1-0731684413481863" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Gel fraction for UPRC<sub>a–e</sub>.</p>
<p>UPRC: unsaturated polyester-reinforced composite.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684413481863-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>However, the other obstacle to be resolved in producing a good lignocellulosic-based composite in terms of mechanical and physical properties is the compatibility between the reinforcement material and polymer matrix. Higher compatibility means more van der Waals forces as well as hydrogen bonding between OH segments of kenaf fibres with C = O of UPR. As the percentage of kenaf fibre increases within the polymer matrix the extent of UV penetration is decreased which subsequently affects the completion of curing. During the curing of UPRC by UV radiation, the photoinitiator absorbs the radiation and disintegrates to produce free radicals. Hence, more cross-links would be produced at the unsaturation sites along the polymer matrix molecular chain. From all the earlier results, it was found that composites UPRC<sub>a</sub> and UPRC<sub>b</sub> were considered the best prepared composites and 5–10% of kenaf fibre was considered the best prepared fibre mat suitable for such composites. This phenomenon is the result of combination of factors such as degree of UV penetration, compatibility of kenaf with UPR matrix as well as degree of cross-linking.</p>
<p>One of the most important factors that influence the mechanical properties of the plant fibre is its chemical composition. According to Habibi et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684413481863">20</xref></sup> the cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin contents were found to have a strong influence on the mechanical properties to the fibre itself. However, among these three components, the mechanical properties of the fibres are strongly influenced by the cellulose content. This is because cellulose is the main structural component that provides strength and stability to the plant cell walls and the fibres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684413481863">21</xref></sup> while Ray and Rout<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684413481863">22</xref></sup> reported that the cellulose is one of the stiffest and strongest organic constituents in a natural fibre. In general, it can be said that the higher cellulose content leads to higher mechanical properties of the fibres. As reported in the literature<sup>23</sup> that kenaf fibre has cellulose content as high as 60.8%. The mechanical behaviour of UPRC<sub>a–e</sub> of variable kenaf percentages was studied by tensile and impact tests. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684413481863">Figures 2 to 5</xref> show the tensile properties (strength, strain, modulus and toughness) of all UPRC formulations using variable kenaf fibre percentages. It is generally believed that the increase in the fibre mat thickness subsequently reduces the ultraviolet penetration. Hence, it adversely affects the properties of the resulting composite. All the prepared UPRC<sub>a–e</sub> has the same chemical composition (MG)/(MA) ratio (1:4 eq./eq.). From the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684413481863">Figure 2</xref>, it can be seen that tensile strength regularly increases when the kenaf fibre content is increased. The tensile strength increases as the kenaf fibre percentage within the composite is increased and reaches a maximum value in UPRC<sub>b</sub> (10% kenaf fibre), followed by a decrease in UPRC<sub>c</sub>, UPRC<sub>d</sub> and UPRC<sub>e</sub> with higher kenaf percentages 15%, 20% and 25%, respectively.

<p>The highest tensile strength of 12.62 (± 0.72) MPa was observed at 10% of fibre loading. Therefore, kenaf content has improved the tensile strength of the composites. It can be said that the reinforcement effect has taken place. The decrease in the tensile strength for composites with fibre loading &gt;10% may be attributed by factors mentioned earlier. This trend may be due to the poor interaction between fibre and matrix. Tensile toughness showed similar trend as tensile strength as represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684413481863">Figure 3</xref>. Moreover, the tensile modulus for the UPRC shows a sharp decrease as the kenaf fibre percentage is increased starting from 827.34 (± 24.02) for UPRC<sub>a</sub> with 5% kenaf fibre to 536.68 (± 40.85) for UPRC<sub>e</sub> with 25% kenaf fibre as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684413481863">Figure 4</xref>. The amount of matrix is subsequently decreased as the fibre loading is increased (constant density for all samples). Thus, this has adversely been affecting the stiffness of composite which is mainly contributed by the fibre. This phenomenon is in contrast with the works conducted before where the increase of lignocellulosic fibre in composite could result in increment of composite stiffness due to the inherent stiffness of the lignocellulosic fibre.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684413481863">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731684413481863"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731684413481863">26</xref></sup> This is probably attributed by the degree of curing of the composites. As observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684413481863">Figure 1</xref>, the degree of curing decreases as the kenaf fibre content is increased due the degree of UV radiation penetration. With other word, the uncured portion of UPR (polymer matrix) increases as the kenaf fibre content is increased. This uncured UPR could act as a plasticiser or a weak point in polymer matrix and lower the stiffness of the composites. This explains that the overall composites strength and stiffness are also affected by the degree of curing of polymer composites when the kenaf fibre content in composite is varied.

<p>A significant trend is observed for the tensile strain percentage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684413481863">Figure 5</xref>) where the results are in the range 1.38 (± 0.21)−1.82 (± 0.10). The strain increases with increasing kenaf fibre percentage within the composite formulation as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684413481863">Figure 5</xref>. This indicates that the stiffness of the composites decreases as the percentage of uncured UPR is increased. It is in agreement with the results of stiffness in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684413481863">Figure 4</xref>.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684413481863">Figures 6 to 8</xref> show the flexural properties (strength, modulus and toughness) of the UPRC<sub>a–e</sub>. Nearly similar trend as shown in tensile properties is observed except for flexural strength for UPRC<sub>c–e</sub> which shows sharp decrease, which may be attributed to the incomplete curing for such UPRC formulations due to the difficulty of UV penetration as explained in the previous section. Furthermore, flexural toughness shows similar behaviour as tensile toughness values where the results are in the range 2.14 (± 0.12)−0.27 (± 0.19). It also can be noticed that the optimal fibre content in order to obtain the highest flexural strength for both composites was 10 wt%. As for impact strength, which is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684413481863">Figure 9</xref>, the prepared UPRC show the same trend as for both tensile and flexural strength. The highest impact strength is at 1.92 (± 0.27) for UPRC<sub>b</sub>, whereas the lowest value is at 0.75 (± 0.13) for UPRC<sub>e</sub>. Hence, the same explanation probably holds in this regard. The general conclusion can be said that the fibre loading and degree of curing significantly affect the mechanical properties of the composites. It shows that the fibre contributes in increasing the tensile strength of the composites. It can also be observed that the composite of 10% fibre content showed the highest tensile strength for the resulting kenaf fibre composites which represents the optimal fibre content. Generally, increasing the fibre content in UPR leads to a lower elongation at break of the composite. In addition, as the fibre content increased to 30%, the UPR was insufficient to wet the fibre entirely and led to poor interfacial bonding between the fibre and the matrix.

<p>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0731684413481863">10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0731684413481863">11</xref> show the results of dimensional stability in the form of water absorption and thickness swelling for UPRC<sub>a–e</sub> as a function of immersion time. Each data point represents the average of four specimens. Lignocellulosic material is hydrophilic with the presence of OH groups in the cell wall which mostly come from cellulose and hemi-cellulose. These groups absorb water through the formation of hydrogen bonding. Like other wood fibres, kenaf is also hydrophilic. The fibre cell wall polymers have hydroxyl- and oxygen-containing groups that can interact with water molecules via hydrogen bonding. Fibre–water interaction can lead to a build up of moisture in the fibre cell wall that would result in fibre swelling and adversely affect dimensional stability of such composites. It can be seen from Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0731684413481863">10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0731684413481863">11</xref> that the prepared UPRC has significant values from water uptake and thickness swelling ranging between 12.05–26.65% and 6.11–11.83%, respectively.

<p>UPRC<sub>a</sub> and UPRC<sub>b</sub> as can be seen in the Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0731684413481863">10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0731684413481863">11</xref> exhibited a smaller amount of water uptake after 16 days of water exposure at room temperature as compared with other composites. Nearly similar patterns of dimensional stability curves, i.e. linear increase followed with a gradual increase before constant values are achieved. After 16 days the absorption of composites reaches saturation points, where the content of water in the composites remains nearly the same.</p>
<p>This can be explained by the kenaf loading in UPRC<sub>a</sub> and UPRC<sub>b</sub> where lower kenaf fibre content has lower tendency to absorb water. For UPRC<sub>c–e</sub> composites, with higher fibre loading (15%, 20% and 25% fibre loading) large amounts of water uptake is observed. This is true since more kenaf fibre means more cell-wall polymers are available to attract water molecules by hydrogen bonding. In addition, the composites may also absorb water via capillary action that occurs at the sample edges where fibre ends are exposed due to sample cutting. Through this mechanism, water molecules are transported along the fibre–matrix interface through flaws and voids that exist within the region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731684413481863">27</xref></sup> From the earlier results, it can be said that water absorption and thickness swelling increase as the kenaf fibre percentages is increased. UPRC<sub>e</sub> which has the highest kenaf content (25%) displays the lowest dimensional stability up to 26.65% (± 0.64) for water uptake and 11.83% (± 0.51) for thickness welling. The increasing moisture absorption in those composites is caused among other factors, by the higher hydrophilic nature of the kenaf fibre compared with the matrix and the greater interfacial area (capillary effect). The hydrophilic character of natural fibres is responsible for the water absorption in the composites, and therefore a higher content on fibres leads to a higher amount of water absorbed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731684413481863">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is then reasonable approach to assume that the water is absorbed by fibre and also voids through the weak interaction between the fibre and the matrix. Voids can exist particularly at the fibre–matrix interface when the fibre is poorly wet by the matrix polymer due to inferior fibre–matrix interaction. UPRC<sub>d</sub> and UPRC<sub>e</sub> composites with higher kenaf fibre percentage (20% kenaf for UPRC<sub>d</sub> and 25% kenaf for UPRC<sub>e</sub>) have inferior fibre–matrix interface. This is evident from the SEM micrographs of the controls as shown later in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0731684413481863">13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0731684413481863">14</xref>, respectively, which display fibre pull-outs during failure and the existence of moderate voids between the fibres and the polymer matrix. As a result, transportation of water molecules via capillary action to voids as well as flaws at the fibre–matrix interface can be expected. Water molecules accumulated at the interfacial voids contribute to the total amount of water uptake by the composite.

<p>The morphological studies of ultraviolet-cured composites UPRC<sub>b</sub>, UPRC<sub>e</sub> and UPRC<sub>c</sub> were examined by SEM micrographs as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0731684413481863">Figures 12</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0731684413481863">14</xref>, respectively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0731684413481863">Figure 12</xref> shows the SEM micrograph of UPRC<sub>b</sub> composite. It is obvious that the fibres are tightly embedded in the matrix with evidence of fibre breakage during failure. This indicates good wetting between the fibre and matrix. Without good wetting, a strong interfacial adhesion cannot be achieved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731684413481863">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731684413481863">28</xref></sup> According to Cautinho et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731684413481863">29</xref></sup> interfacial adhesion is crucial in getting optimum strength properties of composites. In addition, the micrograph shows high compatibility between the kenaf fibre and UPR polymer matrix. Moreover, a good distribution of fibre within the polymer matrix is observed, while the fibre distribution is vital in allowing more light to penetrate and causes complete matrix cure. However, for the SEM micrograph of UPRC<sub>e</sub> composite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0731684413481863">Figure 13</xref>), the fibre is loosely embedded in the polymer matrix and unevenly distributed within the matrix. There is also evidence of fibre pull-outs during failure. An intermediate case appeared for UPRC<sub>c</sub> composite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0731684413481863">Figure 14</xref>), where the kenaf fibre compatibility with the UPR matrix is better than in the previous case UPRC<sub>e</sub>. Thus, SEM results show another evidence of the enhancement of the compatibility between kenaf fibre and UPR polymer matrix which appeared clearly in UPRC<sub>b</sub> composite.

<p>New composites of variable kenaf fibre percentages UPRC<sub>a–e</sub> were prepared using ultraviolet curing technique in the presence of styrene and IRGACURE 1800 as free radical initiator. UPRC<sub>a</sub> and UPRC<sub>b</sub> showed the higher gel fraction value whereas UPRC<sub>e</sub> showed the lowest gel fraction value 83.88% (0.62). The order of gel fraction values for all UPRC formulations was in the following manner: UPRC<sub>a</sub> &gt; UPRC<sub>b</sub> &gt; UPRC<sub>c</sub> &gt; UPRC<sub>d</sub> &gt; UPRC<sub>e</sub>. Tensile strength increased as the kenaf fibre percentage within the composite was increased and reached a threshold value in UPRC<sub>b</sub> which contained 10% kenaf fibre. The tensile modulus for the UPRC showed a sharp decrease as the kenaf fibre percentage was increased starting from 827.34 (± 24.02) to 536.68 (± 40.85). All UPRC samples showed similar trend of impact strength with both tensile and flexural strength results. The prepared UPRC had dimensional stability values ranging between 12.05 (± 0.95)−26.65% (± 0.64) for water uptake and 6.11 (± 1.42)−11.83% (± 0.51) for thickness swelling. The dimensional stability decreased as the percentage of kenaf fibre was increased in the composite.</p>
