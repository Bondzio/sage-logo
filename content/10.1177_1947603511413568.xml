<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This report focuses on the biological events following autogenous bone grafting of large-volume defects of the knee joint’s femoral condyle secondary to osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) or osteonecrosis (ON). At the time this study was initiated, the medical literature held no prospect for sustainable cartilage repair, and the biological fate of various attempts at cartilage repair remains controversial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1947603511413568">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1947603511413568">7</xref></sup> The surgical treatment in the 1980s for large-volume defects of the femoral condyle was a cadaveric osteochondral allograft or total knee arthroplasty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1947603511413568">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1947603511413568">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>At that time, physicians and patients were reluctant to consider cadaveric allografts because of the unknown risk surrounding the discovery of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the early 1980s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1947603511413568">10</xref></sup> Total knee arthroplasty was an emerging technology without long-term follow-ups at that time, so patients were reluctant to sacrifice the entire joint for a localized lesion. Most cartilage repair procedures were directed towards the 2-dimensional superficial loss of the articular cartilage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1947603511413568">11</xref></sup> Subsequently, such procedures have been utilized for larger defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1947603511413568">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1947603511413568">14</xref></sup> In recent years, autogenous osteochondral grafts were introduced for large-volume defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1947603511413568">15</xref></sup> However, there are few long-term reports of restoration of articular surfaces regardless of the treatment method, and histological studies of such cases are exceedingly rare.</p>
<p>The rationale for this novel approach was based upon past experience in the treatment of OCD. It was known that fixation of an osteochondral fragment without adding an underlying bone graft may fail to unite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1947603511413568">16</xref></sup> This knowledge led to the use of adjunct autogenous bone grafting under such a lesion to ensure union. Subsequently, autogenous bone graft was used as a matrix to fill the void adjacent to a partial OCD fragment replacement. The early positive results led to wider indications for the use of autogenous bone graft to fill large-volume osteochondral defects of OCD or ON.</p>
<p>Precedent for neither this novel approach of arthroscopically assisted autogenous bone grafting of large osteochondral defects nor the long-term biological outcome of this procedure was known to the authors at the onset. The purpose of this study was to examine the biological fate of autogenous bone grafting of large 3-dimensional osteochondral defects of the human knee with long-term follow-up. It was hypothesized that the autogenous bone graft would integrate and the portion exposed to the articular surface would form fibrocartilage, which would endure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1947603511413568" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>This study was initiated before the advent of Institutional Review Board (IRB) jurisdiction in our community. The inclusion criteria were patients with OCD and ON of any age, with large-volume lesions. Those with superficial cartilage lesions or defects of traumatic etiology were excluded as well as those with instability, ankylosis, or severe diffuse degenerative arthritis.</p>
<p>Between September 29, 1987 and August 8, 1994, 51 patients were treated with autogenous bone grafting for large-volume osteochondral defects. There were 3 pathological groups: OCD with a partial fragment (<italic>n</italic> = 14), OCD without a fragment (<italic>n</italic> = 12), and ON (<italic>n</italic> = 24). Two patients in the ON group were iatrogenic. One was because of the use of YAG laser energy for an arthroscopic chondylar debridement, and the other was because of leukemia chemotherapy treatment including cortisone.</p>
<p>All surgeries were performed by one surgeon. The index surgeries included other procedures: partial meniscectomy (<italic>n</italic> = 15), abrasion arthroplasty (<italic>n</italic> = 9), chondroplasty (<italic>n</italic> = 8), resection osteophytes (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and wide synovectomy (<italic>n</italic> = 1). The osteochondral crater was arthroscopically cleared of all necrotic tissue, and the margins were undercut to physically secure the cancellous grafts. The surgical defects were estimated to be between 6 to 75 cm<sup>3</sup>. When present, the backs of the hinged fragments of OCD were debrided. All chondral fragments were resected in ON. Twenty-nine percent of the 51 patients had an accompanying high tibial osteotomy when the lesion was medial and involved a large surface area and/or when there was a coexisting varus deformity. No osteotomy was performed in the OCD group when a partial fragment was replaced. Osteotomy was performed on 2 patients in the OCD group who had no fragment to replace. Forty percent of the 25 patients in the ON group had associated tibial osteotomy.</p>
<p>The cancellous bone donor site was the proximal tibial metaphysis except in one patient with the largest defects. This patient had bilateral massive defects so it was necessary to harvest additional cancellous graft from the same-side iliac crest. The cancellous grafts were held in place until a blood clot was formed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1947603511413568">17</xref></sup> There were 2 patients with a cortical cancellous graft taken from the Gerdy tubercle area of the tibia that was placed by open surgery. Cancellous fragments were packed around the corticocancellous graft to obliterate any space. The retained OCD fragments and the cortical cancellous grafts were held in place by screw fixation.</p>
<p>The postoperative care included 2 months of nonweightbearing ambulation with crutches including intermittent active range of motion exercises. Continuous passive motion was not used in any patient. There were no postoperative infections that could have introduced a pathological tissue response.</p>
<p>Patient follow-up was routine on all patients through the first postoperative year as well as evaluations as necessary in the course of their care through 6 years. There was a hiatus in patient data until this formal long-term follow-up was initiated in 2005.</p>
<p>The subsequent clinical and radiological long-term follow-up was under Michigan State University IRB approval. Absent direct evidence, the radiological study was to serve as a means of assessing the long-term biological response of the bone graft integration and the nature of the articular surface. The long-term follow-up process for the radiological evaluation was accomplished by tracking patients via the existing office medical records and an Internet search. Some participating patients who live out of state were financially reimbursed upon request for travel, lodging, and loss of time off work by private funds. The follow-up radiological evaluations were performed without charge by the Department of Radiology at Michigan State University College of Human Medicine.</p>
<p>Twenty-five of the 51 patients were available for the long-term follow-up between 12 and 21 years. An electronic medical record existed for every patient. There were 7 women and 18 men. The average age at the time of the index surgery of these patients was 47 years (range, 13-82 years).</p>
<p>Of the 14 patients in the OCD group with partial fragment and grafting, 6 were available for long-term follow-up, and 8 were lost to follow-up. Of the 12 patients in the OCD group with grafting alone, 11 were available for long-term follow-up. One patient was reported as symptomatic but declined to participate. Of the 25 patients in the ON group with fragment resected and grafted, 8 were available for long-term follow-up. Two died, 7 were lost to follow-up, and 8 underwent a total knee replacement.</p>
<sec id="section3-1947603511413568">
<title>Radiological Imaging</title>
<p>All patients had preoperative and postoperative plain film radiographs. There were plain film radiological studies throughout the course of patient care as well as at the time of the long-term follow-up evaluations. The radiological documents included preoperative plain films in all cases taken in 5 views: bilateral standing anteroposterior (AP), standing Rosenberg view, Merchant view, supine notch view, and lateral. The long-term biological fate of the donor and host sites was documented by MRI. MRI studies were obtained on 23 patients between 12 and 21 years. One patient with a cardiac pacemaker had a CAT scan. One patient from Columbia, South America, was too elderly to travel but submitted follow-up history electronic medical record (EMR) modules and plain film x-rays.</p>
<p>MRI was performed at 3 T (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). Structural imaging parameters were selected for characterization and differentiation of cartilage, subchondral and cancellous bone, and joint fluid using the following fast spin echo sequences. Imaging assessment of the joint and graft material included evaluation of 1) the presence of the subchondral bone plate, 2) the continuity of trabecular bone features between underlying native cancellous bone and graft bone, 3) the articular surface continuity over the graft and the adjacent native articular cartilage, 4) the signal characteristics of the graft bone compared to adjacent native cortical and cancellous bone, and 5) the presence of secondary degenerative changes in the neoarticular surface.</p>

<sec id="section4-1947603511413568">
<title>Photographic Documentation</title>
<p>There was arthroscopic photographic and/or video documentation in all cases, which was archived for identification of the site of the lesion and for observation of biological changes. Illustrative intraoperative findings were photographed. Surgical videotapes were saved through the end of this study to provide a means of review and clinical correlation of biopsy site identification.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1947603511413568">
<title>Gross Pathology</title>
<p>Second-look arthroscopy provided gross pathology inspection on the 29 patients at variable intervals between 8 weeks to 6 years, with one opportunity for second-look arthroscopy at 20 years (Table 2). The gross pathological evidence was gathered during the scheduled screw removal, recurrent symptoms, or second-look arthroscopy granted during surgery on the other knee. The 20-year follow-up opportunity presented when the patient injured what had previously been an asymptomatic knee.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1947603511413568">
<title>Biopsy</title>
<p>There were 21 postoperative biopsies in 15 patients between 8 weeks and 20 years. Accurate targeting of the biopsy site was guided by review of the prior surgery on videotape. The biopsy specimens were taken with a Jamshidi 2-mm-diameter bone marrow biopsy needle (CareFusion Corporation, SanDiego, CA, USA). Routine histological preparations with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and Safranin O were performed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1947603511413568">
<title>20-Year Biopsy Histopathology</title>
<p>Special attention was given to the 20-year biopsy samples. They were fixed, processed, and embedded in paraffin for microtomy. Sections were stained for H&amp;E, Safranin O, or Masson’s trichrome using standard histological techniques. Sections allocated for immunohistochemical analysis were stained with the following mouse monoclonal antibodies: anti-lubricin (1:4,800 dilution; Dr. T. M. Schmid, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL), anti–type II collagen (CIIC1, 1:20 dilution; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA), and anti–α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) (clone 1A4, 1:400 dilution; Sigma, St. Louis, MO USA). The immunohistochemical staining was performed using the Dako Autostainer (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA). Deparaffinized and rehydrated sections were digested in 0.1% protease for 40 to 45 minutes to facilitate antibody penetration, followed by quenching of endogenous peroxidase with peroxidase blocking reagent (DakoCytomation) for 10 minutes. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with 5% goat serum for 30 minutes. The primary antibody was applied at room temperature for 30 minutes. Negative controls were incubated with a mouse IgG and IgM cocktail (DakoCytomation) instead of the primary antibody. Peroxidase-based detection (Dako LSAB-2 System Kit, DakoCytomation) was used per the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, sections were incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG) for 10 to 15 minutes, followed by application of streptavidin-HRP for 10 to 15 minutes. Labeling was developed with an aminoethyl carbazole (AEC) chromogen for 10 minutes. Counterstaining was performed with Mayer’s hematoxylin for 1.5 minutes, followed by application of coverslips.</p>

<p>A representative case of a patient with OCD who had screw fixation of a partial fragment plus a cancellous bone graft. This 36-year-old man underwent arthroscopic surgery on August 4, 1987 for a large-volume osteochondral defect secondary to OCD. He had a small fragment remaining that was secured with screw fixation. An autogenous cancellous bone graft from the proximal tibial metaphysis was placed under and adjacent to the fragment. The long-term results of this patient showed the immediate postoperative biological events, followed by planned and opportunistic second-look arthroscopy and biopsy. He was asymptomatic at 19 years when MRI was taken as part of the long-term clinical follow-up on this cohort. He subsequently injured his knee that resulted in gross arthroscopic inspection at 20 years with correlated biopsy and extensive histochemical studies of the autogenous bone graft site. (<bold>A</bold>) Index surgery showing the partial fragment held with a screw and the adjacent exposed cancellous bone graft (arrow).

<p>Early on, it was not known if a subchondral cortical bone plate would develop following large-volume cancellous bone grafting. Therefore, the surgical approach evolved to open surgery using a composite cortical cancellous graft for 2 OCD patients who had no fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1947603511413568"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>). The donor site included the Gerdy tubercle with its convex surface to replicate the femoral condylar geometry.</p>

<p>Subsequently, it was learned that the cancellous grafts did develop a subchondral bone plate, so larger defects were treated arthroscopically solely with multiple fragments of a cancellous graft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1947603511413568"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>).

<p>Second-look arthroscopy at 8 weeks was accompanied by biopsies of the repaired surfaces of these cases at 8 weeks, which showed gross appearance and histomorphology similar to that observed after abrasion arthroplasty<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1947603511413568">18</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947603511413568"><bold>Figs. 1F</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1947603511413568"><bold>2C</bold></xref>). These observations prompted the consideration of autogenous bone graft as a matrix for large osteochondral defects in selected cases of ON and for OCD when the fragment was absent. This rationale was supported by the recognition that fibrocartilage formed over surgically abraded exposed bone in the arthritic knee and survived for 2 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1947603511413568">18</xref></sup> It was further reasoned that the autogenous bone grafting method would avoid the risk of disease transmission and the autogenous bone graft matrix would fill the osteochondral defect. It was anticipated that the blood clot of the surface of the graft would facilitate the formation of fibrocartilage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1947603511413568">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1947603511413568">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The immediate biological response was blood clot formation in and on the autogenous bone graft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947603511413568"><bold>Figs. 1B</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1947603511413568"><bold>3B</bold></xref>). Gross anatomical inspection was possible between 8 weeks and 20 years. The surface over remodeled graft was contiguous with and sealed to the adjacent normal cartilage but remained soft to palpation at 8 weeks and 10 months compared to the adjacent normal articular cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1947603511413568"><bold>Figs. 2D</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1947603511413568"><bold>3D</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>The gross appearance of the corticocancellous grafts had a similar appearance as the solely cancellous grafts after similar postoperative periods. However, in the very large lesions, the tibial and iliac crest grafts did not have sufficient volume to achieve a congruous convex articular surface at surgery. The incongruent and flat configuration remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1947603511413568"><bold>Fig. 4D</bold></xref>). This same patient’s biological response to the large bone grafts resulted in postoperative loss of range of motion due to adhesions between the graft site and the joint lining. This required 2 subsequent arthroscopic debridement procedures. Resection of the adhesions resolved the symptoms and restored motion.</p>

<p>Twenty-five of the 51 patients were available for radiological follow-up between 12 and 21 years. During the course of the long-term follow-up evaluations, it was apparent that there was a soft tissue covering seen on MRI over the area of the autogenous bone grafts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947603511413568"><bold>Figs. 1G</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1947603511413568"><bold>2F</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1947603511413568"><bold>3F</bold></xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1947603511413568"><bold>4D</bold></xref>).

Continuity of trabecular bone detail with a smooth transition from graft bone to native cancellous bone was consistent with graft integration. The area of the bone graft was never completely homogeneous. Bone did not grow out beyond the level of the adjacent cortex. The surface tissue overlying the graft consistently had a magnetic resonance appearance of intermediate signal intensity between that of joint fluid and meniscus, similar to that of hyaline cartilage remote from the area of grafting. Mild signal heterogeneity in the articular surface typical of degenerative change was present to varying degrees and was similar in contiguous native cartilage. There was osseous incorporation of the graft material in all groups of patients imaged including those with fixation of the native OCD fragment, those with combined corticocancellous grafts, and those with solely cancellous grafting procedures.</p>

<title>Histological Inspection</title>
<p>At 8 weeks, the cancellous grafts revealed a fibrovascular reparative tissue, approximately 3 mm in depth, overlying an active bone surface. The articular surface of the tissue, which appeared to be smooth, comprised a thin layer of cells at some locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947603511413568"><bold>Fig. 1F</bold></xref>). A few cells at the surface appeared rounded in lacunae, in a chondrocytic morphology. The superficial zone of the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947603511413568"><bold>Fig. 1F</bold></xref>) was hypocellular and hypovascular, relative to the underlying reparative tissue. Cells in this fibrocollagenous tissue generally appeared in fibroblast morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947603511413568"><bold>Fig. 1F</bold></xref>). The surface region of the biopsy consisted of fibrous tissue with many elongated, fibroblast-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947603511413568"><bold>Fig. 1F</bold></xref>). The middle zone of the soft tissue portion of the biopsy was hypervascular, with small and large vessels distributed through a dense fibrocollagenous matrix populated with fibroblasts (<bold>Suppl. Fig. S1A</bold>). In the deep region of the tissue, a transition from fibrous tissue to fibrocartilage was seen, with small but notable areas of rounded cells residing in lacunae within a fibrous matrix (<bold>Suppl. Fig. S1B</bold>). The reparative tissue was in continuity with the underlying bone (<bold>Suppl. Fig. S1C</bold>), and its overall appearance was consistent with a reparative response.</p>
<p>Dense fibrocartilage was found in biopsies from patients at 10 months (<bold>Fig. 2E; Suppl. Fig. S2D</bold>) and 2 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1947603511413568"><bold>Fig. 3E</bold></xref>). The corticocancellous grafts maintained the intact cortex, while the all-cancellous grafts had no cortical bone at 8 weeks. The cancellous grafts subsequently formed a subchondral bone plate as seen on biopsy.</p>
<p>The biopsy at 20 years comprised an osteochondral plug made up of the deep zone of hyaline cartilage overlying a calcified cartilage layer and subchondral bone plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947603511413568"><bold>Fig. 1H</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947603511413568"><bold>1I</bold></xref>). Fibrocartilage was above the hyaline cartilage and extended to the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947603511413568"><bold>Fig. 1I</bold></xref>). The superficial zone of the plug was irregular with many fissures and areas of fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947603511413568"><bold>Fig. 1I</bold></xref>). There were fewer cells in the surface zone, which was more eosinophilic than the bulk of the cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947603511413568"><bold>Fig. 1I</bold></xref>, arrow). Examination of the histological sections by polarized light microscopy, to reveal the collagen organization, demonstrated the more fibrous appearance of the matrix in the fibrocartilaginous zone (<bold>Suppl. Fig. S1F</bold>) superficial to the hyaline cartilage at the base (<bold>Suppl. Fig. S1G</bold>). The polarized light microscopy also showed that collagen bundles were aligned perpendicular to the tidemark (<bold>Suppl. Fig. S1G</bold>). The lamellar organization of the underlying bone was also revealed by polarized light microscopy (<bold>Suppl. Fig. S1G</bold>).</p>
<p>A large portion of the section stained positive with Safranin O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947603511413568"><bold>Fig. 1J</bold></xref>), indicating the presence of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Closer inspection of the tidemark region revealed that positive staining was located largely above the newly remodeled tidemark (<bold>Suppl. Fig. S1H</bold>).</p>
<p>The distribution of the staining intensities for type II collagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947603511413568"><bold>Fig. 1K</bold></xref>) was, in part, similar to that seen for Safranin O. Positive staining was localized in the matrix, and no intracellular retention of type II collagen was noted (<bold>Suppl. Fig. S1I</bold>). The negative controls did not stain for type II collagen.</p>
<p>Masson’s trichrome staining revealed the presence of collagen in the majority of the extracellular matrix of the tissue above the tidemark (<bold>Suppl. Fig. S1 J and K</bold>). Of note was the fact that while the surface of the biopsy tissue showed positive staining for collagen using Masson’s trichrome (<bold>Suppl. Fig. S1 K</bold>), very little positive staining for type II collagen was seen in the same area (<bold>Fig. 1K</bold>), suggesting that the collagen located at the surface was primarily type I collagen. This is consistent with the finding that the tissue was fibrocartilaginous at the surface.</p>
<p>Of note was the consistent finding of a thin, dense discrete layer of positive staining for lubricin on the articulating surface of the biopsy section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947603511413568"><bold>Fig. 1L</bold></xref>). The negative controls did not stain for lubricin. The freshly cut surfaces of the biopsy produced during trimming of the tissue did not stain for lubricin (<bold>Suppl. Fig. S1L</bold>), indicating that the lubricin surface layer was not edge-effect artifactual staining. The discrete layer of lubricin covered the surfaces of the crevices and fissures through the tissue (<bold>Fig. 1L; Suppl. Fig. S1L-N</bold>) and was on the surfaces of the fragments of the tissue (<bold>Suppl. Fig. S1M and N</bold>). Significant diffuse staining of the extracellular matrix was also located near the surface to variable depths ranging from 150 to 500 µm below the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947603511413568"><bold>Fig. 1L</bold></xref>). Notably, no lubricin staining was seen in the deeper regions of the biopsy section. No detectable intracellular staining was observed.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The biological fate of the autogenous bone graft matrix in this study showed integration to the host bone plus long-term survival of the newly formed articular surface. The hypothesis was confirmed by planned MRI, second-look arthroscopy, biopsy, and histomorphological inspection.</p>
<p>Second-look arthroscopy with biopsy at various intervals showed the early bone integration. The long-term radiological study of the patient with the very large surgical defects showed the retention of the original incongruous contour of the bone graft geometry. This observation would suggest that future bone grafts for large surface lesions should replicate the normal articular contour, perhaps with additional use of the convex surface of the Gerdy tubercle cortical cancellous graft for large defects.</p>
<p>The biopsies showed the articular surface to be fibrous tissue at 8 weeks and dense fibrocartilage after several months. MRI showed there was long-term maintenance of a soft tissue covering over the entire bone graft. The exact nature was not known until a 20-year second look and biopsy presented in one patient near the end of the follow-up study. This extensive histological analysis on this patient provides a rare opportunity to document the biological events following the use of an autogenous bone graft as matrix for a large-volume osteochondral defect of the knee joint femoral condyle. Clinically, the patient was asymptomatic for 20 years. MRI taken prior to the injury showed integration of the bone graft, although not completely homogeneous. Identification of the exact graft site was confirmed by review of the libraried prior surgical videotapes. The gross anatomy of the articular cartilage formation was congruent with the adjacent joint surface at 8 weeks and 20 years. The nature of the soft tissue covering of the bone graft identified by MRI was not known until the subsequent 20-year biopsy. This single case showed the soft tissue covering to consist of a mix of fibrocartilage and hyaline cartilage despite the presence of subsequent mild, diffuse degenerative arthritis as also seen in the remainder of the medial compartment. It was notable that the normal distribution of the important cartilage-lubricating molecule (lubricin) was seen on the 20-year biopsy surface. There was no intracellular staining of lubricin, suggesting the possibility that the lubricin may have been produced outside the reparative tissue and diffused from the surrounding synovial fluid rather than being produced by cells within the tissue itself. However, given the depth of some of the diffuse staining for lubricin in the extracellular matrix (up to 500 µm below the surface), it seems less likely that the molecule would have been absorbed from the joint fluid.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it should not have been surprising that fibrocartilage has long-term survival potential considering that the fibrocartilagenous meniscus is native to the synovial joint. The meniscus survives under pressure and shear and provides a gliding surface. Animal studies show a similar biological fate of autogenous bone grafting to large osteochondral defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1947603511413568">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1947603511413568">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The surgical removal of the OCD fragment has poor outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1947603511413568">21</xref></sup> Therefore, the attempts at preservation have included <italic>in situ</italic> drilling, replacement, screw fixation, osteochondral autografts, and allografts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1947603511413568">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1947603511413568">27</xref></sup> Present treatments for ON include drilling, cancellous packing, unicompartmental replacement, tibial osteotomy, and total knee arthroplasty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1947603511413568">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1947603511413568">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although various biological matrixes have been proposed in recent years, autogenous bone appears to be a cost-effective, readily available matrix for large osteochondral defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1947603511413568">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1947603511413568">34</xref></sup> The autogenous nature removes the risk of complications of the allograft surgery while resulting in a long-lasting biological solution for both the bone and articular surface.</p>
<p>The strengths of this report were the prospective design, the long-term follow-up, the high quality and consistent availability of an EMR, the archived videotapes for identification of locations of prior surgical sites for correlation with follow-up imaging and arthroscopy, and the gross and microscopic pathology provided by second-look arthroscopy with biopsy. There were pathological studies ranging from 8 weeks to 20 years supported by radiological evaluations. The magnetic resonance examinations were performed with a very high in-plane resolution of 0.31 × 0.42 mm in the sagittal and coronal planes and 0.27 × 0.36 mm in the axial plane, providing excellent delineation of cartilage features with clear discrimination of articular surface tissue from subchondral bone and articular fluid.</p>
<p>The weaknesses of this study were the nonrandomization and dependence upon historic controls. Gross and microscopic studies were not planned at staged intervals but were obtained when the opportunity was clinically possible. There was the absence of cartilage-specific magnetic resonance sequences. The MRI for these examinations was a higher resolution version of imaging protocols, which were considered advanced at the time our follow-up study was initiated. Unfortunately, we did not perform quantitative imaging of cartilage in our patients. This study was contemporaneous with the development of GAG imaging with delayed gadolinium enhancement MRI and before this technique was performed at our institution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1947603511413568">35</xref></sup> Additionally, other measures of cartilage integrity, such as T2-mapping and magnetization transfer imaging, were not performed, which may have offered insight into the nature of the neoarticular tissue formed over these grafts. These methods may prove beneficial in future follow-up assessments as this novel approach to the treatment of large osteochondral defects is further refined. The clinical results will be the subject of a separate report.</p>
