<p>Angiotensin II (Ang II) binds to Ang II type 1 (AT<sub>1</sub>) receptor and evokes cell signaling, and subsequently stimulates vasoconstriction and cell proliferation, which eventually lead to cardiovascular disease. Since most AT<sub>1</sub> receptor blockers (ARBs) have molecular (differential) effects, we evaluated the specific features of candesartan and compared the abilities of candesartan and other ARBs (olmesartan, telmisartan, valsartan, irbesartan and losartan) to bind to and activate AT<sub>1</sub> receptors using a cell-based wash-out assay. Each ARB blocked Ang II-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation and inositol phosphate production to different degrees after wash-out. In addition, a small difference in the molecular structure, i.e. a carboxyl group, between candesartan and candesartan-7H was associated with a difference in the degree of this blocking effect. In addition, interaction between Gln<sup>257</sup> in the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor and the carboxyl group of candesartan may be partially associated with the effect of candesartan after wash-out. Although our findings regarding the molecular effects of ARB are based on basic research, these findings may lead to an exciting new area in the clinical application of ARBs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Angiotensin II (Ang II) is the major effector peptide of the renin–angiotensin system. Ang II type 1 (AT<sub>1</sub>) receptor blockers (ARBs) are highly selective for the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, and block the diverse effects of Ang II, such as vasoconstriction, aldosterone release, retention of sodium and water, sympathetic nerve activation and cell proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470320311417478">1</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Many ARBs are available for clinical use worldwide. Most ARBs have class (or common) effects because they have common molecular structures (biphenyl-tetrazol and imidazol groups),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470320311417478">2</xref></sup> although recent clinical studies have demonstrated that not all ARBs have the same effects. Such drug-specific effects are referred to as ‘molecular (or differential) effects’. We previously reported that olmesartan, which has a hydroxyl group and a carboxyl group in addition to the common biphenyl-tetrazol structure, exhibits strong inverse agonism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470320311417478">3</xref></sup> In addition, irbesartan which has a cyclopentyl group whereas losartan has a chloride group; showed greater binding affinity and a higher inhibition of inositol phosphate (IP) production or monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and a higher production of adiponectin than losartan, likely due to differences in their molecular structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311417478">4</xref></sup> Thus, we also proved that small differences in the molecular structures of ARBs could lead to differences in their abilities to influence the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor, although the small differences in ligands for other GPCRs could lead to differences in pharmacological effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320311417478">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320311417478">6</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>ARBs may be anti-aging medicines and are used as the first drug of choice for patients with diabetes and/or metabolic syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320311417478">7</xref></sup> In this regard, candesartan showed significantly lower all-cause mortality than amlodipine among patients with obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥27.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320311417478">8</xref></sup> Recently, we reported that candesartan, but not a candesartan-related compound that did not contain a carboxyl group, suppressed stretch-induced AT<sub>1</sub> receptor activation through binding of the carboxyl group of candesartan to the specific residues of the receptor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470320311417478">9</xref></sup> Therefore, to evaluate more specific features of candesartan, we compared the abilities of candesartan and other ARBs (olmesartan, telmisartan, valsartan, irbesartan and losartan) to bind to and modulate AT<sub>1</sub> receptor function using a cell-based wash-out assay.</p>

<p>We previously reported that the <italic>K</italic>

In addition, the percentage values by candesartan were significantly higher than those of olmesartan (83 ± 1% versus 79 ± 2%, 76 ± 2% versus 65 ± 5% and 76 ± 3% versus 57 ± 5%, after the second, third and fourth wash-outs, respectively). Since these results indicated that candesartan is the strongest ARB in terms of binding to AT<sub>1</sub> receptor and resistant to wash-out, we analyzed the importance of small differences in the chemical structure. We used 1 µM candesartan and candesartan-7H, candesartan-7H could not bind to AT<sub>1</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470320311417478">Figure 1A</xref>, dotted line), indicating that the carboxyl group of candesartan is an important chemical structure that allows it to bind to AT<sub>1</sub> receptor.

<p>We previously indicated that Gln<sup>257</sup> in the AT<sub>1</sub> mutant receptor is an important binding site of the carboxyl group of candesartan for inducing the insurmountable antagonism of candesartan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320311417478">12</xref></sup> In addition, the carboxyl group of candesartan has been shown to bind to Gln<sup>257</sup> in TM6 and to Thr<sup>287</sup> in TM7, and these interactions might be critical for blocking stretch-induced AT<sub>1</sub> receptor activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320311417478">8</xref></sup> Therefore, we analyzed whether Gln<sup>257</sup> and Thr<sup>287</sup> were also critical for the ability of candesartan to bind to AT<sub>1</sub> receptor after wash-out, and changed Gln<sup>257</sup> and Thr<sup>287</sup> to Ala (Q257A and T287A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470320311417478">Figure 1C</xref> and D).

The level of Ang II-induced ERK activation without ARB was the same as that with candesartan-7H after the first wash-out, which indicated that after wash-out, candesartan-7H does not block AngII-induced ERK activation by AT<sub>1</sub> receptor. Moreover, Ang II-induced IP production was not blocked by 1 µM candesartan-7H without wash-out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470320311417478">Figure 3B</xref>). Ang II-induced IP production was not blocked by 1 µM candesartan-7H after the 1st wash-out, suggesting that candesartan-7H mostly abolished the reduction of IP production before and after the first wash-out.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Ang II binds to AT<sub>1</sub> receptor and evokes cell signaling, and subsequently stimulates vasoconstriction and cell proliferation, which eventually lead to cardiovascular disease. In this article, we have provided direct evidence that ARBs block Ang II-induced ERK activation and IP production to different degrees after wash-out. In addition, the small difference in the molecular structures of candesartan and candesartan-7H led to a difference in their blocking effects. Furthermore, interaction between Gln<sup>257</sup> in the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor and the carboxyl group of candesartan may be partially associated with the blocking ability of candesartan after wash-out.</p>
<p>We previously reported that the carboxyl group of candesartan was a critical molecular structure for the blockade of stretch-induced AT<sub>1</sub> receptor activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320311417478">12</xref></sup> We also indicated that the carboxyl group of olmesartan was an important structure for inverse agonism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470320311417478">3</xref></sup> In addition, the insurmountable behavior of ARBs such as candesartan, olmesartan and Exp3174 (an active metabolite of losartan) is thought to be associated with the carboxyl group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470320311417478">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470320311417478">14</xref></sup> because ARBs that do not contain this group (candesartan derivatives and losartan) do not exhibit insurmountable antagonism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470320311417478">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470320311417478">15</xref></sup> Thus, if ARBs have a carboxyl group, this small difference in the molecular structure evokes different pharmacological properties, such as the blockade of stretch-induced activation, insurmountability and inverse agonism toward AT<sub>1</sub> receptor. Moreover, there is a common critical position in the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor as an acceptor for the carboxyl group of candesartan. The carboxyl group of candesartan stably forms two hydrogen bonds with the side chains of both Gln<sup>257</sup> and Thr<sup>287</sup> and blocks stretch-induced AT<sub>1</sub> receptor activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320311417478">12</xref></sup> The presence of insurmountable antagonism appears to specifically require the binding of ARB with Gln<sup>257</sup> in the AT<sub>1</sub> WT receptor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470320311417478">3</xref></sup> In the present study, Gln<sup>257</sup> was also important for the ability of candesartan because the percentage of candesartan bound to the AT<sub>1</sub> Q257A receptor after wash-out was significantly lower than that with the AT<sub>1</sub> WT receptor. Therefore, the interaction between the carboxyl group of ARBs including candesartan and Gln<sup>257</sup> in the AT<sub>1</sub> WT receptor contributed to their different abilities. On the other hand, our proposed amino acids that interact with the caboxyl group of candesartan were not the same as those published by Bhuiyan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470320311417478">16</xref></sup> They indicate that the caboxyl group of candesartan possibly interacted with Lys<sup>199</sup> based on previous experimental data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470320311417478">17</xref></sup> Since we could not explain the discrepant results, further studies will be needed to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Six kinds of ARBs are available for clinical use in Japan. Fabia et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470320311417478">18</xref></sup> studied 36 reports in which blood pressure (BP) was measured using ambulatory BP monitoring for at least 24 hours. The antihypertensive activities of ARBs differed, and the magnitude of the reduction in BP did not essentially depend on the initial BP values or on the dose used. The abilities of ARBs including olmesartan, telmisartan, valsartan and irbesartan observed in the present cell-based wash-out assay were similar to the recently reported rank order of their dissociation half-lives (olmesartan &gt; telmisartan &gt; valsartan &gt; irbesartan).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470320311417478">14</xref></sup> The potency of ARBs observed in the present study might be related to their dissociation rates from the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor. Although these basic data were not directly associated with the differential antihypertensive activities of ARBs, we believe that the different potencies of ARBs are due, at least in part, to their basic differences.</p>
<p>Most ARBs have common molecular structures (biphenyl-tetrazol and imidazol groups) and it is clear that ARBs have class effects. In addition, each ARB has been shown to have a molecular effect in basic experimental studies, including our present and previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470320311417478">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311417478">4</xref></sup> However, it is controversial whether all ARBs have beneficial molecular effects in a clinical setting. Although the present results highlight the advantages of candesartan based only on experimental conditions, we clearly show the blockade of Ang II-induced ERK activation and IP production by ARBs after wash-out. Several recent clinical trials have evaluated the effects of ARBs on morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure (HF). The ELITE II trial suggested that treatment with losartan is not superior to treatment with captopril.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470320311417478">19</xref></sup> In the CHARM trial, the benefits of candesartan were demonstrated in patients with HF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470320311417478">20</xref></sup> Although there are important differences in the design and hypotheses of these trials that must be taken into account when comparing their results and interpreting their clinical impact, we should also consider whether these are class effects of ARBs. The inverse agonistic activity and blockade by ARB against Ang II-induced ERK activation and IP production after wash-out in this study might also be important for their efficacy in the long-term treatment of heart disease, such as HF including cardiac remodeling, independent of any BP-lowering effect.</p>
<p>In summary, many clinical reports have discussed the differences in the beneficial effects of ARBs. Some beneficial effects conferred by ARBs may be molecular effects rather than class effects. In this study, candesartan induced more beneficial effects than other ARBs, probably due to the small difference in the molecular structures of the ARBs, and this difference evoked the specific blockade of AT<sub>1</sub> receptor-induced cell signaling. Although our findings regarding the molecular effects of ARBs are based on basic research, these findings may lead to an exciting new area in the clinical application of ARBs. A better understanding of the different molecular mechanisms of each ARB could be helpful in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.</p>
