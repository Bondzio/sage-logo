<p>Over a century ago, films took over in the public imagination from books, and over the past several decades they have established themselves as a major source of entertainment and pleasure. Commercial films are made to earn money for their makers and any use they may have for education is probably secondary. These films need to be differentiated from documentaries, which may have educational or propaganda values. In the last quarter of a century, mainstream films have been used to teach psychopathology to medical students, psychiatry trainees and other mental health professionals, and their use in publications has increased exponentially.</p>
<p>This third expanded and revised edition of <italic>Movies and mental illness</italic> is welcome and follows the second edition, published five years previously. In those five years, the book has gained 79 pages and a filmography. A new appendix has also been included, providing a sample course syllabus and examples of films and strategies that offer different and new perspectives on various disorders. The authors have also included 10 best films in each category as an authors’ pick. These additions make the book interesting and extremely helpful in developing and delivering curricula using films to teach about specific psychiatric conditions. It is apparent that those reading and using the book will have their own personal choices, as will students, which is to be encouraged. The authors provide a helpful comparison between classic and recent film examples – a model that can be used to teach changing diagnoses and changing social and cultural contents. The authors have also attempted to include a paragraph on international films in each chapter, thereby broadening the context.</p>
<p>The book has 15 chapters and six appendices. The first chapter provides a broad introduction to films and psychopathology and subsequent chapters deal with specific psychiatric conditions. The last chapter describes treatment. Each chapter begins by inviting the viewer to consider certain questions while watching a specific film. This strategy facilitates the teacher to provide a specific cultural context and diagnostic strictures. Using dialogues to illustrate key factors, this book provides plenty of thought-provoking material both for teachers and for students. It is highly recommended.</p>
