<abstract>
<p>Gastrointestinal (GI) surgery associated with resection or bypass can affect the absorption and kinetics of certain drugs. The goal of this article is 3-fold: (1) highlight the physiologic changes associated with selected GI surgeries (specifically gastric, small intestine, and colon), (2) review the implications for drug and nutrient absorption, and (3) suggest modifications of the pharmacologic agents, dosing regimens, and routes of delivery. Few large trials are available to use as references, but there is a wealth of individual reports and small series. Understanding the predictable challenges of drug administration in these patients will improve care.</p>

<body>
<p>Surgeons routinely alter the structure of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and, as a consequence, also may change its function. With small resections, this impact is minimal, and the remaining intestine adapts so no functionality is lost. However, when large resections are performed in severe inflammatory bowel disease or in intestinal malrotation with ischemia, there may be profound changes in GI function, including nutrient absorption and motility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533613490740">1</xref></sup> Similarly, gastric resections and bariatric surgeries can predictably change GI function. These changes are often not well understood by clinicians caring for the medical needs of the patients. Although less understood and appreciated, these resections also have an impact on drug absorption. The purpose of this review is first to provide an outline of surgical changes in the GI tract, specifically related to gastric resection and bypass, as well as small intestinal and colonic resections, all of which may predictably lead to drug malabsorption. Second, we review what is known about drug absorption, providing suggestions for alternate dosing regimens or therapy to compensate for these changes in GI structure and function.</p>

<title>Gastric Resections and Bariatric Surgery</title>
<p>Partial gastric resection or bypass is performed for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, malignancy, and as a means of weight loss. Gastric resections can be categorized as wedge resections, distal gastrectomies, subtotal gastrectomies, or total gastrectomies depending on the amount of stomach removed. Reconstruction options after more extensive resections consist of a Billroth I, Billroth II, or Roux-en-Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0884533613490740">Figure 1</xref>). The altered gastric anatomy and concurrent vagotomy can lead to altered GI function and absorption. Most drugs are minimally absorbed in the stomach. The rate at which the stomach empties does affect the kinetics of drug absorption and enterhepatic circulation. Vagotomy can delay while resection of the pylorus accelerates gastric emptying, and the result can be variable depending on the patient’s physiology. For many drugs for which rapid absorption is preferred, instructions for consumption generally include taking the agent on an empty stomach with sufficient water.</p>

<p>Bariatric procedures are categorized as restrictive (vertical banded gastroplasty, adjustable gastric banding, and sleeve gastrectomy), malabsorptive (jejunoileal bypass), or both restrictive and malabsorptive (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and biliopancreatic diversion with a duodenal switch). See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533613490740">Table 1</xref> for a summary of these procedures. The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass has been one of the most frequently performed bariatric surgeries in the United States for years and can be performed as an open or laparoscopic procedure. The GI reconstruction is nearly identical to the Roux-en-Y reconstruction after a gastric resection, except the gastric pouch is smaller and the length of small intestine bypassed is greater after bariatric surgery; therefore, similar absorption abnormalities can be anticipated.</p>

<p>One adverse effect attributed to a gastric surgery is the dumping syndrome. This syndrome can manifest with either an early or a late form. The early dumping syndrome can result in nausea, vomiting, fullness, cramping, explosive diarrhea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, syncope, and/or flushing. The symptoms are attributed to a series of events that are set into motion as a result of rapid gastric emptying and often occur within 30 minutes of a meal. Without a braking mechanism such as the pylorus, the stomach is unable to hold an ingested meal, convert it to an isotonic solution, and slowly deliver it to the small intestine. As a result, a hyperosmolar bolus rapidly enters the small intestine. To achieve an isotonic environment, extracellular fluid is osmotically drawn into the bowel lumen, causing both rapid bowel distention and rapid reduction of extracellular volume. It is ultimately these events that cause the GI, cardiovascular, and vasomotor symptoms described. Management includes limiting the intake of concentrated sweets; focusing on high-protein, low-carbohydrate meals; consuming multiple small meals each day; and separating solid food intake from liquid intake. Control of dumping may improve any pharmacologic malabsorption experienced by the patient related to rapid intestinal transit.</p>
<p>Late dumping syndrome is less common than early dumping and occurs several hours after eating, resulting from rapid emptying of a high-carbohydrate meal. The carbohydrates are absorbed in the proximal small intestine, and rapid hyperglycemia ensues. The hyperglycemia is countered by an insulin surge, which subsequently causes rebound hypoglycemia. Manifestations generally involve the cardiovascular and vasomotor symptoms described as part of the early dumping syndrome. Treatment is the same as for early dumping and focuses on low-carbohydrate, high-protein meals. No data reliably identify which drugs will be affected by dumping, but the clinician needs to consider that an agent administered but ineffective may simply not be absorbed.</p>
<p>Although malabsorption is an important aspect of the weight loss mechanism for several bariatric operations, patients undergoing either gastric resections or malabsorptive bariatric procedures are susceptible to a variety of nutrition and metabolic complications. The first widely implemented weight loss surgery was a purely malabsorptive operation called the jejunoileal bypass. Although many patients experienced satisfactory weight loss, the operation was ultimately abandoned and deemed a failure due to serious safety concerns and long-term health problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533613490740">2</xref></sup> Patients undergoing a jejunoileal bypass encountered a series of significant complications, most of which were related to bile salt and fat malabsorption. The jejunoileal bypass delayed mixing of bile salts with ingested fats and bypassed the major site of absorption. Large amounts of fatty acids therefore entered the colon, producing profound intractable diarrhea. A failure of enterohepatic bile salt reabsorption led to losses of bile salt into stool. Failed fat absorption also affected the ability of the GI tract to absorb fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) as well as calcium. Jejunoileal bypass is no longer performed, and when a patient presents with evidence of this procedure as a remote event, referral to a tertiary center for evaluation is necessary.</p>
<p>Drugs with long absorptive phases that require extended exposure to the intestine are likely to exhibit decreased bioavailability in bariatric or gastric resection patients. Also, drugs that are rapidly and primarily absorbed in the stomach or duodenum may have decreased absorption in patients with combination restrictive-malabsorptive procedures. Often, reduced drug absorption results in decreased efficacy rather than toxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533613490740">3</xref></sup> Very few data are available for pharmacokinetics in patients who have had bariatric procedures or small intestinal resections. These drugs need to be dosed to effect, and if the agent has a narrow therapeutic window, switching to an alternate medication may be the safest option for the patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533613490740">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The reduced size of the stomach after bypass surgery may increase the toxicity of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), salicylates, oral bisphosphonates, and oral iron tablet formulations. Dilution within the stomach affects tolerance of these drugs. Consequently, the small (50 mL) pouch produced in a gastric bypass decreases dilution volume and predisposes the stomach to increased direct mucosal contact with a high concentration of the drug, including the possibility of direct contact with the pill itself.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613490740">5</xref></sup> The resulting damage to the gastric mucosa may be substantial. It is routinely recommended that NSAIDs should be avoided in the gastric bypass population because of the risk of ulceration in a portion of the stomach that may be difficult to access endoscopically after surgery. Because of this, alternatives for pain relief, such as acetaminophen, tramadol, and/or opiates, may be needed. Likewise, alternative stable biphosphonates for osteoporosis prevention can be used, which require liquid or IV formulations and avoid the local toxicity of direct mucosal contact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533613490740">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The exception to this effect is tablets that are crushed or capsules that are opened. An example is immediate-release or sublingual nifedipine. The use of immediate-release nifedipine is not recommended<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533613490740">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533613490740"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533613490740"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533613490740">9</xref></sup> because of substantial and rapid declines in blood pressure. In the surgically modified stomach, the capsule is not broken down to allow absorption. By crushing or interfering with the delivery system, the drug is absorbed too rapidly. When patients have been previously maintained on nifedipine, reevaluation and potentially modification of the choice of drug may be indicated following gastric bypass.</p>
<p>Due to reduced gastric acid and the reduced surface area for drug absorption, changes in drug delivery route or dose may be needed to ensure therapeutic drug concentrations. Extended-release formulations should be avoided; some require a long absorptive phase in the intestine (which may not be possible with intestinal resection or bypass), whereas others are absorbed in the colon (which is not possible if the colon has been removed). Immediate-release formulations with more frequent dosing deliver adequate drug amounts with a more stable therapeutic window. It may be useful to use a liquid formulation to limit the drug absorption phase where possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533613490740">3</xref></sup> Other routes, such as intramuscular, transdermal, subcutaneous, and inhalation, may be appropriate. However, if the patient remains morbidly obese, these delivery systems may not be optimal because subcutaneous fat is increased. Conversely, transdermal dosing depends on a normal subcutaneous fat content, and malnourished patients may not have the extended delivery described by the manufacturer, and dosage as well as dosing interval may need to be closely monitored.</p>
<p>The salt form of medications may also affect absorption. For example, calcium citrate does not require gastric acid for absorption of the calcium and is more easily absorbed than the carbonate salt. Calcium carbonate requires a higher acid concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533613490740">3</xref></sup> to dissolve the compound prior to absorption. The limited acid environment following gastric resection, gastric bypass, or even the normal patient on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker decreases the bioavailability of calcium carbonate.</p>
<p>For gastric bypass patients, route of drug administration, salt formation, monitoring of medication blood levels to ensure therapeutic concentrations, and appropriate nutrient and vitamin supplementation are important factors. The impact of obesity and changes in lean body mass may also be important considerations when choosing drug form and dose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533613490740">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533613490740">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>Small Intestinal Resections</title>
<p>Extensive small bowel resections can be the result of a number of diseases, including intestinal volvulus and inflammatory bowel disease. Resection of 50% or less of the small intestine usually poses minimal difficulties for patient management. Resection of up to 8 feet of the proximal jejunum can generally be compensated for with residual distal gut.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533613490740">11</xref></sup> Ileal motility is also significantly slower than duodenal and jejunal contractility, allowing additional time for absorption. In contrast, ileal or ileocecal resection results in more rapid intestinal transit and less time for absorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533613490740">12</xref></sup> The terminal ileum is also responsible for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and bile salt absorption and, when removed, can become problematic and is generally manifested by choleretic diarrhea. In the face of even marginal vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, neurotoxic agents may have accelerated toxicity profiles. An example would be metronidazole as well as some chemotherapeutic agents. Not only does bile salt malabsorption lead to choleretic diarrhea, but the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts also influences medication absorption. Drugs that are excreted in bile and have the duration of their action enhanced by enterohepatic circulation or are disrupted by bile salt malabsorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533613490740">13</xref></sup> include mycophenolic acid,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533613490740">14</xref></sup> warfarin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533613490740">13</xref></sup> digoxin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533613490740">15</xref></sup> oral contraceptives, cyclosporine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533613490740">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533613490740"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533613490740">18</xref></sup> tacrolimus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533613490740">18</xref></sup> and the statins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533613490740">19</xref></sup> Bioavailability and effects of these drugs may be decreased by the lack of normal absorption of bile in the terminal ileum. Instead of recycling and resecreting in the bile, these bile salts are excreted in feces, limiting bioavailability and decreasing the duration they are available for therapeutic effect.</p>
<p>When extended segments of bowel are resected or bypassed, fat malabsorption plays a role in the GI dysfunction. Malabsorption of fat predisposes patients to deficiencies of the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) as well as drugs that interact with the fat-soluble vitamins, such as coumadin. When vitamin K absorption is erratic, the effect of coumadin is difficult to predict.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533613490740">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533613490740">21</xref></sup> Given the narrow therapeutic window for coumadin, the patient can have inconsistencies in prothrombin time and international normalized ratio (INR). Frequently, the clinician must change therapy to an alternate anticoagulant. Outpatient low molecular weight heparin in either a therapeutic or prophylactic dose is an option if renal function is adequate. Fondaparinux (Arixstra; GlaxoSmithKline) is an alternative for anticoagulation. It is a synthetic pentasaccharide anticoagulant that works through antithrombin III–mediated selective inhibition of factor Xa. This drug is again administered subcutaneously but has the advantage of once-a-day dosing. The disadvantage of fondaparinux is that there is no specific antidote for reversal.</p>
<p>Other fat-soluble drugs and agents become similarly malabsorbed, such as hydrocortisone, estrogen,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533613490740">22</xref></sup> other sex hormones, and cyclosporine, all of which are very sensitive to fat malabsorption. Use of these agents in the setting of extensive small bowel resection may become problematic especially if a patient depends on immunosuppressive or oral contraceptive therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533613490740">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0884533613490740"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533613490740">25</xref></sup> Oral levothyroxine is absorbed better in the absence of food and should be taken in a fasted state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533613490740">26</xref></sup> Dosing should be monitored using TSH measurements.</p>
<p>Essential fatty acids are similarly not reliably absorbed when large segments of small bowel are resected. Because essential fatty acid deficiencies are so unusual, subsequent disorders and deficiencies may be confused with alternative diagnoses. Deficiencies of essential fatty acids have been identified in patients with cystic fibrosis as well as in those with chronic fat malabsorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0884533613490740">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0884533613490740">28</xref></sup> Clinical signs of essential fatty acid deficiency include a dry, scaly rash and poor wound healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533613490740">20</xref></sup> Fat malabsorption may be manifested by floating and bulky stools, exacerbated by dietary indiscretions. Other important clinical manifestations are osteoporosis (vitamin D deficiency), skin disorders (essential fatty acid, vitamin A, and vitamin E deficiencies), and bleeding disorders (vitamin K deficiency).</p>
<p>Often, patients with short gut syndrome are placed on H2 blockers or PPIs to decrease acid production and therefore decrease luminal volume and diarrhea experienced by these patients. Clinicians should be aware that the coadministration of drugs with antisecretory agents should be approached cautiously. Prior studies have shown that PPIs and H2 receptor antagonists impaired absorption of different drugs by increasing or decreasing their bioavailability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0884533613490740">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Gastric acid itself plays a role in the efficiency of absorption of some orally administered formulations. Studies have shown that PPIs increase stomach pH and inhibit absorption of drugs that are weak bases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0884533613490740">30</xref></sup> including the antifungals ketoconazole, itraconazole, and griseofulvin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0884533613490740">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0884533613490740"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0884533613490740"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0884533613490740">34</xref></sup>; the antiretroviral atazanavir<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0884533613490740">35</xref></sup>; cefpodoxime<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0884533613490740">36</xref></sup>; enoxacin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0884533613490740">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0884533613490740">38</xref></sup>; dipyridamole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0884533613490740">39</xref></sup>; vitamin B<sub>12</sub>; and iron salts. In contrast, increasing the pH in the stomach increases the bioavailability of medications, including digoxin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0884533613490740">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0884533613490740">41</xref></sup> nifedipine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0884533613490740">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0884533613490740">43</xref></sup> and alendronate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0884533613490740">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0884533613490740">45</xref></sup> via drug-induced hypochlorhydria and presumably also with surgically induced diminished gastric acidity. If PPIs must be used, alternate routes for affected medications may be an option. For example, enoxacin is available in IV form and dipyridamole is offered in an extended-release form. The extended-release form of dipyridamole has its contents protected by a tartaric acid capsule that decreases the pH and increases absorption of dypyridamole.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0884533613490740">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0884533613490740">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0884533613490740">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>In general, medications should be dosed to effect, and levels of critical drugs should be checked when possible.

<p>In the case of oral antibiotics, cephalexin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are well absorbed in the short gut.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0884533613490740">49</xref></sup> Metronidazole is absorbed in the critically short gut. In contrast, oral penicillins and macrolides are less well absorbed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0884533613490740">50</xref></sup> Fluconazole has been reported to be absorbed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0884533613490740">51</xref></sup> In 1 study, acyclovir was not well absorbed, but after increasing the dose to 800 mg 4 times a day, approximately half the normal dose was found in the blood of a patient with short bowel. This dose resolved the patient’s symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0884533613490740">52</xref></sup> If the microbe has limited sensitivities, choosing an IV formulation or using a liquid form may be necessary.</p>
<p>For less extensive intestinal resection, no modification of pharmacologic dosing may be needed. However, in patients with substantial resections, route of drug administration, salt formation, monitoring of medication blood levels to ensure therapeutic concentrations, and appropriate nutrient and vitamin supplementation are important to the patients’ care. The impact of malnutrition may also be an important consideration when choosing drug form and dose.</p>

<title>Colonic Resections</title>
<p>Although the colon is not as absorptive as the small intestine in normal health, it has several carrier-mediated transport systems that have been targeted for colonic absorption of pharmacologic agents. In addition, drugs that are incompletely absorbed in the small intestine may continue to be absorbed in the colon. When a patient has only part of his or her colon removed (left, right, or sigmoid colectomy), there is little change in the absorptive capacity. Some drugs such as diclofenac, metoprolol, isosorbide, nifedipine, and oxprenolol are well absorbed in the colon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0884533613490740">53</xref></sup> When available, rectal suppositories may deliver drugs effectively and with some improvement in absorption due to partial avoidance of the hepatic first-pass effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0884533613490740">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, when the patient has no colon (abdominal colectomy and ileostomy or an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis [IPAA]), the absorptive site for some medications is removed. One group of medications whose absorption is potentially affected by colonic removal includes extended-release products. Pharmacologic interest in controlled-release technology has increased because it allows less frequent dosing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0884533613490740">54</xref></sup> Extended-release β-blockers and antihypertensives can be dangerous when prescribed to patients without a colon because the medication is not completely absorbed. Early after administration, dosing provides appropriate blood pressure control. However, as time progresses, there is a lack of the pharmacologic intervention, and blood pressure and heart rate may rise to dangerous levels. This lack of therapeutic effect is due to expulsion and altered absorption of the medication. In addition, the colon is as permeable as the small intestine to some lipophilic drugs. Many extended-release compounds work because additional drug becomes available for absorption by protecting the agent until it reaches the colon. With the decrease in pH produced by an increase in short-chain fatty acids, the drugs become available, but when the colon is removed, these medications cannot be fully absorbed. The author has had patients who are dependent on narcotics go into withdrawal through the use of extended-release narcotics after their colons have been removed.</p>
<p>There has been recent development of products that are retained in the stomach through the use of polymer technology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0884533613490740">55</xref></sup> These drugs may be useful for patients with a decreased small intestine but would provide erratic product delivery in the patient with prior gastric surgery.</p>
<p>Patients with extremely slow transit due to intrinsic dysfunction and/or institutional bowel syndromes may require colonic resection due to pseudo-obstruction. These patients who were stable on antihypertensive or seizure medications may become rapidly destabilized as the source for absorption of these compounds is removed. In addition, these patients may have colons that absorb all of the water and electrolytes from their feces. Removal of the colon with a subsequent increase in fluid and electrolyte losses may eliminate the need for diuretic medications in the maintenance of a hypertensive patient. Similarly, relative dehydration experienced by these patients may accelerate renal failure. Renally cleared agents may be affected by this phenomenon. In addition, the clinician needs to be aware that with concurrent weight loss and the loss of muscle mass, creatinine and serum urea nitrogen levels may remain relatively stable while renal function is markedly diminished, therefore affecting the metabolism of drugs renally cleared. NSAID and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor administration may need to be modified if the patient has a decrease in renal function.</p>
<p>In the formation of an IPAA, most surgeons will perform a temporary loop ileostomy. Since this diverts the fecal stream at least 100 cm above the terminal ileum, it can be thought of as either a proximal ileostomy or a distal jejeunostomy and may produce the bile salt malabsorption seen with patients with short gut. This predictably leads to malabsorption of drugs such as mycophenolic acid,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533613490740">14</xref></sup> warfarin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533613490740">13</xref></sup> digoxin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533613490740">15</xref></sup> oral contraceptives, cyclosporine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533613490740">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533613490740"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533613490740">18</xref></sup> tacrolimus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533613490740">18</xref></sup> and the statins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533613490740">19</xref></sup> Although the loop ileostomy is temporary, the consequences of malabsorption of these agents can be long term and anticipated. For subtotal colonic resection, no modification of pharmacologic dosing may be necessary. However, in patients with bypassed colons or complete colectomies (familial adenomatous polyposis, ulcerative colitis with IPAA, and end ileostomies), avoidance of extended-release formulations and monitoring of medication blood levels to ensure therapeutic concentrations are necessary.</p>

<title>Stricture and/or Obstruction</title>
<p>In addition to removal of the intestine, disease and surgical alterations can mechanically obstruct orally ingested medications, particularly pills and capsules, as a result of strictures and partial obstructions. Strictures can be secondary to ischemia, inflammatory bowel disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0884533613490740">Figure 2</xref>), or celiac disease or can even be caused by the medications themselves. Occasionally, functional strictures can be found proximal to an ostomy. A normal anal sphincter dilates to allow the passage of feces; however, the diameter of a stoma as it passes through the abdominal wall remains a constant. When a large bolus of fibrous material and/or pills or capsules approach the abdominal wall, they can become impacted into the opening, similar to patients experiencing a gallstone ileus. When the pills are erosive, they can cause complications just proximal to the stoma. Enterically coated potassium or aspirin or drugs such as alendronate sodium (Fosamax; Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ), which are known to be toxic to epithelial cells, may be congested behind a stricture and produce additional ulcerations, GI upset, and bleeding.</p>

<title>Visual Confirmation</title>
<p>When the patient informs his or her physician that pills or capsules are seen in the toilet or ostomy bag, careful consideration should be given to the patient’s route of medication administration. It is likely that some or all of the drug is not being absorbed. One exception to this situation are capsules for the delivery of 5-aminosalicyclic acid (5-ASA), used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in the colon. These capsules may travel through the gut unchanged. The capsule then becomes perforated in the digestive tract, and the drug is delivered into the colon. Change of formulation or alternate dosing mechanism should be considered for the patient when the drug is excreted unchanged in the stool. In addition, drugs directed at treatment of a diseased colon such as 5-ASA compounds can be discontinued following removal of the colon.</p>

<sec id="section7-0884533613490740">
<title>Alternate Routes of Drug Administration</title>
<p>If drugs delivered from pills or capsules are not being absorbed or questionably absorbed, the easiest alternative is to administer the drug as a liquid formulation. Many drugs are available in liquid form and are marketed as pediatric formulations, including most cardiac drugs, pain medications, and antiseizure drugs. However, these formulations may be more expensive. For some medications, IV formulations are identical to the available oral drug and can be diluted, drawn up in a syringe or measuring device, and ingested orally. Without vehicle flavor, the taste may be offensive. However, most adults can tolerate this inconvenience. One example is the use of vancomycin for the treatment of <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> colitis, which requires the use of oral vancomycin to penetrate the colon. If vancomycin pills are not being absorbed or are expelled intact, they may be replaced with IV vancomycin ingested orally. Although the taste might be displeasing to the patient, parenteral vancomycin ingested orally performs the same function. This alternate route of vancomycin has shown to be successful in the treatment of <italic>C difficile</italic> colitis and is sometimes more cost-effective than the oral form.</p>
<p>Narcotics are available as highly concentrated liquids that are absorbed in the upper gut and mouth. Roxicodone intensol is an example of this type of agent. This drug can be absorbed in the upper gut, mouth, and esophagus and replaces other narcotic agents with would not be adequately absorbed.</p>
<p>Other routes for medication administration include intranasal formulations, which are increasingly available. An example of an intranasal formulation is intranasal calcitonin. Subcutaneous and intramuscular injections or intranasal formulations of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> provide adequate replacement when the terminal ileum is missing. Other examples of injectable formulations include low molecular weight heparin, which can be used to replace oral coumadin. Injectable methotrexate (replaced milligram for milligram) can be used to replace oral 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine for short bowel patients who are on therapy for Crohn’s disease.</p>
<p>Transdermal administration of narcotics, antihypertensives, and analgesics is an evolving technology. Consultation with a pharmacist may assist the clinician in considering an alternate route. Transdermal dosing requires a period to achieve equilibrium and also notably requires sufficient body fat to achieve therapeutic levels equivalent to the usual route of medication administration.</p>
<p>Suppositories are not popular formulations with many patients but can be effective if the patient has a rectum and can tolerate insertion of the drug. Similarly, transvaginal applications of drugs can be useful. For example, intravaginal estrogen can be given as a cream, suppository, or a long-acting ring to replace systemic estrogen therapy in patients who require estrogen replacement or supplementation.</p>
<p>When all else fails, IV formulations can be the system of last resort. For chronic requirements with critical short gut, IV administration will depend on permanent venous access, usually via a central venous access catheter. Care must be taken to prevent central venous catheter infection and to remain mindful of catheter complications.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Surgical resections may significantly affect not only the GI anatomy but also the physiology of drug absorption. Clinicians need to have a high index of suspicion for pharmacologic malabsorption in patients who undergo major gastric, small intestine, and large intestine resections. Attention to specific drug metabolism as well as the site of absorption is essential for assessing optimal pharmacologic benefit in this patient population. To date, multiple case reports have addressed this issue, but there have been few large trials or comprehensive reviews. These case reports support the concept that an alteration in pharmacologic benefit is often underappreciated in this patient population. Patient and clinician education is the first step in identifying potential issues with pharmacologic malabsorption in the setting of GI surgery.</p>
