<title>Background:</title>
<p>The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI), developed by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) to promote breastfeeding in maternity facilities worldwide, has had a global impact on breastfeeding outcomes, but other interventions are needed both before and after hospital discharge to meet the recommended targets at 6 months. The Baby-Friendly Community Initiative (BFCI), a multifaceted program for community-based breastfeeding promotion that is complementary to the BFHI, addresses this challenge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0890334412447994">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>To describe the development, strategy, and implementation of the BFCI in Italy.</p>
<p>Methods: In 2006, UNICEF Italy created a working group to develop the BFCI for the Italian health system. A review of the different BFCI models worldwide was conducted. A preliminary adaptation of tools to Italian community health care settings was developed in 2007, when the Italian BFCI Seven Steps were published. Two years later, UNICEF Italy launched the Standards for Best Practice for both hospitals and communities, based on 2009 BFHI and UNICEF UK BFCI materials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0890334412447994">
<title>Outcomes:</title>
<p>The main outcome was to promote this process in Italian regional health systems and develop tools to assess compliance with the BFCI criteria. There is now one fully accredited Baby-Friendly Community in Italy, and 17 other communities are working on the various stages.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Breastfeeding is the normal way to nurture a human baby and is currently recognized as a public health issue, not simply a lifestyle choice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412447994">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334412447994">2</xref></sup> The short- and long-term benefits of breastfeeding and human milk for children, mothers, families, and societies are well documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412447994">3</xref></sup> Breastfeeding initiation rates have increased, but cultural barriers to breastfeeding still exist,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334412447994">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334412447994">5</xref></sup> especially regarding exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months and prolonged breastfeeding, as recommended in the World Health Organization/United Nations Children’s Fund (WHO/UNICEF) Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334412447994">6</xref></sup> Gaps in rates of breastfeeding duration and exclusivity reflect the same sociodemographic, biomedical, and psychosocial determinants that cause health inequities and inequalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334412447994">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334412447994"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334412447994">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Virtually all mothers can breastfeed, but those who choose to do so need professional, community, and family support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334412447994">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334412447994">11</xref></sup> Once the decision to breastfeed is made, the continuity and quality of care are vital to establishing and maintaining breastfeeding. Various strategies have been suggested at the individual, health care, system, and societal levels to support the initiation and duration of breastfeeding and its exclusivity to 6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0890334412447994">12</xref></sup> These strategies include the involvement of health care professionals trained in specific, evidence-based courses free from conflicts of interest,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334412447994">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0890334412447994">14</xref></sup> the support of partners and family members,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334412447994">15</xref></sup> peer counselor and telephone support,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334412447994">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0890334412447994">17</xref></sup> home visits after hospital discharge,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0890334412447994">18</xref></sup> and the development of educational modules for a wider audience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0890334412447994">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The protection, promotion, and support of breastfeeding go far beyond the mere nutritional aspect, since they necessitate a series of interventions that satisfy other health needs of the child, the mother, and the family, together with a refocusing of hospital and community care practices, which must act synergistically. The BFHI, launched by UNICEF and WHO to protect, promote, and support breastfeeding, especially in maternity care facilities, enables families to make informed choices about infant feeding and encourages health professionals to create a more breastfeeding-friendly atmosphere and environment. There are currently 23 accredited Baby-Friendly hospitals in Italy, covering about 4% of births, and many others are working toward accreditation.</p>
<p>The BFHI has had an impact on breastfeeding rates, but other interventions are needed both before and after hospital discharge to meet the recommended targets at 6 months. In 2009, WHO encouraged health care systems to scale up the protection, promotion, and support of breastfeeding at the community level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334412447994">20</xref></sup> Community support—through training and social marketing—is a vital link in an effective and sustainable program, whether initially developed as part of the BFHI or integrated into ongoing community activities. There is no clear definition of a minimum package that should or could be made available to the community. The Baby-Friendly Community Initiative (BFCI), a program for community health care services, is one of the most challenging. The BFCI was first launched as a structured program in the United Kingdom in 1998,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0890334412447994">21</xref></sup> and later in other English-speaking countries (Australia, New Zealand, Canada), where a 7 point plan for the protection, promotion, and support of breastfeeding in community health care settings was adopted. The main objective of the BFCI is to create a breastfeeding culture in the community, within the greater context of a culture of children’s rights and health promotion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0890334412447994">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>This paper aims to describe the development, strategy, and implementation of the BFCI within local health authorities (LHAs) and its expansion into the community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0890334412447994" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>In Italy, the objectives of the BFHI are included among the priorities of the current National Health Plan,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0890334412447994">23</xref></sup> the National Prevention Plan,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0890334412447994">24</xref></sup> and the health program “Gaining Health,”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0890334412447994">25</xref></sup> and they are also a major focus of national guidelines on the protection, promotion, and support of breastfeeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0890334412447994">26</xref></sup> The BFCI, in Italy as in many other countries, works within the National Health Service (NHS) to ensure a high standard of care for pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, and babies in community health settings using a series of steps modified from the BFHI. If babies are formula fed, the community health services provide families with information on infant feeding based on current scientific evidence free from commercial interests. This initiative is focused on supporting parents according to their specific needs and puts a strong emphasis on empowering them to feel competent in caring for their children, as recommended by other national projects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0890334412447994">27</xref></sup> This report was exempt from IRB approval.</p>

<title>The History of the BFCI in Italy</title>
<p>In 2006, after mapping various pilot projects in Italy, the Task Force for the BFHI of the Italian National Committee for UNICEF (UNICEF Italy) established a working group, in collaboration with the Local Health Authority (LHA) of Milan, to extend the BFHI to the community and develop the BFCI for the Italian health system. The group was multidisciplinary and included health workers engaged in initiatives promoting breastfeeding or in community health and social services in various regions (Calabria, Emilia Romagna, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Lazio, Lombardy, Marche, Sardinia, and Tuscany). The first phase included a review of the different BFCI models worldwide, in particular those developed in English-speaking countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0890334412447994">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0890334412447994"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0890334412447994">30</xref></sup> These Steps, based on standards supported by the available evidence, were adapted to enable best practice in Italian LHAs. In 2007, this work was publicly presented at a national conference, and the Seven Steps (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0890334412447994">Table 1</xref>) were officially launched. On that occasion, the LHA of Milan was awarded the first Certificate of Commitment after a preliminary assessment.</p>

<p>Representatives from the Italian BFHI/BFCI Task Force visited the UNICEF Baby-Friendly UK team the following year both to visit an LHA working toward BFCI accreditation, as well as to discuss details of the initiatives with the Baby-Friendly UK staff. In 2009, UNICEF Italy launched the Standards for Best Practice for both hospitals and communities,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0890334412447994">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0890334412447994">32</xref></sup> adapted from the revised WHO/UNICEF BFHI materials and from the 2008 UNICEF UK BFCI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334412447994">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0890334412447994">33</xref></sup> The BFHI and BFCI are 2 separate but complementary initiatives presented together that been promoted by UNICEF Italy in an integrated way as “Together for Breastfeeding: Baby-Friendly Hospitals and Community—United for protecting, promoting and supporting breastfeeding,” using a multistage approach (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0890334412447994">Table 2</xref>) similar to Baby-Friendly UK. In the Italian health system, some LHAs include hospitals and community services, whereas other hospitals have their own independent management. Where there are LHAs with hospitals, it is hoped they will work toward both the BFHI and the BFCI; however, it is possible to work on just 1 of the initiatives.</p>

<title>The Seven Steps of the BFCI in Italy</title>
<p>The Seven Steps address challenges to breastfeeding in general, but they also cover a broader range of support for parents. Local health authorities should become centers of breastfeeding support and a point of reference for families who have any questions about their children. The staff is trained to observe a breastfeed and offer practical tips, to facilitate informed choice for parents regarding infant feeding, and to inform mothers about the different types of support available around the clock in case of problems. In this way, mothers do not feel so alone and can have a positive breastfeeding experience.</p>
<p>Step 1, as in the BFHI, requires the LHA to create a multi- disciplinary group, which draws up the policy on breastfeeding and infant feeding and relative clinical protocols, as well as the simplified version of the policy for parents and families, and promotes the Standards of Best Practice to all health services who have contact with pregnant women, mothers, and babies (eg, mother and child health centers, family health centers, pediatric clinics). Steps 2 and 3 in the BFCI also mirror those of the BFHI: training all LHA personnel according to international standards, using the WHO/UNICEF 20-Hour Course,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0890334412447994">34</xref></sup> and informing pregnant women about the importance of breastfeeding and the risks of artificial feeding. There are 3 different levels of training in the Italian BFHI/BFCI, similar to the model from New Zealand: informed personnel, involved personnel, and dedicated personnel. The amount of training needed varies from a simple 2-hour introduction for informed staff, to a longer (6- to 8-hour) course for involved staff, and finally, to the complete 20-Hour Course, including supervised clinical experience. In the BFCI, the 20-Hour Course has an extra module on complementary feeding based on a document developed within a European Union-funded project.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0890334412447994">35</xref></sup> Information about the Mother-Friendly Step from the BFHI has also been included in the BFCI materials. The BFHI Steps 4-9 about practical information and help for mothers can be found in Steps 4 and 5 of the BFCI, which deal with the practical aspects of helping breastfeeding mothers, as well as those who choose to formula feed, right up through the return to paid work outside the home and the introduction of solid food.</p>
<p>Step 6, which is unique to the BFCI, involves creating a welcoming environment for breastfeeding mothers both within health facilities and in public places in the community. This step led to the creation of a series of Baby Pit Stops in Milan: places in public locations or businesses where the nursing mother could feel welcome and breastfeeding could once again be considered a natural act that can be done in public. The pit stops are free, do not require any purchase in a store, and are guaranteed by the LHA of Milan and UNICEF, with a periodic review by a consumers’ group called Baby Consumers. Initiatives are currently underway to develop breastfeeding-friendly day care and workplaces.</p>
<p>Step 7 of the BFCI is the same as Step 10 in the BFHI and focuses on working together with other services and groups who offer support for infant feeding, including mother-to-mother and peer support groups that are not part of the NHS. Other support may also be offered through a breastfeeding helpline, local health clinics, hospitals, or Baby-Friendly physicians’ offices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334412447994">19</xref></sup> The creation of these networks takes time and energy, but it also allows breastfeeding to become part of a larger effort to help parents, thanks to initiatives such as breastfeeding-friendly pharmacies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0890334412447994">36</xref></sup> where all staff need to complete a 15-hour course, promote breastfeeding as the norm, sell breast milk substitutes only upon specific request, and avoid all promotional activity related to the marketing of breast milk substitutes, bottles, and teats.</p>
<p>The Step concerning the International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes (the Code) is just like that in the BFHI, although LHAs do not distribute formula, so in some ways, implementation is easier. Health care personnel are required to meet in groups, not individually, with any industry representatives and cannot accept free samples, donations, or anything else that might constitute a conflict of interest. The same rules that apply to marketing of products covered by the Code have been extended to pacifiers, nipple shields, and breast pumps in the Italian BFHI/BFCI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0890334412447994">
<title>Becoming Baby-Friendly</title>
<p>During the process, each hospital or LHA follows a structured sequence that begins with the development of an infant and child feeding policy and other documents in Stage 1, completion of training for personnel in Stage 2, and ensuring Baby-Friendly care for all mothers and children in Stage 3, with external assessments in the final 2 phases. During the 4-5 years of the Baby-Friendly accreditation process, UNICEF Italy provides support for the relevant facilities and evaluation in 3 stages, thus making the initiatives more feasible. All stages of the program are supported by tools in Italian, which are available online at the UNICEF Italy site. This sequence introduced 2 new elements into the process: a tutor, assigned to each LHA, who enters the BFCI process from a pool of specially trained health professionals; and the steering committee of independent experts, both based on the UK model. The tutor regularly reviews self-assessments, action plans, and internal audits and evaluates compliance before the external assessments in Stages 2 and 3. Since the Stage 1 assessment is an examination of the documents, the tutor reviews them and recommends them for approval to the task force and the steering committee. The role of the steering committee is that of an overseeing body that can review materials or assessments to guarantee conformity with the standards for the BFHI/BFCI. During the accreditation process, hospitals or LHAs are given a “certificate of commitment” after passing the Stage 2 assessment and the formal BFCI award after the completion of Stage 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0890334412447994">
<title>Determining Which Services to Assess</title>
<p>To receive designation as a Baby-Friendly Community (BFC), an LHA must undertake a process of self-assessment and demonstrate that it has created an effective network in the community, in which all the stakeholders (health care managers, family doctors and pediatricians, gynecologists/obstetricians, psychologists, midwives, nurses, medical assistants, administrative staff and volunteers, local governments, hospitals with maternity facilities, and others) act synergistically to protect, promote, and support breastfeeding. The Italian NHS is implemented slightly differently in each region because governance has been given to the regions, which must follow national guidelines but can implement them according to regional needs. The minimum common denominator in terms of organizational “units” was deemed to be the community health district of an LHA. The theoretical area has a population of about 80,000-100,000 inhabitants, but there are possible differences arising from local situations. In all settings, the LHA must include all staff in the local health clinics who work with pregnant women, mothers, and children, as well as NHS pediatricians and family doctors, all of whom must be trained according to their role and are eligible for external assessment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0890334412447994">
<title>Measuring Organizational Change in LHAs</title>
<p>Throughout the process of becoming Baby-Friendly, both hospitals and community health services are expected to use the triple-A sequence of Assessment, Analysis, and Action, which characterizes many UNICEF programs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334412447994">19</xref></sup> A self-assessment questionnaire about the Steps was developed for the BFCI, mimicking the one used for the BFHI, as well as a monitoring packet including an audit for personnel based on UK materials, and questionnaires for pregnant women and mothers based on the international ones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0890334412447994">38</xref></sup> The services are asked about compliance with the Standards of Best Practice and the Code. This initial self-assessment leads to an analysis of the practices that encourage or hinder breastfeeding and subsequent actions needed to effect these changes. Analysis of audit results is carried out with the tutor and enables the facility to then plan how to proceed. Once these actions are carried out, the process is repeated to verify the successful outcome.</p>

<title>Measuring Outcomes</title>
<p>In 2009, UNICEF Italy, together with the Institute for Maternal and Child Health IRCCS Burlo Garofolo of Trieste and the LHA of Milan, also undertook a multicenter research project to assess the impact of this structured program on rates of breastfeeding. The project involves 18 health districts across Italy that include inner-city neighborhoods, towns, and rural areas. It aims to see whether application of the 7 Steps of the BFCI promotes good practice in local health services in support of mothers and children and whether implementing the BFCI leads to an increase in the rate of exclusive breastfeeding to 6 months of age. The participating LHAs were divided into early and late intervention groups that would each implement the 7 Steps of the BFCI; one group was to begin a year after the other had started. A paper describing the research design and reporting baseline data is under preparation.</p>

<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>“Together for Breastfeeding: Baby-Friendly Hospitals and Community united for the protection, promotion, and support of breastfeeding” is one of those programs that helps health services improve care practices and makes families the focal point when supporting parents’ choices for the feeding and care of their children. There are many different ways of supporting breastfeeding throughout pregnancy, at birth, and during the first year of life. It is essential, however, to keep in mind the geographic, economic, linguistic, and cultural factors that can increase the accessibility of existing services. This increased accessibility may require actively offering services tailored to the specific needs of the most vulnerable population of women with special needs (primiparae, immigrant mothers, adolescent mothers, single mothers, mothers with a history of breastfeeding difficulties or those who quit breastfeeding before they wanted to, and mothers of multiples) or children with special needs who should receive appropriate care and support. Each of the LHAs working toward BFCI designation has had to develop strategies for reaching those families who are most in need of help, either by offering parenting classes at different times during the day or on Saturdays, offering classes with interpreters, or working with local hospitals to develop a coordinated approach to the BFHI and BFCI.</p>
<p>Because many of the 18 LHAs have similar language barriers, 2 of the LHAs collaborated with UNICEF to develop a model summary of the policy, which all LHAs are required to prepare, and to translate the summary into a number of languages as part of Step 1. The LHAs are not required to use this particular summary, but it is available for those who would like to. Some of the LHAs are simply using the text and rebranding the images and layout for their own LHA.</p>
<p>As part of the triad of protection, promotion, and support of breastfeeding, it is important for health care personnel to promote full implementation of the Code, including the subsequent relevant World Health Assembly resolutions to address misinformation and alleviate the commercial influences surrounding infant and young child feeding, which are, unfortunately, still widespread. The Code continues to be of interest to those working in the BFHI/BFCI, and sessions dedicated to the Code during the annual conference for the Italian BFHI/BFCI Network have been lively, stimulating, animated discussions.</p>
<sec id="section14-0890334412447994">
<title>First BFCI Award</title>
<p>As in any project that promotes public health, it is important to be recognized for achieving the final goal. In 2011, the first BFCI award was presented; after an external assessment similar to ones used in the BFHI, the LHA of Milan was the first community in Italy to achieve full accreditation. The LHA serves around 14,000 newborns a year and has significant population flux and mixed ethnicity. The LHA of Milan had begun working on becoming Baby-Friendly in 2002, before the creation of a BFCI in Italy, and had gradually adopted the 7 Steps in a structured way, with a periodic review of their application using a self-assessment tool and an audit of breastfeeding rates according to WHO definitions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0890334412447994">39</xref></sup> In order to meet full BFCI standards, the LHA of Milan commissioned the breastfeeding project coordinator to lead the project and effect the changes needed. The approach used in Milan was found to be effective, as breastfeeding rates were better than in other LHAs in the same region that did not implement the BFCI standards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0890334412447994">40</xref></sup> The clinical staff at the LHA of Milan confirmed the usefulness of carrying out an internal audit consisting of interviews with health care staff to assess knowledge and practical skills, and interviews with mothers to assess their knowledge and skills compared to standards before the external assessment.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>The practice of breastfeeding today must be strongly protected, promoted, and supported. In this sense, the role of health professionals is crucial, but it requires specific and thorough theoretical and practical training on the subject. Some basic guidelines help to create a health system that can favor the cultural environment, for example, by providing consistent and correct information for mothers and their families from conception to birth and through the first year of life. Numerous challenges were encountered along the way, such as developing leadership capacity, delivering training, getting all the stakeholders involved, making organizational changes, and analyzing more effective pre- and postnatal interventions.</p>
<p>In order to strengthen breastfeeding promotion, it is important to closely link breastfeeding and complementary feeding interventions. The challenges to supporting appropriate complementary feeding include wide dissemination of global indicators, the necessity of limiting the influence of baby food and other industries to avoid commercial intrusion into public health activities, tension between big corporations and local producers, the need to improve marketing practices that are compliant with the Code, affordability and accessibility of food, and cultural beliefs and habits regarding infant feeding.</p>
<p>Finally, promoting breastfeeding has more far-reaching implications: it has an impact on daily life, social organization, quality of relationships, time management, and gender roles from birth onward. In this sense, it is considered a powerful indicator of the quality of life and a community’s attention to its future; according to the World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action, it is “an indicator of the real progress of the health of all communities, locally and globally.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0890334412447994">41</xref></sup> The BFCI was developed in Italy by adapting the BFHI to local social and health services in order to achieve optimal support through a continuum of care before, during, and after birth.</p>
