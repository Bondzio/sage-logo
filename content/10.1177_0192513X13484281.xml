<abstract>
<p>This article investigates adolescent men’s pregnancy resolution choices in Australia, Ireland, and Italy. It addresses two main gaps in the literature: the lack of research on (adolescent) men’s views on unintended pregnancy and pregnancy resolution and the lack of international comparative case studies on men and reproductive choices. Consistent with theories of the transformation of intimacies in society and the growth of individualization, the results suggest that adolescent men are interested in the effect of an unintended pregnancy on their individual biographies as well as the effect on their girlfriend’s health and well-being. However, Australian male adolescents were much more likely to choose abortion than Italian or Irish adolescents, suggesting adolescent males have also internalized country-level debates surrounding abortion. Methodologically, the article demonstrates an innovative approach to data collection using a computer-based interactive drama to facilitate participants’ deliberation and responses. It was shown to engage a large number of adolescent men and is likely to have wider generalizability in developing international comparative research on the topic as well as applications for health promotion.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In this article, we present a cross-national analysis of adolescent men’s views on pregnancy resolution in three culturally and legally distinct settings using data derived from a culturally sensitive computer-based interactive video drama. The results describe the similarities and differences in the Irish, Italian, and Australian adolescent men’s views and find that the differences are consistent with the liberal–conservative context in which the adolescent men reside. After elaborating the research question in the context of the extant literature, describing the country cases, the innovative methodological approach, and presenting the results, we describe the implications of the results for our understanding, cross-nationally, of adolescent men’s views and the potential of the methodological approach for large-scale international research on this topic.</p>

<title>Background Literature</title>
<p>Research on unintended pregnancy has focused almost exclusively on women in relation to their responses to such a pregnancy and decision-making processes, leaving important questions concerning the male partners’ roles and perspectives unanswered. This research with women confirms the importance of men’s roles in defining and constraining women’s responses to an unplanned pregnancy in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192513X13484281">Browner, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192513X13484281">Cowley &amp; Farley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192513X13484281">Kero, Högberg, &amp; Jacobsen, &amp; Lalos, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0192513X13484281">Mahon, Conlon, &amp; Dillon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0192513X13484281">Sihvo, Bajos, Ducot, &amp; Kaminski, 2003</xref>) and specifically the importance of <italic>adolescent</italic> men’s roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192513X13484281">Broen, Moun, Bödtker, &amp; Ekeberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0192513X13484281">Resnick, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0192513X13484281">Stevenson, Maton, &amp; Teti, 1999</xref>). However, much of the research on the role of men in pregnancy resolution has investigated the views of men as perceived by women. This needs to be complemented by research that focuses directly on men’s perspectives in order to better understand men as “being reproductive in their own right” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192513X13484281">Inhorn, Thomsen, Goldberg, &amp; La Couer Mosegaard, 2009</xref>, p. 3). While feminists have argued that a woman’s right to choose should be protected, they have equally acknowledged that such decisions cannot be completely the issue of a “private choice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192513X13484281">Davis, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192513X13484281">Himmelweit, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0192513X13484281">Petchesky, 1986</xref>) because, in the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0192513X13484281">Petchesky (1986</xref>, p. 7), “it lets men and society off the hook,” assuming that men can, or want to, stand back from these difficult, potentially life-changing decisions. In particular, in recent times, the rise of the study of critical studies of masculinities and poststructuralist theory within feminism throws a different light on fertility control and reproductive health in modern societies. The study of masculinities has been important in exploring the gendered construction of men’s lives, deconstructing masculinities and femininities as always oppositional and looking for the ground between (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192513X13484281">Brod, Kaufman, &amp; Men’s Studies Association, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192513X13484281">Connell, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192513X13484281">Kimmel &amp; Mahalik, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192513X13484281">Lohan, 2007</xref>). The emergence of poststructuralist theory also heightens our awareness of diversity in men’s and women’s experiences of gendered social relations, including in relation to family planning, pregnancy, and childbirth.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In the context of the sociology of human reproduction, this provides an added impetus to the reconceptualisation of fertility-infertility in inter-relational terms (rather than as “women’s difficulty”), and attempts to decouple the historical association of women and reproduction which has long sustained male hegemony. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X13484281">Annandale &amp; Clark, 1996</xref>, p. 33)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The debate about men’s standing relative to women’s in reproductive matters is connected to the larger sociological debate about the democratization of gender relations in the intimate sphere and the emergence of relationships that are more equally and mutually satisfying, yet at the same time more uncertain and open to dissolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192513X13484281">Beck &amp; Beck-Gernsheim, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192513X13484281">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X13484281">Giddens, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192513X13484281">Jamieson, 1988</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X13484281">Giddens (1992)</xref> writes of a “transformation of intimacies” in which sexual relationships represent a new kind of intimacy based on a negotiated agreement between individuals of equal standing and on an increased level of self-reflexivity of what each other’s needs are. These new types of intimate relationships are also referred to as “the pure relationship” grounded in confluent love and equality in the emotional exchange and less bound by obligation and duties. This literature presents a commentary on intimate relationships in which decisions are premised more on what individuals think and need in relation to their individual life courses (individualization), rather than on traditional gender, family, and occupational norms, and especially emphasize women’s greater autonomy to express their needs within relationships.</p>
<p>While one gains an insight into how the broader reflexive project in society affects gender relations, there is a notable theoretical impasse in this literature in that men’s own experiences of changes in contemporary gender relations are overly determined and absented from the arguments. Empirical detail on how reproductive decision making is negotiated within contemporary intimate relationships from men’s perspectives is scant. The specific case of how men might choose to resolve an unintended pregnancy is a potentially revealing test case of the emergence of the “pure relationship” and the democratization of gender relations because, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0192513X13484281">Turney (2011)</xref>, even in relationships that achieve the fragile balance between individual and joint interests, a pregnancy may destabilize it because the choice to parent or not to parent is typically unevenly distributed biologically, socially, and morally. Thus, feminist research that explores men’s perspectives and experiences of unintended pregnancy will not only contribute to an understanding of men as “reproductive in their own right,” which is long overdue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192513X13484281">Inhorn et al., 2009</xref>, p. 3) but will also increase our knowledge of the gender-relational context of how intimate relationships and reproductive decision making are experienced in contemporary society. The scholarly call to end the marginalization of men in reproductive health research and in reproductive services is spreading across disciplines and growing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X13484281">Bowner &amp; Preloran, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192513X13484281">Dudgeon &amp; Inhorn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192513X13484281">Inhorn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192513X13484281">Kero, Lalos, &amp; Wulff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192513X13484281">Locock &amp; Alexander, 2006</xref>; Marsiglio, 1998a, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0192513X13484281">1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0192513X13484281">Sherr, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0192513X13484281">Thompson &amp; Lee, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The case of adolescent unintended pregnancy is also an interesting one because of the intense worldwide policy interest in reducing unintended adolescent pregnancies in the interests of health and well-being (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0192513X13484281">Savio Beers &amp; Hollo, 2009</xref>, for overview). In the context of an enormous amount of research on the topic of adolescent pregnancy worldwide, there is a very notable dearth of research conducted with adolescent men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192513X13484281">Lohan, Cruise, O’Halloran, Alderdice, &amp; Hyde, 2010</xref>), and part of the reason for this lies in the methodological challenges of researching adolescent men’s views and experiences of an unintended pregnancy. The challenges primarily concern two inter-related issues: relevance and access. In relation to relevance, gender norms in society and reproductive physiology have meant that adolescent men generally do not have the same opportunities as adolescent women to imagine an unplanned pregnancy in their lives and to think through the consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0192513X13484281">Marcell, Raine, &amp; Eyre, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0192513X13484281">Marsiglio &amp; Shehan, 1993</xref>). Therefore, previous research with adolescent men has involved the use of written vignettes to evoke a scenario and to probe adolescent men’s thoughts and hypothetical decision making in relation to an unplanned pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X13484281">Hooke, Capewell, &amp; Whyte, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0192513X13484281">Marsiglio, 1988a</xref>, 1988b, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0192513X13484281">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0192513X13484281">Marsiglio &amp; Menaghan, 1990</xref>). In relation to access, the sensitivity of the issues in question and the absence of any clinical or social space in which researchers might recruit adolescent men who are, or have been, involved in pregnancy outcome decisions (especially in the numbers required to test the saliency of the psychosocial determinants in a quantitative design) means that it is exceedingly difficult to collect data directly from adolescent men in relation to their perspectives on resolving an unintended pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192513X13484281">Buston, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0192513X13484281">Marsiglio &amp; Menaghan, 1990</xref>). Researchers have only attempted this direct approach inquiring into adolescent men’s actual experiences in a small number of qualitative studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192513X13484281">Buston 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192513X13484281">Cater &amp; Coleman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192513X13484281">Holmberg &amp; Wahlberg, 2000</xref>) and small-scale quantitative studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0192513X13484281">Redmond, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0192513X13484281">Vaz, Smolen, &amp; Miller, 1983</xref>). However, only in two of these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192513X13484281">Buston, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192513X13484281">Holmberg &amp; Wahlberg, 2000</xref>) was there any degree of depth approached on the pregnancy resolution issue in particular.</p>
<p>A further approach to the study of adolescent men and pregnancy resolution choices has been to do surveys of college men’s views on abortion only. This research has been predominantly conducted among small and convenience samples of college men in the United States and with particular reference to men’s <italic>right</italic> to be involved in pregnancy termination decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X13484281">Coleman &amp; Nelson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192513X13484281">Esposito &amp; Basow, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0192513X13484281">Jones, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0192513X13484281">Nelson, Coleman, &amp; Swager, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0192513X13484281">Ryan &amp; Dunn, 1983</xref>; as an exception see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192513X13484281">Agostino &amp; Wahlberg, 1991</xref> who interviewed school-aged men). Finally, national studies of adolescent men, also conducted in the United States, inquire into adolescent men’s more general views on abortion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192513X13484281">Boggess &amp; Bradner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192513X13484281">Ku, Sonenstein, &amp; Lindberg, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0192513X13484281">Marsiglio &amp; Shehan, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, the literature suggests a need for a turn in research on reproduction and couples’ relationships that acknowledges men’s views on, and participation in, reproductive decisions. While the small number of studies on adolescent men and pregnancy described above represents a welcome shift, to date, this research has been national rather than cross-national in scope and has focused largely on adolescent men’s attitudes to abortion only. A further limitation is that in studies that have inquired into men’s direct experiences of pregnancy resolution decisions, the adolescent men have been recruited primarily through their female partners (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192513X13484281">Buston, 2010</xref>, for exception which was with incarcerated males) and, finally, the use of very short written scenarios (sometimes three or four lines) arguably does not allow sufficient immersion for the research participants in a hypothetical case study of an unintended pregnancy. The exploratory study presented in this article assesses cultural differences regarding adolescent men’s pregnancy resolution choices in relation to a hypothetical unplanned pregnancy across three different countries. More specifically, this article focuses on adolescents’ perceptions of the positive and negative consequences of either having an abortion or keeping the baby in response to a hypothetical unintended pregnancy in their own lives. This analysis will identify the extent of similarities and differences in adolescent men’s attitudes across three culturally and legally distinct contexts.</p>

<title>The Case Studies</title>
<p>Australia has adopted a very liberal position on the provision of abortion services, but there are variations in each State’s legislation. In South Australia, where this study took place, it is legal if two doctors agree that a woman’s physical and/or mental health is endangered by pregnancy, or for serious foetal abnormality. Essentially, abortion is available to women. In 2010, 52.5% of known adolescent pregnancies in South Australia were terminated, being 16.1 per 1,000 of young women aged between 15 and 19 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0192513X13484281">Pregnancy Outcome Unit, 2012</xref>). Rates have been gradually declining since 2002, along with the adolescent pregnancy rate. There is no accurate collection of statistics Australia-wide.</p>
<p>By contrast, the Republic of Ireland has one of the most conservative policies on abortion in the western world; here, it is illegal to have an abortion except where there is a real and substantial risk to the life (as distinct from the health) of the mother. Owing to legal restrictions on abortion in the Republic of Ireland, women who live in Ireland and who decide on abortion/termination as a resolution to pregnancy must travel outside the country (usually to Great Britain) to private clinics or hospitals offering such services. In 1980, the rate of abortion was estimated at 3.1 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 19 years, rising to a peak of 6.0 in 2001 and falling back to 3.5 in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192513X13484281">Lohan, Cruise, O’Halloran, Alderdice, &amp; Hyde, 2011</xref>). Italy sits in the middle of this continuum of liberal–conservative polities within the context of these three countries and, more broadly, in relation to policies on abortion in western developed countries. Abortion is available to women on the grounds of health, economic, social, or family reasons but up to 90 days (12 weeks) only. Between 12 weeks and 20 weeks, an abortion is only permitted if there is a threat to the life or health of the pregnant woman. Referrals for a termination of pregnancy are made through primary physicians or maternal health clinics to the public hospitals. In Italy, the rate of abortion for 15- to 19-year-olds was 5.5 per 1,000 women in 1990, also rising to a peak of 7.1 in 2000 and decreasing to a rate of 6.6 in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192513X13484281">Italian National Institute of Statistics, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The countries also vary in terms of levels of religiosity. Australia is notably the most secular of the three societies. Although the most common religion in Australia in 2011 is Roman Catholicism (25.3%), followed by Anglican (17.1%), church attendance in Australia is relatively low. Less than 20% attend church once per month or more. Also, a significantly large proportion of the population professes to have “no religion” and “no religion” is the response that shows the largest growth in numbers over time. Buddhism represents the largest proportion of the three most common non-Christian religions (2.5%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192513X13484281">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2011</xref>). In spite of the increasing secularization of both Italy and Ireland, and the influence of religious pluralism as a result of migration to these countries, the vast majority of their respective populations remain Roman Catholic (more than 80% of the populations of both countries are Catholic). Although both countries have also shown sharp increases in the numbers of people that profess no religion and very significant decreases in church attendance, both countries still show relative high levels of church attendance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192513X13484281">Ballarino &amp; Vezzoni, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192513X13484281">Central Statistical Office, 2011</xref>). Estimates of the proportion of the populations of both Italy and Ireland who attend mass on a weekly basis currently stands at more than 30%, which are among the highest levels in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192513X13484281">European Social Survey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192513X13484281">Irish Times, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, these country-level differences in abortion provision, religious composition, and levels of secularization are important. The Catholic Church has a particularly uncompromising position on abortion, stating that life must be protected from the point of conception and thus, unlike other religions, such as Islam, does not recognize the greater rights of the pregnant woman over the life of the foetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0192513X13484281">Hessini, 2007</xref>). The thesis of individualization is based on increased secularization, signifying the decline of religious norms in society on individuals’ preferences and also depends on the availability of services which, for example, allow individuals the ability to choose a medically safe and economically affordable abortion. Hence, the departure point of the selected case studies is an expectation that more favorable responses toward abortion in the context of an unintended adolescent pregnancy would be elicited from respondents residing in the more culturally secular and legally liberal settings.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>In this study, we used a computer-based interactive video drama (IVD) first developed by researchers in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192513X13484281">Condon, Corkindale, Russell, &amp; Quinlivan 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192513X13484281">Corkindale, Condon, Russell, &amp; Quinlivan, 2009</xref>). Participants were provided with the researchers’ production of an original filmed scenario of a week in the life of a young man whose girlfriend has just told him she is unintentionally pregnant. The IVD is approximately 25 minutes long in duration. This was used as a means to assess the decision making of participating adolescent males about a hypothetical unintended pregnancy. The IVD had the advantage of enhancing the potential of the research participants to identify with the lead character and the challenges he faces relating to making a decision. The participants were cued about the status of the relationship: “That’s Emma been going out with her for a while.” Throughout the drama, participants were asked to consider various questions embedded in the film screen and then click on an answer that best reflected their response. The purpose was to engage participants in explorations of how they would feel and act if they were in this situation. Details about the design and composition of the IVD can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192513X13484281">Condon et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192513X13484281">Lohan et al. (2011)</xref>. Drawing inspiration from this Australian study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192513X13484281">Lohan et al. (2011)</xref> investigated male adolescents’ attitudes in Ireland by adapting the instrument to the Irish context and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0192513X13484281">Olivari, Confalonieri, Ionio, Milani, and Traficante (2011)</xref> adapted the instrument for use in Italy. In the case of Italy, the original instrument was dubbed into Italian. In the case of Ireland, the researchers recreated the original Australian film using Irish actors and Irish settings and pilot tested the tool for face validity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0192513X13484281">1</xref></sup> This adaptation involved only minor changes to the original script. The embedded questions were predominantly the same regardless of the country-level version.

<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 771 adolescents attending high schools from three countries were recruited by means of different enrolment techniques. Three hundred and thirty were from Australia, 360 were from Ireland, and 81 were from Italy. Participants in Ireland and Australia were selected through stratified random sampling. In Australia, schools were stratified to account for variation by the type of school (public/private, mixed sex/single sex) and socioeconomic status. In Ireland, schools were stratified to account for variation by socioeconomic advantage/disadvantage, urban/rural, religious/nonreligious, single or mixed sex. Participants in Italy were selected through a convenience sample of northern Italian schools but the sample is broadly representative of the region in terms of socioeconomic status and whether the school was single or mixed sex. Further detail on the respective samples is available from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192513X13484281">Condon et al.

<title>Procedures and Materials</title>
<p>Ethical approval for the study was obtained from each of the three respective universities involved in each of the countries. Individual consent forms were signed by all participants who were assured of their anonymity. Data collection in Ireland and Australia occurred within computer suites in schools under “exam conditions.” Data collection within Italy occurred in a university computer suite, also under “exam conditions.” Participants were administered the IVD (Australia and Italy: “If I were Ben,” cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192513X13484281">Condon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192513X13484281">Corkindale et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0192513X13484281">Olivari et al., 2011</xref>; and in Ireland: “If I were Jack,” cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192513X13484281">Lohan et al., 2011</xref>) assessing their attitudes toward a hypothetical unintended pregnancy of their partners. The IVD is designed to be used by adolescent men, each participant watching the action at his own computer, listening to the dialogue through headphones, following the lead character as he faces the issues imagining how he thinks he would feel and act: “If I were Jack.” In particular, the IVD probes adolescent men’s own attitudes to two pregnancy outcome options: choosing to continue the pregnancy or choosing abortion. These attitudes are investigated through 24 dichotomous (important/not important) items assessing participants’ attitudes toward the perceived advantages and disadvantages of abortion and of continuing the pregnancy (cf. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0192513X13484281">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0192513X13484281">3</xref> for the list of items). The items were developed from focus group research with adolescent males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192513X13484281">Condon et al., 2006</xref>) and tested for face validity in Ireland and Italy. The responses to these questions were automatically saved to the computer program of the IVD.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Described first are country comparisons of adolescent men’s reactions to the news of the pregnancy, their communication with their parents, and their help-seeking and coping behaviors. Described second are country comparisons of adolescent men’s attitudes to the advantages and disadvantages of continuing versus discontinuing the pregnancy in the context of this hypothetical situation and their final pregnancy resolution choices. Across the three nations, adolescent males were most likely to say they would feel shocked on hearing the news that their girlfriend was pregnant (Australia, 64%; Ireland, 50%; Italy, 44%) followed by the next most common response (frightened). Only a small minority in each country said they would be happy (Australia, 4%; Ireland, &gt;1%; Italy, 1%). Most adolescent males would tell their parents, although in each of the countries and particularly in Australia and Ireland, adolescent males predicted that they were more likely to tell their mothers than their fathers (Australia, 70% tell mother, 61% tell father; Ireland, 76% tell mother, 65% tell father; Italy, 77% tell mother, 75% tell father). In terms of help-seeking and coping behaviors, the adolescent males had a strong sense of self-efficacy. While more men in Italy and Ireland said they would feel like crying in the face of dealing with this situation (Australia, 39%; Ireland, 57%; Italy, 51%), the vast majority in each of the countries said that they were going to be able to “help with this” (Australia, 89%; Ireland, 86%; Italy, 83%) and felt that they must “have a say” (Australia, 87%; Ireland, 93%; Italy 87%). Consistent with this perceived desire to be involved and to help out, a very strong majority in each country said they would visit a crisis pregnancy counselor (Australia, 89%; Ireland, 92%; Italy, 90%). However, only a minority in each country said they could cope with being a father at their age (Australia, 33%; Ireland, 39%; Italy, 21%).</p>
<p>In relation to country comparisons of adolescent men’s attitudes to the pregnancy resolution choices, country of origin was cross-tabulated with responses to the 24 dichotomous items in order to detect statistically significant variations in the perceived (positive and negative) consequences of continuing and discontinuing the pregnancy across the three contexts. The percentage frequency distribution and chi-squares of all 24 items are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0192513X13484281">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0192513X13484281">3</xref>. The percentages represent the proportion of the men in the total sample who identified the perceived (positive or negative) consequence as important consideration to them. Each respondent was expected to consider each and every consequence. A <italic>p</italic> value of &lt;.05 was established before analysis as the measure of significance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0192513X13484281">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>As far as the negative aspects of an abortion are concerned, there are very few differences across the country samples. What is interesting, however, is that the male adolescents share a significant concern for the girlfriend’s health and well-being in going ahead with an abortion. More than 85% of male adolescents in all three countries state that it is an important consideration to them that an abortion could be physically risky for their girlfriends and more than 80% in all three countries state that it is an important consideration that an abortion could be mentally risky for their girlfriends. Regarding the items about the positive consequences of having the baby, only one substantively sizable difference emerges—relating to enjoying being a Dad. Italian participants are more likely than the Australian and Irish adolescents to idealize the positive aspects linked to the continuation of the pregnancy. In particular, more than 80% of Italian participants rate as “important to me” the responsibility assumption linked to becoming a father and the possibility of having a baby to love. It is important to note also that the percentages of Irish and Australian adolescents are higher than 60% for this item, signifying that, across the three countries, adolescent males can also identify with the positive consequences of having a baby. As far as the negative aspects of having a baby are concerned, three differences emerge that are not only highly statistically significant but are also substantively sizeable in the terms of the magnitude of the percentage differences. First, almost 80% of Australians say “it would ruin my future,” compared with between 50% and 60% of Irish and Italian male adolescents. Second, Australian male participants are more unhappy with the financial cost of babies compared with the Irish and Italian participants and, third, significantly more Australian male adolescents agree that there would be negative aspects, such as losing sleep and having to change nappies (37% of Australian participants compared with 24% of Irish participants and 7% of Italian participants).</p>
<p>Finally, in relation to adolescent men’s pregnancy resolution choices, a similar pattern emerged (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0192513X13484281">Table 4</xref>). Consistent with the attitudinal items shown above, adolescents in Ireland and Italy were much more likely to choose to continue the pregnancy (keep the baby) over adolescents in Australia. In Ireland, 76.9% of the adolescent male participants chose to continue the pregnancy compared with 60.6% in Italy and 43.4% in Australia. Overall, these country-level patterns mirror the dominant cultural and legal context of abortion in each country. In the more catholic restrictive regimes of Ireland and Italy, adolescent males’ choice to keep the baby dominates over the choice of abortion as their preferred outcome in relation to an unintended pregnancy.</p>

<p>The considerable health and social consequences of adolescent pregnancy have meant that understanding, preventing, and to some extent supporting, adolescent pregnancy has been a high priority across western developed nations for more than three decades (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0192513X13484281">Savio Beers &amp; Hollo, 2009</xref>, for an overview). However, within the significant body of research on adolescent pregnancy, there is a notable dearth of research that examines the male role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192513X13484281">Alan Guttmacher Institute [AGI], 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192513X13484281">EngenderHealth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0192513X13484281">Lindberg, Sonfield, &amp; Gemmill, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192513X13484281">Lohan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0192513X13484281">Marsiglio, Ries, Sonenstein, Troccoli, &amp; Whitehead, 2006</xref>). While it is the woman’s right to choose pregnancy resolution outcomes in the event of an unintended or crisis pregnancy, men’s views are important because a considerable bank of research with women, including adolescent women, identifies that their male partners’ views, or the estimated views of their partners, affect women’s decision-making processes as well as their sense of support in making decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192513X13484281">Broen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192513X13484281">Browner, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192513X13484281">Cowley &amp; Farley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192513X13484281">Kero et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0192513X13484281">Mahon et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0192513X13484281">Sivho, Bajos, Ducot, &amp; Kaminski, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0192513X13484281">Resnick, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0192513X13484281">Stevenson et al., 1999</xref>). The study of adolescent men’s perspectives on unintended pregnancy and pregnancy resolution decision making is driven also by the emergence of feminist-informed critical studies on men and poststructuralist theory in feminism. These scholarships share a concern for drawing men in from the edges of decision making on reproduction and breaking down essentialist gender constructions that previously designated family planning, pregnancy, and childbirth as being the purview of women only.</p>
<p>Amongst the limitations to the current study are variations across the three samples, notably the nonrandom and smaller sample size in the Italian case, and the marginally older sample in the Italian case relative to the Ireland and Australia cases, the small number of cases overall, and the generally exploratory nature of the study. In addition, the results are based on men’s views on a hypothetical pregnancy in their lives rather than on a retrospective study of actual experiences. However, this article makes a contribution to illuminating adolescent men’s perceptions of the relative advantages and disadvantages of abortion and continuing the pregnancy in the context of a hypothetical unintended pregnancy in their own lives. Moreover, the cross-cultural comparisons of adolescent men’s attitudes to both keeping the baby and abortion is a unique contribution to the current literature and helps to begin to theorize the effect of country-level context on adolescent men’s choices. The sizable differences identified in adolescent men’s views in relation to the perceived advantages and disadvantages of abortion versus keep the baby across the three countries are consistent with an expectation that more liberal responses would be elicited from respondents residing in the culturally and legally liberal setting. The biggest differences put Australian male adolescents on one (liberal) side and Italians and Irish on the other (conservative) side. Adolescents in Australia placed greater emphasis on being able to finish school, babies being costly, losing sleep, and not liking nappies. Consistent with the literature on the transformation of intimacies and growth of individualization in society (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192513X13484281">Beck &amp; Beck-Gernsheim, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192513X13484281">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X13484281">Giddens, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192513X13484281">Jamieson, 1988</xref>), the results suggest that cross-culturally men are interested in the effects of an unintended pregnancy on their individual biographies as well as being concerned about how an abortion would affect their girlfriend’s health and well-being. However, levels of individualization were also shown to be affected by wider social norms in society in that levels of individualization were more extreme in countries with more liberal laws and cultural norms governing abortion. The results thus suggest that adolescent men are aware of, and have internalized, the debates surrounding the value of abortion in their country-level context.</p>
<p>In addition to these theoretical concerns, the results also suggest the potential to create greater and more explicit engagement with adolescent men in relation to anticipatory thinking around the consequences of an unintended pregnancy in their lives and their role in communicating with their partners around its resolution. In particular, the consistently high numbers of adolescent men across the three countries who suggest that they would feel shocked and frightened on receiving news of their partner’s unintended pregnancy as well as the high number of men who said they would tell their parents and would like to seek help from a counselor, demonstrate a need among adolescent men to be offered informal and formal sources of support. It is increasingly apparent to researchers, practitioners, parents, and others who work with youth that targeting adolescent men is an important, yet neglected, part of preventing unintended adolescent pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192513X13484281">AGI, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192513X13484281">Kirby, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0192513X13484281">Lindberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192513X13484281">Lohan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0192513X13484281">Marsiglio et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0192513X13484281">Smith, Guthrie, &amp; Oakley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0192513X13484281">Swann, Bowe, McCormick, &amp; Kosmin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0192513X13484281">World Health Organization, 2011</xref>), and the findings of this study suggest a need among adolescent men to be included in crisis pregnancy support services. One of the applications of the IVD developed for the purposes of data collection in this study has been its redevelopment as part of culturally sensitive educational interventions in second-level schools in South Australia, Ireland, and Northern Ireland. The key educational aim of the interventions is to raise awareness among young men as well as young women about the potential consequences of an unintended pregnancy in their lives and to increase young people’s self-efficacy in communicating about unintended pregnancy.

<p>The article also addresses the methodological challenge of researching adolescent men’s views in relation to unintended pregnancy resolution choices. The topic is challenging not only because of the cultural sensitivities in many countries around abortion per se but also because of the gendered cultural construction of pregnancy and abortion as being more an issue of concern for adolescent girls than adolescent boys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192513X13484281">AGI, 2002</xref>). Thus, a significant methodological challenge exists for researchers in recruiting men into research on reproduction, and especially in relation to abortion, in ways other than through their female partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192513X13484281">Buston, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192513X13484281">Kero et al., 2010</xref>). The method developed here of a computerized IVD is built on the researchers’ production of an original film depicting a week in the life of a young man, seen from his point of view, whose girlfriend has just told him she is unintentionally pregnant and is explicitly targeted toward eliciting men’s responses. The film is “interactive” in that it pauses throughout with questions that invite participants to role-play how they would act and feel in relation to pregnancy resolution choices if this scripted scenario of an unintended pregnancy were to happen in their lives. While further innovative methods may need to be developed to access men’s own lived experiences of dealing with the consequences of an unintended pregnancy, the picture emerging from these findings is that this method of eliciting responses among a general population of adolescent men in the context of a hypothetical unintended pregnancy was operational across three cultural contexts and, thus, is likely to have wider generalizability.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The article is grounded in the theoretical concerns of poststructuralist feminism and the literature on the transformation of intimacies and individualization in society, which suggest that one, we need to pay greater attention to men’s role in reproductive choices and two, reproductive choices in late modernity are less influenced by overarching senses of traditional values and moral norms and more influenced by a negotiated agreement between two individuals of equal standing and informed by increased attention to each other’s needs. In applying these theoretical departure points to the study of adolescent pregnancy, the study specifically addresses two main gaps in this literature, namely the neglect of adolescent men’s views on dealing with an unintended pregnancy and international comparisons of young people’s views.</p>
<p>The results show that cross-culturally adolescent men are concerned with the effects of an unintended pregnancy on their lives and future life chances and that of their girlfriends suggesting evidence of individualization. However, the greater chance of adolescents in Australia choosing an abortion over those in Italy and Ireland and in articulating the negative impacts of a pregnancy on their current and future life chances, suggests that levels of individualization may be greater in more highly secularized and liberal countries. In addition, the results suggest that an unintended pregnancy would be a significant crisis in an adolescent male’s life and cross-culturally, adolescent men expressed an interest in informal and formal support mechanisms in the event of such a crisis in their lives. The greater inclusion of men in pregnancy counseling services is required to disrupt notions of unintended pregnancy as being solely a woman’s issue.</p>
<p>The methodological contribution of the study is the demonstration of a computer-based IVD as a means of stimulating deliberation and participants’ responses to the experience of a hypothetical scenario of an unintended pregnancy that was operational across different cultural contexts. Taken together, the substantial and methodological conclusions of this exploratory study suggest the potential for theoretically interesting large-scale international comparisons with data derived from culturally specific IVDs. This would facilitate cultural context to be theorized and formally incorporated into analyses of men and reproductive decision making more generally and specifically in relation to adolescent men’s views on pregnancy resolution.</p>
<p>More generally, the article argues that studies that overlook paternal involvement run the risk of missing a crucial element in understanding reproductive desires, decision pathways, and contemporary gender relations. Future research might explore more deeply adolescent men’s experiences and expand international comparative work.</p>

<p>We pretested the script of the interactive video drama among a similar sample of adolescent men in three focus group discussions. Examination of the data poststudy showed that the level of “don’t know” responses to questions was low. Also, in questions designed to measure the extent to which participants could identify with the main character, responses indicated a high level of identification.
