<p>The topics Noha Mellor et al. cover in <italic>Arab Media</italic> provide a context for the large-scale use of emerging media technologies and formats in the Arab countries. This is evident in the argument that Arab media have undergone a sequence of changes due to the acceleration of globalization. Globalization is seen as a process where global and local cultures are emphasized. Attitudes towards the globalization of popular media often see it as a detrimental process of unbalanced cultural exchange and western hegemony. However, the authors acknowledge the perceived benefits of globalization, including the propensity to foster economic development. Western influence on ‘serious’ media, such as news and debate programming, is seen as a progression towards democratization.</p>
<p>The book is divided into eight chapters, each focusing on one form of Arab media. Chapter 1 examines the overarching shift from media as a tool for public mobilization to media as a means of commercial profit; chapter 2 looks at the print and publishing industry; chapter 3 examines the Arab press; chapter 4 is about the radio broadcast sector; chapter 5 is a survey of the television industry; chapter 6 focuses on the cinema; and chapter 7 addresses the spread of the internet and its increasing role in the Arab public sphere. Chapter 8 and the Conclusion bring the book to a close by addressing more recent trends and the future of the Arab media industry.</p>
<p>One overarching trend in the Arab media landscape is the control of authoritarian regimes over the media industries. However, the region is also home to media industries that have undergone commercialization and liberalization while remaining under the thumb of these totalitarian regimes. In chapter 1, Mellor argues that since independence the media have contributed to the emergence of an Arab identity and have undergone privatization efforts. Economic development and the spread of new media platforms have led some to question whether this will increase Americanization rather than the emergence of an Arab identity based on Arab terms.</p>
<p>In chapter 2, Nabil Dajani addresses the growth and development of the Arab publishing industry. Dajani’s main criticism is that the industry focuses on the physical aspect of printing rather than the human element and is too quick to embrace technological advances as they pour in from the West. Without human participation in the process, the industry is simply overlaying western technology, rather than focusing on development from within the region. Dajani calls for Arab printers and publishers to seek help from regional companies.</p>
<p>The third chapter covers the development of the press in the region, which was heavily influenced by several factors, including conflicts between minority sects and a push for Arab nationalism. Its orientation towards political and economic elites meant that the press has failed in its role as a watchdog. Low revenue has led many of these newspapers to rely on government subsidies, thus encouraging journalists to favour the interests of those providing financial support. According to Dajani, the main issue facing Arab print media is a distorted vision of freedom. A more beneficial conceptualization of freedom is one that requires active participation from the public. It is also one that ‘rejects the hegemony of ruling authorities and the business sector’ (p. 66) and that serves the public, not only political elites</p>
<p>In chapter 4, Muhammed Ayish examines radio broadcasting, asking whether the emerging information and communications technologies (ICTs) that have increased radio offerings have in turn led to a larger social role for radio in a society often defined by authoritarianism. Ayish answers that radio has turned into a forum for ‘nonpolitical discussions on public issues’ (p. 84), as well as a tool for generating income by private broadcasters and a venue for foreign public diplomacy. Radio has also contributed to sectarian divisions within Arab society. However, Ayish argues this has more to do with regional politics than radio broadcasting itself.</p>
<p>Ayish discusses the evolution of the Arab television broadcast industry in chapter 5. A key question is its role in democratization and cultural revivalism. According to the author, some see it as tool for national development, others view it as an avenue for the infiltration of western culture. Research indicates that television raises public awareness but fails to contribute to changes on the ground. It is difficult to ascertain the true impact of broadcasters’ influence on political and cultural transformation: it serves as a government mouthpiece, yet contributes to democratic education; it is a hegemonic conduit between the West and Arab countries, but it also promotes social and moral values.</p>
<p>Mellor discusses Arab cinema in chapter 6, specifically Egypt’s important role in the development of the industry. Generally speaking, the industry has contributed to the breaking of regional social taboos. Mellor points to the history of privatization where, unlike television, Arab cinema has enjoyed autonomy from state control since the 1970s. Increased reliance on international funding could change the subject matter and encourage addressing more daring topics. Globalization of the industry also means increased exposure internationally. However, cinema has a high barrier to entry as financial resources are concentrated among a few players.</p>
<p>The internet is currently a hot topic of debate regarding Arab media. In chapter 7, Khalil Rinnawi writes about the often ‘schizophrenic’ (p. 123) Arab internet landscape. It is at once both repressed by authoritarian regimes and embraced as a necessity for economic development. On a social level, the internet in Arab countries acts as an outlet for expression that is not provided by traditional media. The internet is evolving at a more accelerated rate than other media industries as it is relatively young and allows for rapid dissemination of information. Rinnawi points out that internet use is increasing exceptionally fast in the Arab world. However, the most game-changing aspect of ICTs is possibly that they transcend social class and are more difficult for the regime to control.</p>
<p>Chapter 8 and the Conclusion are devoted to trends in Arab media and their future. Rinnawi clearly lays out the four most important effects of globalization on Arab media: privatization of mass media outlets, cross-ownership, trans-border ownership, and the regionalization of marketing and advertising (p. 149). According to the authors, globalization has affected Arab media profoundly and the sector has become more complicated than ever. The autonomy of Arab media within a global context, as well as issues of identity and culture are the subject of contention and contradictory views.</p>
<p><italic>Arab Media</italic> includes detailed information and a clearly presented argument, making it an accessible book for those not familiar with the Arab media industries. One of the most beneficial aspects of the book is its emphasis on historical context. <italic>Arab Media</italic> also begins with an overview of the region, which is immensely helpful for someone who is not too familiar with the Arab world.</p>
<p>The authors’ objective is not to take overtly normative positions on the state of Arab media forms. However, the authors do make suggestions about how Arab media can address certain challenges. Overall, the book provides a comprehensive outline of Arab media, but, more importantly, it examines the effects of an increasingly globalized world on the region’s dynamic media industries.</p>
