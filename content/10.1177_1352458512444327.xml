<abstract>
<p>Randomized clinical trials (RCT) in multiple sclerosis (MS) have a recent tradition, but their number has been exponentially increasing since the first study detecting the efficacy of a disease modifying drug in MS. To examine the methodological details of reports of RCT in MS, we extracted from five leading journals all the reports of RCT published between 1993 and 2010. Trial reports were compared for different periods (1993–2001, 2002–2006, 2007–2010) for a set of indicator variables reflecting methodological quality (including details about randomization and blinding, statistical methods, results reporting, subgroup analyses). Fifty-three reports were included in the analysis. All of the methodological items indicated an improvement over time in the quality of reporting, the main weaknesses being frequent and inappropriate use of significance testing for assessing baseline imbalances and the statistical approach to subgroup analysis. A complete and transparent reporting of trial methodology is becoming even more important in an era when new design strategies are required for the feasibility of future trials in MS.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The first positive trial assessing the efficacy of a disease modifying drug (DMD) in multiple sclerosis (MS) is dated in 1993<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512444327">1</xref></sup> fixing at that year the start of the era of randomized clinical trials (RCT) in MS, much later than, for example, oncology which boasts a long tradition in RCT since the late 1950s. Since that year, many RCT have been conducted in MS and a standard methodology has been consolidated ranging from phase II placebo-controlled trials, typically lasting 6 months with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) endpoints, to phase III placebo-controlled trials lasting 1–2 years with relapse or disability progression endpoints. This process has brought to the market new drugs as alternatives to Interferon, and other therapies will become available in the near future. So we have entered a new era of RCT in MS: since patients are enrolled in trials which are more and more benign and the use of placebo has become ethically questionable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512444327">2</xref></sup> new design strategies are required to handle this evolution, and a large effort is devoted to study, among other strategies, the validation of surrogate outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512444327">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512444327">4</xref></sup> and the application of adaptive designs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512444327">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512444327">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, after about 20 years of RCT history in MS, the aim of this paper is to review the quality of RCT in MS reports from 1993 to 2010. In this last decade, the quality of RCT reporting has in general constantly improved, with many journals having statistical refereeing and clearer guidelines to authors. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement, first published in 1996<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512444327">7</xref></sup> and revised in 2001<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512444327">8</xref></sup> and 2010<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512444327">9</xref></sup> provides recommendations for authors regarding how to prepare reports of trial findings. In this paper we assessed the methodology of RCT reports in MS using indicators of quality based mainly on the explicit reporting of details of trial design and conduction, statistical analysis and the display of results.</p>

<sec id="section2-1352458512444327" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Material and methods</title>
<p>We searched reports of RCT in MS published between 1993 and July 2010 in <italic>The Lancet, Lancet Neurology, Annals of Neurology, Neurology</italic> and <italic>The New England Journal of Medicine.</italic> We screened electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE (1993–July 2010), PubMed (1993–July 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1993–July 2010) to identify trials fulfilling the following inclusion criteria: randomized, phase II or phase III, placebo or active-controlled trials in MS, assessing the efficacy of DMD of any class. Reviews, observational studies and secondary publications were excluded. Two researchers (AB and AS) independently extracted data relevant for the analysis and any discrepancies were checked by a third assessor (MPS) and resolved by discussion.</p>
<p>MS type, trial phase, number of centers, treatment arms, sample size and follow-up length were extracted as ‘general’ items. The presence of the term ‘randomized’ in the title, systems to implement randomization and method to generate randomization lists, blinding methodology, explicit definition of the primary outcome, intention to treat (ITT) analysis and details about calculation of sample size were extracted as ‘methodological’ items. The presence of a flow diagram, details on patients lost to follow-up, reporting and comparison of baseline characteristics between randomized group and possible imbalances noticed, covariate adjustment for primary outcome (pre-planned or not) and which analysis (unadjusted or adjusted) received more emphasis were collected as items related to ‘presentation of results’. The number and proportion (%) of trials reporting different items of the CONSORT statement were reported. Years of publication were categorized in three classes, as 1993–2001, 2002–2006, 2007–2010. SPSS (v.18; IBM Corporation) was used for computation.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 288 studies were screened. Of these, 226 were excluded mainly because they were solely observational studies or they were focused on symptomatic drugs. Among the remaining 62 papers, nine were excluded after reading the full articles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512444327">Figure 1</xref>) and 53 trials were finally included: 23 published in <italic>Neurology</italic>, 10 in <italic>The Lancet</italic>, 9 in <italic>The New England Journal of Medicine</italic>, 7 in <italic>Lancet Neurology</italic> and 4 in <italic>Annals of Neurology</italic>. Seventeen studies were published in 1993–2001, 17 in 2002–2006 and the remaining 19 studies in 2007–2010. A table listing all of the studies included in this review is reported in the Supplementary Material.</p>

<p>The median number of patients enrolled was 297 (range 30–2244) with a median follow-up of two years (range 6–36 months). Just four trials were monocentric, and the median number of centers involved in multicenter studies was 32 (range 1–198). The number of centers involved was significantly higher in 2007–2010 (median=50) as compared to 2002–2006 (median=37) and 1993–2001 (median=11, <italic>p</italic>=0.001, test for trend). Twenty-eight trials (52.8%) had two arms, 22 trials (41.5%) had three arms, two trials (3.8%) had four arms and one trial (1.9%) had five arms. Overall 44 trials (83%) were placebo-controlled. Primary outcomes were MRI outcomes (41.5%), relapses (26.4 %) or disability (22.6%); other outcomes were both relapses and disability (7.5%) or relapses and MRI (1.9%).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458512444327">Table 2</xref> shows information collected on methodological items. The term ‘randomized’ is reported after 2001 (55.6% of trials) slightly more frequently than in the period 1993-2001 (35.3%, p= 0.28). Most of the trials (about 83%) did not report the systems of allocation concealment and, if quoted, the interactive voice responder resulted the most adopted method (13.2%). The statistical method used to generate the randomization list was specified in 43 trials (81.1%), with block randomization as the most used method (81.4%). In 25 out of the 49 multicenter studies (51%), randomization was balanced for center.</p>

<p>Among the 17 trials for which a randomization balanced for baseline covariates was done, seven studies involved only one baseline characteristic and a maximum of four features was balanced for. The baseline characteristics most used for adjustment were age, sex and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). In the majority of trials (90.6%) a double-blind procedure was implemented, with only one study conducted without any method of blinding. Among blinded trials, 49 (94.2%) reported details on who was blinded and in 31 (59.6%) details on how blinding was achieved were shown. Details about calculation of sample size were reported in 44 trials (83%). Primary outcome was predefined in all but two trials, both run in the period 1993–2001. Thirty-four trials (64.2%) were ‘positive’ trials, with a significant treatment effect. In 42 trials (79.2%) the ITT principle was adopted for data analysis, with an increase in more recent trials (2002–2010: 88.9%) as compared to older studies (1995-2001 58.8%, <italic>p</italic>=0.02).</p>

Eleven trials (20.8%) did not report any CONSORT diagram, eight of which were between 1993 and 2001 (p=0.002 for the comparison 1993–2001 vs. 2002–2010). The number of levels of the diagrams increased from a median of four (range 0–7) in the period 1993–2001 to a median of six (range 0–14, p=0.009). Almost all trials (52/53) reported information on the number of patients lost to follow-up, with 50 trials (94.3%) also reporting details about reasons for the loss to follow-up. All trials showed a table of baseline characteristics by treatment allocation. The number of baseline features varied widely with a median of 10 features and a maximum of 22 features. About half of the trials (28/53, 52.8%) assessed imbalances between treatment groups by significance tests. Imbalance, based on p&lt;0·05, was claimed in six trials, for a total of eight significant baseline differences, which is 3% of 274 identifiable significance tests. The use of statistical tests to evaluate imbalances of baseline characteristics has not decreased in more recent years (p for heterogeneity=0.22, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1352458512444327">Table 3</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Thirty-nine trials (73.6 %) analyzed primary outcomes with adjustment for some covariates and in 35.9% of trials adjustment was pre-planned. The number of covariates used to adjust for was never higher than 6 and adjustment for 2–4 covariates was the most frequent case. The majority of studies (76.9%) using a covariate adjustment for the primary outcome reported just the adjusted results and only in 15.4% of trials both unadjusted and adjusted results were shown; none of these trials found any difference between adjusted and unadjusted results. Correction for the center effect was applied to 20 (52.6%) out of the 37 multicenter trials including a covariate adjustment.</p>
<p>Covariates frequently included into the main analysis were baseline EDSS score, previous years relapses or baseline MRI activity. The statistical methods most widely used were the Cox proportional hazard model or the log-rank test for time to progression of disability; the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used for the number of MRI lesions or the rate of clinical relapses. In more recent years this model was replaced by generalized linear models, as Poisson regression (for relapse rate) and Negative Binomial regression (for MRI lesions).</p>
<p>Fifteen trials (28.3%) included subgroup analysis in the principal report while other three trials had a subgroup analysis performed and published in separate papers. Among these 15 trials, four (26.7%) presented subgroup results without statistical tests, eight (53.3%) reported the <italic>p</italic>-values of comparison between drugs in each subgroup while only three (20%) performed an interaction analysis to test for heterogeneity of treatment effect between the subgroups. All reports did subgroup analysis on the primary outcome of the study while in seven studies (46.7%) this was done on more than one outcome. Six reports (40%) claimed features from subgroup analysis on abstract or conclusions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The clinical trial scenario in MS has been rapidly changing in these last years. The advent of new effective therapies has made the use of placebo unethical,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512444327">2</xref></sup> at least in trials lasting more than six months. Methodological research in MS is focusing on the search for better clinical outcomes and valid surrogate markers to investigate the efficacy of new drugs with enough power. With this background, in this review we give a picture of the state of the art of methodology of RCT in MS, focusing on the quality of reporting in five leading journals.</p>
<p>A detailed documentation of randomization methods was lacking in the first MS trial reports, but improved after the publication of the CONSORT statement in 2001.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512444327">8</xref></sup> Methods used to generate the random sequence, details about blinding, details about the balancing of randomization, assumptions for sample size calculation and application of the ITT analysis have all featured in improved documentation after 2001. This improvement can be imputed to the editorial policy of medical journals that, with the endorsement of the CONSORT statement, both helps authors in providing the clarity needed by readers wishing to assess a trial’s validity, and also forces researchers and sponsors to routinely implement the basic procedures of good methodology of RCT.</p>
<p>A questionable practice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512444327">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512444327"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512444327">12</xref></sup> largely adopted is the use of significance tests for detecting baseline differences. The null hypothesis of no differences between the treatment arms is true by definition, since the randomization procedure guarantees that any baseline differences are due to chance alone. About half of the trials do such significance tests and this practice does not decrease in recent years; on the other hand, usually no information is given on whether baseline factors are associated with outcome, a more interesting insight than the focus on significant differences that are by chance. Our 3% rate of significant baseline comparisons is slightly lower than in earlier surveys with a 4–6% rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512444327">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512444327">11</xref></sup> and is consistent with the rate of 5% of such tests expected to reach p&lt;0·05.</p>
<p>The statistical issues related to subgroup analysis in RCT are well known<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512444327">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458512444327">14</xref></sup> including the concept that the reliance on subgroup <italic>p</italic> values is misleading. Nevertheless the use of interaction tests to assess the heterogeneity of treatment effect across different subgroups, the correct approach, is still underused. Subgroup analysis reflects the scientifically important issue that the treatment may have really different effects according to certain baseline characteristics. However, if the overall treatment effect is significant, some subgroups will and some will not show significant differences depending on chance and the smallness of subgroups. An example is the subgroup analysis of the CHAMPS study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458512444327">15</xref></sup> published in a companion paper. In the abstract the authors stated, ‘Intramuscular Interferonβ-1a initiated at a first demyelinating attack delayed clinically definite MS in monofocal patients (<italic>P</italic>=0.0013), patients with or without gadolinium enhancing lesions (<italic>P</italic>=0.0007, <italic>P</italic>=0.0405) and patients with at least nine T2 lesions at baseline (<italic>P</italic>=0.0044)’. This sentence suggests that the drug delayed clinically definite MS just in the indicated subgroups. As for patients classified according to their number of baseline T2 lesions, in the results we find that ‘over 2 years, the unadjusted Hazard Ratio (HR) was 0.50 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.19–1.37; <italic>P</italic>=0.1700) for patients with fewer than nine T2 lesions and 0.53 (95%CI 0.34–0.82; <italic>P</italic>=0.0044) for patients with nine or more T2 lesions’. So the treatment effect was pretty much the same in the two subgroups, but it was non-significant in patients with fewer than nine T2 lesions because their group was small (90 subjects), while it was significant for patients with nine or more T2 lesions who were more numerous (286 subjects). The correct approach, based on an interaction test, would have compared the HRs (0.50 vs. 0.53), indicating a lack of evidence that the intervention’s effect (significant on the whole group) depended on the number of baseline T2 lesions. Subgroup analysis constitutes additional data usually not appearing in the first report that would be of interest for MS specialized journals. It must be noted that, since interaction tests commonly lack statistical power in single trials, the combination of individual patients’ data in meta-analyses would be crucial to detect subgroup effects. Meta-analyses pooling individual-patient data from different RCT have never been performed in MS research, due to the companies’ reluctance to combine their data. MS specialized journals should promote the publication of such kind of pooled analyses.</p>
<p>Since most of the RCT in MS are fully or partially sponsored by industry (92% of those included in our analysis) it is not possible to assess the impact of the funding source on the quality of reporting. Otherwise, while industry-funded research largely resulted associated with increased likelihood of pro-industry results,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458512444327">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458512444327"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458512444327">18</xref></sup> there are conflicting results on the limited data about the association of industry funding with methodological quality, with some studies indicating even a higher quality (probably associated with the greater financial resources) compared to non-industry funded trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458512444327">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458512444327">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, reporting of several important aspects of trial methods has improved since 1993. The editorial policy of medical journals has driven this improvement and should continue to enrich the guidelines for authors, covering also technical aspects (e.g. ‘the use of interaction test is required for subgroup analysis’) whose application will end up to educating authors to the adoption and reporting of correct procedures.</p>
