<abstract>
<p>The general aim of this paper is twofold. First, we evaluate Mead’s later efforts at developing a non-conscious theory of meaning that refutes the primacy of Descartes’s <italic>cogito</italic> as a foundational explanation of adult human understanding and social interaction. However, paired with this first goal, we also intend to use Mead’s theoretical framework as a paradigmatic example of a theory of intersubjectivity. We will show how Mead problematically reintroduces the presence of conscious awareness in order to provide an intersubjective account of mutual human understanding and interaction. We argue that this position reveals a lacuna in both Mead’s theory of meaning specifically, as well as in theories of intersubjectivity more broadly. Such approaches require a foundational account of <italic>practical</italic> meaning and knowledge. We conclude by exploring the links between these arguments and the emerging theory of interobjectivity.</p>

<p>The contemporary human condition in modern societies is characterized by conflicting worldviews that come into contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354311409794">Giddens, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959354311409794">Moghaddam, 2008</xref>). In the contemporary world, as people meet and interact—be it in public places, on vacation, or online—they increasingly come face to face with others whose views differ markedly from their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354311409794">Giddens, 1991</xref>) and at times may appear odd, abhorrent, or even bizarre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354311409794">Benhabib, 2002</xref>). This fact creates new challenges for intersubjectivity—understood as the human ability to take the perspective of the other—for how can we understand someone whose perspective we do not understand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959354311409794">Sammut &amp; Gaskell, 2010</xref>)? This paper revisits G.H. Mead’s contributions in defining the human capacity for perspective taking, which we see as one of the paradigmatic accounts of a theory of intersubjectivity. However, rather than reexamining Mead from contemporary social and political theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959354311409794">da Silva, 2007</xref>), or rereading Mead’s ontogenetic arguments in light of the social act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354311409794">Gillespie, 2005</xref>) or his theory of perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354311409794">Martin, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959354311409794">2006</xref>), the general aim of this paper is to explore his efforts at dealing with the philosophical legacy of the <italic>cogito</italic> by examining and evaluating how he treats the presence of conscious subjectivity in his “theory of meaning.” Given the fact that the presence of subjectivity is necessarily implied in any account of intersubjectivity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959354311409794">Sammut, Daanen, &amp; Sawarti, 2010</xref>), such an evaluation of meaning and conscious awareness in a paradigmatic example such as Mead points towards the importance these topics have for theories of intersubjectivity more broadly.</p>
<p>In the 350-plus years since Descartes’s death, there have probably been as many articulations of this problem as there have been philosophers. This paper attempts to strip this “problem of the <italic>cogito</italic>” down to its most basic articulation. The problem of the <italic>cogito</italic> is seen as one reducible to the fundamental position that Descartes gave to our self-conscious knowledge of the world as the Archimedean point for one’s understanding of the world. Mead reacts against this claim that individuals are originally and fundamentally related to the world in terms of their own self-conscious knowledge of the world. His response to this problem was to reject its preeminence, rejecting the foundational status of the <italic>cogito</italic> as an original given from which all other knowledge derives. However, he went about this task in two different ways. Mead’s first response is commensurate with the canonical interpretation of his work; namely, he rejected the preeminence of the <italic>cogito</italic> by arguing that self-consciousness is itself dependent on group life. This is his <italic>ontogenetic</italic> response, widely known through his discussions on play and games (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959354311409794">Mead, 1934</xref>).</p>
<p>This paper, however, will focus on Mead’s second approach. It is worth noting at this point that our argument here is concerned only with Mead’s attempts to deal with the problem of the <italic>cogito</italic> in the context of adult human beings, and that it does not address his ontogenetic or phylogenetic arguments. As Cook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354311409794">1993</xref>, p. 80) points out, Mead often conflates these separate levels of analysis, which in turn often leads to confusions in interpreting his work. Similar to his ontogenetic arguments, it is necessary to debunk the priority that self-consciousness plays in our understanding of the world. However, Mead’s emphasis in this second case deals with the level of adult human interactions with the world. In his later work particularly, and in a similar fashion to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354311409794">Dewey (1922)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959354311409794">Heidegger (1927/1996)</xref>, Mead emphasizes the position that a “consciousness of” the meaning of objects about us is a secondary or derivative way of understanding the world. This paper will argue that we can see such an attempt in Mead’s discussion of “the world that is there” coupled with his theory of perspectives. Thus, Mead is again addressing the problem of the <italic>cogito</italic> by attempting to develop a theory of meaning which does not require a conscious awareness of the meaning of objects as its precondition. The key to appreciating these arguments lies in grasping the phenomenological relevance of Mead’s work and thus in understanding meaning from the point of view of the fully enculturated adult human actor engaged in interaction with the world.</p>
<p>However, the overall purpose of this paper is more ambitious and should be seen as possessing two driving aims. First, we uncover a problem in Mead’s articulation of the social act that his theoretical framework doesn’t fully address. When Mead’s social act is examined in the context of adult human social interaction (and thus not as an ontogenetic argument), we find that Mead is forced to reintroduce the presence of conscious awareness as a <italic>necessary</italic> condition of the adult human social act. Thus, not only does this reveal a certain incoherence in light of his discussions on the world that is there and his theory of perspectives, but it also points towards an even greater problem with how he conceives of the capacity for human understanding itself. For Mead, in spite of the fact that meaning is a social product (as per his ontogenetic arguments), the presence of consciousness is inappropriately reintroduced in the adult human social act as a process of conscious interpretation. In other words, the only way Mead conceives of two adult human beings understanding one another in the context of social interaction is through an act of consciously interpreting the perspective of the other.</p>
<p>This conclusion leads to our second aim. More broadly, the problems we identify in Mead’s work specifically speak towards difficulties underlying most (if not all) theories of intersubjectivity more generally when used as a <italic>foundational</italic> explanation for human understanding and social relations. Such a discussion focusing on the role of conscious, reflective awareness is both pertinent and timely given the increased interest that intersubjectivity has had both in clinical/psychoanalytic contexts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354311409794">Benjamin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959354311409794">Stern, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959354311409794">2004</xref>) and in social/cultural approaches to psychology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354311409794">Coelho &amp; Figueiredo, 2003</xref>). In order to avoid confusion, however, it is necessary to emphasize precisely what we argue here. We are not suggesting that theories of intersubjectivity are inappropriate per se. Rather, following aspects of Mead’s own arguments, as well as the sort of points made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959354311409794">Heidegger (1927/1996)</xref> in Division One of <italic>Being and Time</italic>, we are claiming that theories of intersubjectivity are better applied to secondary or derivative accounts of human understanding and social relations when occurring in the context of the adult human being. More specifically, we argue here that the postulation of intersubjectivity must be restricted to those instances characterized by some sort of breakdown or absence of culturally constituted, taken-for-granted meaning. Thus, since children lack a full understanding of how to seamlessly participate in the wide range of cultural practices that make up our daily lives, it may be perfectly appropriate to discuss intersubjective understanding between a child and a primary caregiver as playing a vital role in the development of the self and psychic reality (as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959354311409794">Stern, 2004</xref>, or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354311409794">Fonagy and Target, 1996</xref> do). Alternatively, conceptualizing the important role that intersubjectivity plays in therapeutic interventions also seems warranted given the fact that clients engaged in therapy presumably possess meanings towards the world that don’t work well for them (i.e., are “broken” in some respect) and must be altered through a creative act of rupture and change in the therapeutic process. Other examples abound and follow below. However, the essential point is that, in general terms, we aim to show that theories of intersubjectivity are inappropriate when applied to our most basic, routine, and everyday social interactions with the world and presuppose a version of the problem of other minds. (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354311409794">Leudar &amp; Costall, 2004</xref>, for a similar argument addressing Chomsky and Grice’s role in influencing psychological theory.) We conclude by arguing that this problem may be solved with an account of “background understanding” as a theory of practical knowledge that serves to unite understanding between people and that functions on a non-conscious level; eliminating the necessity to postulate the presence of subjectivity and intersubjectivity in routine social interactions at all (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959354311409794">Sammut et al., 2010</xref>). We will conclude by suggesting how the emerging theory of interobjectivity contributes to broadening our understanding of such a background understanding and the limits of how intersubjectivity should be applied.</p>

<title>Mead and meaning: Prelude to the act</title>
<p>Across the entirety of his oeuvre, Mead is generally consistent in maintaining that the meaning of an object lies in one’s disposition to act towards that object. It is important to note that he typically refers to this disposition to act towards objects as our attitudes towards objects. So, to present a simplified example, we might find the meaning of a book lying in the disposition we have towards reading it, thus making the meaning of the book “something which one reads.” Also, we could say the same thing for a chair: that is, the meaning of a chair is “something to sit in” simply because people are disposed to use chairs in this way. Alternatively, we could say that our attitude towards the chair is our disposition to sit in that chair. In summary, meaning=attitude=disposition to act.</p>
<p>However, this is only part of the story. Mead also makes a crucial distinction between two different “types” of meaning: non-significant and significant. These two different types of meaning are probably most familiar from his example of the “conversation of gestures” in the dog fight. For the present purposes, two points in this distinction are worth expanding upon. First, in the case of the conversation of “non-significant gestures,” there is a lack of shared meaning between the two participants engaged in the act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354311409794">Blumer, 2004</xref>, p. 22; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354311409794">Cook, 1993</xref>, pp. 81–82; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959354311409794">Mead, 1934</xref>, pp. 69n, 72n, 81; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959354311409794">Miller, 1973</xref>, pp.70–71). In the case of significant symbols, however, both parties in the interaction share (in some sense) the meaning of the gesture (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354311409794">Blumer, 2004</xref>, p. 26; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354311409794">Cook, 1993</xref>, p. 83; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354311409794">Gillespie, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959354311409794">Miller, 1973</xref>, p. 72). Mead associates conscious awareness with these two different types of meaning, respectively. The first type he refers to as the “unconscious or non-significant conversation of gestures” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959354311409794">Mead, 1934</xref>, p. 46). The second type emphasizes the connection between conscious awareness and the use of significant symbols (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354311409794">Mead, 1910</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959354311409794">1922</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959354311409794">1925</xref>). Thus, to summarize our point here, non-significant meaning=nonconscious meaning, whereas significant meaning=conscious awareness of meaning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0959354311409794">1</xref></sup> We will return to the importance of this distinction below in our discussion of the social act.</p>

<title>Mead and non-conscious meaning: The “world that is there”</title>
<p>The world that is there is how Mead conceives of our perception of objects infused with meaning. When Mead speaks of the world that is there, he often does so in reference to science, which he sees as a paradigm for human thought rather than as a special and separate case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959354311409794">Mead, 1936</xref>, p. 75). For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959354311409794">Mead (1925)</xref>, scientific inquiry does not begin by questioning the ontological status of objects in the world as the philosophical tradition does; rather “the natural sciences start pragmatically with a world that is there. …They always have their feet upon the solid ground of unquestioned objects of observation and experiment” (p. 252). For the scientist, as well as for fully enculturated adult humans engaged in typical, day-to-day interactions with the world, the meaning of objects about us is immediately apparent without the need for the intervention of conscious reflection:<disp-quote>
<p>Where no reconstruction of the world is involved in our identification of objects that belong to it and where, therefore, no readjustment of conduct is demanded, such a logic symbolizes what takes place in our direct recognition of objects and our response to them. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959354311409794">Mead, 1917</xref>, p. 213)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, Mead’s position is that “there is no implication of an awareness. All that is implied is that the ongoing activity of the individual form marks its world for the form” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959354311409794">Mead, 1925</xref>, pp. 256–257). This has a profound implication for the way he theorizes meaning. Presaging the latter work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354311409794">Gibson (1979)</xref> on affordances, when Mead speaks of a world that is there, what he is saying is that from the <italic>phenomenological point of view of the actor engaged in a particular practice</italic>, meaning appears directly as a property of an object just as any of its physical properties might. This is precisely what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959354311409794">Mead (1925)</xref> means when he claims that “meanings exist in nature as do the forms of physical objects” (p. 257; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959354311409794">1925</xref>, p. 251;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959354311409794">1926</xref>, p. 75; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959354311409794">1929</xref>). Thus, by emphasizing the actor’s phenomenological experience of a meaningful world, Mead transfers the locus of meaning from the conscious mind of an actor to the objects that each actor perceives and interacts with. He thus provides an account of meaning from the phenomenological point of view of the actor that is not dependent upon the <italic>cogito</italic> (i.e., the presence of conscious awareness) as its necessary precondition.</p>
<p>This conceptualization of the world that is there is Mead’s most sophisticated effort at articulating a theory of non-conscious meaning. At first glance, to suggest that meaning is directly perceived as a property of the object itself might appear contrary to the essence of his arguments against the primacy of the <italic>cogito</italic>, and thus contrary to the centrality he placed on one’s participation in one’s cultural environment. However, it is vital to point out that this position is not at all contrary to a social or cultural conceptualization of meaning if we bear in mind that Mead’s position is phenomenological. Mead is not making a claim about how objects “really are out there in the world.” In light of this, it would be a mistake to see our reading of him as advocating some sort of naïve realist or physicalist position that states that the meaning of objects is somehow inherent in the physical qualities of the object itself irrespective of the presence of human involvement. Quite to the contrary, Mead argues against this position in two ways. First, in his ontogenetic arguments, he clearly maintains that meaning is first and foremost a social product. Thus, he advocates that the meaning of objects is readily apparent to us—as fully enculturated human adults—through our habitualization in the relevant cultural practices that we have engaged in throughout our whole lives, starting with play and games as children. It is a result of being habitualized in our respective cultures that permits us to take for granted the meanings of objects about us. It is because these meanings are taken for granted that conscious awareness is not required. Secondly, Mead’s response to this potential counter argument deals directly with the adult human level of interaction. Building on Martin’s recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354311409794">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959354311409794">2006</xref>), we recognize the importance Mead placed on the role of perspectives in shaping the very nature of the world that is there “relative to the sensitivities and capacities of the individual forms” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959354311409794">Mead, 1925</xref>, p. 257).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0959354311409794">
<title>Perspectives and a meaningful “world that is there”</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959354311409794">Mead (1925)</xref> says that “an environment thus arises for an organism through the selective power of an attention that is determined by its impulses that are seeking expression” (p. 256). In other words,<disp-quote>
<p>there would be a world that would exist for the organism, when the organism marked or plotted or, to use Bergson’s term, canalized its environment in terms of its future conduct. For Bergson, a percept is an object of possible action for an organism, and it is the active relationship of the organism to the distant object that constitutes it an object. (p. 256)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An example clarifies this point. Let’s say it’s time for dinner and someone walks into the dining room and laid out at the dinner table are a number of objects: forks, knives, glasses, plates, and so on. In light of Mead’s theory of perspectives, how is this world that is there meaningful to the individual? Following his argument, the objects in the room make sense in terms of the present purpose the individual is pursuing. So, when the individual enters the room in order to eat dinner, the chair means “somewhere to sit,” the plate means “somewhere to put food,” the fork means “something to eat with,” and so on. Of course, the meaning of these objects has a certain cultural specificity, as some cultures might not see chairs as “somewhere to sit” when it’s time to eat dinner, and so on. However, bracketing the specificity of different cultural meanings, this example illustrates how the world <italic>meaningfully</italic> appears to us at any moment; everything encountered presents itself to the individual in relation to the project of eating dinner.</p>
<p>Equally important to this account of “perspectival realism” (as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354311409794">Martin, 2005</xref>, nicely calls it) is that one does not have to think about the chair in order to sit in it; rather, the chair is immediately and non-consciously meaningful upon the act of perceiving the chair itself. All of the objects in the room appear to us immediately and non-consciously. The world that is there is an “environment of meaning” that is immediately intelligible to the individual without the necessary intervention of conscious awareness. The locus of meaning is thus transferred from the mind of the individual subject to the object itself. It is the projected future action of the actor herself that determines (i.e., non-consciously “selects”) the meaning of the objects about her through previous enculturation in relevant social practices. Owing to this previous enculturation, the actor “knows how” to eat dinner.</p>

<title>The rise of conscious awareness: Accounting for the <italic>cogito</italic> in the disruption of the act</title>
<p>Although Mead thereby refutes the primacy that Descartes accorded the role of conscious awareness in understanding the world, he does not entirely dismiss the importance of reflective thought in human lives. Rather, he argues that the presence of consciousness in day-to-day adult human interactions is a secondary and derivative way of knowing the world. We may identify at least two closely related ways that Mead conceptualizes the causes for this rise of consciousness. First, consciousness arises when we encounter a problem that results in a disturbance in the “taken-for-grantedness” of meaning that characterizes our non-conscious participation in the world that is there:<disp-quote>
<p>Cognition is a process of finding out something that is problematical, not of entering into relation with a world that is there. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959354311409794">Mead, 1925</xref>, p. 255)</p>
<p>I am positing here moments of problematic reflection and moments of unreflective reality. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959354311409794">Mead, 1929</xref>, p. 75; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959354311409794">1917</xref>, p. 223; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959354311409794">1938</xref>, p. 63).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, conscious thought arises—in the context of adult human social interaction—when the meaning once held towards the world that is there becomes disrupted or contested in some way: that is, when we are no longer able to take for granted the meaning of the world. To return to our previous example, if during the course of having dinner a light bulb goes out, consciousness arises in the specific form of an aroused consciousness of the light bulb that the individual did not have before. It is by virtue of the presence of conscious awareness that individuals can manipulate the meanings that objects have in the world and ultimately move from one world that is there to another (e.g., such as by negotiating the meaning of a chair from “something to sit on” to “something to stand on” for the purposes of changing a light bulb). It is in this way that Mead sees the value of consciousness as vital to human evolution and human creativity. In a sense, what thinking and conscious awareness do is divorce the immediacy between the object and the meaning of the object that were formerly unified in our non-problematic, taken-for-grated interactions in the world that is there. Once the individual stands on the chair, the world becomes a different place.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0959354311409794">2</xref></sup> Conscious thought allows us to change the world and make it a different place.</p>

<p>In its most essential form, a social act is any situation where two people are interacting with one another and mutually influencing one another’s behavior. Thus, the social act “may be found in any cooperative process in which each individual <italic>indicates</italic> [emphasis added] by his gesture [that] which belongs to his act [and] what the others have to do” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959354311409794">Mead, 1938</xref>, p. 447). So how does this work? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959354311409794">Mead (1922)</xref> argues that the gesture brings the stimulus-object into the range of reactions of others. The gesture therefore serves two simultaneous functions: (a) to introduce the object of interaction to others (i.e., indicating what the interaction is about) and (b) to indicate the “nature” of this object to both self and others (i.e., indicating the meaning of the object). To illustrate this point with an example, let’s say Dan wants to buy a sandwich. Dan takes a sandwich from a shelf inside a shop and places it on the counter top in front of the shopkeeper. This “putting the sandwich on the counter” is a gesture and the beginning of a social act between two fully enculturated human adults. When Dan places the sandwich on the countertop, he indicates to the shopkeeper that he is initiating an interaction that will involve this sandwich. Also, following Mead’s argument above, when Dan places the sandwich on the countertop, he also needs to “indicate” the meaning of this sandwich to himself in two ways: (a) the meaning of the sandwich as it exists for himself and (b) the meaning of the sandwich as it exists for the shopkeeper. This “double indication of meaning” here is what Mead refers to as significance or as the significant gesture/symbol (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354311409794">Gillespie, 2005</xref>, pp. 32–34).</p>
<p>One can see how there is something special about the significant symbol in Mead’s account of the social act in that it permits meaning to be shared between two people. This has provided a blueprint for defining intersubjectivity. Mead particularly points our attention to the vocal gesture as the paradigm for significant symbols. The reason for this is that when we speak, we hear the same word spoken as the other does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959354311409794">Mead, 1925</xref>, p. 272). Whether the gesture is vocal or otherwise, the essential point of the significant symbol is that it “tends to arouse in the individual who makes it the response or responses which it calls out in the other” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959354311409794">Mead, 1938</xref>, p. 447). Thus, by virtue of the significant symbol, it is possible for Dan to indicate the meaning of the sandwich to himself as it exists both for himself and for the shopkeeper. When Dan does in fact indicate this meaning to himself as it exists for the other, what he is doing is “taking the attitude/perspective of the other” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959354311409794">Mead, 1922</xref>, p. 161).</p>
<p>At this point we would like to pose the following question: what does Mead exactly mean by “indication” or “arousal” when one “takes the attitude/perspective” of the other in the specific context of adult social interaction? To answer this question, let’s return briefly to the distinction mentioned above between non-significant and significant symbols. As noted, significant symbols differ from non-significant symbols in the sense that the meaning of the significant symbol is (in some way) shared by all participants engaged in the social interaction. Moreover, non-significant symbols are considered to be “non-conscious,” whereas significant symbols are characterized by the presence of a “consciousness of meaning” in the minds of the participants involved. Thus, in the case of the adult human social act, the significant symbol “arouses” a <italic>consciousness of the meaning</italic> of the object in one’s mind. In our example, Dan “takes the attitude of the shopkeeper” towards the sandwich when he arouses the meaning of the sandwich in his mind as it exists for the shopkeeper: that is, when Dan becomes <italic>conscious of</italic> the shopkeeper’s attitude towards the sandwich. It is evident that, for Mead, a necessary condition of any adult human social interaction is the presence of a <italic>consciousness of</italic> the meaning of the object as it exists for both self and other. One may find a number of examples throughout Mead’s writings where he supports such a view (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959354311409794">Mead, 1922</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959354311409794">1925</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959354311409794">1926</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959354311409794">1938</xref>). This point is not necessarily a new one, as many of Mead’s commentators have also characterized his position in such a way (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354311409794">Blumer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354311409794">Cook, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354311409794">Martin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959354311409794">Miller, 1973</xref>). However, we note that this characterization of consciousness as a <italic>necessary</italic> condition for any <italic>routine</italic> adult human social interaction is problematic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0959354311409794">
<title>Intersubjectivity and the absurdity of conscious awareness in routine social interaction</title>
<p>What we have here, then, is the basis for an intersubjective account of human social interaction. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959354311409794">Mead (1925)</xref> insists that “if we are to co-operate successfully with others, we must in some manner get their ongoing acts into ourselves to make the common act come off” (p. 263). According to Mead’s account, if Dan is going to cooperate with the shopkeeper in order to buy the sandwich, he must somehow understand the perspective of the shopkeeper and thus the world that is there for the shopkeeper. Dan must take the attitude/perspective of the shopkeeper in order to understand how the shopkeeper is going to act. He does this by consciously indicating or arousing in his own mind what the meaning of the sandwich is for the shopkeeper. To put this another way, “taking the attitude/perspective of the other”—in the adult human context—is the achievement of intersubjective understanding; an act of consciousinterpretation of one’s own perspective as well as the perspective of the other. This is the only way that Mead sees it as possible for two individuals to come together and achieve the common understanding necessary in order to cooperate with one another successfully.</p>
<p>This point leads us to the very heart of the matter. Specifically, if Mead requires that the self “take the attitude/perspective of the other” in order to understand the perspective of the other (i.e., the world that is there for the other), then we are forced to conclude that the perspective of the other is not initially intelligible in the world that is there for the self. If this perspective were immediately intelligible, then there would be no need to postulate the necessity of “attitude/perspective taking” in order to understand this perspective. It necessarily follows from Mead’s theory of perspectives that, from the phenomenological perspective of a person engaged in an act, the meaning of an object derives from one’s future-directed intention to act upon that object. Not only is the meaning of the object different, but the whole world that is there non-consciously presents itself differently for each person. In our example, the meaning of the sandwich is very different for the two people involved in the act. There is a divergence of meaning between Dan and the shopkeeper based upon their two very different dispositions to act towards the sandwich. This is a characteristic problem that intersubjectivity resolves. When an individual relates to another individual and a divergence of meaning exists between the two, a negotiation of accounts is undertaken that enables the two subjects to negotiate an intersubjective meaning that spans their divergent perspectives. Mead requires the presence of consciousness in the social act because, as we saw above, it is consciousness that is responsible for creatively changing the meanings that objects in the world hold for us. In our example, consciousness is required in order for Dan to leave his world that is there and enter into the shopkeeper’s in order for Dan to understand how the object appears meaningful to him.</p>
<p>This point, however, reveals two vital difficulties with Mead’s account specifically and with an account of inter subjectivity as a <italic>primordial</italic> explanation of human understanding and social relationships more broadly. First, if this process of indicating the meaning of an object as it exists both for oneself and for the other is a necessary condition for the social act to be successfully carried out, how is it that we can explain why Dan initiated this social interaction to begin with? In other words, if Dan must consciously indicate to himself that the sandwich means “something to sell” for the shopkeeper, how is it that Dan even knew to begin with that he had to buy the sandwich rather than merely walking out of the shop without paying? Clearly, we must say that Dan already knew what the sandwich meant to the shopkeeper and what the sandwich meant to himself. Therefore, the necessary presence of conscious awareness in the adult human social act leads us to the absurd conclusion that Dan must consciously indicate something to himself that he necessarily must have already known before initiating the social act to begin with.</p>
<p>The second difficulty with such an intersubjective account lies in an incongruence with Mead’s own phenomenological arguments described above. From a first-person and phenomenological point of view, when we examine our experiences of just such a routine act as buying a sandwich, we do not notice ourselves consciously indicating its meaning either to ourselves or to others. As previously argued, consciousness arises when a disruption in the typical meanings we hold towards the world occurs (e.g., if Dan left the store and inadvertently forgot to pay, provoking outrage from the shopkeeper). If one doesn’t encounter a problem or disruption in one’s typical understandings, then there is little reason to think that conscious awareness must be present in routine and habitual social acts.</p>
<p>In light of these two difficulties, we must ask ourselves the following question: namely, what is it specifically about Mead’s theory of intersubjectivity that provokes these two difficulties? We contend that Mead fails to provide an account of how meaning can be shared between adult humans on a non-conscious level that resembles our phenomenological experience of our most routine and everyday social interactions. What Mead’s theory specifically requires—and thus what any theory of intersubjectivity more broadly requires—is an account of practical meaning that captures the way we skillfully know how to interact with others in routine social acts that does not require the presence of conscious awareness in order to “know the mind of the other” and thus the future action of the other. In other words, Mead lacks a basic and primordial account of adult human understanding that does not rely on some form of cognitive “mind reading” (in the form of a conscious interpretation of the perspective of the other) as a necessary condition in order to achieve fulfillment. What we have here, then, is a version of the “problem of other minds” that is not fully resolved. In reference to adult social interaction, “taking the attitude of the other” is Mead’s attempt to solve this “problem of other minds” through the “argument from analogy”: that is, we infer knowledge of others from the knowledge of our own mental states (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959354311409794">Hyslop, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959354311409794">Thornton, 2004</xref>)—a point, incidentally, that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959354311409794">Wittgenstein (1953)</xref> and later <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354311409794">Austin (1979)</xref> have both compellingly tackled. However, in Mead’s case, this is precisely how “taking the attitude/perspective of the other” works. When we “take the attitude/perspective of the other,” what we are doing is consciously recalling the contents of our own mind when we were formerly in the position that the current other finds herself (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354311409794">Mead, 1913</xref>). In doing so, we come to understand the perspective of the other and the world that is there for the other. Such conscious recollection or deliberation is perfectly appropriate in those circumstances where we actually don’t know how to proceed (e.g., the case of children or of novel situations for adults), or in the event of some genuine miscommunication or misunderstanding between two people (e.g., the case of cultural differences). However, the issue we are stressing here is that we—as fully enculturated adult humans—already do know how to get about in the world, and therefore such miscommunication or lack of knowledge does not apply to the majority of our typical, basic, and everyday interactions with others. Thus, it is a mistake to apply this presence of consciousness to those situations where it is not required. Consequently, it is a mistake to require an account of intersubjectivity in order to explain the type of understanding present in routine and highly habitualized social interaction. We contend that an account of interobjective background understandings augments Mead’s theoretical framework specifically and theories of intersubjectivity more broadly.</p>

<title>Interobjectivity: Background understandings as our <italic>knowing how</italic></title>
<p>As argued above, the resolution of divergent meanings through intersubjectivity requires conscious awareness of the rupture followed by negotiation. While this serves to explain certain social interactions, it cannot account for the phenomenological transactions that take place routinely and habitually and that require no such conscious exchange of perspectives. In our example, the sandwich is a <italic>social</italic> object in that it represents more than one meaning: that is, it is something to be both bought and sold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354311409794">Gillespie, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959354311409794">Mead, 1925</xref>, p. 268). Its objectification can be said to be <italic>interobjective</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354311409794">Latour, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959354311409794">Sammut et al., 2010</xref>) in that it spans divergent meanings but is nevertheless objective to the extent that it has a place in a routinely objective exchange that incorporates distinct subjectivities. This divergence in meaning is the very problem that leads to the rise of consciousness in the social act. Thus, the presence of conscious awareness in the social act points towards a lacuna in Mead’s theory of meaning: namely, that he lacks an account of <italic>practical</italic> meaning that immediately and non-problematically spans the distinct subjectivities of each person engaged in the social act. As a result, Mead fails to account for a fundamental aspect of human understanding as a type of <italic>knowing how</italic>.</p>
<p>With specific reference to Mead as one of the paradigmatic accounts of intersubjectivity, we agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354311409794">Martin (2005)</xref> that “it is clear that Mead did not explicitly emphasize the extent to which … our self understanding and our understanding of others, are possible only against a background of traditional assumptions, practices, and prejudices” (p. 247). Martin finds it necessary to introduce Gadamer’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959354311409794">1960/1995</xref>) concept of horizon as a way of grounding all of our understanding of the world in a more fundamental “background of meaning and intelligibility”(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354311409794">Martin, 2005</xref>, p. 244) that he feels Mead lacks. However, in Martin’s account, “understanding” is something to be achieved through “a dyadic process that necessarily involves a critical consideration of one’s own situation and assumptions” (p. 231). Thus, he is concerned with situations where there is “active engagement with the perspectives of others in a manner that encourages a critical re-examination of our own perspectives and attitudes” (p. 246). This derivative type of understanding is what much of Gadamer’s <italic>Truth and Method</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959354311409794">1960/1995</xref>) is primarily concerned with. This is not, however, the sort of conscious, reflective (mis)understanding that concerns us in this paper, as a critical re-examination of perspectives presupposes a situation where our more fundamental understanding of the world has already broken down. Thus, this “understanding of understanding” does not address the present issue.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959354311409794">Heidegger (1927/1996)</xref>, on the other hand, outlines a much more basic way of understanding the world (what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354311409794">Taylor, 1993</xref>, refers to as “pre-understanding”). Heidegger refers to this type of “understanding” as <italic>Auslegung</italic>, or the way in which the world “discloses” or “shows up” for us as immediately and non-consciously meaningful before any sort of active or conscious process of interpretation need take place at all.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0959354311409794">3</xref></sup> This “pre-understanding” serves as the essence of our understanding: the very “background understanding” that permits the world to be meaningful to us in the way that it is. As an example of this type of understanding, we need only return to our previous illustration of Dan’s buying a sandwich. The shop “shows up” for Dan as a place to buy a sandwich, and the sandwich “shows up” for Dan as something to buy. However—and most importantly for our purposes here—the shopkeeper also immediately “shows up” for Dan as the person who will sell him the sandwich. In other words, the future directed intended action of both Dan and the shopkeeper are immediately intelligible to one another given their mutual understanding of the act or practice in its entirety (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959354311409794">Merleau-Ponty, 1964/1973</xref>). Provided that we restrict ourselves to our basic interactions with the world in the adult human context, there is no need to consciously reflect on the meaning of other people around us any more than we have to reflect on the meaning of objects about us. Such meanings are interobjective, spanning the various possible subjective objectifications of the object involved without requiring intersubjective (re) negotiation. The reason for this is that we all <italic>already know how</italic> to get about in the world.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize <italic>knowing how</italic> because this is the essence of our basic and fundamental way of interacting with the world. Here, we follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354311409794">Dreyfus (1991)</xref> in relating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959354311409794">Heidegger’s (1927/1996)</xref> arguments to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354311409794">Dewey’s (1922)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959354311409794">Ryle’s (1949/2000)</xref> distinction between <italic>knowing how</italic> and <italic>knowing that</italic>. In its most basic terms, <italic>knowing that</italic> is a sort of conscious, deliberative type of knowledge, best characterized by the performance of mental acts or by knowing facts (e.g., knowing that triangles have three sides). Conversely, <italic>knowing how</italic> is a sort of practical, skillful knowledge that is not characterized by the presence of conscious awareness. We might think of the example of riding a bike. One does not <italic>know how</italic> to ride a bike by thinking: “In order to move forward, I must pedal. In order to pedal, I must move my legs in such and such a way, … etc.” Now, this may very well be the case for someone just learning how to ride a bike, but recognizing this only reinforces the point that someone who is already skilled at bicycle riding does not have to consciously think about it in order to do it. Rather, one’s understanding of how to ride a bike is present and apparent to us <italic>in its totality as a practice</italic>. This is just the point that Heidegger makes in reference to our background understanding of the world. As cultural beings, we are directly immersed in a world that we implicitly understand. This “primordial understanding is know-how” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354311409794">Dreyfus, 1991</xref>, p. 184) because what it means to be a social or a cultural being is, in large part, to be “at home” in a world in which we are skilled practitioners (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354311409794">Daanen, 2009</xref>). Being at home in the world means <italic>knowing how</italic> to get about in the world with a sense of ease and familiarity: that is, in non-problematic ways. To be a fully enculturated adult human <italic>is</italic> to be a skillful master of the relevant cultural practices that one is “at home” with. This skillful mastery of cultural practices is possible because of this profound understanding and familiarity we have with objectifications that include our perspectives and those of others, and, as such, it enables our <italic>knowing how</italic> to get about in a social world that includes others.</p>
<p>To say that Mead neglects an account of “background understanding” is to say—in large part—that he neglects to consider how, in the course of our day-to-day social interactions, our most basic way of understanding others is internal to the very intelligibility of the practice itself. Furthermore, we contend that any theory of intersubjectivity used more broadly as a fundamental explanation of adult human social interaction falls short in a similar respect. To know how to buy sandwiches means that I know how to deal with the shopkeeper in a way that is immediately and non-problematically obvious to me. Conversely, not knowing how to deal with the shopkeeper in such a way is to say that I really haven’t fully mastered the skill of buying sandwiches: that is, I do not really know how to buy sandwiches because I am not versed in the interobjective representation of buying sandwiches. Thus, because Mead requires the necessary presence of an act of conscious interpretation “to know the mind of the other,” he neglects to fully appreciate that a—if not <italic>the</italic>—fundamental dimension of human knowledge is a type of <italic>knowing how</italic> rather than a <italic>knowing that</italic>. Human understanding is thus a problem that one needs to solve. When I consciously indicate the meaning of the object as it exists for the other (i.e., when I take the attitude of the other), I <italic>know that</italic> the object means “<italic>x</italic>” for the other. By <italic>knowing that</italic> the object means “<italic>x</italic>” for the other, I can then proceed to infer how she will act. However, with the addition of an interobjective “background understanding” <italic>qua</italic> a socially constituted theory of <italic>knowing how</italic>, this presence of consciousness in the social act is no longer necessary.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The purpose of this paper was to highlight Mead’s attempts at addressing the problem of the <italic>cogito</italic> by examining and evaluating his “theory of meaning.” In light of this goal, his account of the “world that is there” was introduced and his theory of perspectives analyzed as his best attempt at dislodging the primacy of the <italic>cogito</italic> by conceptualizing an account of non-conscious meaning. We proceeded to evaluate this attempt in light of Mead’s theory of the social act. However, upon a detailed examination of the social act, we found that a necessary condition for any social act was the presence of conscious awareness. Furthermore, we argued that this presence of consciousness was necessary in order to permit self to take the attitude of the other and thus understand the perspective of the other. We argued that this necessary presence was untenable but could be resolved by an account of interobjective background understandings as a theory of <italic>practical know-how</italic>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is worth considering the place of the common notion of the generalized other that is also present in Mead’s work. Mead speaks of “the attitude of the generalized other” or the “common perspective of the group” quite often in his writings. However, neither the “generalized other” nor the “common perspective of the group” is conceptualized by him as a non-conscious and <italic>practical</italic> account of social meaning. Consequently, the arguments outlined in this paper capture how “other minds” show up as directly meaningful to us as an integral part of the act (or practice) itself and apply equally to the generalized other or the common perspective of the group. In fact, the “generalized other” in Mead is itself equated with the presence of conscious awareness. The attitude of the generalized other is a product of conscious reflection just as the attitude of a specific other is:<disp-quote>
<p>This is just what we imply in “self-consciousness.” We appear as selves in our conduct in so far as we ourselves take the attitude that others take toward us, in these correlative activities. Perhaps as good an illustration of this as can be found is in a “right.” Over against the protection of our lives or property, we assume the attitude of assent of all members in the community. We take the role of what may be called the “generalized other.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959354311409794">Mead, 1925</xref>, p. 268)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For this reason, the perspective of the group or the generalized other equally requires a background of understanding as <italic>explanans</italic>. For Mead, objects in the world are “social objects” to the extent that the self adjusts her own personal inclinations to act towards an object by consciously considering how “one” would act. Yet we have shown that this act is paradoxical in that it would require a degree of awareness or consciousness to discern how the other would act. While this is certainly applicable to certain forms of social interaction that are characterized by intersubjective negotiations, it also fails to account for the everyday forms of interaction that occur routinely and non-consciously. For such everyday social interaction, a background of interobjective meanings that span the diverse meanings of interacting subjects enables different subjectivities to relate meaningfully without the need for a conscious intersubjective negotiation of perspectives. Through interobjectivity, subjects are able to non-consciously adopt the perspective of the other in structuring their routine everyday conduct. The quality of objectivity applies to such interaction in as much as it represents the knowledge of <italic>knowing how</italic> to act in everyday affairs.</p>

<p>In this paper, the terms “consciousness,” “consciousness of,” and “conscious awareness” represent the type of reflexive thought we engage in when deliberating about something. For our purposes here, we oppose these terms with “non-conscious.” The term “non-conscious” is preferred here in order to avoid confusion with the psychoanalytic tradition. The distinction between “consciousness,” on the one hand, and “non-consciousness,” on the other hand, approximates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959354311409794">Ryle’s (1949/2000)</xref> distinction between “knowing that” and “knowing how” or the distinction between “propositional/declarative knowledge” and “practical/procedural knowledge.” For those more familiar with the psychoanalytic tradition, one could see our use of the term approximating the idea of the “pre-conscious.” We would also refer readers to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959354311409794">Shotter’s (1993)</xref> discussion of a third kind of knowledge which he variously refers to as “knowing-from-within,” “knowledge-in-practice,” and “knowledge-held-in-common with others.” Our current and previous use of “knowing how” (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354311409794">Daanen, 2009</xref>), however, is meant to encompass the points Shotter includes in this third form of knowledge.</p>

His PhD research examined how the English-speaking community of Montreal is in the process of renegotiating its identity in order to cope with the sudden rise of Francophone nationalism in Quebec. His future theoretical and empirical interests focus on understanding trauma as a collective phenomenon with particular reference to war veterans. Address: Department of Clinical Psychology, Argosy University Chicago, 225 N. Michigan Ave., Suite 1300, Chicago, IL 60601, USA. Email: <email>pd285@cam.ac.uk</email></p>
<p>Gordon Sammut is Associate Lecturer in Social Psychology at the University of Malta and a doctoral candidate in social psychology at the London School of Economics and Political Science. He is working on developing the concept of the “point of view,” drawing on the works of Asch, in light of the theory of social representations. His main interests include psychosocial models in the social sciences, attitude measurement and public opinion, the epistemology of representations and phenomena, gestalt social psychology, and issues relating to opinion formation and argumentation. Address: Department of Psychology, University of Malta, Msida, MSD2080, Malta. Email: <email>gordon.sammut@um.edu.mt</email></p>
