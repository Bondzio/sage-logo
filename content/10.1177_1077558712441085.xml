<abstract>
<p>Quality of care may be linked to the profitability of admissions in addition to level of reimbursement. Prior policy reforms reduced payments that differentially affected the average profitability of various admission types. The authors estimated a Cox competing risks model, controlling for the simultaneous risk of mortality post discharge, to determine whether the average profitability of hospital service lines to which a patient was admitted was associated with the likelihood of readmission within 30 days. The sample included 12,705,933 Medicare Fee for Service discharges from 2,438 general acute care hospitals during 1997, 2001, and 2005. There was no evidence of an association between changes in average service line profitability and changes in readmission risk, even when controlling for risk of mortality. These findings are reassuring in that the profitability of patients’ admissions did not affect readmission rates, and together with other evidence may suggest that readmissions are not an unambiguous quality indicator for in-hospital care.</p>

<body>
<p>Hospitals have experienced increasing financial pressure over the past 15 years as a result of payment reforms, including the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) and its subsequent refinements (1997-2001), the Medicare Modernization Act (2003), and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010). The Affordable Care Act goes beyond direct payment reductions to include provisions that link payment to quality, such as a new policy to reduce payment for excessive readmissions. The ongoing focus on cost reduction efforts—and the likelihood of further cuts in Medicare payments in the future given the federal budget deficit—underscore the need to understand the extent to which payment reductions affect readmission rates, as reducing payments could potentially cancel out any gains in quality from linking payment to readmission rates directly.</p>
<p>Financial pressure through payment reductions instituted by past reforms, including the BBA of 1997 and its refinements and the MMA of 2003, likely did not affect admissions to hospital service lines uniformly. The BBA and its subsequent refinements decreased the rate of growth in prospective payment system (PPS) payments across all diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), reduced disproportionate share payments, and lowered indirect medical education payments while the MMA of 2003 increased the frequency of market basket updates, issued a 0.4 percentage point penalty for not providing data on 10 quality measures, and equalized payments between rural and urban hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077558712441085">Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712441085">Rivers &amp; Tsai, 2002</xref>). Admissions to certain services, such as cardiovascular medicine, tended to have higher average profit margins for hospitals across the nation than other services such as Psychiatry, before and after the reforms. However, the reductions in payments affected the average profitability of some service lines significantly more than others, which may have created incentives for hospital quality to respond accordingly. This is particularly important because predictions of provider responses to payment cuts depend on an admission’s profitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712441085">Hodgkin &amp; McGuire, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077558712441085">Lindrooth, Bazzoli, &amp; Clement, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077558712441085">Meltzer, Chung, &amp; Basu, 2002</xref>). Emerging evidence suggests that reductions in average service line profitability as a result of such reforms were associated with relative increases in mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712441085">Lindrooth et al., 2012b</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the recent emphasis on readmission rates as a quality measure, including as a metric on which to base payment, we examine how changes in average service line profitability for hospital admissions resulting from prior reforms (the BBA of 1997 and its refinements and the MMA of 2003) differentially affected the likelihood of readmission, while controlling for the simultaneous risk of post discharge mortality, for patients in 1997, 2001, and 2005. We hypothesized that patients admitted to service lines that experienced greater decreases in average profitability would experience higher likelihoods of readmission over time as hospitals attempt to minimize costs to maintain operating margins in these areas, perhaps through reductions in length of stay (LOS) or more constrained nurse staffing.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077558712441085">
<title>New Contribution</title>
<p>This is the first study that evaluates the effect of the average profitability of hospital admissions, which is used in this context as a metric for the impact of payment reductions, on subsequent readmission rates. In addition, this is the first study to control for the competing risk of death post discharge. There is potentially a substantial bias in studies examining readmission rates without adjusting for post discharge mortality because patients who die within 30 days post discharge cannot experience readmission (i.e., hospitals with poor quality and numerous patients who die in this period may have spuriously low readmission rates).</p>
<p>Furthermore, studies of quality of care during this time have largely focused on national trends within a single condition (often, acute myocardial infarction) or across hospitals and have not examined whether reductions in reimbursement have affected patient outcomes differentially based on the profitability of treating different conditions. This is important because changes in quality may vary in relation to underlying service line profitability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1077558712441085">
<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>As payments for services are reduced through policy reforms, providers experience decreased incentives to incur the costs necessary to provide levels of quality above the profit-maximizing level and beyond the minimum level implied by professional standards, regulations, and ethics. This is well-described in economic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712441085">Friedman, Sood, Engstrom, &amp; McKenzie, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712441085">Hodgkin &amp; McGuire, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077558712441085">Meltzer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077558712441085">Newhouse, 1989</xref>) predicting that the provision of quality will be directly correlated with the reimbursement level to the extent that quality is observable by others. If quality is observable, then higher quality drives a favorable reputation and thus a greater likelihood that patients will select a high-quality hospital for treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558712441085">Glazer &amp; McGuire, 2002</xref>). Reductions in payment are predicted to lead to a lower equilibrium level of quality because competing providers are faced with increased financial constraints and retain less resources to invest in improving discretionary quality. Empirical work provides supporting evidence that lower payment rates are associated with lower levels of nurse staffing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712441085">Bazzoli, Lindrooth, Hasnain-Wynia, &amp; Needleman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558712441085">Lindrooth, Bazzoli, Needleman, &amp; Hasnain-Wynia, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077558712441085">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>), reduced performance on process measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712441085">Bazzoli et al., 2007</xref>), and worse outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712441085">Baker, Einstadter, Husak, &amp; Cebul, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712441085">Bueno et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077558712441085">Seshamani, Schwartz, &amp; Volpp, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077558712441085">Seshamani, Zhu, &amp; Volpp, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The above framework, evaluating the direct impact of payment reductions on quality, is applicable when admissions are profitable on average and quality is provided at levels above a minimally acceptable level. When admissions to different service lines have varying profitability, hospitals will have a greater incentive to invest in quality and compete for patients in profitable service lines than in unprofitable service lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712441085">Hodgkin &amp; McGuire, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077558712441085">Meltzer et al., 2002</xref>). This drives the prediction that the equilibrium level of quality provided in a service line is a function of service line profitability.</p>
<p>A reduction in payment will lead to a reduction in expected profitability if the expected costs of care remain constant. The effect of a shock to expected profitability on quality of care depends on the degree to which providers adjust resource use accordingly. An individual hospital may respond to changes in payments by reducing costs, and thus a change in payment may affect but not necessarily determine the change in profitability of an admission. A hospital-level measure of service line profitability would be endogenous because it encompasses a hospital’s reaction to a change in payment and is therefore likely correlated with the error in a hospital-level regression. Therefore, we estimated the effect of changes in expected profitability on quality using the national average of service line profitability, which is unlikely to be correlated with the behavioral response of individual hospitals. It is important to note that we treat reductions in payment as an exogenous shock to average service line profitability, and it is through variation in average service line profitability that payment reductions are predicted to affect quality. We model the effect of average service line profitability directly, but payment changes are the main policy lever through which profitability of Medicare admissions can be affected.</p>
<p>Readmissions entail further complexity because hospitals have historically been reimbursed for the care they provided during readmissions, and there has been no direct financial penalty related to preventable readmissions. In the absence of any direct financial incentive to avoid readmissions, hospitals had an indirect incentive to minimize readmission rates to the extent that readmission rates are viewed as poor quality. This incentive is analogous to the incentive to reduce mortality rates. However, public reporting of readmission rates as a quality indicator has been more controversial than mortality measures because it may be that a nontrivial portion of the variability in readmission rates is out of a hospital’s control. Thus, while we hypothesize that decreases in service line profitability will lead to lower levels of quality reflected in higher readmission rates, whether changes in profitability caused by reductions in Medicare reimbursement were sufficient to explain variation in readmission rates is an empirical question.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>We used the Medicare Provider and Analysis Review File (MEDPAR) Research Identifiable File 100% sample to draw patient data. Each record in the MEDPAR includes codes for up to 6 procedures and 10 diagnoses, demographic information, unique beneficiary numbers linked to death certificates, submitted and allowed charges, admission source, and discharge status. Costs and cost-to-charge ratios (CCRs) came from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS). The American Hospital Association’s (AHA) Annual Survey of Hospitals provided information on other hospital characteristics that we use for sample selection and stratification, including location, ownership, and teaching status. We defined hospitals located within a Metropolitan Statistical Area as urban. We obtained data on general practitioners, defined as office-based practicing physicians, per county from the Area Resource File.</p>
<sec id="section4-1077558712441085">
<title>Study Sample</title>
<p>The study sample included Medicare Fee for Service (FFS) beneficiaries from 66 to 90 years of age admitted to general acute care hospitals eligible for prospective payment during 3 fiscal years: 1997 (October 1, 1996 to September 30, 1997), 2001 (October 1, 2000 to September 30, 2001), and 2005 (October 1, 2004 to September 30, 2005). We limited our initial data to only include hospitals that reported costs and charges in three consecutive years, centering on each of the three study years to ensure stable estimates of cost center–level CCR using hospital cost reports. The initial data comprised 19,613,447 patient admissions from 4,822 unique hospitals within the 50 states and Washington, D.C. that contributed data for all the three study years.</p>
<p>We applied the following exclusions: patients enrolled in Medicare HMO plans (<italic>n</italic> = 1,601,752 admissions and 2 hospitals), patients admitted from long-term care facilities (<italic>n</italic> = 278,678 admissions and 2 hospitals), patients with organ acquisition charges because reimbursements on these services were based on cost (<italic>n</italic> = 2,316 admissions and 0 hospitals), acute myocardial infarction or stroke patients discharged alive in less than 2 days to remove “rule-out myocardial infarction” admissions (<italic>n</italic> = 83,078 admissions and 0 hospitals) as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077558712441085">Volpp et al. (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077558712441085">Volpp, Rosen, Rosenbaum, Romano, Even-Shoshan, Wang, et al. (2007)</xref>, recorded date of death earlier than hospital admission date (<italic>n</italic> = 999 admissions and 0 hospitals), patients with “rare” DRGs occurring less than 500 times across all hospitals in each of the 3 years (<italic>n</italic> = 32,942 admissions and 0 hospitals), service lines with fewer than 50,000 admissions in any study year (<italic>n</italic> = 297,074 admissions and 1 hospital), and discharges to hospice (<italic>n</italic> = 78,772 admissions and 0 hospitals). These exclusion criteria resulted in loss of hospitals if those hospitals were in the sample exclusively because of patients meeting the criterion.</p>
<p>Patients that were transferred between hospitals after the initial admission were assigned to the receiving hospitals, so the records for the initial admissions at index hospitals were excluded to avoid duplication (<italic>n</italic> = 480,622 admissions and 1 hospital). Hospitalizations from the last month of 2005 data, September, were excluded because our time-series data ended with this month, and hence it was not possible to compute the future-looking outcome measures of mortality and readmission within 30 days of discharge (<italic>n</italic> = 435,172 admissions and 0 hospitals). We further excluded hospitals whose 1997 Medicare share of inpatient days were unavailable (<italic>n</italic> = 154,456 admissions and 163 hospitals). Finally, we excluded rural hospitals because small samples in certain service lines and lack of other service lines resulted in unstable estimates (<italic>n</italic> = 3,461,608 admissions and 2,215 hospitals). These exclusions were performed to reduce the likelihood of bias from unobserved patient severity or goals of care (e.g., hospice patients), misrecorded data (e.g., death date earlier than admission date), or to increase homogeneity of the sample (e.g., exclusion or rare DRGs).</p>
<p>Our final sample consisted of 4,387,724 patient admissions from 2,396 hospitals in 1997, 4,376,998 admissions from 2,194 hospitals in 2001, and 3,941,211 admissions from 1,990 hospitals in 2005, for a total of 12,705,933 discharges from 2,438 hospitals. Thus, our sample represents PPS-eligible admissions in major DRGs across almost all urban acute care hospitals in the United States in 1997, 2001, and 2005.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1077558712441085">
<title>Main Outcome Measures</title>
<p>This study models the risk of readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge as the primary outcome, controlling for the competing risk of post discharge mortality.</p>
<p>We defined index admissions as any inpatient hospital admission that was not preceded by a hospital discharge within the prior 30 days. All-cause readmissions were identified as the first hospital admission within 30 days of discharge from an index admission, not including readmissions for rehabilitation, hospice, and aftercare (identified using previously published ICD-9 codes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077558712441085">Press et al., 2011</xref>). Additional readmissions beyond the first readmission within 30 days were not considered; only 2.0% of index admissions were associated with multiple readmissions. Patients that were transferred between hospitals after the initial admission were assigned to the receiving hospitals, since the condition of the patient on discharge and the timing of discharge were more directly attributable to them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1077558712441085">
<title>Risk Adjustment and Hospital Control Measures</title>
<p>We employed a risk-adjustment approach developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712441085">Elixhauser, Steiner, Harris, and Coffey (1998)</xref> and used in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712441085">Rosen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077558712441085">Silber et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077558712441085">Volpp et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077558712441085">Volpp, Rosen, Rosenbaum, Romano, Even-Shoshan, Wang, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077558712441085">Volpp, Rosen, Rosenbaum, Romano, Even-Shoshan, Canamucio, et al., 2007</xref>). This method includes 27 comorbidity indicators (excluding fluid and electrolyte disorders and coagulopathy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558712441085">Glance, Dick, Osler, &amp; Mukamel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077558712441085">Quan et al., 2005</xref>) and has been shown to achieve better discrimination than other approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077558712441085">Southern, Quan, &amp; Ghali, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077558712441085">Stukenborg, Wagner, &amp; Connors, 2001</xref>). Our approach also included controls for the demographic variables age, gender, and race, admission type (emergent vs. urgent vs. other), admission source (clinic vs. emergency room vs. other), year of admission, and indicators for the number of admissions in the prior 180 days. We also adjusted for year interacted with the hospital service line indicator variables. In sensitivity analyses, we included a variable for general practitioner density by county to proxy for access to primary care after discharge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077558712441085">
<title>Service Line Profitability</title>
<p>Service line definitions were based on the Massachusetts Health Data Consortium CMS-DRG Map (v24.0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712441085">Massachusetts Health Data Consortium, 2011</xref>), with minor modifications, grouping patient DRGs into distinct hospital services provided within the same unit across hospitals. We further separated medical from surgical orthopedics and invasive from medical cardiology because both the levels and trends in reimbursement for these service lines were dramatically different and the volume of patients warranted further disaggregation. This approach resulted in 20 hospital service lines, of which 7 were exclusively procedural services, 8 were exclusively nonprocedural, and the remainder a combination of the two.</p>
<p>As our metric for profitability, we calculated average service line markups across the national sample of hospitals over 3 years. To calculate this metric, we first used cost center–specific CCRs from HCRIS to convert submitted patient care charges into costs per revenue center (service line). To improve the stability of estimates by reducing the impact of reporting errors, we used 3-year averages of the CCRs spanning the patient data year (i.e., average cost-to-charge ratio over 1996-1998 for the 1997 patient data, 2000-2002 average for the 2001 data, and 2004-2006 average for the 2005 data). In cases where a revenue center did not have an equivalent cost center or a hospital did not report cost center–specific cost-to-charge, we used hospital-level CCRs. The cost of a hospital stay was computed as the sum of all costs incurred during the stay. We calculated markups for each service line annually by subtracting the cost of stays from the allowed charges and dividing this difference by the cost.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077558712441085">1</xref></sup> Allowed charges included DRG-based reimbursement plus adjustments for disproportionate share, graduate medical education, outlier payments, and other adjustments. Finally, we calculated the national average markup for each service line across all hospitals in the sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1077558712441085">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>We used a research design comparing semiparametric Cox proportional hazards models with and without controlling for the competing risk of post discharge death within 30 days of discharge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077558712441085">Lunn &amp; McNeil, 1995</xref>). Controlling for the simultaneous risk of post discharge mortality enables us to account for variation in readmission rates that is due to 30-day mortality rates. This framework examined whether the average profitability of hospital service lines to which a patient was initially admitted was associated with the likelihood that the patient would be readmitted within 30 days of discharge.</p>
<p>We were interested in the effect of average service line profitability on risk of readmission after being discharged alive, since typically readmission rates are calculated using all patients discharged alive as the denominator. In doing so, we conditioned the competing risk specification on patients who have already survived to discharge. This approach improved the tractability of the model by allowing us to use the <italic>stcox</italic> commands in STATA Version 11 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).</p>
<p>The dependent variable was readmission within 30 days of discharge from an index hospitalization using Cox models adjusting for patient comorbidities, secular trends common to all patients and hospital service lines, service line–specific time trends, national average service line markups, average service line markup interacted with the hospital’s 1997 Medicare share of inpatient days, stratified by hospital service line, computed with and without controlling for the simultaneous risk of death. Service line–specific time trends were included to control for secular, unmeasured trends in treatment patterns that could differentially affect readmission in each service line. We estimated the model using a 70% sample of patients randomized by hospital and service lines because estimates based on the full sample were not computationally feasible due to the size of data set. All standard errors use the Huber–White correction for robust standard errors and are clustered by hospital service line.</p>
<p>Cox models were chosen because of the advantages of semiparametric estimation over defining a functional form as well as the structure of the data consistent with a survival analysis. Cox models enable a competing risks framework, allow for inclusion of fixed effects, and provide unbiased estimates in a nested design as long as clusters do not include very few individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712441085">Allison, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558712441085">Glidden &amp; Vittingho, 2004</xref>). They are commonly used to estimate competing risks models even when the interest is not in the time to an event but instead in controlling for the contemporaneous risk of an alternative event. This model also allows us to control for the fact that our outcome measures are truncated at 30 days.</p>
<p>The use of competing risks to control for the simultaneous risk of death after discharge, rather than assuming that readmission risk and death are unrelated, is an important advantage over standard “single-risk” logistic or Cox models of readmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712441085">Bakoyannis &amp; Touloumi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712441085">Han &amp; Hausman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077558712441085">Lunn &amp; McNeil, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077558712441085">Sueyoshi, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077558712441085">Woolridge, 2002</xref>). Thus, this model allows for the inter-dependence of these two risks and addresses the general concern that higher post discharge mortality rates could bias readmission rates because patients who died can no longer be rehospitalized.</p>
<p>The research design prevents four possible types of bias. First, we allowed the competing risks model to compute a separate baseline hazard function for each service line in every hospital (stratification by the interaction between hospital and service line), akin to a standard hospital service line fixed effect. The effect estimated is the association between changes in service line profitability and changes in likelihood of readmission over the study period within a hospital’s service line. Thus, differences caused by hospital and service line characteristics that are stable over time do not confound the effect of service line profitability on readmission risk, because each hospital’s service line is compared with itself as policy reforms changed the underlying profitability of service lines over the study period. Second, we introduce year indicators and service line–specific time trends in the proportional hazards model to control for secular, unmeasured service line–specific trends in treatment patterns that could differentially affect readmission in each service. Third, the proportional hazards model adjusts for measured risk factors, such as a change in the mix of patients that varies across hospitals. Fourth, the competing risk framework allows us to control for variation in readmission rates that is due to 30-day mortality rates.</p>
<p>The <italic>markup</italic> and <italic>Markup</italic> × <italic>Medicare share</italic> interaction coefficients measure the effect of profitability on 30-day all cause readmission. A <italic>markup</italic> coefficient greater than 1 indicates that an increase in reimbursement led to an increase in 30-day readmissions. The <italic>Markup</italic> × <italic>Medicare share</italic> interaction tests whether there is a dose–response in that the impact is larger in hospitals with a larger share of Medicare patients. This would be the case if a hospital’s response to changes in Medicare reimbursement depended on the importance of Medicare patients within the hospital’s payer mix. Hospitals with high Medicare shares are more likely to change treatment styles in response to a reduction in Medicare reimbursement than hospitals that are less reliant on Medicare patients.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the nonlinearity of Cox models makes interpretation of the <italic>markup</italic> coefficient and <italic>Markup</italic> × <italic>Medicare share</italic> interaction coefficient more complicated than in linear models, and the effect can vary considerably by level of the variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558712441085">Ai &amp; Norton, 2003</xref>). To appropriately characterize this effect, we differentiated the likelihood function by <italic>markup</italic> to compute the total effect for different levels of <italic>markup</italic> and <italic>Medicare share</italic>. Coefficients less than one indicate an association with lower risk of the readmission outcome.</p>
<p>Because the outcome of readmissions also includes a component of post discharge outpatient care, we also computed a model including a control for general practitioner density by county to proxy for access to primary care after discharge. We tested the validity of the proportional hazards assumption in our estimations by plotting the survival functions for readmission and death, stratifying by the risk types, and comparing the Kaplan–Meier observed survival curves to the Cox predicted curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077558712441085">Hess, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077558712441085">Klein &amp; Moeschberger, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077558712441085">Lunn &amp; McNeil, 1995</xref>). We found that the survival functions were parallel and the Kaplan–Meier observed survival curves were virtually identical to the Cox predicted curves implying that the proportional hazards assumption was not violated.</p>

<p>The number of admissions for the 20 service lines ranged from a minimum of 91,268 patients in Psychiatry to a maximum of 2,160,433 patients for Medical Cardiology over the three study years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712441085">Table 1</xref>). The variation in average LOS per service line (3-year average range 4.7 days for Gynecology to 11.0 days for General Surgery) was consistent with reported statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712441085">Nagamine, Jiang, &amp; Merrill, 2006</xref>). LOS declined uniformly across all services with a reduction from a mean of 7.1 to 6.3 days over the period. The largest reduction occurred in Vascular Surgery (LOS 9.7 days in 1997 and 7.9 in 2005) and the smallest reduction was in Cardiovascular Surgery (LOS 11.1 days in 1997 and 10.9 in 2005). Average markups were highest for exclusively procedural service lines early in the study period, with the top 3 service lines being Thoracic Surgery (markup = 38.8%), Cardiovascular Surgery (markup = 36.4%), and General Surgery (markup = 35.2%). However, average profitability of these services dropped dramatically over the 8 years, consistent with policies that targeted reductions in reimbursement for the highest margin services. Surgical Orthopedics, for example, experienced the greatest drop in markup losing 31.0 percentage points from 1997 to 2005 while the average was a 21.8 percentage point reduction across all services during this time period. Half of the service lines became unprofitable in 2005. Notably, Thoracic Surgery (2005 markup = 13.8%) and Invasive Cardiology (2005 markup = 14.6%) were considerably more profitable than other services (2005 average markup = 1.2%) on average. These findings are consistent with a more thorough exposition of trends in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077558712441085">Lindrooth et al. (2012a)</xref>.</p>

<p>Unadjusted readmission rates remained stable throughout the study period for nearly all service lines (overall rate: 16.0% in 1997 and 2005). Oncology demonstrated the highest unadjusted readmission rates (31.7% in 1997, and 34.9% in 2005) as well as the greatest increase 1997 to 2005 (3.2 percentage points). Gynecology experienced the lowest unadjusted readmission rates (7.2% in 1997 and 7.3% in 2005) while Invasive Cardiology showed the greatest reduction of 1.7 percentage points (15.5% in 1997 to 13.8% in 2005). Unadjusted 30-day mortality rates declined for all service lines, with the average decreasing from 2.8% in 1997 to 1.9% in 2005.</p>
<p>Examining hospital characteristics demonstrated that average markup levels and year-to-year changes were similar across different types of hospitals, with teaching hospitals having slightly higher average markups than nonteaching hospitals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077558712441085">Table 2</xref>). Unadjusted readmission rates stayed relatively constant by hospital characteristic over the sample period. Teaching hospitals had higher unadjusted readmission rates than nonteaching as did for-profit and government hospitals relative to not-for-profits. Unadjusted 30-day mortality dropped uniformly across the hospital types.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We find no association between the reduced average profitability of hospital service lines because of payment reform and the likelihood of patient readmission between 1997 and 2005. Adjusting for the risk of mortality post discharge did not meaningfully alter results.</p>
<p>This study is the first to our knowledge that evaluates the effect of payment reforms on readmission rates through changes in average profitability of hospital admissions and that also considers the competing risk of post discharge mortality. Readmission rates have gained considerable attention as a measure of quality of care, particularly as the PPACA will establish reduced payments to hospitals for excess readmissions. Readmissions incur substantial costs to the Medicare program, with one study finding that 19.6% of Medicare hospitalizations result in readmission at a cost of $17.4 billion in 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077558712441085">Jencks, Williams, &amp; Coleman, 2009</xref>), and this has driven great interest in payment reforms that aim to reduce readmission rates.</p>
<p>Work to date has provided equivocal results on the relationship between cost of care and readmissions. Furthermore, there is evidence that readmission rates for heart failure patients have been increasing since the late 1990s, though this trend may have tapered off in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712441085">Bueno et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712441085">Heidenreich, Sahay, Kapoor, Pham, &amp; Massie, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077558712441085">Ross et al., 2010</xref>). These trends could be driven to some extent by declining profitability because of payment reductions, as hospitals attempt to limit in-hospital care by shortening LOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712441085">Bueno et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077558712441085">Chen et al. (2010)</xref> compared pneumonia and heart failure patients in a cross-sectional study using 2006 data and found that low-cost hospitals had similar 30-day readmission rates compared with high-cost hospitals for pneumonia patients and slightly higher 30-day readmission rates for congestive heart failure patients. However, the differential impact of reductions in payment on readmissions across hospital service lines that may have differing levels of profitability had not previously been examined. Policies such as nonpayment for readmissions will likely affect some service lines more than others, such as those with a higher number of readmissions, and this may have differing effects depending on the service line’s underlying average profitability. The lack of an association between greater decreases in profitability and higher likelihoods of risk-adjusted readmissions that we found in this study is reassuring in terms of the implementation of related payment reduction approaches that are embedded in the Affordable Care Act. Had we found effects of changes in average service line profitability on readmission rates, it would have made evaluation of the new readmissions payment policy highly challenging, as effects of reimbursement changes under the Affordable Care Act could effectively offset effects of payment policies directly targeted at reducing avoidable readmissions. Although payment reductions causing changes in average service line profitability might affect quality of care as measured by other types of outcomes, based on our findings we would expect little effect on readmissions rates.</p>
<p>This study cannot establish the reason why readmissions were not affected. One possible explanation is that hospitals effectively cross-subsidize from other payers; however, the lack of an effect at the hospitals with the highest shares of Medicare patients offers some evidence that this factor is unlikely to explain the entire lack of an association. It is also possible that decreases in profitability led to fewer readmissions because the readmissions themselves are less profitable, or the link between quality of care in an index admission and the likelihood of profitability from a subsequent readmission is too uncertain. Most likely, the finding has a multi-factorial explanation, and the role of post discharge care (which was unaffected by inpatient payment reductions during this time period) is likely to be an important one. We do find qualitatively similar results in a sensitivity analysis that controls for general practitioner density per county, though it is likely an incomplete proxy for access to post discharge ambulatory care.</p>
<p>It is important to interpret these results in the context of past findings that greater reductions in average service line profitability were associated with higher 30-day mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712441085">Lindrooth et al., 2012b</xref>). Taken together, these results highlight the complexity in using post discharge 30-day readmission rates as a measure of the quality of care delivered in a hospital. While readmissions soon after hospital discharge may reflect poor quality of inpatient care, they may also reflect the peri- and post discharge quality of care, including transitions to the outpatient setting and follow-up care itself. The quality of care post discharge may be unaffected by the variation in inpatient profitability and may even compensate for worse inpatient care, with a net result of readmission rates that were unaffected. Thus, our finding that variation in profitability does not affect readmissions could be attributed to a variety of factors: (a) the historical absence of direct financial incentives to reduce readmissions may have meant a relative paucity of quality improvement activities that target preventable readmissions; (b) a hospital’s ability to influence care after a patient is discharged was limited; or (c) variation in service line profitability, combined with the indirect reputational effect of reduced readmissions as a signal of poor quality, was not a strong enough incentive to change the processes necessary to reduce readmissions.</p>
<p>Our study has several possible limitations. First, the competing risks Cox proportional hazards model, while allowing for varying forms of baseline hazards for each hospital service line, assumes proportional hazards between the risks of readmission and death. However, we tested this assumption extensively with results suggesting that it was not violated in our estimations. Furthermore, results were qualitatively similar when relaxing this assumption and using a model stratified by outcome. Second, observational studies with administrative data lack detailed clinical information and are subject to unmeasured confounding that could each contribute to the effects observed. However, by computing baseline hazards at the hospital service line level, our approach compares outcomes over time within each hospital service line. This methodology reduces the likelihood of bias as service lines within a particular hospital serve as their own controls. Third, our analysis relies on differential changes in average service line level profitability, and thus our results derive from outcomes that reflect changes in service line–specific treatment. Fourth, our analysis looks at the net effect of changes in revenue minus changes in cost and does not consider inputs separately. Finally, we do not have information on differences in the provision of care within a service line, such as staffing ratios and personnel, which may elucidate the mechanisms behind our findings.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study is the first to explore the impact of payment reductions through changes in average profitability of admissions by service line and the association with readmissions. We found that the likelihood of readmission was unaffected by changes in average service line profitability during a period in which payment reductions were instituted. Moreover, our results on likelihood of readmission are qualitatively similar with and without adjustments for the simultaneous risk of death. This provides some reassurance that payment reductions do not necessarily increase subsequent readmission rates, though the impact of further payment reductions may vary based on the degree to which they affect admission profitability as well as to what extent the hospitals in question are providing quality above the profit-maximizing level.</p>

<p>We have used the term <italic>markup</italic> to denote (Revenue − Cost)/Cost, as per its standard definition, as our metric for profitability. This term is to be differentiated from “margin” or “profit margin.” MedPAC uses the term <italic>margin</italic> for (Payment − Cost)/Payment, which from the hospital’s perspective would be analogous to (Revenue − Cost)/Revenue, and “profit margin” sometimes includes overhead costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077558712441085">Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, 2011</xref>). Since this is different than the standard definition of “markup,” we elected to avoid ambiguity by using “markup” as the term in the article.</p>
