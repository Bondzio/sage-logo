<p>This article describes the development of a bottle-weaning educational flipchart, using recommended health education principles for developing patient education material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839910396364">Denny-Garamendi, Lopez-Rabin, Guendelman, &amp; Schafer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839910396364">Seligman et al., 2007</xref>). The flipchart and related English/Spanish parent brochures can be downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nal.usda​.gov/wicworks/Sharing_Center/gallery/wic_fam4.htm#fa16a1">http://www.nal.usda​.gov/wicworks/Sharing_Center/gallery/wic_fam4.htm#fa16a1</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/wicworks/Sharing​_Center/NY/Flipchart.pdf">http://www.nal.usda.gov/wicworks/Sharing​_Center/NY/Flipchart.pdf</ext-link>). The flipchart, a discussion guide for nutritionists in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program, is intended for use with parents of children 12 months of age drinking two or more bottle-type containers of milk or juice per day.</p>
<sec id="section1-1524839910396364">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Professional guidelines recommend bottle weaning at or around 12 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839910396364">American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839910396364">American Academy of Pediatrics, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839910396364">U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA], 2001</xref>). Continued bottle use is associated with dental caries, particularly in lower socioeconomic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839910396364">DenBesten &amp; Berkowitz, 2003</xref>) and, in association with excess milk intake, is also a risk factor for iron deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839910396364">Bonuck &amp; Kahn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839910396364">Brotanek, Schroer, Valentyn, Tomany-Korman, &amp; Flores, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910396364">Graham, Carlson, Sodergren, Detter, &amp; Labbe, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839910396364">Lampe &amp; Velez, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>More than 25% of U.S. 12-month-olds and 9% of 3-year-olds continue to drink from a bottle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839910396364">Kaste &amp; Gift, 1995</xref>). In the WIC program, 12-month-olds in the Bronx consumed a median of 5.0 (interquartile range = 3-6) milk bottles/day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839910396364">Bonuck, Huang, &amp; Fletcher, 2010</xref>). There is an association between continued bottle use and toddler overweight in both local WIC centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839910396364">Bonuck &amp; Kahn, 2002</xref>) and national survey data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839910396364">Bonuck, Kahn, &amp; Schechter, 2004</xref>), with a national study finding that “taking a bottle to bed” was a major predictor of 3-year-olds being overweight or obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839910396364">Kimbro, Brooks-Gunn, &amp; McLanahan, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The flipchart was designed as the primary intervention for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a bottle-weaning intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839910396364">USDA, 2008</xref>). The premise of the trial is that inappropriate bottle use is a potential but little researched risk factor for early obesity. “Inappropriate bottle use” refers to children older than 12 months of age drinking more than two nonwater, bottle-type beverages per day. Trial began enrollment in October 2008 and ended in April 2010, with a total of 300 families enrolled, and data collection will continue through April 2011. The trial’s primary outcome is reduced bottle use (number of bottles, calories from bottles); the trial’s secondary outcome is reduced weight-for-height <italic>Z</italic> scores.</p>
<p>The choice of flipchart as primary educational material was guided by several factors. First, anecdotal information about bottle weaning collected from WIC nutritionists during the formative stages suggested that parents often had very individual, specific concerns regarding the bottle weaning process that were not most effectively addressed in a group educational session. For example, some mothers worried about milk consumption after weaning, others had questions about weaning if an older child is still on the bottle, and still others needed advice about incorporating weaning into childcare. The flipbook allowed the WIC nutritionist to address concerns on a one-on-one basis, customizing the conversation by including only the flipbook pages that pertained to the mothers’ situations. Second, use of the flipchart was expected to help maintain fidelity to the intervention protocol by ensuring that this customized conversation was built around a book of consistent images, phrases, and advice that was distributed to all nutritionists. Finally, the flipbook was portable and easy to store, both of which are stated preferences of the WIC nutritionists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1524839910396364" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>A review of educational tools on weaning was conducted on WIC Works, the Nutrition Education and Training Materials Database maintained by the Food and Nutrition Service, a federal agency of the USDA that is responsible for administering the WIC Program at the national and regional levels. The search revealed no anticipatory guidance materials or educational programs on timely bottle weaning. Therefore, we employed six steps, described below, to develop the educational flipchart for this intervention. These steps were adapted from previous patient education materials development processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839910396364">Denny-Garamendi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839910396364">Seligman et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and the specific activities described in this article were exempt from written informed consent procedures as they are considered both “preparatory to research” and “for quality improvement activities” as they occurred in the course of routine care, with the assistance of site staff.</p>
<sec id="section3-1524839910396364">
<title>Step 1: Convene a Working Team and Solicit Stakeholder Input</title>
<p>Clinician input ensures accuracy in messages and provides real-world perspective on client education. Participant feedback ensures that messages are clear, relevant, culturally appropriate, and feasible to be acted on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839910396364">Seligman et al., 2007</xref>). Also, administrative input increases the likelihood that materials will be adopted on a system-wide basis.</p>
<p>A “core development team” included (a) the study principal investigator with expertise in maternal–child health interventions; (b) a registered dietitian experienced in WIC, from whom the project germinated; and (c) a health education specialist, the study’s project director. Critical stakeholders included (a) nutrition experts: a family physician specializing in nutrition and a pediatric nutritional epidemiologist, (b) WIC nutritionists from our local sites and the New York State Department of Health, and (c) WIC clients at the study sites.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1524839910396364">
<title>Step 2: Identify Key Concepts to be Communicated and Best Means of Communication</title>
<p>First, the team had to develop key concepts that are “on point” with the program and that motivate the target audience. Second, the team had to craft specific messages that clearly and effectively communicated these concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839910396364">Roper, 1993</xref>). Health behavior research suggests that “gain-framed” messages—those emphasizing the benefits associated with adopting recommended behaviors—are effective in promoting prevention behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839910396364">Fox, Hanson, &amp; Briefel, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Messages were tested in four focus groups with caregivers of WIC toddlers aged 7 to 36 months at the study sites. The team selected three gain-framed concepts related to timely bottle weaning to highlight: (a) decreased risk of dental caries (i.e., “baby bottle tooth decay), (b) decreased risk of iron deficiency anemia, and (c) increased likelihood of a healthier weight trajectory as a result of limiting milk and juice intake. The flipchart summarizes these as “Healthy Teeth, Healthy Blood, and Healthy Weight.” Most participants knew someone with dental caries and that it was related to excess milk or juice bottles. However, associated risks of iron deficiency anemia and weight gain were not well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839910396364">Brotanek et al., 2009</xref>). On hearing about anemia, one mother said, “So even if they have a low blood count, if you give them more milk it can go lower? They didn’t tell me that.” Consequently, we reframed our “Healthy Blood” and “Healthy Weight” messages to assume no baseline knowledge of the link with bottles among participants.</p>
<p>The groups were also confused about the key message of limiting milk. One participant exclaimed, “I don’t understand . . . I thought you were supposed to drink milk because it makes your body strong!” Another asked, “But milk is supposed to be healthy, with protein and stuff . . .” Participants found it difficult to reconcile their perception of milk as a healthy drink with advice to limit milk intake. One WIC nutritionist noted that her advice to parents is “Milk and juice are okay, in the right amount and in the right way.” This concept—of moderate consumption and from cups versus bottles—was added as a second recurring message in the materials to clarify this confusion, and a page on calcium was added to reinforce the recommendation that children aged 1 to 3 years old should have up to 16 ounces of milk per day from cups. In that discussion, parents were also informed that dairy foods such as cheese and yogurt were acceptable alternative sources of calcium if they had concerns about decreased milk consumption while switching from bottles to cups.</p>
<p>The flipchart’s most provocative visual depicts 1 bottle of milk as the caloric equivalent of 2 fried eggs, such that drinking 5 bottles of milk is the equivalent of eating 10 fried eggs. This page was developed in response to feedback from WIC nutritionists, who reported that mothers often discounted milk’s effects on their child’s appetites because milk is a beverage, not a food. For example, when discussing “picky eating,” more than one nutritionist reported that they found it useful to ask parents how hungry they would feel if they drank a quart of milk per day, and as a result, the parents would often comment that they had never thought about their child feeling full from milk. There was agreement among nutritionists that parents would benefit from an easy way to understand that milk has calories and can be filling, perhaps by comparing a bottle of milk with its caloric equivalent.</p>
<p>The development team evaluated a variety of food equivalents in an effort to find a food that could be clearly and easily understood without explanation in a multicultural setting. Foods considered and rejected included pizza (too much variety between servings), hot dogs (choking hazard), Oreo cookies (concerns regarding equating milk with junk food), and a cumulative meal approach in which each additional bottle represented a new food added to the plate (too confusing). Ultimately eggs were agreed on as a visually compelling yet easily understood food unit to represent the number of calories in each 8-ounce bottle of whole milk, and the finalized visual, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1524839910396364">Figure 1</xref>, delivers a powerful message.</p>

<sec id="section5-1524839910396364">
<title>Step 3: Link Concepts to a Behavioral Theory</title>
<p>Behavioral theory helps practitioners develop effective programs by identifying program objectives that are related to one another and to the health behaviors of interest. Interventions rooted in behavioral theory increase the likelihood of behavior change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839910396364">Jackson, 1997</xref>). Effective programs identify the most appropriate theory and practice approach for the population, setting, and target behavior.</p>
<p>Early drafts incorporated the transtheoretical model (TM), which complemented a modified motivational interviewing format being phased in at the time (2007-2008) as WIC’s main dietary assessment technique. Although our intervention and the TM assume behavior change is an ongoing process, incongruence arose based on the TM’s characterization of “pre-contemplators” as resistant or unmotivated and “contemplators” as ambivalent to change or procrastinators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839910396364">Rollnick &amp; Miller, 1995</xref>). In contrast, WIC nutritionists told us that parents of inappropriate bottle user were not, for the most part, either “unmotivated” or “resistant to change.” More typically, they were unaware of the strong link between the three gain-framed concepts—tooth decay, iron deficiency, and overweight—and inappropriate bottle use.</p>
<p>Based on this feedback, the team adopted the precaution adoption process model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839910396364">National Cancer Institute, 2005</xref>). This approach assumes that WIC clients may not appreciate the <italic>full</italic> gamut of the potential risks (dental caries, iron deficiency anemia, overweight) of bottle use past 12 months of age or the potential benefits (improved speech and swallowing skills, in addition to healthy teeth, blood, and weight) of timely weaning. The precaution adoption process model thus outlines a pathway from being unaware of the consequences of extended bottle use, to reducing bottle use, and, finally, to adopting and maintaining the healthy behavior (i.e., eliminating bottles).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1524839910396364">
<title>Step 4: Design Materials That Emphasize Key Concepts Chosen for Communication</title>
<p>Recent reviews suggest that simple pictures without distracting, irrelevant details and with easy to read captions heighten comprehension, especially for people with low reading skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839910396364">Carney &amp; Levin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839910396364">Filippatou &amp; Pumfrey, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910396364">Houts, Doak, Doak, &amp; Loscalzo, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, cultural relevance of the pictures affects comprehension; pictures of people who are similar to the viewer have a greater effect on behavior than pictures of unfamiliar, different people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839910396364">Dowse &amp; Ehlers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839910396364">Roter, Rudd, Keogh, &amp; Robinson, 2006</xref>). WIC nutritionists affirmed that visuals must feature racially diverse 1- to 2-year-olds and their families. Stakeholders also felt strongly that visuals should model appropriate feeding behaviors—for example, self-feeding versus being fed by a caregiver, and family meals.</p>
<p>The printed flipchart is bound within an easel style binder meant to be propped on a table or desk, between the WIC nutritionist and the client. The nutritionist-facing side features a topic headline (e.g., “Healthy Teeth”) followed by open-ended questions and conversation openers. The client-facing side facing features the same topic headline and a relevant image—for example, the “Healthy Teeth” page has a close-up of a smiling child. Initial drafts used clipart style artwork, but input from the state WIC program, reflecting feedback they had obtained from WIC clients, indicated a preference for cleaner “magazine-style” photographs. All illustrations were subsequently replaced with stock photography.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1524839910396364">
<title>Step 5: Refine Materials Using Input From the Target Population</title>
<p>The core development team then pilot tested the flipchart, as noted earlier, in four focus groups. The groups, which were formed in 2008, included 26 caregivers of 7- to 36-month-old children at the two Bronx, New York, WIC study sites. Overall feedback was positive: Parents asked how much milk children of that age need and discussed the relationship between milk, feelings of hunger and fullness, and weight gain. The groups identified three key areas for revision: excessive length, preference for more direct language, and incorporation of the role of relatives or other caregivers.</p>
<sec id="section8-1524839910396364">
<title>Excessive length</title>
<p>Initially, the flipchart took 30 to 45 minutes to deliver, much longer than the typical 10- to 15-minute WIC nutritional counseling sessions. For clients, this proved to be too long a time to discuss bottle weaning, particularly in light of the fact that caregivers attending a recertification appointment would have their 12-month-old child with them. The flipchart was streamlined: first, by removing certain topics from the standard conversation, to be addressed on an as-needed basis (e.g., “Choosing a Cup”). Next, the flipchart was bifurcated into (a) eight topic pages to be used in all intervention contacts and (b) six “Educational Supplement” reference pages for nutritionist to use based on client need.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1524839910396364">
<title>More direct language</title>
<p>New York State WIC staff suggested that we use the open-ended “emotion-based”-question style of “Touching Hearts, Touching Minds” materials developed by another WIC program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.touchingheartstouchingminds.com/">http://www.touchingheartstouchingminds.com/</ext-link>). This approach stimulates dialogue by presenting health information gradually rather than in a didactic manner. However, this approach was not well received by the groups. Rather than facilitating conversation, participants viewed the open-ended questions as rhetorical (and thus did not answer them) or as unnecessarily tantalizing—resulting in parents asking the group leader to “just tell me what I need to do.”</p>
<p>Pages that were not well received or that did not move the conversation forward were removed. Pages that clearly stated the amount of calories in milk and juice were moved from the “Educational Supplement” section containing optional topics to the main content area. Open-ended questions were eliminated or replaced with more concrete questions about the parents’ experiences and concerns regarding bottle weaning. These revisions promoted a more to the point conversation that required approximately 10 minutes. Examples of the initial and revised wording are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839910396364">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Incorporating relatives</title>
<p>A recurrent theme was that given caregivers’ (particularly grandmothers) strong role in child feeding, parental attempts at bottle weaning would be met with skepticism or even undermined. About grandparents, participants stated that “they always think more is better, they’re always wanting to feed the baby,” that “my mother-in-law would definitely have a hard time,” and that grandmothers say, “she’s too little for a cup.” Parents felt competent deflecting the grandparents’ ministrations, yet they requested a brochure outlining key intervention points to share with other caregivers to “validate” the weaning purpose and process and a website they could visit for more intervention. In response, both were developed, with the brochure reiterating the “Healthy Teeth, Healthy Blood, Healthy Weight” messages and listing the website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ProudToBeBottleFree.org">ProudToBeBottleFree.org</ext-link> as a resource for further information.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1524839910396364">
<title>Step 6: Assess Use of Materials in the Target Audience</title>
<p>Final material testing was conducted with 10 families at the WIC sites who met the study’s eligibility criteria: child 11.5 to 12.5 months of age drinking more than 16 ounces of milk or sweetened beverages from a bottle per day. The intervention was delivered on an individual basis during regular WIC nutritional counseling, with some sessions observed by a member of the study team and feedback provided by the WIC nutritionist. Final minor adjustments were made to the wording, organization, and formatting, resulting in the final draft used in the trial.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This article describes the development of an educational flipchart for a USDA-funded trial to promote timely bottle weaning among WIC clients. The content, theoretical orientation and format of the materials was influenced at every turn by the input of frontline WIC nutritionists, WIC policy staff at the state level, and WIC clients.</p>
<p>Delivery of the intervention has been completed, and both WIC nutritionists and clients have found the materials easy to work with. Anecdotal data suggest that the WIC nutritionists relied less on the flipchart as they became familiar with it and internalized its messages. The striking visuals resonate with parents, and they report readily sharing the accompanying brochure with other caregivers involved in feeding the index child. Preliminary data suggest that this flipchart intervention, employed by WIC nutritionists as part of routine practice, may be effective at helping toddlers wean from the bottle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839910396364">Hyden et al., 2009</xref>).

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This article presents the background to the most detailed, specific, bottle-weaning promotion materials published to date. Development was an iterative process, occurring over a period of 6 months and involving a range of stakeholders. Several revisions were necessary before an instrument was developed that addressed the educational goals of the intervention, the communication preferences of the priority population, and the logistical challenges of the brief WIC counseling sessions. Practitioners should consider use of a systematic process guided by the six steps outlined above to produce and revise health education materials in collaboration with community members, experts, and stakeholders.</p>
