<abstract>
<p>The previous special issue featured articles on the theme of presenting the latest advances in cognitive readiness research in terms of both theory development and practical applications across domains. For researchers, this translates into addressing important research gaps and identifying areas warranting further investigation. For practitioners, this translates into useful and practical recommendations and lessons learned for promoting cognitive readiness in complex domains. The editors continue this theme in this special issue with two more articles that address this important topic. It is their hope that the findings and lessons learned presented in this three-part special issue will provide a basis for future research aimed at creating more cognitively ready individuals and teams.</p>

<p>C<sc>ognitive readiness can be described as the state of possessing the psychological (mental)</sc> and sociological (social) knowledge, skills and abilities, and attitudes needed to sustain consistent, competent professional performance and mental well-being in dynamic, complex, and unpredictable environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1555343412455645">Bolstad, Cuevas, Babbitt, Semple, &amp; Vestewig, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1555343412455645">Morrison &amp; Fletcher, 2002</xref>). The previous special issue of this volume featured the latest advances in cognitive readiness research in terms of both theory development and practical applications across domains. For researchers, this translates into addressing important research gaps and identifying areas warranting further investigation. For practitioners, this translates into useful and practical recommendations and lessons learned for promoting cognitive readiness in complex domains.</p>
<p>Part 1 of the special issue began with an introduction by the editors, followed by three articles that examined a variety of topics, including identifying the general challenges associated with the institutionalization of cognitive readiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1555343412455645">Fautua &amp; Schatz, 2012</xref>); designing decision support systems with consideration for three factors that influence cognitive readiness, namely, adaptability, flexibility, and acceptability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555343412455645">Cegarra &amp; van Wezel, 2012</xref>); and presenting a theoretical framework to guide the development of training for team cognitive readiness in small units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1555343412455645">Fiore, Ross, &amp; Jentsch, 2012</xref>). We continue this theme in Part 2 of the special issue with two more articles exploring cognitive readiness: a theoretical model for measuring military cognitive readiness at the operational and strategic levels (Grier, 2012) and an empirical evaluation of two decision support tools, focused on three components of individual cognitive readiness in complex operations, namely, situation awareness, problem solving, and decision making (Lafond, DuCharme, Gagnon, &amp; Tremblay, 2012).</p>
<p>A forthcoming issue will present Part 3 of the special issue. This will begin with a preface by Patrick Mason, Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, which discusses the importance of cognitive readiness for human performance and operational effectiveness and identifies several challenges that must be addressed in future research (Mason &amp; McQuade). The specific issues that will be addressed by the three articles in Part 3 include evaluating a team psychophysiological approach to measuring cognitive readiness during a complex and dynamic task (Walker, Muth, Switzer, &amp; Rosopa), using eye-based psychophysiological cues to enhance screener vigilance (Langhals, Burgoon, &amp; Nunamaker), and guidelines on how to conduct training of cognitive readiness research emphasizing transfer of cognitive readiness components to dynamic, stressful unpredictable environments (Kluge &amp; Burkolter). As in Part 1, the articles selected for Parts 2 and 3 cover a diverse range of issues and approaches from researchers in academia, industry, and government organizations, including both national and international representation.</p>
<p>From a theoretical perspective, collectively, the research findings reported in this three-part special issue significantly contribute to our understanding of the broad range of cognitive, behavioral, and attitudinal factors that influence cognitive readiness in complex operational environments. From a practical perspective, each article concludes with useful recommendations and/or implications for theory or practice. It is our hope that the findings and lessons learned presented in this three-part special issue will provide a basis for future research aimed at creating more cognitively ready individuals and teams.</p>
