<p>Mandatory detention of asylum seekers arriving by boat in Australia continues to provoke debate and concern. This is despite the right to seek asylum being enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This paper reviews the mental health implications of current Australian national policy. It posits the evolution of mental distress and despair as a clinical correlate to national policy, and how a series of high-profile cases prompted reform in this area. The paper also raises key issues pertaining to the intersection between human rights, mental health and the ethics of clinical care in the detention environment. Given the overwhelming confirmation of a system that is harmful to both detainees and employees, closer scrutiny of clinical practice within the detention setting and an overall re-thinking of current policy is essential.</p>
<sec id="section3-1039856213491991">
<title>Policy, political and legislative context: an overview</title>
<p>The United Nations (UN) estimates that 43.7 million people are now displaced worldwide, of whom 15.4 million are refugees and 837,500 are asylum seekers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213491991">1</xref></sup> Australia currently accepts around 13,000 refugees per annum, under the Refugee Humanitarian Program. Australia processes only 2.2% of the asylum claims made to 44 industrialised countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213491991">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Australia, as a signatory to the Refugee Convention (1951), has the obligation to assess refugee claims; however, for over a decade public and political controversy has surrounded the management of the asylum-seekers arriving by boat. The current national policy is to automatically detain asylum seekers who arrive by boat. Applying to all the so-called unauthorised boat arrivals since its introduction in 1992, the mandatory detention policy has impacted more than 20,000 adults and children. Under current immigration law, Australia detains all asylum seekers (child and adult) arriving without documentation in designated facilities, including offshore centres on Nauru and Manus islands. Both major political parties have upheld this policy, asserting it has significant deterrent value by communicating to unauthorised arrivals that seeking asylum by boat does not automatically result in freedom nor entry to Australia.</p>
<p>In conjunction with mandatory detention, the government initiated remote and/or offshore reception and processing of asylum-seekers, excised offshore islands from the migration zone and intercepted boats. Like mandatory detention, remote and offshore processing aims at deterrence; however, processing in these locations makes effective health and mental health service provision difficult and reduces visiting, public scrutiny and external review.</p>
<p>What is clear is that the impact of mandatory detention on vulnerable populations is central to current debates and raises key issues concerning human rights and professional ethics. The importance of documenting policy-related harms again assumes high priority. Professional bodies and clinicians face complex ethical dilemmas while attempting to advise the government of the risks of maintaining the policy and its long-term health consequences for those whom are eventually released.</p>
<p>The context and setting of immigration detention is not a therapeutic environment. Professional integrity of clinical practice and policy advice in this context and the challenge of maintaining a values-driven approach to research and publication are critical.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1039856213491991">
<title>Overview of immigration detention, mental health and clinician involvement</title>
<p>Mental health professionals have played a major part in raising clinical and ethical concerns regarding the impact of mandatory detention, including for children. Asylum-seekers have often made a fraught decision to leave home, culture and family. For unaccompanied minors, there is the burden of sustaining their culture and future alone. Disappointment about slow processing times and release aggravates their feelings of powerlessness and abandonment. For survivors of torture and trauma, the un-empathic and intrusive responses of an inflexible regime can revive traumatic memories, triggering distress, anxiety and anger; which may be expressed as interpersonal conflict with the staff in the detention areas.</p>
<p>Researchers and clinicians became increasingly involved in clinical practice and policy advocacy during the operation of remote facilities in Woomera and Baxter, in South Australia, in the early 2000s. Behavioural disturbances, riots, self-harm and suicidal behaviour became endemic, reflecting detainee distress, frustration and despair at their powerlessness and the prevailing culture of disbelief, blame and punishment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213491991">2</xref></sup> The psychological impact on children, 3000 of whom were detained during this period, prompted community concern and protest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213491991">3</xref></sup> Various official inquiries and publicised cases of children with severe psychiatric disturbance and developmental problems heightened concern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213491991">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213491991">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>For many clinicians, the need to intervene and advocate on behalf of detainees raised questions about the boundaries of professional responsibility and the moral duty to oppose damaging Australian Government policy, despite personal and professional risk. Gathering evidence about the mental health impact of detention became strategically important. Several independent studies find that mandatory detention is associated with psychological harm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213491991">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213491991"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213491991">8</xref></sup> Researchers and clinicians alike found themselves in a highly politicised environment. This raised issues of the ethics of researching detained populations and the need to advocate for systems reform, on the basis of findings.</p>
<p>Research on detained populations is necessarily complex, involving consideration of the appropriateness of detention and the political system within which detention occurs. As a clinician and researcher, there is a moral imperative to expose human rights violations and abuses of vulnerable individuals and groups. Thus, research in this context cannot be value-free: a strong argument supports making explicit the values that underlie and influence the research agenda. Researchers may strategically highlight the predicament of detained asylum seekers by documenting mental health impacts of detention, while simultaneously critiquing detention policy and practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213491991">9</xref></sup> The ideal, therefore, is that such research be conducted independently of the Australian Government, with appropriate independent ethics committee scrutiny and approval.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213491991">10</xref></sup> Findings must be published after peer review is complete. While conducting research in the face of resistance and sometimes more blatant attempts at censorship remains difficult,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213491991">11</xref></sup> the integrity of this audit trail is vital for democratic and free debate about policy reform and better practice.</p>
<p>Prolonged detention, non-resolution of refugee status and uncertainty about the future emerge as major contributing factors for persistent anxiety, depression, increasing hopelessness and mental deterioration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213491991">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213491991">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several reports noted high rates of self-harm amongst detainees and forms of symbolic protest, such as mouth-sewing. Self-harm may represent protest, frustration and suicidal ideation, while suicidal intent is often difficult to assess. The government and the detention system have tended to label all such behaviour as ‘attention-seeking and manipulative’, lacking in serious intent, and denoting poor or ‘bad’ character.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213491991">14</xref></sup> Several reports note the damaging impact on children of witnessing such behaviours and the mental deterioration of family members. All such studies underscored the relationship between the meaningless nature of prolonged detention, human rights and mental health. Given that mandatory detention remains a key component of the Migration Act, community detention for groups such as children and unaccompanied minors has been a recommendation of health and mental health groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1039856213491991">
<title>The case of SB</title>
<p>The plight of detained children had often been extreme. The case of SB, an Iranian child in detention with his family, received considerable public attention and raised community awareness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213491991">15</xref></sup> Details of this case are noted in the 2004 Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission (HREOC) inquiry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213491991">3</xref></sup> SB, aged 5 years, was held in Woomera for 11 months and was exposed to riots, self-harming behaviours and suicide attempts. He became withdrawn, anxious and had nightmares. The family was transferred to the Villawood centre in New South Wales (NSW), where he witnessed a significant suicide attempt and became withdrawn, mute and refused all oral intake. SB required several admissions for rehydration and every time after returning to detention, his condition deteriorated. Several child psychiatrists who assessed him concluded that returning SB to such a traumatic environment would cause relapse and they advised community release with his mother. Citing concerns about setting a precedent, the then Minister for Immigration declined. Predictably, SB’s condition deteriorated, so he was placed in community foster care separated from his mother. As he continued to deteriorate, his mother was released from immigration detention 4 months after separation and his father, 8 months later. SB was found to be a genuine Convention refugee. He remains distressed, with features of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and adjustment difficulties and he receives on-going treatment to this day. SB’s case exemplifies the harms to children resulting from an inflexible and rigid adherence to Australian Government policy. Clinicians involved in the case of SB did not distinguish public advocacy from their other clinician roles; however, the then Immigration Minister queried whether psychiatrists could advocate for children’s rights and implied a conflict inherent in arguing for a detained child’s release on medical grounds. The validity of medical and psychiatric recommendations about treatment and placement of detainees was contested. Clinicians sometimes argue that the environmental contribution to disorder was so great, that release and community placement provided the only possibility of ‘recovery’; while Government sometimes accused the detainees of simulating psychiatric conditions, to gain release.</p>
<p>The 2004 HREOC Report on children in detention, ‘A Last Resort?’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213491991">3</xref></sup> notes the negative developmental effects of detention on children and the failure of Australia to respect its signatory obligations under international human rights treaties. Informed by clinicians and child workers, it notes the potential long-term effects of traumatic exposure, the risk of on-going mental disorder, the difficulties that detained parents face, and the way in which parental depression and despair affects children. Children were also exposed to behavioural disturbance, violence and self-harm. Older children and adolescents were involved in protest behaviour, and younger children were inadequately protected witnesses. Several clinical reports describe children with attachment disorders, socially indiscriminate behaviour and developmental delay. The lack of care, protection and appropriate activities for play and education are criticised. The detention of children is unacceptable under several international conventions and child protection frameworks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1039856213491991">
<title>The case of CR</title>
<p>The case of CR, an Australian permanent resident who was found to have been held unlawfully in detention for a period of 10 months, proved the predisposition of the immigration detention system to mislabel psychiatric disturbance as ‘misbehaviour’ or ‘simulation’. The case was the subject of a Commonwealth Inquiry and all details are on the public record. CR suffered from a severe, chronic psychotic disorder and was acutely unwell and speaking her native language (German) when she was detained, initially placed in prison and then in immigration detention, as it was assumed that she was an ‘illegal’ person. As her condition deteriorated, she was largely isolated in a behavioural management unit for up to 21 hours a day. She became incoherent, smeared faeces on the wall and removed her clothes, yet the system did not recognise this as possible mental illness and she did not receive adequate psychiatric assessment nor any treatment. CR was in need of an urgent psychiatric treatment, yet was treated as ‘badly behaved’ and disruptive. She was only released from detention into the public sector mental health care when she was recognised by family members in a media article. Ironically, fellow detainees recognised that CR was mentally unwell, and had asked that she be assessed and cared for in a psychiatric facility. This case raised serious issues about a detention culture which focuses on behavioural control and assumes detainees are manipulative and deceitful. The ensuing Palmer report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213491991">16</xref></sup> addresses the provision of mental health services and support in detention, and recommends on-going independent monitoring of service standards and provision of appropriate levels of care. This report prompted the establishment of an independent advisory body, comprising representatives of medical and health professional bodies (Detention Expert Health Advisory Group, 2005), which continues to advise the Department of Immigration and Citizenship regarding the health and mental health needs of asylum-seekers and detainees’ suicidal ideation.</p>
<p>Consequently, a Detention Health Framework was developed and the provision of psychological support and mental health services instituted. The negative impact of detention itself on mental and physical health has been acknowledged. The value of designating detainees as ‘clients’, appointing case managers and describing the ‘journey’ of detainees cannot obscure their involuntary status and the significant risk of mental deterioration. Increasing the length of time in detention, slowing of the processing of asylum claims and detaining of those with histories of torture and trauma has again produced a high-risk and volatile situation, with increasing rates of self-harm and clusters of suicidal behaviour and completed suicides. Earlier research noting the clear relationship between detention and mental disorder has re-surfaced in political discussion.</p>

<sec id="section7-1039856213491991">
<title>Clinical research</title>
<p>Many studies have examined the mental health of refugees and asylum seekers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213491991">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213491991"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213491991"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213491991"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213491991"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213491991"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213491991"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213491991"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213491991">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856213491991">17</xref></sup> A recent systematic review of the studies investigating the impact of immigration detention on the mental health of children, adolescents and adults identifies high levels of mental health problems in detainees.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213491991">18</xref></sup> This review reflects a considerable body of scientific research that has consistently demonstrated high rates of mental disorder in detained asylum seekers. In their study exploring the health of those in Australian detention centres, Green and Eagar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856213491991">19</xref></sup> find that those detained for unauthorised boat arrival or unauthorised air arrival have the highest rates of self-harm (17.7% and 14.4%, respectively), rates that were well above that of the illegal foreign fishers (2.1%), those who overstayed their visas (3.6%) and the average of all the groups in detention (6.2%).</p>
<p>Research has focussed on the impact of experiences in detention on vulnerable groups of asylum seekers, and also on modelling the factors contributing to better or worse outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856213491991">20</xref></sup> Factors such as length of time in detention, negative experiences and traumatic exposure, inability to communicate freely in a language most familiar to the detainee and the process of establishing refugee claims, all compound the asylum-seeking experience. Time in detention correlated with severity of distress. The conditions of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms, self-harm and suicidal ideation were commonly reported. Mental health may initially improve shortly after release, although the mental health effects post-release may also be prolonged. The role of pre-existing trauma and the impact of persecution, displacement and loss also contribute to the overall mental health risk and mediate outcome. The specific needs of children, and their vulnerability in the face of trauma and detention, were also examined. The overall results point to high levels of psychiatric morbidity, particularly of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), arising from the detention experiences, and these have been used to counter the prevailing systemic tendency to deny or minimise the negative impact of detention.</p>
<p>Initial descriptive studies found high rates of depression, PTSD and suicidal ideation. A study of Cambodian detainees, held for a period of 32–55 months, notes strong feelings of anger and frustration, a sense of loss of control over their lives and a sense of profound boredom. The situation of detention and prolonged uncertainty contributed to mental distress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1039856213491991">21</xref></sup> A study of East Timorese asylum-seekers reports that 45% had suicidal ideation. Other reports note that relative to those in the community, detained asylum-seekers experience higher levels of depression, PTSD and physical symptoms, despite both groups having experienced similar rates of persecution and trauma in their country of origin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856213491991">22</xref></sup> These findings point to the negative impact of detention and its direct contribution to the development of mental disorder.</p>
<p>Steel and colleagues studied 10 of 11 families in a remote centre, using standardized instruments for diagnostic assessment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213491991">13</xref></sup>. Every adult was found to have major depression and most reported suicidal ideation. All children were diagnosed with at least one psychiatric disorder and most had more than one disorder. Half the children had PTSD and separation anxiety disorder, and more than half expressed suicidal ideation, while a quarter had engaged in self-harm. A low level of pre-existing (lifetime) psychiatric symptoms or disorder support the view that detention causes mental disorder. A striking feature is the high reporting of negative experiences within detention itself, including abusive and harsh treatment, and witnessing others’ self-harm and suicidal behaviour. This paper supports advocacy for the removal of vulnerable children and individuals from detention and it calls for the abolition of mandatory detention. In the current environment of ongoing detention, lengthening detention and increasing behavioural breakdown and suicidal behaviour, these results remain important.</p>
<p>A study of children in a remote facility found high levels of trauma-related symptoms and developmental compromise amongst 20 children, aged 11 months to 17 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1039856213491991">23</xref></sup> Some children under 5 years of age had spent most of their lives in detention (7 children). All the younger children showed delayed cognitive development, related to neglect and deprivation. All children aged 7 to 17 years met diagnostic criteria for PTSD and major depression with suicidal ideation. The children’s trauma related to events that they experienced whilst in detention.</p>
<p>As noted, length in detention emerged as a major contributing factor to mental deterioration, physical symptoms and hopelessness. While asylum-seekers arrive with pre-existing high levels of traumatic exposure and loss, which impact their rates of distress, research suggests that the experience of detention itself is most significant. An early study by a detained medical practitioner in Villawood detention centre<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213491991">12</xref></sup> finds that the severity of depressive symptoms increases with the length of time in detention and finally results in a state of cognitive deficit, pervasive mistrust and psychotic symptoms. Recent work reviewing medical records of detainees again relates length of detention to health problems and particularly notes complex physical health presentations, medical service utilisation and mental health diagnoses increasing at the 12-month period. Rates of disorder are low in the early periods of detention and extremely high after 18 months in detention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856213491991">19</xref></sup> Whilst the Australian government now accepts this relationship and risk, detaining people for only brief periods (current policy of 90 days) and facilitating community processing of vulnerable groups, such as survivors of torture and children, this remains difficult. Community alternatives to detention, if based on a model of personal autonomy and participation, may be the only way to prevent deterioration, increasing distress and rates of self-harm. The occurrence of five suicides across the detention system, from September 2010 to July 2011, is clearly extremely concerning and requires rethinking of the policy of mandatory detention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1039856213491991">24</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1039856213491991">
<title>The questionable value of clinical care in the immigration context</title>
<p>The above body of research contributes to the ‘asylum seeker’ debate and calls for reform of immigration law in Australia. The findings raise questions about the meaning of individual diagnosis, when the detention environment and the refugee determination process themselves are major factors in producing distress. Labelling self-harm and behavioural disturbance as politically-motivated ‘bad behaviour’ contributes to under-recognition of serious mental distress and disorder, amplifies the distress and disorder, and compounds the difficulty in creating a psychologically-supportive environment.</p>
<p>Similarly, the capacity to treat psychiatric conditions within the immigration detention setting is limited. Treating professionals have little control over the length of detention, lack of status resolution and detainees’ deterioration. The example of a psychologist teaching ‘anger management’ following a protest action by distressed detainees illustrates how psychological interventions that ignore context may misunderstand the healthy role of political protest and ultimately, exacerbate the feelings associated with being misunderstood and humiliated. For mental health clinicians, the detention context challenges the traditional model of trauma and recovery. The conventional individual model of PTSD, applied to individuals, has less utility when we are talking about trauma across a collective culture, across a whole community or group. Cultural variations in the expression of distress, when the how and why for being held is sought and their experience of trauma prompts exploration in frameworks which are broader than Western diagnostic approaches. Socio-political interventions potentially transcend the individualistic psychological models of Western Psychology.</p>
<p>The prescription of anti-depressant, anti-psychotic and analgesic drugs is also of questionable value and utility. It is unclear to what extent such practices are regulated. Consequently, in dealing with detained populations, many clinicians describe feelings of disempowerment and even experience vicarious traumatisation and have been unable to continue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1039856213491991">25</xref></sup> Constraints on the traditional clinical role pose ethical dilemmas, including the age-old question of whether to work ‘within the system’, trying to mollify its harmful effects, or ‘to oppose it from without’. Clinicians working within the system, noting how difficult it can be to resist taking up simplistic approaches, have raised the need for external supervision and support. Supporting non-professional advocates and volunteers has also been necessary: many are not experienced in dealing with the high levels of complex distress and suicidality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1039856213491991">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Advocacy, therefore, becomes important as it is potentially therapeutic for detainees. This includes stating that the treatment is of limited value within an environment known to be harmful to the people who are living and working within it. Clinicians have documented development and deepening of mental and physical health issues over time, and they often put the argument for community release forward, when concerned about a detainee’s well-being. For the health professions, this is part of clinical practice.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Immigration detention has once again become a key political issue, following a period of relative calm within the system. Increasing numbers of irregular maritime arrivals to Australia have prompted a political debate about the factors influencing asylum seeking and those which might deter it. Both sides of politics have argued for the regulation of unauthorised arrivals and for mandatory detention. In the face of increasing numbers of detainees, many with a history of torture and trauma, and significant numbers of unaccompanied minors, concerns have once again been raised about the serious harmful effects of immigration detention and the impact on children – now and in the future. The overwhelming strength of international evidence appears not to guide current planning. Attempts to provide psychological support and increase mental health services confront the problems of treatment efficacy in a damaging environment. Increasing numbers of so-called ‘failed’ asylum seekers and long-stay cases will have a major impact on the operation of detention centres and the rates of protest, disturbance and mental disorder. There is anecdotal evidence that the attempted suicides and suicidal behaviour is on the rise. It is clinically and ethically ill-informed to say that such actions are ‘bad behaviour’ or ‘playing-up’ and that asylum-seekers should face criminal charges. The challenge appears to be one of re-creating some level of psychological and empathic understanding for the plight of the asylum-seeker, and of the impact of mandatory detention. A trauma-informed model of care is essential and should underlie policy reform and service provision. The sense of déjà vu is strong, for those who have been involved in these issues over the last decade or more.</p>
