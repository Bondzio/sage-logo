<p>This book is the history of the birth, life, and (near-)death of the concept of persistent individual differences in the probability of being involved in an accident: <italic>accident proneness</italic>.</p>
<p>Burnham’s book is comprehensive, informative, and a pleasure to read. He traces the development (largely in the 20th century) of the concept that some people have a personal, persistent deficiency that leads them to have more accidents than might be expected.</p>
<p>The introduction of technology in the late 19th and early 20th centuries simultaneously made more demands on workers to conform to the needs of the machines – and provided more opportunities to be involved in accidents. Some operators were involved in more accidents than were others. The machine always did what it was directed to do, so the accident must have been the user’s fault. Having more than one’s share must be a personal characteristic, leading to the label <italic>accident prone.</italic>
</p>
<p>Psychologists, psychiatrists, and psychoanalysts undertook to find measurable – or at least detectable – personal characteristics (as concrete as reaction time and as vague as a so-called affinity for accidents) that correlated with the probability of accidents and that could be used to select operators who would have fewer accidents. But convincing proof of the existence of accident proneness was never found. The shift in social strategy was to human factors engineering: Design the accidents out of the machine.</p>
<p>What is my own opinion? At a meeting about 60 years ago, I listened to a paper on accident proneness. The presenter spoke for 15 minutes and concluded by saying,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>There is no acceptable proof of the existence of accident proneness. Everyone agrees that it does not exist. But when I go home I will go into a broom closet, turn off the light, shut the door and scream, “But there <italic>are</italic> accident-prone people.”</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>I remain a believer.</p>
