<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dudrick and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112460397">1</xref></sup> developed and established the techniques for administering parenteral nutrition (PN) in the 1960s. Since then, home parenteral nutrition (HPN) has come to be used for patients who require an extension of intravenous (IV) nutrition beyond the hospital. HPN is not without risk, but techniques of PN administration in the hospital have been adapted for use in the home setting. As challenging as it can be for the patient and additional potential caregivers to administer this type of therapy at home, it has become much easier with the availability and evolution of many home care services that were not available when the first patients went home from our program in the 1970s. Over the years, infusion devices have become smaller in size and more portable, thereby reducing restrictions to allow more freedom of movement so that patients are not homebound.</p>
<p>Nutrition support teams (NSTs) are commonly composed of physicians, dietitians, pharmacists, nurses, and social workers, but few hospitals in the United States have home NSTs managing these complex patients. Proper delivery of HPN therapy requires an interdisciplinary approach as well as a clear understanding of the pathophysiology of the underlying condition, safe solution ordering, fluid and electrolyte management, management of short- and long-term infectious and noninfectious complications, and selection and maintenance of vascular access devices (VADs). The purpose of this article is to provide a thorough review of transitioning patients from hospital to home and management of HPN therapy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0148607112460397">
<title>Patient Selection</title>
<p>Patients who have been receiving PN in the hospital may become stable enough to consider leaving the hospital, but for a number or reasons, they may not be able to either maintain their fluids and electrolytes normally or ingest sufficient nutrients to sustain themselves. Surgical and medical teams refer patients to NST physicians for determining the appropriateness of HPN therapy in patients with intestinal failure (IF). IF is defined as a loss of absorptive capacity secondary to obstruction, dysmotility, surgical resection, congenital defect, or mucosal disease, resulting in chronic diarrhea, dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, micronutrient imbalances, and malnutrition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112460397">2</xref></sup> These patients may require HPN for several weeks or months or indefinitely. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112460397">Table 1</xref> lists the common etiologies for HPN. Patients with cancer who cannot maintain fluids and electrolytes and could be candidates for hospice care will not be discussed further here.</p>

<p>After HPN is deemed necessary, a care plan should be developed by the interdisciplinary team with patient involvement, and the patient should understand the risks and benefits of HPN therapy. The care plan should include the indication for HPN, the approximate length of HPN therapy, end point (surgery, spontaneous healing of fistula, resolution of obstruction, transition to enteral nutrition [EN], etc), and the goals of HPN (weight gain, weight maintenance, weight loss). After determining the plan of care, selection of the proper VAD should follow along with patient education, identification of the HPN caregiver, insurance review by a nurse case manager, selection of a homecare agency and infusion pharmacy, evaluation of the home setting (for safety), and stabilization and cycling of the HPN solution. For centers providing HPN without management by a physician lead NST, case managers assist in identifying a physician to prescribe HPN and coordinating the many different skilled therapies that patients may require.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0148607112460397">
<title>Reimbursement</title>
<p>The case manager or discharge planner plays a critical role in determining the patient’s insurance benefits and reimbursement for HPN. Costs associated with HPN were estimated at $140,000 annually in 1992 and are probably higher now.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112460397">3</xref></sup> For patients with Medicare, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) criteria must be met for reimbursement of HPN. Criteria for HPN coverage include the following: HPN therapy is required for at least 90 days (CMS defines the condition causing the need for HPN therapy to be 90 days or lifetime as judged to the best of the attending physician’s knowledge) and weight maintenance cannot be possible using other methods (enteral feeding or pharmacological interventions). Diagnoses covered by CMS for HPN therapy (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148607112460397">Table 2</xref>) include bowel obstruction, pancreatitis, small bowel fistula (not able to be bypassed with a feeding tube), or intestinal malabsorption or dysmotility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112460397">4</xref></sup> Documentation such as operative reports, laboratory values, and imaging studies are required by CMS to support the diagnosis of intestinal failure requiring HPN. Medicaid benefits and private insurances coverage vary, and benefits should be reviewed by the case manager or discharge planner to ascertain individual benefits. Patients without insurance coverage provide additional challenges for the discharge planner. Often, homecare providers will provide some of the HPN and/or related supplies as charity care, and the patient is required to pay a set cost out of pocket.</p>

<title>IV Access</title>
<p>One of the most critical decisions that must be made prior to hospital discharge is how long the intended HPN therapy may be needed, short vs long term. The answer to this will help in selecting the most appropriate VAD for each individual patient. To avoid multiple needless catheterizations, the decision should be made by collaborating with the primary service, Infectious Disease Service (if antibiotics are necessary), the NST physician, and the patient. Advantages/disadvantages for each VAD include the following: patient/caregiver ability to care for the VAD, activity level, body image concerns, previous history of VADs, additional therapies needed, and patient preference.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112460397">5</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607112460397">Figure 1</xref> shows the potential sites for IV access. Choices for vascular access include tunneled VADs with an anchoring cuff (Hickman/Leonard, Broviac, and Groshong), implantable ports, and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). For “short-term” therapy, defined as short to moderate duration (usually weeks), a PICC is often used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112460397">6</xref></sup> This can be placed at the bedside by a specialty team or in interventional radiology. Some advantages of the PICC are the cost-effectiveness of bedside placement, decreased risk of catheter insertion complications, and ease of removal upon completion of HPN therapy. Disadvantages include the following: patient is less independent with the care of the PICC, dressing must remain dry, tip migration if the PICC is not secured, and a greater risk of thrombosis due to the small intraluminal diameter of the catheter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112460397">7</xref></sup></p>
<fig id="fig1-0148607112460397" position="float">
<label>Figure 1.</label>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0148607112460397-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>For longer term therapy, months to years, tunneled catheters are the mainstay. Advantages of tunneled catheters are ease of self-care, they can be used for an extended timeframe, the cuff aids in the prevention of bacteria migrating into tunnel, and the ability to repair holes or breaks. However, there is a lower risk of thrombosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112460397">8</xref></sup> with tunneled catheters compared with PICCs. Implanted ports are another option for long-term continuous therapy or intermittent therapy. An advantage of a port is minimal alteration in body image, no concern for accidental pulling or cutting of the device, and patients may go swimming when the port is not cannulated. A disadvantage is the needle stick to access the port, and with severe infections, a surgical procedure is needed for removal.</p>
<p>Another consideration when selecting a VAD is the number of lumens that will be needed. It is very important for patients to receive the fewest number of lumens required. Unneeded lumens require unnecessary manipulation of the catheter, which increases the chance of infection. Also taken into consideration is the cycle of the HPN solution and if other IV therapies are required. For instance, with a single lumen, if antibiotics are ordered every 12 hours, this could be given before and after the HPN 12-hour cycle. For antibiotics given more often than every 12 hours, a double lumen would be required. Selecting the optimal double lumen may help in decreasing chances of withdrawal or total occlusion complications (unpublished observation). One option is the Hickman 9 Fr., with the white lumen having the intraluminal size of 0.7 mm and the red lumen 1.3 mm. Another option, the Leonard 10 Fr., is more desirable as both lumens are 1.3 mm. Otherwise, the Leonard catheter is identical to the Hickman catheter; the difference between the two is simply the diameter of the lumens.</p>
<p>Not only is selecting the appropriate VAD of utmost importance, but also the vessel where the catheter is placed can help in decreasing possible complications. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607112460397">Figure 1</xref> shows the potential sites for IV access. The choice of the insertion site is dependent on many factors such as patient anatomy, chest wall disease, previous catheters, radiation therapy, implanted defibrillator/pacemaker, and previous thrombosis. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “No recommendation can be made for a preferred site of insertion to minimize infection risk for a tunneled central vascular catheter.” However, the CDC does recommend the avoidance of the femoral site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112460397">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many preventive strategies and new technologies are available to help prevent some VAD-related complications (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148607112460397">Table 3</xref>). Thrombotic catheter occlusion and catheter-related infections are the most commonly reported catheter complications for all types of VADs in the healthcare setting. One preventive strategy to help in decreasing thrombosis is ensuring that the tip of the VAD is positioned in the right atrium/superior vena cava (SVC) junction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112460397">10</xref></sup> The tip of the catheter should be aligned with the vessel walls and free floating. According to Kusminsky,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112460397">11</xref></sup> malpositioned VADs have been associated with problems of local toxicity, SVC perforation, and venous thrombosis. Previously, VADs were placed within the right atrium, but the current practice opposes this because of the increased risk of perforation. Other preventive strategies to help decrease the incidence of thrombotic occlusions and possible infection would be using proper flushing technique and correct clamping sequence when disconnecting the syringe from a needleless connector. It is important to know what type of fluid displacement the connector has—negative, positive, or neutral—to prevent blood reflux into the tip of the catheter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112460397">12</xref></sup> With negative fluid displacement, disconnecting from the needleless connector before clamping can cause reflux of blood back into the catheter. It is recommended when flushing to leave a small amount of saline in the syringe and while actively flushing close the clamp. Positive pressure will prevent retrograde of blood into the catheter. With the neutral displacement connector, there is no fluid movement in either direction when tubing or syringe is disconnected. Flushing with a positive displacement connector means that when disconnecting, a small amount of fluid is forced from the reservoir of the connector into the catheter to prevent the reflux of blood. In this case, clamping after disconnecting is required.</p>

<p>Helping the patient maintain the VAD for the duration of HPN therapy should be the goal, and measures to help meet this goal include hand hygiene, access site disinfection, and providing education to the patient on caring for the VAD.</p>

<title>Solution Basics (Adapted From Speerhas and Rhoda<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607112460397">13</xref></sup>)</title>
<p>Components of HPN solutions include protein in the form of amino acids (AAs), carbohydrate in the form of dextrose, electrolytes, minerals, vitamins, trace elements, medications, and sterile water for injection. Fat may be added daily to HPN or administered separately.</p>
<sec id="section6-0148607112460397">
<title>Amino Acids</title>
<p>Synthetic crystalline amino acids, which provide 4 kcal/g, are used in PN as a source of protein. AA solutions are made by a number of manufacturers, range in concentration from 3% (30 g/L) to 20% (200 g/L), and are available in standard or disease-specific formulations.</p>
<p>Standard AA solutions contain 8 essential AAs plus cysteine and 6 nonessential AAs. Some standard AA solutions (specifically, FreAmine III [B. Braun, Bethlehem, PA]) also contain an appreciable amount of phosphate, which must be considered for compatibility and when dosing electrolytes. A 10% solution is used in PN formulas that do not require concentrated or disease-specific AAs. Concentrated AA solutions, 15% or 20%, are available when minimizing fluid intake is required.</p>
<p>Choline is a nonessential AA that is found in many foods, and consequently, deficiencies are rare. Approximately 80% of patients who rely on HPN for their full source of nutrition have been found to have low levels of choline circulating in the blood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607112460397">14</xref></sup> Some investigators think that choline deficiency may contribute to the development of PN-associated liver disease (PNALD). Choline is not routinely added to HPN formulas since it can be synthesized endogenously from methionine and therefore is not an essential AA. In contrast, studies have shown that this pathway may be altered when patients are on HPN. Buchman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607112460397">15</xref></sup> showed that patients receiving HPN with choline deficiency and hepatic abnormalities had a reversal in these hepatic abnormalities once choline supplementation was started. Further clinical trials are still needed to fully understand the effect of choline supplementation intravenously on PNALD, and development of an injectable choline preparation is still needed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0148607112460397">
<title>Carbohydrate</title>
<p>Carbohydrate is provided as dextrose and is usually the primary calorie source in PN. IV dextrose has 3.4 kcal/g and is an inexpensive, readily available energy source that can be admixed with any AA solution. Commercially available dextrose solutions range in concentration from 5%−70%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0148607112460397">
<title>Fat</title>
<p>Fat is available for IV use as an oil-in-water emulsion. The emulsified lipid particle ranges from 0.1–0.5 microns in diameter, which is slightly smaller than endogenous chylomicrons. All IV fat emulsions (IVFEs) available in the United States contain egg phospholipids as an emulsifier, water, and soybean or safflower oil as a source of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Glycerol is added to make the emulsion isotonic. Lipid particles break down and release triglycerides when administered intravenously. Triglycerides are then hydrolyzed by lipoprotein lipase forming glycerol, free fatty acids, and mono- and diglycerides. The free fatty acids are usually taken up by the tissues and either oxidized for energy or used for resynthesis of triglycerides and deposition into adipose tissue.</p>
<p>The primary role of IVFE is to prevent essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency. Since IVFE contains egg phospholipids, it is contraindicated in the (rare) instance of a documented egg allergy. If so, as a last resort, safflower or sunflower oil can be administered topically or enterally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112460397">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>IVFEs containing 10% or 20% fat are isotonic and are the source of EFAs when a patient is receiving a dextrose-based PN solution. The 30% solution is used for compounding total nutrient admixtures (TNAs). A 10% IVFE provides 1.1 kcal/mL, 20% provides 2 kcal/mL, and 30% provides 3 kcal/mL. A minimum of 100 grams of IVFE is required weekly to prevent EFA deficiency. Other fat emulsions formulations are available outside the United States but will not be discussed here.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0148607112460397">
<title>Electrolytes/Minerals</title>
<p>Some electrolytes and minerals are inherent in AA mixtures. Additional electrolytes and minerals are added to PN in the amounts based on the individual needs of the patient. Sodium and potassium are available in salt forms as chloride, acetate, and phosphate. The gluconate salt of calcium is the preferred form of this mineral (over calcium chloride) since it is less likely to cause incompatibilities in PN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112460397">5</xref></sup> Multichambered PN bags are also commercially available with a standard mixture of electrolytes. National shortages of many ingredients contained in PN formulas have occurred, making patient-specific PN very difficult to order.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0148607112460397">
<title>Vitamins</title>
<p>IV vitamin preparations should be added to HPN solutions daily. Vitamins are commercially available as injectable multivitamin infusions or single-entity products (with the exception of biotin, pantothenic acid, riboflavin, and vitamins A, D, and E) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148607112460397">Table 4</xref>). There is also an adult multivitamin injection available without vitamin K. Since this has short-term stability in PN solutions, it cannot be compounded by pharmacy for HPN, and the patient or caregiver must add this to each PN prior to infusion. During times of multivitamin shortages, American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) recommends IV vitamin preparations be given 3 times weekly. Chewable vitamin supplements twice daily can be used for patients with IF on days multivitamin infusion (MVI) is not infused.</p>

<title>Medications</title>
<p>PN is a complex formulation primarily designed to deliver nutrients and fluids but can also be used to deliver medications. Administering medications via HPN is generally not recommended due to potential drug-nutrient interactions, compatibility limitations, and the inability to adjust or discontinue the medication without discontinuing HPN. However, delivering medications via HPN can reduce nursing time and risk of contamination due to decreased manipulation of IV lines associated with administering medications separately. Medications commonly added to HPN are discussed below. A pharmacist should be consulted before adding any other medication to HPN.</p>
<p>Heparin is not used in HPN patients routinely as it can cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and if it is used, it should be withheld in patients actively bleeding.</p>
<p>Regular human insulin is chemically stable in HPN and is effective in controlling blood glucose when added in appropriate amounts. Insulin should not be routinely added to HPN unless the patient has a history of diabetes or is demonstrating glucose intolerance for any reason. Only regular human insulin should be added to HPN. Insulin has short-term stability in PN solutions, and the patient or caregiver must add it to each PN prior to infusion.</p>
<p>Histamine-2 receptor antagonists such as famotidine, ranitidine, and cimetidine are used to decrease gastric acid secretions, particularly in patients with massive small bowel resection or to prevent stress-induced gastropathy. Once added to HPN, oral and other IV doses of this class of drugs should be discontinued. The therapeutic dose of famotidine is 40 mg/d. The dose of these agents must be reduced by half in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min). Because histamine-2 receptor antagonists can potentially cause mental status changes, particularly in the elderly, their use should be limited to certain conditions. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0148607112460397">Table 6</xref> for indications on adding these agents to PN solutions.</p>

<p>Corticosteroids such as IV methylprednisolone or hydrocortisone can be added to HPN for those patients who need long-term corticosteroid therapy and cannot take oral corticosteroids. Drawbacks to adding corticosteroids to HPN solutions include full dose of steroids not being delivered if there are pump malfunctions or if the HPN solution is abruptly stopped for any reason. Since steroids have short-term stability in PN solutions, they cannot be compounded by the pharmacy for HPN, and the patient or caregiver must add this to each PN prior to infusion.</p>
<p>Metoclopramide is compatible in PN solutions. Meto-clopramide is a prokinetic gastrointestinal agent commonly used for chronic nausea. If chronic IV use is necessary, 20–40 mg/d can be added to PN. However, this is rarely done due to the high incidence of neurological side effects. Since this has short-term stability in PN solutions, metoclopramide cannot be compounded by the pharmacy for HPN, and the patient or caregiver must add this to each PN prior to infusion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0148607112460397">
<title>PN Formula Selection</title>
<p>PN can be compounded as 2-in-1 (dextrose-based) or 3-in-1 (lipid-based) formulations. A 3-in-1, also known as a total nutrient admixture (TNA), may be administered centrally or peripherally (home PN therapy does not use the peripheral route) depending on osmolarity, whereas a 2-in-1 is typically administered centrally. The patient’s clinical and nutrition status, estimated duration of therapy, and current IV access are considerations when determining the type of PN solution. Osmolarity of PN solutions can be estimated using the formula in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0148607112460397">Appendix A</xref>.</p>
<p>Central PN can be provided as a 2-in-1 solution since there are no limits on osmolarity when infusing into a central vein. The decision to add IV fat emulsions to PN or administer it separately is based on clinical, physiochemical, and economic factors.</p>
<p>TNAs may be advantageous when limiting carbohydrate is warranted due to glucose intolerance. However, IVFEs are more expensive than dextrose, and adding it to PN creates issues regarding the stability of the formula and compatibility with other additives.</p>
<sec id="section15-0148607112460397">
<title>Compatibility</title>
<p>Compatibility of a TNA involves the stability of the IVFE. IVFEs are stable by virtue of a phospholipid coating and negative electrical charges surrounding each lipid particle, causing a repellent effect and preventing coalescence. TNAs have stability problems if improperly compounded (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0148607112460397">Appendix B</xref>). Incompatibility can also result from the addition of inappropriate concentrations of highly positively charged particles to the TNA. Iron cations, for example, can cause significant interference with IVFE stability and should not be added to a TNA. In addition, the total mEq of calcium and magnesium in a TNA should be restricted (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0148607112460397">Appendix B</xref>).</p>
<p>If IVFE stability is compromised, creaming or “oiling out” will occur (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0148607112460397">Figure 2</xref>). Creaming presents as a skim milk lower layer with a creamy white layer on the surface of the solution. This represents the beginning of emulsion destabilization. At this stage, sufficient shaking will reemulsify the mixture. “Oiling out” or “cracking” represents a drastic stability change and is identified when free oil floats on top of the TNA solution. When this occurs, the TNA should not be infused.</p>
<fig id="fig2-0148607112460397" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0148607112460397-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The relative solubility of calcium and phosphate is of concern in all PN solutions. Precipitation of calcium phosphate in PN can occur if the solution is not prepared correctly or the concentrations of calcium and phosphate are too high. If PN is compounded with an AA solution containing phosphates (FreAmine III 10%; B. Braun), this amount of phosphates should be included in the calculation. See <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3-0148607112460397">Appendix C</xref> for an equation to calculate calcium and phosphate limits to maintain solubility of these components in the PN solution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0148607112460397">
<title>PN Solution Preparation and Delivery</title>
<p>The goal of specialized nutrition support is to provide nutrients in adequate quantities to meet metabolic demands. Individualized PN prescriptions, rather than standard solutions, are the best way to meet these needs while remaining within daily fluid allowances. Standard commercial solutions of PN with or without electrolytes and containing different amino acid and dextrose concentrations are currently available. These are supplied as dual-chamber bags (none available in the United States with fat emulsion) and have extended stability and a lower aluminum content, and they have potentially less chance of error in compounding as only vitamins and trace elements need to be added prior to dispensing from the pharmacy. These commercial solutions of PN are not patient specific as they all have the same concentration of electrolytes or no electrolytes at all. In general, a patient on HPN can travel. For short trips, the PN bags can be taken in cold-storage containers. For longer trips, it is reasonable to ask the infusion pharmacy to ship HPN bags and supplies to the destination. A letter from the prescribing physician may be necessary for airline travel.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0148607112460397">
<title>Administration</title>
<p>PN may be cycled or administered continuously. In a hospital setting, PN is usually infused continuously over a 24-hour period because it requires less nursing time, effort, and manipulation of IV lines. Continuous infusion also generally results in fewer metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia and electrolyte disturbances. PN can be cycled over 8–20 hours to allow time away from the infusion pump when a patient is discharged to an extended-care facility or home. It is recommended that the PN be cycled and stable (euglycemia) prior to discharge home from the hospital. One goal is to cycle PN over 12 hours each day. This allows the pancreas and liver to readapt from the stress of the PN infusion and also provides for some enhanced quality of life for the patient. Infusion pumps can be programmed to taper up 1, 2, or 3 hours and/or taper down 1, 2, or 3 hours to maintain glycemic control during and after the PN infusion. Only minor infusion cycle alterations should be required in the home setting.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0148607112460397">
<title>Weaning of HPN Solutions</title>
<p>Weaning of HPN solutions differs from weaning hospital PN solutions. Rather than decreasing the energy or fluid of the daily solution, calories and fluid are usually reduced by omitting days of the HPN infusion. Once the patient has achieved his or her goal weight and/or the condition requiring PN therapy has been resolved (ie, malabsorption medically treated, surgical intervention, etc), typically 7 days of HPN infusions are reduced to 5 or 6 days if the patient can maintain adequate hydration. When infusion schedules are changed, laboratory studies are checked the following week to evaluate fluid and electrolyte stability. Once intake and output records are reviewed for fluid balance, weight status is evaluated, and labs are acceptable, the patient is assessed for ability to wean further from PN.</p>
<p>After HPN solutions are reduced to the minimum, 3 days weekly, the patient’s PN is placed on hold for 1 week. After laboratory studies are reviewed and found to be normal and the patient’s weight and enteral intake is assessed to be adequate, the patient’s VAD is removed and HPN formally discontinued. Some HPN programs will keep the VAD for several weeks to months to verify that the patient can be independent of HPN and does not need to restart and require another invasive catheter placement, especially if access has been an issue in the past.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0148607112460397">
<title>HPN Monitoring and Complications</title>
<p>There is a lack of controlled trials with HPN patients and therefore a lack of evidence-based guidelines for monitoring and treating potential complications. Long-term complications may include intes-tinal failure–associated liver disease (IFALD), metabolic bone disease (MBD), and infectious (catheter-related bloodstream infections [CRBSIs], site infections, port-pocket infections, tunnel infections, etc) or noninfectious catheter complications (catheter-related thrombosis, SVC syndrome, air embolism, occlusions, etc). Other metabolic (fluid and/or electrolyte abnormalities) or mechanical catheter complications may also occur.</p>
<p>Currently, there are no professional society guidelines for monitoring HPN patients. Our practice at the Cleveland Clinic is to obtain labs monthly once the patient is stable. Our lab monitoring includes a basic metabolic panel, hepatic panel, phosphorus, magnesium, and complete blood count. Prealbumin, C-reactive protein, and prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) are monitored monthly. Trace elements (copper, chromium, selenium, zinc, and whole-blood manganese) are monitored biannually.</p>
<p>Cavicchi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607112460397">23</xref></sup> reported the prevalence of liver disease in HPN patients with permanent IF, noting that 26% of patients had liver disease after 2 years and 50% after 3 years. The data clearly show that the incidence of IFALD increased with the duration of HPN. When liver enzymes suddenly increase or remain persistently elevated, investigating the cause is warranted (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0148607112460397">Table 7</xref> for the suggested management of hepatobilliary complications). Our institution avoids use of IVFE daily, but if required based on specific patient comorbidities to achieve glycemic control, IVFE is be limited to less than 1 g/kg daily<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607112460397">23</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0148607112460397">Table 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Decreasing HPN Complications</title>
<p>One of the main goals of HPN therapy is to maintain the patient’s nutrition status while concurrently making all efforts to minimize complications associated with HPN. CRBSI is one of the most serious infectious complications of HPN. Methods to prevent CRBSI have included selecting the VAD with the fewest number of lumens, institutional hand hygiene policies, staff and patient training on proper catheter care techniques, maximal barrier precautions during catheter insertion, aseptic technique during catheter insertion, and removing catheters no longer in use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112460397">9</xref></sup> Instructing the patient on infection prevention is one of the most critical steps in preventing catheter-related infections. It is imperative for patients to receive education on aseptic technique for HPN procedures and catheter care. Patients should be provided detailed written instructions, visual demonstration, and the opportunity to repeat back the procedures. Homecare nursing plays a vital role in reinforcing the teaching provided to patients while hospitalized on catheter care, monitoring compliance with procedures, and monitoring the catheter site. Other techniques have included use of antibiotic or ethanol lock therapies to prevent CRBSI.</p>
<p>Antibiotic locks have been used to treat CRBSI. Antibiotic locks consist of 100- to 1000-fold higher concentrations of antibiotics that dwell within the lumen of the catheter when cycled HPN is not infusing. Antibiotic locks are used with systemic antibiotics for treatment of a CRBSI when the goal is to salvage the VAD. Antibiotic locks should not be used alone for treatment of CRBSI but in conjunction with systemic antibiotics for 7–14 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0148607112460397">32</xref></sup> CDC guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112460397">9</xref></sup> recommend not using antibiotic lock for the prevention of CRBSI in general but can be used prophylactically only in situations with long-term VADs in patients with a history of multiple cases of CRBSI. The use of antibiotic locks brings concerns for the development of resistance or the potential for selection of worse infectious organisms. The optimal duration of antibiotic locks remains unknown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0148607112460397">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ethanol lock (ETL) has emerged as a method to prevent CRBSI and has been used in many patient populations, including hemodialysis, oncology, and adult and pediatric HPN patients, but its use is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration or the Infectious Disease Society of America due to insufficient data. Benefits of ETL over antibiotic lock include the following: there is no concern for the development of resistance (as ethanol acts to denature proteins), it is inexpensive, and it has both bactericidal and fungicidal properties. Small studies among HPN patients have demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in CRBSI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0148607112460397">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0148607112460397"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0148607112460397"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0148607112460397"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0148607112460397">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because of the limited number of studies, the optimal dwell time and strength of ETL are unknown, but it is believed to be most effective immediately after the central venous access device (CVAD) is placed, before biofilm has a significant amount of time to form. Typically, 3 mL of 70% ethanol is administered after cycled HPN infusions are completed and allowed to dwell within the lumen of the catheter for the longest number of hours the patient is disconnected from HPN. Before starting the next HPN infusion, ETL is flushed through the line with normal saline (in adult patients). ETL is commonly only used in catheters made from silicone as alcohol has the potential to act as a solvent with polyurethane materials. Crinch et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0148607112460397">38</xref></sup> examined the mechanical properties of polyurethane and silicon catheters after exposure to 70% ethanol for 10 weeks in the lab to investigate the effect on the integrity of the catheters. The authors report that there was a negligible impact on the mechanical properties of polyurethane and silicon catheters and suggest that concerns about the use of ethanol in these catheter types are less of a concern.</p>
<p>Some literature in the pediatric population shows there may be increased risk of thrombosis with ETL use, but this has yet to be documented in the adult population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0148607112460397">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0148607112460397">40</xref></sup> More studies are warranted in this area to define many unanswered questions regarding the optimal ethanol concentration, optimal dwell time in the catheter, and studies for cost-savings analysis and if quality of life is affected in HPN patients. Currently, 70% ETL locks must be compounded in the pharmacy into a prefilled syringe. Stability of the compounded ethanol within the syringe has been studied and documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0148607112460397">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>For patients with hypercoagulable states or those at increased risk of a catheter-related thrombus, some experts suggest use of low-dose warfarin (1–2 mg of warfarin/d) to reduce thrombotic risk prior to insertion of a long-term VAD with continued therapy as long as the VAD is in place. Boraks et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0148607112460397">42</xref></sup> demonstrated decreased incidence of CVAD-related thrombosis in oncology patients with tunneled catheters given 1 mg/d warfarin upon insertion until the line was removed. Bern et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0148607112460397">43</xref></sup> showed reduced thrombus related to VAD in oncology patients given 1 mg/d warfarin 3 days prior to VAD placement and continued therapy for 90 days after placement. Ports were used and correct placement for the study was defined as within the tip of the SVC or proximal innominate vein (these lines would currently be considered malpositioned and at greater risk of thrombus due to tip location).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112460397">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112460397">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0148607112460397">44</xref></sup> It is unclear if these results could transfer to the HPN patient population.</p>
<p>Patients receiving HPN therapy via a VAD may also benefit from low-dose warfarin therapy; however, past studies within the PN population have been completed with heparin and not warfarin. The decision to use this potentially beneficial therapy in HPN patients is based on clinical judgment of the managing physician until future studies are completed. Treatment with anticoagulation prophylaxis in oncology patients receiving HPN should be strongly considered due to the underlying increased risk of thrombosis.</p>

<title>Quality of Life</title>
<p>HPN has been a lifeline for patients with intestinal failure over the years, but quality of life (QOL) can be challenging to measure. The difficulty in capturing and defining QOL is determining the impact on QOL from symptoms related to the primary disease vs the impact from HPN. Tools to measure QOL that have been validated in the HPN population include the HPN-QOL, a 48-item questionnaire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0148607112460397">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>Due to the need for infusions that last many hours, many patients talk about the difficulty in getting a good night’s sleep. Clinicians can offer the patient an option to infuse HPN solutions during the daytime hours to allow for restful sleep during the night hours. Over the years, equipment such as portable pumps and backpacks has allowed for enhanced mobility in the home setting. It is our practice, considering QOL, to assess the ability to allow patients to infuse HPN solutions 6 nights weekly if they do not have excessive GI losses or problems maintaining adequate hydration.</p>

<title>Additional Issues</title>
<p>As this detailed discussion has shown, HPN is very labor intensive and uses many resources. Unfortunately, this management is either poorly or not reimbursed by insurers and government agencies alike. This can lead to breaks in management and responsibilities that could ultimately affect the patient. Furthermore, attempts at weaning could create a “Catch-22” where the patient is under the “minimum reimbursable infusion amount,” which could then require the patient to be responsible for the charges. Insurers and the government should work with physicians and appropriate societies to more fairly compensate those for their time and efforts to keep patients out of the hospital and give them hope for an improved QOL.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0148607112460397" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The provision of HPN requires a coordinated multimodality approach to provide a costly, high-tech therapy at home. Although patients can do very well, vigilance to maximize QOL and to minimize potential complications takes significant effort on both the patients’ and clinicians’ behalf to form a beneficial symbiotic therapeutic partnership.</p>
