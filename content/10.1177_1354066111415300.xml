<abstract>
<p>The concept of governmentality has gained significant influence among scholars of International Relations. Recently, however, there is a growing literature engaging critically with the notion of a global governmentality. This article seeks to inform this debate with insights from global climate change politics as a paradigmatic case for applying governmentality to global politics. Drawing on an analysis of the Clean Development Mechanism, it makes three arguments, which seek to refine the global governmentality concept. First, governmentality does not necessarily centre on the notion of the ‘population’, but can also function as a governmentality of other ‘technological zones’. Second, the seeming failure of a governmentality in its own terms is better understood within a ‘post-foundational’ framework of depoliticization. Third, governmentality and sovereignty are not mutually exclusive. Instead, the former allows the latter to ‘govern at a distance’. The Clean Development Mechanism illustrates these points perfectly. Although it is based on a global ‘carbon governmentality’, it is able to conduct individual conduct directly. Its apparent failure in terms of carbon emission reductions is in fact a success of depoliticizing climate politics, excluding fundamental social structures. And although it is based on an international treaty, it establishes an advanced liberal government of the climate.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>

<p>Is it possible to move outside? Is it possible to place the modern state in a general technology of power that assured its mutations, development, and functioning? Can we talk of a ‘governmentality’ that would be to the state what techniques of segregation were to psychiatry, what techniques of discipline were to the penal system, and what biopolitics was to medical institutions? These are the kind of questions that are at stake. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354066111415300">Foucault, 2007</xref>: 120)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It seems that the discipline of International Relations is increasingly haunted by the same set of questions that concerned Foucault in his famous lectures on the genealogy of ‘governmentality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354066111415300">Foucault, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354066111415300">2008</xref>): is it possible to understand the international domain of sovereign nation states in terms of techniques of power? Can we ‘go behind’ the nation state and seek out its embedding in a general economy of power effective at the global level? In other words, is there such a thing as a <italic>global governmentality</italic>? While there exists a vast literature on governmentality studies in the social sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1354066111415300">Miller and Rose, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1354066111415300">Rose et al., 2006</xref>), the governmentality concept did not appear in International Relations until a couple of years ago.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1354066111415300">2</xref></sup> Since then, however, a growing number of scholars have sought to answer these questions affirmatively, and have attempted to study world politics from a governmentality perspective (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354066111415300">Death, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1354066111415300">Lipschutz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1354066111415300">Merlingen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1354066111415300">Neumann and Sending, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1354066111415300">Okereke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1354066111415300">Rosenow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1354066111415300">Sending and Neumann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1354066111415300">Walters and Haahr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1354066111415300">White, 2007</xref>). Instead of focusing on the traditional’ <italic>who gets what, when and why?</italic> of inter-state politics, this perspective focuses on the more subtle mechanisms and asks <italic>how</italic> power is exercised.</p>
<p>More recently, however, some scholars have raised concerns about the applicability of the governmentality concept to the international level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354066111415300">Chandler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354066111415300">Joseph, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354066111415300">2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354066111415300">2010b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1354066111415300">2010c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1354066111415300">Selby, 2007</xref>). They argue that the traditional problem space of government — the population and civil society — does not exist outside ‘advanced liberal societies’, so that governmentality can hardly work beyond the Western world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354066111415300">Joseph, 2009</xref>). And, as state sovereignty still remains dominant at the international level, there could perhaps be a system of disciplinary power, or even an <italic>international</italic> governmentality, that acts on nation states. Yet a genuinely <italic>global</italic> governmentality — affecting the individual ‘conduct of conduct’ from the global level — can neither exist nor successfully be studied.</p>
<p>This article seeks to inform this debate with insights from the governmentality of climate change, focusing on the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). As one of the three flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol, it establishes a carbon market for emission reductions achieved in the global South, so-called Certified Emission Reductions (CERs), which can be bought by developed countries to offset their greenhouse gas emissions. Whereas the other two Kyoto mechanisms (Emissions Trading and Joint Implementation) more or less have not yet got off the ground, the CDM has become the second biggest market in climate certificates after the European Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) with a market volume of US$6.5 billion in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354066111415300">Kossoy and Ambrosi, 2010</xref>). And, given that most Annex I<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1354066111415300">3</xref></sup> countries are likely to miss their emission reduction targets, the CDM is arguably the most successful and significant element of the Kyoto Protocol; successful, however, only in relative terms. Right from the very beginning of its implementation in 2001, it has come in for fierce criticism for its lack of achieving real emission reductions and spurring sustainable development in target countries. The CDM, thus, might be a success in numbers, but is often understood — even by some of its proponents — as a failure in terms of climate protection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1354066111415300">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Against this backdrop, this article claims that the CDM is a ‘paradigmatic case’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354066111415300">Flyvbjerg, 2006</xref>: 232–233) for refuting critics of the global governmentality thesis. ‘Rendering climate change governable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1354066111415300">Oels, 2005</xref>) is a perfect example of a genuinely global governmentality, as it is constructed on a planetary problem space: the disturbance of the earth’s carbon cycle. This carbon governmentality not only affects international politics, but can also ‘conduct the conduct’ of subjects on a variety of spatial and political levels, from the personal ‘carbon budget’ and the ‘national sink’ to transnational carbon markets such as the CDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354066111415300">Lövbrand and Stripple, 2011</xref>). The case, thus, perfectly demonstrates that sovereignty and governmentality must not be thought of as mutually exclusive, but that the former can be situated in a liberal economy of power, governing ‘at a distance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1354066111415300">Miller and Rose, 2008</xref>). What is more, in that it especially targets the developing world, the CDM demonstrates that this carbon governmentality even reaches beyond the narrow confinements of advanced liberal societies — and this precisely by virtue of the advanced liberal technologies of the market. Finally, although the CDM might be a failure in terms of climate protection, it must not be understood as a defeat of global governmentality. In the same way as attempts to reform penalty practices through the prison failed to abolish crime, but served to traverse society with a dense web of disciplinary power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354066111415300">Foucault, 1977</xref>), the failure of CDM serves carbon governmentality to enfold its actual function. It brings about a way of governing the earth’s carbon cycle which purports to save the climate but in fact protects <italic>business as usual</italic> from climate protection. The failure of the CDM is the success of a depoliticization of climate change politics.</p>
<p>The following pages are organized in two parts. The first section introduces the debate about global governmentality and argues that the critiques do not discredit the concept, but help to refine it in three important ways. Thus, the section loosens the connection between governmentality and the population, addresses the relationship between governmentality and sovereignty, and links the notion of failure to a ‘post-foundational’ understanding of depoliticization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1354066111415300">Marchart, 2007</xref>). The second part illustrates these arguments with insights from governing global warming. In particular, it subjects the CDM to an ‘analytics of government’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354066111415300">Dean, 2010</xref>), and fleshes out the functioning of carbon governmentality in four dimensions: the fields of visibility, the techne, the episteme and identities. As this article focuses mainly on a theoretical controversy, and the CDM is a well-studied field,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1354066111415300">5</xref></sup> the empirical analysis is mainly based on secondary and grey literature.</p>

<title>Global governmentality</title>
<p>Michel Foucault’s concept of governmentality is an attack on those models of power which remain ‘under the spell of monarchy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354066111415300">Foucault, 1978</xref>: 88). These models of power — a transferable entity, tied to a sovereign centre, obvious and repressive — that were characteristic for the medieval state in modern times have increasingly been replaced by a more oblique and indirect use of power that Foucault identified as ‘government’. While it has its roots in the ‘pastoral power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354066111415300">Foucault, 2007</xref>: 123ff.) of ancient times, it could not have enfolded as a general economy of power if the concept of ‘population’ had not emerged in the 17th century and served as its appropriate problem space. Since then, the ‘governmentalization of the state’ has continuously advanced, and government has become the dominant way of exercising power in modern societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354066111415300">Foucault, 2007</xref>: 109). Today, it would best be understood as ‘the conduct of conduct’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354066111415300">Foucault, 1982</xref>: 220) and so points to a combination of external and internal guidance. To govern can be understood as ‘any more or less calculated and rational activity, undertaken by a multiplicity of authorities and agencies … that seeks to shape conduct by working through our desires, aspirations, interests and beliefs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354066111415300">Dean, 2010</xref>: 11). Government does not work through direct interventions, but lives by the ‘creation of probabilities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354066111415300">Lemke, 2000</xref>: 29; author’s translation) for individual behaviour. As the Foucauldian coinage ‘governmentality’ suggests, the manifold processes governing conduct are permeated and held together by a particular ‘mentality’. They draw on theories, philosophies, calculations or values that are themselves social and cultural products and become (re)produced in the processes of government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354066111415300">Dean, 2010</xref>: 16). Knowledge, in this sense, constitutes the use of power, and power, in turn, produces knowledge; they form an immanent complex of ‘power-knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354066111415300">Foucault, 1978</xref>: 98). In other words, governmentality highlights the way discourses are intertwined with a field of seemingly disparate practices. Finally, understanding government as the ‘conduct of conduct’ draws attention to the level of the subject. ‘Technologies of the self’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354066111415300">Foucault, 1993</xref>: 203) enable subjects to internalize governmental rationalities and translate them into individual practices. Put bluntly, the concept of governmentality helps to shed light on the multiple ways through which power is exercised ‘at a distance’ beyond the narrow confinements of state policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1354066111415300">Miller and Rose, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Dean, hence, proposes an analytics of government in order to study ‘regimes of practices’ instead of the institutions of governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354066111415300">Dean, 2010</xref>: 40). Here, the governmentality concept serves as a theoretical lens which allows us to study a broad range of regimes of practice. In order to capture their entanglement with political technologies, governmental rationalities and individual subjectivities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354066111415300">Dean (2010</xref>: 37ff.) particularly focuses on four dimensions: the <italic>field of visibility</italic>, which pictures and highlights the objects of government, their relationships and their ordering in space and time; the <italic>techne</italic> of government, that is, all strategies, procedures, means, mechanisms, instruments, tactics, physical technologies, modes of calculation and so on which render reality a governable entity and act on it accordingly; the <italic>episteme</italic>, which makes it possible to underpin these techniques with forms of knowledge and provides the overall logic of government; and <italic>identities</italic>, which offer the subject positions and technologies of the self-governing individual. This framework has become a prominent point of reference within the governmentality literature (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1354066111415300">Rose et al., 2006</xref>), and also provides the basis for the empirical analysis of this article.</p>
<p>Abstracting from the narrow institutions of the state promises a way of overcoming the state-centrism of International Relations. In the same way as the state has been governmentalized, it could be argued that the increasing globalization and transnationalization of international relations can be seen as a governmentalization of world politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1354066111415300">Neumann and Sending, 2007</xref>): an emerging realm of overlapping and interlocking regimes of practice criss-crossing and undermining national boundaries. Consequently, there is a growing body of literature concerned with the application of the governmentality concept to what is traditionally known as the international (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354066111415300">Death, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1354066111415300">Lipschutz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1354066111415300">Merlingen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1354066111415300">Neumann and Sending, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1354066111415300">Okereke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1354066111415300">Rosenow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1354066111415300">Sending and Neumann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1354066111415300">Walters and Haahr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1354066111415300">White, 2007</xref>). Yet, at the same time, there is increasing concern that the governmentality concept might not be equipped to deal with the specificities of world politics. Put bluntly, this criticism can be summarized in three related points. First, the traditional problem spaces which enabled governmentality to become dominant in Western societies — the ‘population’ and ‘civil society’ — do not exist outside this context. Governmentality can only function in ‘advanced liberal societies’, which is why the international level does not provide the conditions of possibility of a genuinely <italic>global</italic> governmentality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354066111415300">Chandler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354066111415300">Joseph, 2009</xref>: 413; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1354066111415300">Selby, 2007</xref>: 336). Instead, second, the international sphere is still mostly characterized by state sovereignty and proves to be ‘uneven’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354066111415300">Joseph, 2010a</xref>: 230), so that ‘if the idea of global governmentality is to have any sort of meaning then it should be redefined as techniques aimed at regulating the behaviour of states and governments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354066111415300">Joseph, 2009</xref>: 427). In this sense, there could perhaps be an <italic>international</italic>, but definitely not a genuinely <italic>global</italic>, governmentality. In sum, third, attempts to establish governmental regimes of power in illiberal societies as well as at the global level are likely to fail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354066111415300">Joseph, 2010b</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1354066111415300">6</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section3-1354066111415300">
<title>Refining governmentality</title>
<p>Contrary to these three objections, I contend that there is the possibility of a genuinely global governmentality, although acknowledging that the critique helps to advance the concept in three crucial regards. The first argument concerns the relationship between governmentality and the population or civil society. From the angle of biopolitics, which Foucault developed in his earlier writings and lectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354066111415300">Foucault, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354066111415300">2003</xref>), it comes as no surprise that he strongly connected governmentality to the notion of the population — as this was also the historical context in which pastoral power was secularized — without, however, tightly marrying these two concepts. For one thing, he and others also traced the transformations through liberal and advanced liberal rationalities, which added ‘civil society’, the ‘social’ or the ‘community’ as relevant objects of government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354066111415300">Foucault, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1354066111415300">Rose, 1996</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354066111415300">Dean, 2010</xref>). Moreover, if governmentality is supposed to be essentially tied to a particular problem space, this reproduces an overall bias that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354066111415300">Barry (2001</xref>: 19) detects within governmentality studies: the dominant concern with the government of populations comes at the cost of neglecting other zones of government formed by technological devices and calculations. If <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354066111415300">Foucault (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354066111415300">2008</xref>) argues that the population is not essentially given but was ‘discovered’ through technologies such as census, statistics and the apparatuses of security, there should be no <italic>a priori</italic> reason to rule out that government might apply to other, also artificially created, ‘technological zones’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354066111415300">Barry, 2001</xref>: 25). Contributions from political geography, for example, have shown how practices of governing the ‘national farm’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1354066111415300">Murdoch and Ward, 1997</xref>), the ‘mineral nation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354066111415300">Braun, 2000</xref>), the ‘national forest’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354066111415300">Agrawal, 2005</xref>) or territory in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1354066111415300">Rose-Redwood, 2006</xref>) <italic>created</italic> such calculative spaces and turned them into a basis for the ‘conduct of conduct’. This is a recurrent theme in the ‘green governmentality’ literature, too, which assumes that governmentality itself creates the environment as a thinkable and governable space (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354066111415300">Darier, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1354066111415300">Rutherford, 2007</xref>). This shows that governmentality is not limited to the government of the population <italic>per se</italic>. But the critique rightly points to the fact that a global governmentality in particular cannot easily draw on long-established spaces such as the ‘population’. In other words, it depends on the existence of what can be called a ‘global polity’, which exists when relevant actors become oriented towards a global ‘“governance-object”, that is constructed as real, distinct, malleable and subject to political action’ at the global level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354066111415300">Corry, 2011</xref>: 3). A proper application of the concept to international relations, thus, has to focus on how global governmentality itself constructs this global polity as its appropriate domain.</p>
<p>The second argument concerns the relationship between sovereignty and governmentality. One indeed has to acknowledge that the application of the governmentality framework all too often results in ‘the effective disappearance of the … state’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354066111415300">du Gay and Scott, 2010</xref>: 9). Yet, even from Foucault’s point of view, he who was always eager to avoid a proper engagement with the state (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354066111415300">Foucault, 2008</xref>: 76–77), it is definitely not the case that ‘sovereignty ceased to play a role when the art of government becomes a political science’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354066111415300">Foucault, 2007</xref>: 106). Instead, he speaks of a triangle of sovereignty–discipline–government, and diagnoses a ‘governmentalisation <italic>of</italic> the state’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354066111415300">Foucault, 2007</xref>: 109; own emphasis). Dean’s distinction between regimes of practice and the institutions of governments highlights this point very well: governmental power is exercised by a multiplicity of processes and agencies beyond the state, but this does not preclude them from being used by the state to ‘govern at a distance’. The notion of governmentality is helpful precisely because it cuts across the usual separation of state and society. Therefore, assuming that, a governmentalization of world politics would not imply a <italic>replacement</italic> of sovereignty with government, or a transfer of power from the state to global civil society — as, for example, the global governance literature would assume. Instead, a global governmentality perspective sheds light on the multiple ways through which states seek to use liberal norms, civil society or international organizations as a means to govern at a distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1354066111415300">Neumann and Sending, 2010</xref>: 6). The prevalence of sovereign states at the international level, thus, does not contradict the assumption of a global governmentality, or reduce it to a mechanism for conducting the conduct of states. Global governmentality is not about discovering a new political sphere next to the state, but rather about theorizing the state’s interaction with globalized regimes of practice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1354066111415300">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>One could, therefore, think of governmentality in terms of different layers. Foucault himself did not treat the population as a uniform and coherent problem space but as a culmination of practices on different scales, ranging ‘from the internal conversations one has with oneself about how to act, to urban regulation and conduct, to national policies, to epistemologically abstract knowledge formations and imaginations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354066111415300">Legg, 2005</xref>: 144). He teaches that the art of governing a state is intrinsically related to a governmental rationality of international relations — a case in point being the liberal concern with international competition and the ‘comparative advantage’, which enables certain (national or local) economic policies (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354066111415300">Foucault, 2008</xref>: 52ff.). In this sense, national policies are often cast within the imagination of a global frame, and ‘weave together domestic and international spaces’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354066111415300">Dean, 2010</xref>: 239). Accordingly, if one speaks of a global governmentality, this does not refer to an entity that is restricted to a planetary level, but rather to an interconnected domain of government which spans from the global to the local and manifests at various spatial levels. Therefore, Joseph is indeed right that global governmentality might be directed at the conduct of states. But it comprises much more than that — acting, for example, directly from the global on the local in an advanced liberal way.</p>
<p>The third argument concerns the significance of failure for global governmentality. With regard to the penal system, Foucault famously remarked that if one asks ‘what is served by the failure of the prison’, one would see that the prison ‘is not intended to eliminate offences, but rather to distinguish them, to distribute them, to use them’ and constitute them as a ‘general economy’, which would justify the application of disciplinary power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354066111415300">Foucault, 1977</xref>: 272). The idea of an economy of failure enables us to think about what happens in fact when governmentality fails in its own terms. I contend that governmentality, whether or not it reaches its purported aims, generally results in a depoliticization of the issue area at stake. This can be elucidated by linking governmentality with a ‘post-foundational’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1354066111415300">Marchart, 2007</xref>) understanding of the political. Such an understanding can be derived from recent contributions in political theory drawing on the intellectual roots of poststructuralism. These thinkers stress the fact that the political is not a distinct sphere of society — such as the formal political system — but a latent feature of all social life and a fundamental ontological condition of society. For instance, the post-Gramscian hegemony theory of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1354066111415300">Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe (1985)</xref> assumes that all social facts are radically contingent and discursive in nature. Although, for example, climate change consists of objective and natural processes, it only makes sense to us in terms of discursively constituted representations. And these representations are inherently unstable and depend on the outcomes of discursive struggles. Once a discourse is settled, it excludes some notions and ideas, which gives rise to an antagonistic outside as the necessary <italic>other</italic> of social life. This assumption allows for distinguishing between two layers within society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354066111415300">Laclau, 1990</xref>: 33). The ‘social’ represents the sedimented structures of a given regime of practice which are taken for granted, where a particular discursive representation has become ‘hegemonic’, so that they are not questioned anymore. By contrast, ‘the political’ refers to those areas of social life where this implicitness has dissolved through dislocations. This sphere is marked by contestation, instability and hegemonic struggle, where the discursive <italic>outside</italic> breaks in. In this sense, the political is a latent feature in all areas of social life, which comes to the fore when their implicit foundations are called into question. For instance, the ‘climategate’ affair of November 2009, when thousands of emails leaked from a university server and spurred distrust in the methods of climate science, represents such a moment of dislocation through which the rather sedimented idea of climate change as an objective and man-made process was called into question and the discursive outside (‘climate scepticism’) re-entered the sphere of the political.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1354066111415300">8</xref></sup> From this perspective, politics is not restricted to the parliament or the government, but a latent feature of all social spheres. And, within the space of the political, there are two types of operations: a politicizing treatment of a particular problem brings the underlying antagonisms to the fore, and aims for the transformation of sedimented social structures. Depoliticization, on the contrary, involves all counter-strategies which seek to conceal the contingency of reality, sew the gaps in hegemonic discourses or channel dislocations in a way that fundamental social structures remain untouched.</p>
<p>Such an understanding of the political and depoliticization connects well to the Foucauldian concept of governmental power. Not only do both approaches seek to transcend the narrow institutions of the state in their accounts of power and politics. Governmentality can also be understood as a particular understanding of depoliticization. It is concerned with the ‘right disposition of things’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354066111415300">Foucault, 2007</xref>: 96), which resonates well with the image of a sedimented social setting. Government seeks to manage grievances, problems and demands in a way that the dominant order is not disturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354066111415300">Howarth, 2009</xref>: 321). This forms the heart of the liberal doctrine of government. Ever since the emergence of liberal governmentality, it has been obsessed with not ‘governing too much’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354066111415300">Hindess, 2005</xref>: 394). It is an art of governing as much as it is an art of <italic>not</italic> governing. As Foucault notes, the <italic>dispositives</italic> of security which emerged with governmentality are concerned with ‘organizing circulation, eliminating its dangerous elements, making a division between good and bad circulation, and maximizing the good circulation by diminishing the bad’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354066111415300">Foucault, 2007</xref>: 18). Only when circulation crosses a certain dangerous threshold is governmental intervention necessary. Liberalism, hence, ‘identifies a domain outside “politics”, and seeks to manage it without destroying its existence and autonomy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1354066111415300">Miller and Rose, 2008</xref>: 60). By constituting this domain as an autonomous and ‘natural’ entity and managing its disturbances, governmentality (re)-constitutes its basic social structures and so depoliticizes them. In this sense, the crucial point is not whether global governmentality is effective in its own terms, but rather if it actually brings about a depoliticization in terms of sedimenting social structures.</p>

<title>Governing global warming through the Clean Development Mechanism</title>
<p>The CDM is one of the three ‘flexible mechanisms’ of the Kyoto Protocol, next to Emissions Trading and Joint Implementation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1354066111415300">9</xref></sup> It is a market-based approach — making emission reductions tradable — and works on a project base (for a more detailed overview of the system, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354066111415300">Bumpus and Liverman, 2008</xref>). Project developers, who may be national authorities, business actors, international investors or the like, set up individual greenhouse gas emission projects in a developing country, say a single generator powered by landfill gas. After the project has accomplished a complex registration and validation procedure involving national authorities as well as the international CDM executive board, the amount of abated greenhouse gas emissions is then issued as Certified Emission Reductions (CERs). These are sold to the governments of the developed world, thereby generating extra revenue which makes the project profitable. Through the EU Linking Directive, however, CERs can be injected virtually directly into the European ETS, the world’s biggest carbon market. For instance, a project developer in Manila generates CERs with landfill gas, which she sells to the operator of a coal-fired power plant in North Rhine-Westphalia/Germany, who can in turn stick to burning coal. In this sense, the CDM creates a transnational carbon market.</p>

<title>Visualizing climate change through the global carbon cycle</title>
<p>Climate change is first and foremost visualized as a global problem. Throughout the last 20 years the problem of climate change has spawned a vast multiplicity of private and political practices at various levels. The majority of them have strikingly transcended transnational borders. This goes without, saying for the formal international climate change regime, including the authoritative science of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), runs through transnational city partnerships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354066111415300">Betsill and Bulkeley, 2004</xref>), advocacy groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1354066111415300">Newell, 2008</xref>) or business and civil society activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1354066111415300">Pattberg and Stripple, 2008</xref>), and also applies to the rather individual practices of carbon offsetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1354066111415300">Paterson and Stripple, 2010</xref>). Even those policies that are seemingly situated at the local or national level have strong global linkages, as they are either derived from global arrangements, such as the European ETS, or seek to become transnational, as in the case of subnational trading systems within the US. More often than not, domestic political action is made contingent on the activities of other states, as has been the major political rationale of the Copenhagen Climate Summit. Thus, it seems fair to argue that climate change follows the now long-standing tradition of environmental politics to visualize biospherical depletion as a problem of planetary dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354066111415300">Jasanoff, 2001</xref>). The governmentality literature on climate change, hence, highlights the fact that ‘rendering climate change governable’ takes place on a planetary scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1354066111415300">Oels, 2005</xref>). It is, for example, underpinned by a discourse of ‘green governmentality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1354066111415300">Luke, 1999</xref>), which constructs global warming as an inherently global field of visibility, and extends biopolitics from the care for the population to the management of the entire planet (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354066111415300">Bäckstrand and Lövbrand, 2006</xref>). In this sense, climate politics takes place in a genuinely global polity. If there ever has been such a thing as a governmentality of climate protection, it has been a <italic>global</italic> governmentality.</p>
<p>Establishing governmentality in this global climate polity is enabled by the existence of an appropriate problem space or technological zone: the earth’s carbon cycle. Already when Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius published his path-breaking work on human-induced climate change in 1896, the problem was articulated with reference to the global flows of carbon between the atmosphere and the oceans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1354066111415300">Lövbrand and Stripple, 2006</xref>). Ever since, the climate has been made thinkable in terms of a carbon cycle science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354066111415300">Boyd, 2010</xref>). The development of technologies such as computer modelling, satellite surveillance, glaciology or paleoclimatology enabled the modelling of the earth’s carbon cycle as a vast epistemic field. They allow for ‘precise estimations of the global cycling of carbon’ and ‘turn stocks and flows of carbon into objects of governance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354066111415300">Lövbrand and Stripple, 2011</xref>: 27). Carbon governmentality, however, does not mean that the ‘population’ is entirely replaced with carbon, for governmentality not only focuses on the existence of an appropriate epistemic problem space, but this problem space must also be capable of governing itself in terms of a ‘conduct of conduct’. In other words, the problem space is an object as well as being a subject of government. At first glance, it is difficult to imagine this for an inanimate being such as carbon. In order to achieve this subject–object duality, it is hence necessary to understand the carbon cycle in terms of a coupled human and ecological system. And this is precisely what the ‘earth system governmentality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354066111415300">Lövbrand et al., 2009</xref>: 12), which underpins the government of climate change, actually does. It does not completely replace the population, but rather recodes it in terms of an atmospheric science that combines human and ecological systems. The key epistemic figure that makes it possible to think human life in terms of carbon is that of the ‘carbon footprint’. It integrates individual activities (e.g. flying) and lifestyles into the visible space of the carbon cycle, and can be extended to the impact of firms, communities, NGOs or entire nation states. Governing carbon, in this sense, is also governing <italic>through</italic> carbon.Within this global field of visibility, the state fades into the background, so that sovereignty is embedded in an advanced liberal government at a distance. On the one hand, global climate politics is of course backed up by national sovereignty. Its core is made up of intense international negotiations, which indeed re-territorialize the global atmosphere and bring the nation state back in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1354066111415300">Lövbrand and Stripple, 2006</xref>). For example, the climate negotiations are mostly concerned with assigning national emission reduction targets. Accordingly, neither could the CDM do without the state. It is established by an international treaty, and the CDM board, which carries most of the administration, is composed of national bureaucrats. This, then, could be understood as evidence supporting the claim of an international governmentality, reinstating the state as the main space of government. However, climate politics cannot be sufficiently explained only in terms of sovereign nation states. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354066111415300">Bernstein et al. (2010</xref>: 161), for example, analysing the 2009 climate summit, argue that it is possible to tell a ‘tale of two Copenhagens’: one of failing international negotiations, and one of very vivid transnational carbon markets. They argue that we have to focus on the ‘complexity of interactions between these transnational governance systems and the interstate negotiations’. This demonstrates that the earth’s carbon cycle is increasingly made governable through other calculative spaces such as the ‘carbon market’ or the ‘personal carbon budget’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354066111415300">Lövbrand and Stripple, 2011</xref>). And even the most individual ‘technologies of the self’, such as carbon offsetting or budgeting, can easily spawn from the same field of carbon governmentality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1354066111415300">Paterson and Stripple, 2010</xref>). While it clearly addresses the conduct of states, it is definitely not limited to it.</p>
<p>The CDM is a particularly illustrative example of how the state is only one among many spatial and political levels in global climate governance. The CDM establishes a transnational market, and hands over responsibility for emission reductions to market participants. Climate protection is accomplished in individual projects mostly by private actors. What is more, the CDM does not directly intervene in investment decisions, but merely creates incentives for climate-friendly behaviour. Greenhouse gas abatement remains entirely voluntary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1354066111415300">11</xref></sup> In that it also ‘creates probabilities’ for the particular behaviour of business and public actors, it is a clear example of the conduct of conduct. Being basically a market mechanism, it even achieves this in an advanced liberal way. Once the CDM is set up, the state fades into the background. This is not to say that the state ceases to play a role, but rather that it is embedded in a global carbon governmentality. Rather than acting directly on individuals’ behaviour, it establishes liberal norms at the international level and governs through them ‘at a distance’. For example, the CDM executive board, comprising national diplomats, sets norms about what counts as a proper CDM project. These norms, however, are initiated and animated by mostly private actors on subnational spatial levels. In sum, the CDM creates (and governs) a particular field of visibility connecting decentralized and distinct locales within the globalized space of carbon governmentality. And within this field, the state remains mostly invisible.</p>
<p>Third, this field of visibility results in a depoliticization of climate politics because it makes the structural causes of climate change invisible. Against the backdrop of the notion of the political developed above, the history of climate change is a history of growing dislocation of social structures. Global warming appears as an ever-aggravating and still not sufficiently tackled problem with potentially catastrophic consequences for human civilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1354066111415300">Swyngedouw, 2010</xref>). In recent policy discourses it is even depicted as a dawning apocalypse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1354066111415300">Methmann and Rothe, 2011</xref>). Thereby, it represents the outside of the genuine modern narrative of infinite progress and growth. Decline and scarcity, which had been excluded from the discourses of advanced capitalist societies, return in the figures of pollution, resource depletion and ecological catastrophe. A politicizing take on climate change would draw attention to these fundamental issues: relating continued ecological destruction to the ‘treadmill of production’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1354066111415300">Schnaiberg, 1980</xref>); questioning the ‘carboniferous capitalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1354066111415300">Mumford, 1934</xref>) — the model of fossil fuel-based growth that still overwhelmingly dominates the world economy — as well as other deeply sedimented social practices, such as industrial agriculture, free trade in goods and services, or individual mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1354066111415300">Paterson, 2000</xref>); and highlighting the massive ‘ecological debt’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1354066111415300">Simms, 2005</xref>) of the global North, and its related responsibility for transforming its own societies and bearing the costs of climate change and protection. In sum, a politicizing take on climate change would involve public debate, address social structures and highlight global inequalities. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) of 1992, the origin of the CDM, on the contrary, seeks to prevent these issues being put on the agenda, and instead focuses on an optimal management of the status quo: the administration of existing carbon emissions. And this is precisely the case with carbon governmentality. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1354066111415300">Oels (2012)</xref> argues, it wants ‘good circulation is to be maximised while bad circulation is to be reduced to a “tolerable” level (but not completely eliminated)’. This is even reinforced with the Kyoto Protocol which ‘normalizes’ carbon emissions at a particular legal level, so that ‘economic growth is secured by governmental interventions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1354066111415300">Oels, 2012</xref>). In this sense, the CDM, which only highlights the level of the individual project as well as its embedding in the global carbon cycle, contributes to the depoliticization of climate politics. As the following sections flesh out in more detail, the CDM exercises governmental power in a way that does not touch upon the structural business as usual.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1354066111415300">12</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section6-1354066111415300">
<title>The techne of commensuration</title>
<p>Carbon governmentality, and particularly the CDM, depends on a set of political technologies that constitute a techne of commensuration. This techne consists of two layers, carbonification and marketization. As to the former, it has already been mentioned that the image of a global carbon cycle, which is supposed to encompass human and ecological systems but cannot be seen and perceived as such, depends on the appropriate technological devices in order to make carbon visible. The techne of the global governmentality of climate change consists of ‘apparatuses of security’, monitoring and controlling the earth’s entire carbon cycle and the consequences of its disruption for global ecosystems and patterns of human life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1354066111415300">Oels, 2005</xref>: 200); satellite surveillance, computer modelling, glaciology, monitoring emissions forming a ‘vast machine’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354066111415300">Edwards, 2010</xref>). These technical devices are then used to make a large field of natural (forests, oceans, soil) and social systems comparable in terms of their stocks and flows of carbon and translate them into a global model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354066111415300">Lövbrand and Stripple, 2011</xref>). Also, the CDM heavily depends on such a techne of ‘carbonification’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1354066111415300">Mert, 2009</xref>: 336). Its prime objective is ‘making things the same’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354066111415300">MacKenzie, 2009</xref>): rendering individual projects commensurable with the overall carbon cycle of the earth’s climatic system. It allows for comparing projects focusing on different types of greenhouse gases by translating them into the common reference of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO<sub>2</sub>e). Making things comparable through carbonification, however, implies that this process of carbonification is not a passive act of measuring what is out there, but an active and contingent construction of carbon equivalents. Only such an operation makes it possible to connect the different spatial levels of carbon governmentality (individual footprints, national sinks and transnational markets) to the overall space of the global carbon cycle.</p>
<p>The second layer of commensuration is marketization, that is, expressing these projects in the language of the market in order to make them temporally and spatially (that is, globally) exchangeable. Carbon governmentality is inherently linked to market mechanisms. For example, both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354066111415300">Bäckstrand and Lövbrand (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1354066111415300">Oels (2005)</xref> detect a discourse of ‘ecological modernization’ within international climate politics which expresses climate change in economic terms. While carbonification measures, calculates and visualizes the climate as a governable space, ecological modernization provides the ‘blueprint for action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354066111415300">Bäckstrand and Lövbrand, 2006</xref>). It draws extensively on the advanced liberal ‘technologies of agency and performance’ in that it establishes markets, voluntary commitments, benchmarking and reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1354066111415300">Oels, 2005</xref>: 200); hence the priority given to the implementation of carbon trading schemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354066111415300">Bernstein et al., 2010</xref>). In this sense, carbon governmentality not only creates a global space for government, it also makes it possible to achieve this government in an advanced liberal way.</p>
<p>The same type of operation constitutes the second core technique of the CDM: the trading of emission reductions across time and space. In a sense, one could say that this marketization represents a second-order commensuration: while carbonification allows for making different types of emission reduction technologies comparable, marketization abstracts from their temporal and spatial dispersion. Eventually, CERs become the ‘commodity form’ of climate protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354066111415300">Bumpus and Liverman, 2008</xref>: 136). They commensurate the mostly fossil fuel-related carbon emissions in the North with a ‘gigantic variety of projects in the global South’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1354066111415300">Lohmann, 2009</xref>: 505). Putting a uniform price on carbon emissions and emission reductions allows for comparing two such diverse things as the replacement of a power plant or the reforestation of degraded woodlands. Again, this is a highly artificial equivalence, as there is no essential likeness of a eucalyptus plantation and a coal-fired power plant. It is a deliberate governmental strategy to make these things the same. Together, the two types of commensuration allow for connecting local projects within a global space, and governing them at a distance.</p>
<p>Not only does the techne of commensuration integrate individual CDM projects into carbon governmentality, it also results in a remarkable depoliticization of climate politics, for carbonification has to exclude a vast array of aspects from its calculations in order to be feasible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1354066111415300">Stephan, 2010a</xref>: 14), and this leads to the exclusion of important structural issues. For one thing, a crucial element not considered in carbonification and marketization is the question of innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1354066111415300">Lohmann, 2009</xref>: 507). Carbonification does not measure the structural impact of an emissions reduction project, although planting a forest or implementing solar power generators will differ regarding further CO<sub>2</sub> emissions beyond the single project. The latter, for instance, might stimulate innovation in solar power generation, which in turn spurs the implementation of this technology, while a forest may degrade later on. In a similar vein, carbon prices can increase path dependency of existing social and economic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1354066111415300">Lohmann, 2009</xref>: 506). For example, the CDM creates an incentive to focus on cost-efficient projects which immediately deliver large amounts of CERs — the low-hanging fruits — while much more fundamental changes would be necessary. Their initial costs are much higher, though (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354066111415300">Driesen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1354066111415300">Prins and Rayner, 2007</xref>). Carbonification and marketization, therefore, disregard the impact of individual projects on wider social structures. And this is mostly due to the fact that these effects can hardly be measured in terms of carbon emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1354066111415300">Spash, 2010</xref>: 176).</p>
<p>It, therefore, comes as no surprise that important socio-economic structures are often disregarded in real-world CDM projects. First of all, they ignore social and environmental side-effects of project development. A case in point are hydroelectric dams. The CDM does not account for the social consequences, often involving the large-scale displacement of local populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354066111415300">Gilbertson and Reyes, 2009</xref>: 57), as well as environmental side-effects, such as decomposition-related methane emissions, which can even exceed the purported mitigation of carbon emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354066111415300">Graham-Rowe, 2005</xref>). A large share of hydroelectric CDM projects, moreover, violate international standards for dam construction, as these are not sanctioned by CDM application procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354066111415300">Haya, 2007</xref>). Second, CDM projects often focus on narrow carbon emission reductions, but neglect the principle of a long-term sustainable development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1354066111415300">Olsen, 2007</xref>). Third, there is a strong incentive to exclude long-term structural issues and concentrate on short-term fixes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354066111415300">Driesen (2007)</xref>, for example, shows that 61 percent of CDM projects involved the implementation of rather simple end-of-pipe technologies. And these are not only teething troubles. As of September 2009, roughly 75 percent of all CDM CERs were generated through minor technological fixes preventing HFC-23 and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, which are by-products of industrial processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354066111415300">Gilbertson and Reyes, 2009</xref>: 56). In sum, the techne of commensuration, which seeks to abstract carbon emission reductions from their social and economic context in order to make them tradable, in effect leads to the bracketing of this very social and economic context from climate protection decisions — depoliticizing climate change.</p>

<title>The episteme of a ‘future perfect’</title>
<p>Carbon governmentality centres on the assumption that the earth’s carbon cycle can be modelled and predicted on the basis of environmental and geosciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1354066111415300">Oels, 2005</xref>: 200). It is based on the assumption that we can gather enough solid knowledge about natural and social processes that it is possible to predict their future on a planetary scale. This is illustrated by the IPCC’s efforts to calculate global warming with a particular degree of certainty, assess the relative significance of its causes and model the impacts for particular regions and ecosystems. Eventually, the idea of ‘earth system sciences’ puts forth the idea that we can steer the entire planet like a ‘spaceship earth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354066111415300">Lövbrand et al., 2009</xref>). The CDM brings the idea that reality is finally computable and predictable through science down to the individual project level. This is accomplished through the core epistemic figure of ‘additionality’. It is the crucial criterion for a project to be eligible for the CDM, because it assures that a project would not have materialized without additional CER revenues, and that it actually changes the course of carbon emissions. It is crucial to note that this idea is based on ‘counterfactual reasoning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1354066111415300">Lohmann, 2005</xref>: 217–218). In order to know whether a project is additional one has to distinguish it from other, alternative futures. Hence, the CDM episteme revolves around finding out what would have happened otherwise — the ‘baseline’ — and it uses the epistemic devices of carbon governmentality to do so. It goes without saying that this is a highly speculative and contingent practice, but it represents a proper translation of the global episteme to the local project. What is more, the whole idea that carbon emissions can be compensated for without ‘leakage’ — that is, that it is possible to precisely calculate carbon emissions of individual sites and processes both in the North and the South and compensate one for the other — is an illustrative instance of the idea of planetary management. It is the condition of possibility for the CDM to make sense.</p>
<p>The calculative episteme of the CDM, furthermore, is a cause of climate change depoliticization. First, it makes it necessary to present this future ‘not as indeterminate and dependent on political choice … but as singular, determinate and a matter for economic and technical prediction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1354066111415300">Lohmann, 2005</xref>: 217). In general, the calculation of carbon emission scenarios all too often transforms aspects, events and developments which would make it possible to alter these scenarios into ‘technical and methodological uncertainties’, as they are extremely difficult to calculate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1354066111415300">Lövbrand, 2004</xref>: 451). In effect, human choice and actionability, political intervention, resistance, socio-economic transformation — that is, everything outside the actual CDM project — are excluded from the possible array of options. Second and related, the very methodology of counterfactual reasoning excludes fundamental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354066111415300">Lewis, 1973</xref>: 218), since the principle aim of counterfactuals is comparison. Therefore, scenarios cannot differ too much because otherwise one would end up comparing apples and oranges. This leads to a situation in which only two possible futures are left: with and without CDM projects. Both are quite similar, while alternative futures of changed structural conditions, such as patterns of production and consumption, are dismissed. Most of the contentious types of CDM project reflect these epistemic propositions. For example, a growing number of CDM projects in India deal with the introduction of so-called ‘supercritical technology’ in coal-fired power plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354066111415300">Gilbertson and Reyes, 2009</xref>: 57). As of September 2009, there were 15 such projects. The supercritical technology, however, only introduces minor improvements in terms of efficiency. The CDM, therefore, has only a relatively low impact in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the power plant. And the baseline scenario creates a future in which it is taken for granted that coal-fired power plants will be built. It legitimizes sticking to the most carbon-intensive way of generating electricity. Similar tendencies can be observed in CDM projects involving waste management. As of June 2009, 20 incinerators and 110 landfill gas projects have been approved under the CDM, as compared to three composting and no recycling projects, despite the fact that these are environmentally and climatically superior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354066111415300">CDM Watch, 2010</xref>). This is caused by the fact that most business-as-usual scenarios are based on the highly disputable assumption that all future waste is going to be collected and disposed of in simple landfills, releasing large amounts of methane emissions. Compared to this not necessarily realistic worst-case scenario, even the relatively inferior solutions of incineration and landfill gas use appear to be viable solutions to climate change. But they exclude the preferable options of recycling and composting, which in effect narrows the future to a path close to the baseline scenario.</p>
<p>Third, counterfactual reasoning not only linguistically and symbolically creates these dichotomous but similar futures, but bears the tendency to actually reinforce the business-as-usual scenario in practice and turns it into a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more carbon-or greenhouse gas-intensive a national development plan, for instance, is designed, the more possibilities there are to generate carbon reductions to be sold as CERs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1354066111415300">Lohmann, 2005</xref>: 217). Again, this tendency is reflected in actual practices. As one study on projects abating N<sub>2</sub>O from adipic acid production shows, their inclusion in the CDM creates incentives for factory owners to move even more sites of production from the developed into the developing world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1354066111415300">Schneider et al., 2010</xref>). This allows them to register more CDM projects, and generate more CERs. The baseline which assumes that a certain amount of adipic acid is produced in a particular area, is reinforced through new adipic acid factories.</p>
<p>In sum, the episteme of the CDM seems to employ a strategy similar to what Didier Bigo has termed governing the future as ‘future perfect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354066111415300">Bigo, 2007</xref>: 31). By monitoring what is happening today, this course of action is prolonged and extrapolated into the future. The future is already determined and complete, it is already here. And we can only attempt to alter it slightly, as the basic parameters are already fixed. In effect, the CDM simply administers a present which has always-already become our future. This also explains the strong geographical bias of CDM projects, which are mostly implemented in Asia and Latin America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354066111415300">Bumpus and Liverman, 2008</xref>: 144). By its very episteme, the CDM can only apply to regions where a certain form of development is already occurring and can be calculated, shaped, legitimized and governed through the CDM. In this sense, one could say that the CDM normalizes or naturalizes a certain dynamic of development which is supposed to occur anyway.</p>
<p>To be precise here, the geographical bias of the CDM is rather different from Joseph’s claim that global governmentality is impossible due to the ‘uneven’ nature of the international realm. He argues that ‘contemporary forms of governmentality can only usefully be applied to those areas that might be characterized as having an advanced form of liberalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354066111415300">Joseph, 2010a</xref>: 224). He later on clarifies ‘liberalism’ as ‘liberal societies’, and equates this more or less with the existence of a ‘civil society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354066111415300">Joseph, 2010a</xref>: 233ff.). This is different from the developmental dynamic which seems to explain the regional bias within the CDM. For example, Asia and the Pacific account for roughly 80 percent of global CERs, with China alone contributing 68 percent to this share. China can hardly be said to have an advanced liberal society, but is definitely characterized by dynamic socio-economic development. Therefore, uneveness in Joseph’s terms (no liberal society) does not prevent the CDM from being effective. This again underlines the fact that governmentality is not essentially linked to a liberal civil society.</p>

<title>The identities of carbon professionals</title>
<p>Carbon governmentality on the global level presents two types of identity. On the one hand, it creates the idea that global problems need global solutions. Hence, global climate politics is a matter for the heads of state (or, at least, for the national executives), who pursue multilateral negotiations within a big ‘summit theatre’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354066111415300">Death, 2011</xref>). On the other hand though, the epistemic approach to climate change makes it necessary that these global negotiations be guided by sound scientific findings such as the IPCC reports. This gives particular importance to scientists, or experts in general, who provide the knowledge basis for carbon governmentality. It can be argued that ‘politicians’ still trump ‘scientists’, in that, for example, the commitments of the Kyoto Protocol are the outcome of a political bargain, not of a scientific assessment; hence, many scientists criticize the poor performance of the international negotiations. When, however, the CDM translates carbon governmentality to the local level, this hierarchy is reversed. The CDM lives by a multilateral architecture, but addresses individuals as project developers. It is the project, not the national policy, that contributes to climate protection in the first place. And this gives rise to a particular form of subjectivity of local expertocracy, which feeds into the overall depoliticizing nature of the CDM.</p>
<p>The focus on the project as the main subject of climate protection, hence, brings about a set of associated subjectivities. The tremendous technicality of the CDM methodology and application procedure makes sure that projects decisively hinge on the involvement of what could be termed ‘carbon market professionals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1354066111415300">Voß, 2007</xref>: 340). Projects could not be realized without the participation of a broad range of specialized actors: project developers, carbon brokers, investors and global corporations, international organizations such as the World Bank, consultants, lobbyists, and so on. Although the CDM is an international mechanism, it could not do without this vast field of mainly transnational actors on the ground (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354066111415300">Bumpus and Liverman, 2008</xref>: 140, 144). In effect, the CDM ‘treats carbon project sponsors and managers as free agents while implicitly demoting other actors into passive objects of deterministic calculation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1354066111415300">Lohmann, 2005</xref>: 218). It disregards local participation and political debate and is biased towards technical calculation and specialized CDM procedures. This, in turn, might help to ‘neutralise and hence legitimise politically charged decisions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1354066111415300">Lövbrand, 2004</xref>: 451). By contrast, local populations and authorities are reduced to rather passive stakeholders, spectators and bystanders. They become the object of scenario-building and calculation — for example through mandatory consultation procedures — but do not have an active role to play in the development of the project. And even if they might have managed a particular natural resource such as an ancient forest for a long time, this achievement cannot be accounted for unless it is turned into a CDM project, which is impossible without the carbon professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354066111415300">Bachram, 2004</xref>: 8). In other words, carbon professionals are the agents of climate protection, while local and national populations and authorities are reduced to objects of CDM procedures.</p>
<p>This tendency characterizes even the probably most favourable types of CDM projects, those involving renewable energy. Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354066111415300">Gilbertson and Reyes (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1354066111415300">Lohmann (2006)</xref> list a remarkable number of renewable energy projects that have spawned conflict at the local level. In most cases, this was due to the fact that projects collided with the basic demands and needs of local populations and livelihoods, which were downplayed throughout the design and registration of the CDM project. A case in point is a large-scale wind power project in the Satara and Supa districts of Maharashra on the Sahyadri Valleys, Western Ghat, India, conducted by the Tata Group. Local villagers lacked information about the project, could not participate in its design and were eventually deprived of their farming land, while the corporation did not keep its promises about employment benefits. It is here that the identities created through the CDM come into effect, favouring project developers, while local people are even depicted as protesting against climate protection.</p>
<p>In this sense, it would be tempting to assume that the CDM only concerns those parts of the developing world that are advanced liberal, the carbon professionals — and so again restricts governmentality to advanced liberal sectors of a society. Yet the CDM not only affects those formally participating in it. As the CDM is so attractive in terms of profitability, whenever actors in the South think about climate protection, it is likely that they do so in terms of the CDM. In this sense, it channels existing efforts to reduce carbon emissions into a particular regime of government. On the other hand, this is not to say that the CDM is entirely hegemonic. There might well be resistance and opposition, and actors might prefer to pursue other policies of climate protection. The CDM, however, imposes a particular distinction between more legitimate forms of governing the climate (those eligible for the CDM) and less legitimate ones (those outside the CDM), and so also affects those who would reject it in that it renders them ‘radicals’ or not pragmatic enough.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The starting point of this article was the growing concern with the notion of global governmentality, which some deem to be unfit to readily travel to international relations. This article used the case of global climate change politics in order to counter such claims, but in a way that sought to advance the concept of global governmentality. It argued that global governmentality can exist to the extent that it can draw on an appropriate global polity — here the climate. And as this is not essentially given, research has to focus on how governmentality itself creates such a polity — here in the form of carbon cycle science and the technologies of carbonification. The article, furthermore, showed that governmentality and sovereignty are not mutually exclusive but that the latter embeds the former so that power is exercised in an advanced liberal way. Implementing carbon markets and making carbon professionals responsible for their effectiveness, thus, represents such an apparent disappearance of the state, which is not to say that it does not play a role anymore. Contrary to a global governance perspective, a Foucauldian perspective does not postulate a transfer of power from state to non-state actors, but that the state (as well as other actors) governs at a distance. In this sense, analysts of global governmentality have to be aware of the interplay of sovereignty and governmentality. The analysis, finally, revealed that the apparent failure of global governmentality is not necessarily a sign of its non-existence. Linking it to a post-foundational understanding of the political, it shows that governmentality often results in the depoliticization of its polity. Accordingly, the obviously failing CDM is very successful in preserving the status quo through, for example, counterfactual reasoning or the abstraction from social structures through carbonification.</p>
<p>Global warming not only informs the governmentality debate; the governmentality concept, vice versa, also helps to better understand the case of climate change. While most of the institutionalist literature is concerned with the genesis and architecture of global climate governance, a Foucauldian perspective sheds light on <italic>how</italic> power works through these institutions (for the merits of a Foucauldian approach to global climate change see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1354066111415300">Okereke et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, understanding the failure of the CDM as a success in depoliticization may enhance our understanding of the poor performance of present-day climate governance. Connecting the literature on climate change governmentality to the concept of depoliticization highlights how its political rationalities, technologies and identities work towards the ‘emptying’ of climate change politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1354066111415300">Methmann, 2010</xref>), which might well be overlooked by other approaches. From this perspective, the failure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could be understood as a systematic feature of carbon governmentality — and also open some space to think beyond carbon governmentality towards the transformation of fundamental social structures.</p>
<p>In this sense, the aim of this piece has been to advance the concept of global government in two ways: strengthening it theoretically in response to its critics, and demonstrating the merits of applying it empirically. This is not to say that climate change is the only issue area which would be able to do so, but that it contains particularly rich evidence to do so. Nor does it mean that global governmentality is ubiquitous. Instead, it implies that global governmentality might be helpful to elucidate some cases, and less helpful for others. In contrast to striving for a thorough ‘theory of governmentality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354066111415300">Joseph, 2010a</xref>: 224, 243), this would probably be a perspective much more compatible with the undogmatic, experimental and open nature of Foucault’s overall intellectual project.</p>

<p>The structure of the Kyoto Protocol divides its parties into two broad camps: Annex I parties (the so-called developed countries) that are obliged to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 2012 by 5.2 percent in total, and the non-Annex I parties (the developing countries) that are not subject to such obligations.

<p>It would, however, be equally wrong to assume that governmentality is always at the service of states. In order to capture the complex relationship between government and the state, Foucault speaks of a triangle of sovereignty, discipline and government (2007: 107).

<p>The example of climate change, which was also before ‘climategate’ far from being completely sedimented, also demonstrates that something is neither completely political nor social.

In order to strengthen the agency perspective in governmentality, it could be promising to further combine governmentality and post-Gramscian hegemony theory — a task which I embark on elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1354066111415300">Methmann, 2010</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>To be precise, the concepts of de/politicization used here, obviously, do not reduce the political to obvious political conflict among states or political parties, but also include the ‘depth’ of the issues under contestation. This clarification is all the more necessary as some observers would probably claim that the climate negotiations are highly politicized given the apparent conflicts between developing and developed nations, the US and the EU, or the US and China. From the perspective employed here, however, these phenomena do not appear as politicization, as they are situated within the rather technocratic framework of the UNFCCC and do not touch upon wider structural issues. For the difference between the two understandings, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1354066111415300">Rothe (2011)</xref>.</p></fn>
