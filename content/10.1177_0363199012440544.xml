<p>Staples’ focus on daughters offers a refreshing perspective on the life-cycle approach so familiar to family history. We have become accustomed to the tripartite division of women into three groups: maid–wife–widow. But all women were daughters, and that relationship is likely to have been relevant throughout their lives, whether they acquired the additional relationship of wife or not.</p>
<p>This investigation of daughters’ inheritance is based on the wills enrolled in the Court of Husting. Staples used Reginald Sharpe’s <italic>Calendar</italic> of the wills, now available at British History Online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.british-history.ac.uk">www.british-history.ac.uk</ext-link>), plus a sample of the originals. The Court of Husting was London’s borough court, which exercised probate jurisdiction for citizens who possessed at least £10 of assets. There were 3,081 wills proved in the period 1300–1500. More than half of testators specified an occupation or status, perhaps not surprising in view of the urban, elite, and gild-based nature of the court’s clientele (citizens had to be members of one of the city’s gilds). The four most frequently occurring occupations that Staples found among the testators were fishmongers, goldsmiths, drapers, mercers and clerks, accounting for 13 percent of all wills (p. 40). When in 1515 the Court of Aldermen set the order of precedence (i.e., the order of wealth) of the gilds, the Mercers were first, and the Drapers, Fishmongers, and Goldsmiths third, fourth, and fifth, respectively. Staples identifies 26 percent of testators as artisans, 19 percent as merchants, 3 percent each as ecclesiastics and professionals, and 2 percent as nobility (p. 40). The range of artisans extended as far down as fripperers and upholders, who were described in John Stow’s 1598 <italic>Survey of London</italic> as they “that solde olde apparell and housholde stuffe.” But even these occupations were a different proposition in late medieval than in Victorian London, when a proliferation of goods had cheapened their resale. The testators in the Court of Husting were by and large the merchant and artisanal elite.</p>
<p>The distinguishing feature of urban property division in the middle ages is that real property held in burgage tenure—unlike freehold—could be disposed of by will. So urban wills contain more bequests of land than rural wills. Although Staples does not specify how many of the 3,081 wills bequeathed real property, she counts 7,160 discrete bequests. Of these, 20 percent were made to daughters and around 27 percent to sons. From the point of view of recipients, 78% of all daughters received some real property, compared with 86% of all sons. Among a much smaller number (3,378) of bequests of movable property, equivalent numbers went to daughters (604) and to sons (605). These are important findings in this particular population of elite urban craftsmen and merchants (and a few of their wives). Staples concludes that parents tried to provide for their daughters as well as their sons, and contrasts the relatively egalitarian division of property in London with a rural preference for primogeniture, or at least a pattern of land to sons and movables to daughters.</p>
<p>She acknowledges that the actual division of property is complicated by the Custom of London, but concludes that “it is still remarkable that Londoners adhered to this custom in practice, showing little or no gender preference” (p. 145). The Custom of London granted one-third of all a man’s property to all his children equally and one-third to his widow, and the remaining third being at his disposition. In the absence of a will, the property would be divided in half along the same lines. This custom is sometimes characterized as particularly generous, but the same division of movables was ecclesiastical law throughout the country at this time (although abolished outside of London in succeeding centuries). The burgage tenure of English boroughs was commonly partible among sons (as opposed to the primogeniture of freehold), and partibility among daughters as well as sons, was “not rare,” according to the last and only compilation of the laws by Mary Bateson in her <italic>English Borough Customs</italic> (1904–1906). The will was an instrument designed to encourage charitable and religious bequests, and became a way to deviate from the devolution of property according to custom. But most people—even wealthy urban male people—did not make a will. The Court of Husting was not the only one in which citizens’ wills could be probated, so there were more than 3,000 made over 200 years. But in a City of perhaps 80,000 people before the Black Death, and 40,000 for the rest of the period, even if only half were citizens, only a small fraction of those dying died testate.</p>
<p>The pattern that Staples observes among the urban elite was certainly dramatically different from aristocratic practice. But the wealth of citizens takes a different form from the wealth of rural dwellers: it tends to consist of much more valuable movable property and less landed property. In a city, land does not have to be preserved in holdings sufficient to support a family by agriculture. The English customary rules of land devolution may not be dissimilar to other northern European countries which stipulated different urban and rural inheritance regimes by law: equal division among all sons and daughters in the city; double shares to sons in the country.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363199012440544">1</xref>
</sup> Whether there was such a marked divergence between the English city and country will need to be examined more closely.</p>
<p>Staples’ egalitarian conclusions are complicated by three factors which are only implicit here. First, quantifying bequests of real property is difficult. Staples categorizes domestic and nondomestic or commercial holdings, but these distinctions are at best ambiguous. A “tenement” merely meant a holding of indeterminate size and use; a “rent” could refer to different things in different contexts. (“Property” is also slippery, and frequently equated here with real estate.) But sons were clearly favored where the testator specifically named “dwellings” (only 381 occurrences, of which 29 percent went to sons and 13 percent to daughters) or “houses” (844 occurrences, of which 27 percent went to sons and 21 percent to daughters) (p. 81). Movable bequests are also difficult to quantify (e.g., “the goods in my chamber”). While Staples distinguishes between types of goods (Domestic, Clothing, Armor, Books, etc.), the second-most frequent category is Unspecified (p. 120). The egalitarian conclusions rest upon the number of bequests, not the content of those bequests.</p>
<p>Second, in the population of children receiving bequests, there are 1,529 daughters and 1,854 sons. This proportion represents an extremely abnormal sex ratio, since there is no evidence that medieval London practiced female infanticide. That disparity immediately tells us that daughters were less likely to receive bequests in these wills than sons. The author suggests that daughters may already have received a marriage portion in lieu of inheritance, and while that is certainly a possibility, it should be borne in mind that married sons would also have received a portion upon marriage, albeit perhaps in the form of a promise of inheritance.</p>
<p>Third, only 12 percent of these wills (361) were made by women (p. 33). This is at the very bottom of the range compared with twenty-three other will studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0363199012440544">2</xref>
</sup> From the appendix listing annual numbers of Husting wills, it can be calculated that the proportion of women’s wills among the total was not constant between 1300 and 1500. At 14 percent through the first half of the fourteenth century, it fell to 10 percent or less for the next 150 years, possibly reflecting the legal dispute over married women’s ability to make a will.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0363199012440544">3</xref>
</sup> The City of York, where Goldberg analyzed just under 2,000 lay wills in the period 1389–1500, saw a similar decline in the relative share of women’s wills over time. But the proportion of wills made by women in York was consistently double the level of that in the Court of Husting, dropping only to 20 percent by 1500.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0363199012440544">4</xref>
</sup> The relatively low incidence of women’s wills casts a question mark over the advantages enjoyed by London daughters.</p>
<p>Like all studies of wills in isolation, this one brings home forcefully the limitations of the source. Wills represent only the testator’s wishes, not the actual division of property. Transfers during the testator’s lifetime, or by entail, or by the Custom of London are obscured. There is no listing of debts, and not all family members are necessarily named. So wills provide partial assets and partial family, and may raise more questions about family transmission of wealth than they can answer.</p>
<p>One of the largest unknowns is marriage transactions, since England lacks surviving marriage contracts. Staples alludes to the use of bequests in the negotiation of daughters’ marriages. Of course inheritance was used to negotiate marriage, but that was as true for sons as for daughters. The economy was maintained by a continual cycle of family formation: inheritance—marriage—inheritance and so on. Wealthy merchant/artisan households were based on a partnership of assets, of labor, and of social networks. If the “medieval ideological structure did not tolerate single female entrepreneurs” (p. 11), nor did it envisage single male entrepreneurs. It would have been virtually impossible for a gild master to take an apprentice without being married. The majority of beneficiaries in wills were not the testators’ children, but their widows—who were themselves daughters. It is quite possible that the bequest a man made to his widow conferred property that she had herself inherited from her parents, either prior to or upon her marriage, or a joint inheritance with her husband after their marriage. All property transmission, to daughters or to sons, was conceived of as contributing to familial welfare, which for most children meant the marital economy, and for some meant monastic contracts.</p>
<p>Staples deals briefly with the subject of work in Chapter 3, which could have been augmented by a closer analysis of the types of goods in those wills itemizing the tools of various trades. Since all of these testators, male and female, were members of one of London’s gilds, their daughters as well as their sons were entitled to membership. While perhaps only 10 percent of all apprentices were girls,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0363199012440544">5</xref>
</sup> as members of the urban elite, they shared a familial work identity which was quite different from the marginal position of poorer women in the labor market.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0363199012440544">6</xref>
</sup> As a distinct and powerful social group, the particular gendered structure of these families deserves closer scrutiny.</p>
