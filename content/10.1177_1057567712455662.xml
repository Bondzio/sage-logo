<italic>Increased Surveillance of Sex Offenders</italic> presents an overview of sex offender behaviors, motivations, typologies, and theoretical understandings of and societal responses for both contemporary America and historically. The book provides readers with a basic understanding of the dynamics of the “sex offender problem” in the United States today, as well as an assessment of one monitoring program that provides, as the book title implies, increased surveillance of sex offenders.</p>
<p>In total, this is a book that may be of value and education for readers who know very little about sex offenders and societal responses to such offenders, other than what they encounter in the mass media. For the academic audience, however, this is a book that should be passed by. The depth, breadth, and organization of the book are unfortunately shallow, narrow, and disjointed. What is presented is all very cursory, with major ideas introduced, elaborated upon for perhaps a couple of sentences, and then discussion moving to a new topic or major concept/issue.  </p>
<p>Perhaps, the most frustrating parts of this book are found in the organization of the presentation. First, with only one exception, the individual chapters are truly stand-alone pieces, with no connections drawn, no relations established, and no flow between chapters. Similarly, even within chapters, there is no apparent logic or reason for the order in which the material is presented, and often a topic simply stops with no expectation that the discussion of a particular concept was complete and another topic is begun. Second, it is not until Chapter 6 that the reader realizes that this is a book reporting on the conduct of original research.  The first five chapters review various literatures, and then at the opening of Chapter 6, the reader is suddenly told that now the author will describe a program (of increased surveillance of sex offenders) and offer an evaluation of the efficacy of that program. With the exception of the title of the book, there is no mention of this fact and no foreshadowing that actual original research is to be presented. Rather, literally out of nowhere, the reader is suddenly jolted into a new way of thinking and a wholly new topic and style of writing.</p>
<p>The book does present interesting overviews of a range of sex offender-related topics. Chapter 1 is a brief overview of statistics on sexual victimization and presentation of definitions for some foundational concepts. Near the end of the chapter, the author discusses a few facts that are specific to New York city, although the reader never receives any guidance on why this jurisdiction is highlighted.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 presents an historical look at changing views on sex and legal changes over time related to sexual activities and offenses. Also presented here are discussions of three identified waves of moral panics regarding sex crimes from American history, as well as brief discussions of how these moral panics lead to legal changes and policy developments.</p>
<p>In Chapter 3, the reader is confronted with very basic overviews of three general theoretical approaches to understanding sexual crimes—biological theories, psychological (including psychoanalytic, social learning, and cognitive behavioral) theories, and feminist theories. After this, the chapter switches focus to brief overviews of a number of clinically based typologies of sex offenders, although the utility and the value of understanding either the typologies or theoretical propositions is never explained.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 focuses on the idea of sex offender recidivism, and it rightly stresses that, generally, sex offenders have low rates of recidivism. The chapter not only provides overviews of a few recidivism studies (although unfortunately it is true only for a few studies, much of the existing literature on the topic is absent) but also discusses problems and challenges in conducting recidivism studies. In addition to recidivism itself, Williams-Taylor addresses a range of risk factors and their relationship to recidivism likelihood for sex offenders. Near the end of the chapter, there are also sections overviewing several risk assessment instruments commonly used with sex offenders and some basics about different treatment approaches that are used today.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 concludes the presentation of background and general information, with a focus on American legal developments of recent years in this area. Most of the major federal laws are introduced, although so briefly that it is hard to grasp the importance of each of these developments. For example, the book covers the Jacob Wetterling Act, Megan’s Law, the Pam Lyncher Act, Jessica’s Law, and the Adam Walsh Act in just less than three pages (and this includes the retelling of the <italic>story</italic> of each event/victim). While the chapter does discuss the argument about a little of the research evaluating efficacy of such laws, it does so very selectively. The chapter then concludes with brief discussions of the theoretical positions behind each of the major legislative initiatives of recent years.</p>
<p>Chapters 6 and 7 consist of the presentation of Williams-Taylor’s original research. Chapter 6 describes the New York program of intensive supervision of sex offenders and a description of the study constructed to evaluate the program. A strength of the book is that the description of the evaluation methods is simple, so that nonacademic audiences can understand what was done, how, and why. The results of the evaluation are presented in Chapter 7, where they are boiled down to the fact that there are no significant differences identified between sex offenders participating in the increased surveillance program and nonparticipants on the issues of sexual, violent, violent sexual, or noncompliance recidivism.</p>
<p>Finally, Chapter 8 attempts to provide a discussion of the policy implications of the study, although these are unfortunately also quite superficial and brief. And, also regrettably, there is no connection to the issues or ideas presented in the first five chapters of the book. The materials that comprise the majority of the text are never connected to the findings or implications of the original research. Instead they are left to stand alone, perhaps or perhaps not to be seen as relevant to the research by readers.</p>
<p>Readers of this review should most certainly note the repeated use of “brief” to describe the discussions presented in <italic>Increased Surveillance of Sex Offenders.</italic> It is certainly a theme of this review and the book. Everything that is presented is brief and rather superficial. The book is disjointed, and it lacks cohesion and explicated relevance. Additionally, it should be noted that for scholars looking to identify a resource for locating sources on any of the myriad issues related to sex offending, and responses to sex offenders, this is not the place to look. There are two reasons for this. First, the book is woefully thin on citations and very selective in those that are cited. And, second, it appears that Williams-Taylor has cited sources that were the place where she learned of an idea or fact, not necessarily the actual source that establishes an idea or fact. For instance, in Chapter 5, she cites a 2006 study by Mustaine et al. as the source for findings that are said to be from research conducted by both the Minnesota Department of Corrections and the Colorado Department of Public Safety. Mustaine and her colleagues did not conduct the studies being discussed, but they did discuss them in their article. Hence, Williams-Taylor must have first learned of these studies in Mustaine et al.’s article and therefore chose to cite the piece, rather than the actual study. Numerous similar examples abound here, where ideas and facts mentioned in the literature reviews of an article are cited to that article, not the actual source.</p>
<p>In summary, <italic>Increased Surveillance of Sex Offenders</italic> is a book that can provide a lay audience with an understanding of the basic lay of the land regarding sex offenders and how society responds to these offenders. But for a reader with any degree of academic sophistication, training, or insight, this book proves to be an inadequate resource.</p>
