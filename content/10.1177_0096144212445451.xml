<abstract>
<p>In the early 1950s, as neighborhoods around the country experienced widespread racial antagonism and white flight, Philadelphia’s West Mount Airy bucked powerful legal and cultural trends to create an institutional mandate toward racial integration. But even as those efforts brought together black and white community leaders under a common goal, there quickly emerged a fundamental disconnect among residents over the meaning of integration; whereas white home owners saw living in an integrated community as a way of legitimizing their identities as liberal, urban Americans, black residents overwhelmingly viewed integration as a means toward achieving a set of very tangible material conditions. At first, this distinction was benign; within two decades, however, the ideological disconnect gave way to a heated battle over the daily experience of integrated living. In the mid-1970s, the growing crisis of crime became the terrain on which battles over local control and racial representation were fought in West Mount Airy.</p>

<p>On June 20, 1975, at the sixth anniversary of National Neighbors, an initiative bringing together racially integrated communities across the country, Eleanor Holmes Norton took the podium as the keynote speaker. In front of a packed ballroom, filled with representatives from dozens of interracial community organizations, the New York commissioner of human rights spoke on the state of racial justice in the United States. “There is a special urgency attached to housing discrimination in America today,” said Norton, “more special than continuing discrimination in unemployment and, despite the harangue and failure of busing in some cities, more special than school desegregation. For housing is the stepchild of civil rights progress in America.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144212445451">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The struggle over residential space lay at the center of America’s fight for racial justice in the latter half of the twentieth century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144212445451">2</xref></sup> While civil rights activists made great strides in effecting change in the public sphere, swift demographic changes in the years following World War II remade neighborhoods into intense battlegrounds. Middle-class African Americans, capitalizing on new economic opportunities and political reforms, had for the first time in large numbers escaped the overcrowding of inner-city ghettoes and tried to make their homes in previously all-white areas. Newly forming community organizations responded with widespread campaigns to “protect” their neighborhoods from black infiltration. Some of these groups transformed their blocks into sites of hostility and violence. In many such urban neighborhoods, integration became known as the period between the first black family moving onto a block, and the last white family moving out.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144212445451">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>To many, this racial transition in northern cities appeared to have exposed the limits of postwar civil rights reform. Patterns of resistance and flight fostered a sense of instability that served to spawn still more resistance and flight. In seemed an unbreakable cycle. Deep-seated hostilities were breaking neighborhoods apart.</p>
<p>Some community groups, however, saw these transitioning neighborhoods as opportunities. Well versed in a sense of postwar political liberalism and not wanting to give into the belief that racial transition necessarily brought about neighborhood decline, small pockets of white home owners set out to maintain their place in the community, while welcoming the new African American families seeking to move in. In the early 1950s, white religious and community leaders in West Mount Airy, one of the first neighborhoods in the country where residents created an institutional mandate toward integration, began to conceive of alternative ways to think about race and residential space.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144212445451">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Through the 1950s and into the next decade, Mount Airy residents saw tangible success stem from their efforts. Though the neighborhood experienced early hints of panic growing out of the rising influx of African American home owners, through swift cultural and institutional intervention, community leaders were able to stabilize property values and curb the flight of white residents as black families continued to purchase homes in the area. In the decades to follow, these integrationist efforts gained momentum in isolated pockets of the northeastern and midwestern United States. Though organizers were never able to effect a mass movement for intentional residential integration, and many of these integrating communities ultimately looked quite similar to those that experienced hostility and flight, throughout the latter half of the twentieth century, the nation saw committed groups of middle-class white liberals working with their African American counterparts to create stability by embracing transition.</p>
<p>But while integration in Mount Airy was a collaborative project, bringing together white and black community leaders who sought a racially diverse, economically stable neighborhood, there emerged a fundamental disconnect among residents over the meaning of integration. By the early 1960s, the efforts undertaken by West Mount Airy Neighbors (WMAN), the community organization that formed to spearhead the integrationist agenda, began to highlight sharp distinctions within the neighborhood over how residents understood and experienced integrated space.</p>
<p>In West Mount Airy, the meaning of integration had become bound by racial identity. For the white members of WMAN, living in an integrated community served to legitimate their identities as liberal, urban Americans. For African American residents, meanwhile, moving into an integrated neighborhood brought with it a set of very tangible conditions—secure investments in property, better schools, safer streets, more reliable municipal services—and a window into the majority white culture with which they were trying to engage.</p>
<p>At first, this disparity, in fact, may have been the reason why integration worked so well in West Mount Airy. For the neighborhood’s white residents, their efforts toward interracial living were contingent on a shared set of values, a common class-based sense of identity. Among white liberals, integration became a careful balance, between this democratic ideal and this economic imperative. In the postwar reimagination of liberalism, where economic welfare had given way to a rights-based agenda and middle-class identity had become the focal point of race-based reform, Mount Airy’s integration project became grounded in notions of middle-class access and equality of opportunity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144212445451">5</xref></sup> This conception of integration worked well with the goals of the upwardly mobile black home buyers moving in, who sought the very economic conditions that this class-based exclusivity required.</p>
<p>Within a decade, however, this ideological disconnect that was so critical to the neighborhood’s early success would give way to a heated battle over the daily experience of living in West Mount Airy. Amid the backdrop of urban deindustrialization and within the context of changing conceptions of racial justice in the United States, black and white residents of West Mount Airy found themselves at odds over the problem of rising crime rates in the region. White community leaders, still committed to integration as a visible representation of their liberal politics, criticized larger city policies that sought to staunch criminal activity by targeting black youth. African American residents, however, many recently infused with a sense of cultural nationalism and self-help but still seeking to protect the material conditions that came with interracial living, condemned the white integrationists for their “soft-on-crime” mentality. In the middle of the 1970s, this crisis over crime became the terrain on which the battle over local control and racial representation was fought in West Mount Airy.</p>
<p>The field of integration studies within historical scholarship is only just emerging amid the established literature on race relations in the postwar era, and much of what does exist is driven largely by a social and cultural analysis of white integrationists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144212445451">6</xref></sup> By bringing into focus the African American experience of residential integration and by highlighting the economic exclusivity that, in many of these neighborhoods, became a necessary precursor to racial inclusivity, this article offers a new dimension to the study of the integrationist agenda. By adding in these new voices and new modes of analysis, this research portrays a neighborhood struggling with the deeper meanings of integrated space, with identity politics and larger institutional, cultural, and structural forces, and with internal resistance to change. In that sense, it speaks directly to the larger historiographical debates over post-WWII urban space. Through this analysis of spatial, racial, and class-based identity formation, it adds new depth to the existing literature on both racial politics and urban neighborhoods in the latter half of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>In the wake of the Second World War, upwardly mobile African Americans began to escape the confines of Philadelphia’s inner-city ghettoes and move into the northwest neighborhoods of Germantown and West Mount Airy. At first, white home owners articulated concerns over the oncoming transition. In 1950, West Mount Airy was home to 18,462 residents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144212445451">7</xref></sup> Outside of the neighborhood’s Sharpnack section, an industrial village that had sprung up in the eighteenth century as a home for domestic workers and was, by the 1890s, known for its densely populated blocks of narrow two-story stucco homes, 98.6 percent of the community’s residents were white.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144212445451">8</xref></sup> Like much of the urban North, Mount Airy residents experienced deep racial anxieties, and worked hard to preserve what they saw as the integrity of their community. With the sudden influx of new African American buyers, they worried that their property values would diminish, that the instability would breed volatility and crime, and that their neighborhood institutions would fall apart. Realtors worked to capitalize on these fears, spreading rumors of mass home sales and projecting intense instability and a pronounced decline in housing values. White home owners grew nervous about the very real potential that, spurred by these unseemly real estate practices, the projections of swift demographic turnover would become reality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144212445451">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the spring of 1953, a group of community leaders from four area religious institutions—the Germantown Jewish Centre, the Summit Presbyterian Church, the Epiphany Episcopal Church, and the Unitarian Church of Germantown—came together as the Church Community Relations Council (CCRC) to begin a conversation about the changing face of their community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0096144212445451">10</xref></sup> The group elected a committee to conduct a study of local and national trends in housing and race relations. By the end of the summer, armed with census data, city charters, religious texts, sociological studies, real estate appraisals, state, federal, and international constitutions, and human relations literature, the group was convinced that they could make their idea of interracial living a reality. Their research, they maintained, provided ample evidence to support the notion that a racially mixed neighborhood was both sustainable and, just maybe, even desirable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0096144212445451">11</xref></sup> The formation of this organized community effort set in motion the creation of West Mount Airy as an intentionally integrated community.</p>
<p>In its statement of principle, “This We Believe about Our Neighborhood,” the CCRC laid out an agenda for Mount Airy’s integration efforts. “Gradually,” the statement read,</p>
<disp-quote><p>Negro families of means are buying homes in the better neighborhoods. Those that are moving into our neighborhood show every evidence of being good neighbors and of keeping their property values up to standard. However, because of the myths and legends of race, the history of segregation and some of the traditional practices of the real estate market, a spirit of fear and panic often seeps into the hearts and minds of many people, causing them to list their house for sale and to run away. This running away is detrimental to the community. It forces too many sales in too short a time. It sometimes depreciates market values and disrupts the pattern of community leadership and neighborhood acquaintance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0096144212445451">12</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>
<p>While West Mount Airy’s efforts toward intentional integration were grounded in the liberal ideals of the mainstream civil rights movement, underlying this work was the fundamental desire of whites to remain in their houses, to maintain their community as a vibrant, economically viable, urban retreat. As such, the CCRC, in setting the institutional tone for the neighborhood’s integration project, sought to craft a careful balance between the economic imperative of middle-class exclusivity and the liberal politics of racial inclusivity.</p>
<p>“People who love good homes, gracious living, a cultural atmosphere, should be encouraged to stay,” the CCRC went on. “People who appreciate and can contribute to such an environment should be encouraged to buy or rent in the neighborhood.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0096144212445451">13</xref></sup> Not wanting to give into the idea that the American Dream had been relocated to newly forming suburbs, the CCRC asserted a message of an elite liberal cosmopolitan urbanity; it was out of this desire to maintain their urban liberalness that community leaders created an affirmative civil rights duty.</p>
<p>The CCRC evoked this dignified middle-class urbanity not as something that white West Mount Airy residents should seek to attain but rather as a truism. “The residents of the neighborhood are known to be people of refinement and culture,” the statement read. “Philadelphia, and Germantown in particular, has traditionally been a community in which democracy, human dignity, and respect for all people have been held in high esteem. The citizens of Germantown are known for their mature, unhurried exercise of good judgment in meeting social issues.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0096144212445451">14</xref></sup> In linking the moral commitment to democracy with the residential self-interest of maintaining the viability of the neighborhood, the CCRC sought to show white Mount Airy home owners the social and cultural value of an integrated community. The council painted interracial living as performative, an outward manifestation of both economic status and liberal politics. As white middle-class families across the nation were seeking refuge in newly constructed homogeneous suburbs, the CCRC attempted to convince its constituents that it was their very financial and social stature that made such a commitment to integration their providence.</p>
<p>At the same time, the CCRC linked this middle-class sensibility with a moral agenda, an international responsibility to uphold the ideals of democracy and human dignity. “Today,” it said, “from all over the world comes a challenge. ‘Show us that democracy in America means dignity and respect for every person regardless of his color, his ancestry, or the manner of his worship. Show us that under your system, people . . . can live together in peace and mutual respect without boundary lines that segregate them by race, color, or religious creed.’ The whole future course of world history may depend on America’s answer to that challenge.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0096144212445451">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scholar Mary Dudziak has argued that the U.S. government painted racial equality as a central component of the nation’s Cold War agenda; to bolster its international image, the country pushed the rhetoric of racial justice to the forefront of American domestic policy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0096144212445451">16</xref></sup> The integrationists of the CCRC, well educated and well versed in the contemporary political and social landscape, justified their actions by grounding them in the Cold War imperative. According to the council, residential racial integration lay at the core of American democracy. By working toward that ideal, the CCRC statement implied, white Mount Airy residents were not only preserving their community but also becoming better Americans.</p>
<p>The WMAN integration project allowed residents to protect their homes and their quality of life, while at the same time living out their mission of equality and justice and spreading it across the globe; it served at once as achieved racial justice and sustainable urban cosmopolitan-ness. As historian Phyllis Palmer writes of Washington, D.C.’s Takoma neighborhood organization, Neighbors’ Inc., which used West Mount Airy as a model in crafting its own integrationist agenda, “instead of a suburban ideal of American as white, homogeneous, suburban, and withdrawn from urban and international dangers, [these interracial neighborhood organizations] presented a normative middle-class image as interracial, cosmopolitan, open-minded, and integrationist.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0096144212445451">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Over the next decade, community leaders in West Mount Airy, reimagining themselves as WMAN, would bridge this rhetorical suasion with concrete, structural interventions geared toward creating a sustainably integrated community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0096144212445451">18</xref></sup> But even as their tactics grew, their founding principles—the calculated balance between liberal interracialism and economic exclusivity—remained central to their agenda.</p>
<p>And in a sense, it was this very message that attracted prospective black home buyers to the community. Northwest Philadelphia had long been known for its diverse housing stock, its high-value property, its array of religious institutions, its tree-lined streets, and its reputable elementary schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0096144212445451">19</xref></sup> By the 1940s, West Mount Airy had also gained a reputation as a socially liberal community. While the region retained its historic roots as a well-to-do retreat from the frenzy of city life, the neighborhood’s white population in the middle of the twentieth century professed a sense of cultural diversity that lent itself to the possibility of tolerance for incoming black families. In the years following World War II, Mount Airy was home to a diverse community of high-achieving white residents. They were well educated, politically oriented, and liberally minded. They were physicians and judges, lawyers and business owners, race relations specialists and longtime activists, acclaimed jazz musicians and established members of the Philadelphia orchestra.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0096144212445451">20</xref></sup> Says Shirley Melvin, who moved to West Mount Airy with her family in 1942 at the age of eighteen, many residents of the neighborhood had experienced working and engaging with African Americans through their professional and social networks, making the prospect of residential integration far less foreign.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0096144212445451">21</xref></sup> With a growing awareness of the character of the community, incoming black families believed that they might find a sense of acceptance among such a diverse, well-connected, and stable community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0096144212445451">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to the 1960 census, the median income for black families in West Mount Airy was $6,323, compared with $4,248 among African Americans in Philadelphia and $5,782 among all Philadelphia residents. In West Mount Airy, 22.7 percent of African Americans were categorized as professional or technical workers, compared with 4.7 percent of black Americans in the city and 9.4 percent of Philadelphia as a whole. Of black families in West Mount Airy, 76.5 percent owned their own homes, compared with 42.9 percent of the black population in the city and 58.7 percent of Philadelphia residents overall.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0096144212445451">23</xref></sup> These families chose West Mount Airy in part because it offered them access to a world of stability and security.</p>
<p>In 1957, the <italic>Philadelphia Tribune</italic>, the city’s largest African American newspaper, declared Germantown (the section of the city where West Mount Airy sits) a racially integrated neighborhood. “Germantown,” the headline read, “Mecca for hundreds of dissatisfied Negro residents of North and South Philadelphia, is now a well-integrated community, according to a <italic>Tribune</italic> survey.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0096144212445451">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>By the middle of the 1960s, the neighborhood was attracting large numbers of prospective African American home buyers as well as local and national black leaders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0096144212445451">25</xref></sup> William Coleman, who would go on to serve as Secretary of Transportation under the Nixon and Ford administrations, owned a home in the 500 block of West Hortter Street. Renowned civil rights activist Rev. Leon Sullivan, who would formulate the Sullivan Principles for U.S. firms operating in South Africa, lived in the area, and Sadie Alexander, the first black woman to serve on a presidential commission—appointed by Truman to his Commission on Human Rights—resided with her husband, Judge Raymond Alexander, in the 700 block of Westview Street.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0096144212445451">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>For many of these black residents, their interest in the community rested as much in the concrete, material advantages that living in West Mount Airy could bring as it did in the democratic ideal of interracial liberalism that WMAN was promoting. To be sure, most black Americans in the decades following the Second World War believed in the pursuit of racial justice, broadly construed. They agreed that a nation predicated on the ideals of equality and democracy would necessarily bring them closer to tangible de facto and de jure civil rights action. Particularly among the country’s black middle class, the equation of racial justice with a philosophy of integration resonated loudly.</p>
<p>As scholar Preston H. II writes, through the 1960s, many black intellectuals and civic professionals viewed the problem of housing as one of equality of access and opportunity. According to Smith, whose research focuses on postwar Chicago, these African Americans pursued a vision of “racial democracy,” subscribing to the belief that racial groups should have proportional access to social goods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0096144212445451">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Focusing on interrace relations, says Smith, these black professionals believed that “affluent blacks should have access to the same housing as affluent whites, [and] working-class and poor blacks should have the same quality housing as working-class and poor whites.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0096144212445451">28</xref></sup> Thus, while not all upwardly mobile African Americans necessarily saw residential integration as their personal goal—in recent years, historians and social scientists have written at length about self-segregated black suburbs, where economically successful black Americans have sought refuge from an integrated public sphere—many certainly subscribed to the ideal of choice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0096144212445451">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>“Assuming that there were safe, sanitary, and pleasant surroundings,” wrote <italic>Pittsburgh Courier</italic> columnist Eric Springer in 1962, “is it not possible that some of us would desire to live in such a neighborhood precisely because we know that people with a similar heritage, common religion, or racial background lived there?” The problem, said Springer, is not when blacks choose to live together, but when society constructs barriers preventing such mobility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0096144212445451">30</xref></sup> Residential integration, then, offered the black middle class the possibility of positive change. Their perception of integration, though, went far beyond this abstract sense of opportunity.</p>
<p>For middle-class African Americans across the country, the prospect of integration offered a fundamental material gain that could not be discounted. An integrated neighborhood meant nicer homes, more stable investments, better schools, safer streets, and more reliable municipal services. Living among whites meant that the larger city government would pay attention.</p>
<p>The <italic>Pittsburgh Courier</italic> highlighted what it termed the “evil” of segregated housing in a January 1957 article. “Negro housing is expensive,” the author wrote. “All experts agree that for a comparable facility, the Negro pays substantially more than whites and he pays it all out of a small annual income.” Segregated housing leads to overcrowding, the article continued. It fosters discrimination. It breeds dilapidation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0096144212445451">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1964, <italic>Courier</italic> columnist Benjamin Mays wrote of the problems of public schools, arguing that integrated housing was a necessary step in the fight for integrated education. Though Mays articulated a call for equal education regardless of racial demographics—“[School boards],” he wrote, “are obligated to see to it that all schools are equally adequate in construction, materials used, and in equipment”—he clearly linked the idea of integration with the promise of tangible social and economic equality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0096144212445451">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>A 1963 study by the National Scholarship Service and Fund for Negro Students reported that African American graduates of segregated schools were outperforming their northern peers in integrated classrooms. Psychologists Kenneth Clark and Lawrence Plotkin, who oversaw the project, noted that these findings were in contrast to the generally held belief about the promise of an integrated learning environment for black students.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0096144212445451">33</xref></sup> Though the report itself was noteworthy for its commentary on integrated education, what is significant here is that such a study was commissioned precisely because of the presumed link between integration and superior conditions. This relationship between integration and the prospect of material gain created a substantial and sustainable pull toward these integrating neighborhoods for African Americans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0096144212445451">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Black residents of West Mount Airy echoed such sentiments. Christopher Edley and his wife moved to the neighborhood from North Philadelphia in the mid-1950s to offer their children a better education. “It is time for my children to begin school,” said Edley’s wife, “and the schools in [my old neighborhood] are inferior, as are all Negro neighborhoods.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0096144212445451">35</xref></sup> An African American man who lived on Sedgwick Street ignored name-calling and snowball attacks when he first moved to the neighborhood because of the stable property investments the community offered. “I had a house I wanted to live in,” he said, “and I was determined to stay in it.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0096144212445451">36</xref></sup> Don and Vivian Black, who settled in West Mount Airy in 1955 also, came to the neighborhood for the secure property values. The couple knew that they could find a friendly white face in the community and felt that the long-standing (and continuing) white presence evidenced the long-term investment potential. The Blacks worked with white local real estate agent Nancy Longstreth and quickly found the place that would become their home for more than fifty years. “I really wanted a fireplace,” Don recalled, “but I liked the house so much that I said, ‘I can forget the fireplace.’”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0096144212445451">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps equally important to this secure investment in home and school was the possibility of a window into a majority white culture. For many black home owners in West Mount Airy, living with whites provided a lens into a mainstream professional culture. According to Ed Henderson, a black engineer who moved to the neighborhood with his family in 1960, the community provided a space for him to educate his children to a white world. “I didn’t want them to be a little cork bobbling in the ocean, not knowing where they came from, where they were, or where they were going,” he would remember.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0096144212445451">38</xref></sup> Henderson believed that by raising his kids in an integrated neighborhood, by teaching them to interact with their white counterparts from an early age, they would be better equipped to negotiate the largely white professional world as adults. His kids would grow up well versed in mainstream white culture, he thought. They would know how to negotiate it, and how to fine success within it. They would get this education on the streets and in the schools. The neighborhood would provide them a sort of orientation, a boot camp for entering into the majority white professional public sphere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0096144212445451">39</xref></sup> For those African Americans who could afford it, residentially integrated space offered them the opportunity to educate themselves and their children to a world of relative privilege and stability.</p>
<p>Recent scholarship has heralded these migrating black families as racial pioneers, staking a personal claim in the civil rights movement and putting their bodies on the line for their ideals. Historian Andrew Wiese, in his compelling work <italic>Places of Their Own</italic>, describes such African Americans as “foot soldiers, . . . black families who had the means to leave the segregated neighborhoods and the nerve to challenge the color line.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0096144212445451">40</xref></sup> Others have explained this phenomenon as an exodus paralleling the archetypical white flight to homogeneous suburbs. As scholar Michael Maly suggests, “[T]he typical pattern went like this: a few middle-class black families, seeking to escape the overcrowded conditions in the segregated zones and to get better housing, would move into a predominantly white neighborhood.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0096144212445451">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>While there undoubtedly existed African Americans who saw it as their ideological mission to pave the way for integrated residential space, many more saw neighborhoods like West Mount Airy as an opportunity to leave the dilapidated conditions of the inner-city ghettoes to which they had previously been bound, and simultaneously to participate in the larger push toward equality. The middle-class African American experience of residential integration in the middle of the twentieth century was not a simplistic assertion of racial justice, nor was it a crude calculation of economic advantage. Just as white integrationists saw the project as a balance between economic viability and racial liberalism, blacks participating in these efforts toward intentional integration did so from a dual recognition of racial justice and material gain.</p>
<p>Initially, these disparate conceptions of integration, in fact, served the community well. White families, proudly displaying their liberal politics by remaining committed to the interracial neighborhood, welcomed in upwardly mobile black home buyers based on a common class-based identity. According to one black Mount Airy resident, who moved to the community in 1951, a white neighbor welcomed her onto the block, exclaiming, “I’m very happy to see nice black folks moving in to get rid of some of these poor whites.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0096144212445451">42</xref></sup> And African Americans, like Don Black and Ed Henderson, believed that this economic exclusivity would function to keep their own property investments secure. Mount Airy’s residents—black and white alike—overwhelmingly saw their neighbors as similarly situated socially and economically, and they believed that these attributes were an intrinsic part of successful residential integration.</p>
<p>Over time, however, this ideological disconnect began to disrupt the lived experience of black and white residents in West Mount Airy. By the middle of the 1970s, amid changing cultural expectations and shifting realities of urban space, the integrationist mission of the neighborhood was called into question.</p>
<p>Across the nation, in the waning decades of the twentieth century, cities were in crisis. Deindustrialization redirected manufacturing jobs from the Northeast and Midwest to the American South, and then out of the country altogether.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0096144212445451">43</xref></sup> Chicago lost one-third of its manufacturing capacity between 1967 and 1977.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0096144212445451">44</xref></sup> The growth of suburbia and the trends toward white flight depleted urban centers of thriving tax bases. In 1970, for the first time in the nation’s history, more Americans were living in suburbs than in cities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0096144212445451">45</xref></sup> Shopping districts dried up and crime rates swelled as gang activity intensified. In Baltimore, downtown retail sales dropped 48 % in Boston, 38 percent. In Detroit, homicide rates rose 345 percent between 1965 and 1974, stabilizing at those heightened levels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0096144212445451">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Philadelphia, particularly in industrial districts at the north end and south end of the city, factories shut their doors, leaving thousands of residents out of work. The middle-class exodus sent public schools into crisis, as funding dipped to record lows. Though the city avoided following in the riotous footsteps of such deindustrializing cities as Detroit and Newark, New Jersey, crime rates soared as the economy plummeted and discontent surged. Even the liberal middle-class enclave of Mount Airy experienced the effects of such turmoil.</p>
<p>In the early 1970s, the neighborhood began to see an upsurge in dilapidated homes, abandoned cars, gang-related violence, and criminal activity. As newly elected WMAN president Edwin Wolf said at a 1971 board meeting, “I think West Mount Airy is in trouble. It is beginning to be beset by those marks of urban decay—the slackening of city services, growing tension between police and community, intensifying conflicts including the use of arms between groups of our young people, deterioration of our schools, and overall, a slow decline in the confidence we have in our public institutions to do the job we require of them.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0096144212445451">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>That same year, WMAN canceled a series of planned open house tours, out of fear that would-be burglars might use the events to scope out properties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0096144212445451">48</xref></sup> The <italic>Chestnut Hill Local</italic> reported that the neighborhood was “locking up.” The growing concern of upheaval prompted families to begin to leave the area. By 1970, West Mount Airy had shrunk to 15,365, losing approximately one-sixth of its population over the previous twenty years. Though the population of home owners in the neighborhood had stabilized at roughly 40 percent black and 60 percent white, only 58 percent of residents lived in the same house in 1970 that they had owned in 1965.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0096144212445451">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>In an attempt to promote community cohesion, WMAN set out to revitalize its then-defunct Block Captain Program. The initiative was modeled after a 1969 effort that appointed neighborhood leaders on each of the area’s two hundred residential streets to serve as the eyes and ears of the community. Block captains were to act as the neighborhood’s cheerleaders, the town watch, the clean-up crew, and the educators.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0096144212445451">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other community leaders worked to issue a response as well, wanting at once to protect the neighborhood and to minimize the possibility of panic and further instability. Residents thought that with this increased attention to crime and its attendant causes, they could stave off the problems of urban decay that were facing Philadelphia and cities across the country. In addition to the block captain program, organizers set off on a neighborhood beautification project and began to focus their energies on engaging local youth. WMAN member Les Persley led a camping trip for neighborhood teens. A local arts center offered use of its facilities to youth in the area, and boys flocked to the basketball courts. A group of high schoolers held bake sales to raise funds for a block newspaper. But while several of these programs saw initial interest, residents soon tired of the commitment necessary to sustain the effort. These discrete projects were not enough to protect the integrated community from the problems facing urban areas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0096144212445451">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>Over the next two years, West Mount Airy saw crime rates continue to creep up. Residents remained uncertain about the viability of the area, and WMAN struggled to maintain a sense of stability. By the middle of the decade, the neighborhood had reached a point of crisis. In the first six months of 1974, Mount Airy saw crime rates jump dramatically from the previous year. Incidents of larceny rose from 499 to 630; homicide, from 9 to 12; and aggravated assault, from 89 to 140. Reports of rape climbed from 18 to 34. Though the actual numbers were relatively low, the percentage increases were pronounced: accounts of larceny were up 26.3 percent; homicide, 33.3 percent; aggravated assault, 57.3 percent; and rape, 88.9 percent. The escalation, particularly of violent crime, sent neighbors into a panic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0096144212445451">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some residents felt that WMAN’s historic approach was inappropriate to the current problems facing the neighborhood. Over the past decade, the organization had worked to craft a calculated balance, supporting the city’s efforts while pursuing a platform of liberal reform. WMAN had tried to address the problems of increased criminal activity and at the same time condemn the erosion of policy–community relations under Frank Rizzo, the nation’s most infamous police-commissioner-turned-mayor. But in 1974, amid growing fears in the neighborhood, a group of Mount Airy residents asserted that the organization’s recent response to the practices of the Philadelphia police force was confounding its agenda and negating the importance of crime prevention.</p>
<p>Throughout this period, Rizzo patrolled the city with a heavy hand. When demonstrations broke out in Philadelphia in 1967 following race riots in Newark and Washington, D.C., Rizzo quickly rounded up the protestors and called on city leaders to pass an emergency proclamation, prohibiting residents from gathering in groups of twelve or more. Over the next few years, Rizzo’s officers would storm black student protests in the city’s Fairmount neighborhood. They would raid the home of several members of the black power organization, Revolutionary Action Movement, and infiltrate the group. Finally, in 1970, in perhaps the most controversial incident in his long career as both a police officer and a politician, Rizzo ordered the arrest and public strip search of several members of the local Black Panther organization, following a bloody week that had seen the killing and wounding of six police officers and several black activists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0096144212445451">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>As an organization, WMAN repeatedly condemned Rizzo’s tactics. Beyond the fact that the commissioner was targeting African American agitators and systematically violating their civil rights, WMAN members believed that Rizzo’s approach was further exacerbating the growing crisis of crime across the city. Police brutality, community leaders argued, served to alienate its victims, making them more suspicious of authority and increasingly frustrated by the established social channels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0096144212445451">54</xref></sup> And within West Mount Airy, the WMAN board said, that suspicion was pitting neighbor against neighbor. “There are incidents by police that are undermining community relations[;] neighbors that were once friends are having neighborhood problems. . . . The forced pressure and violence of the people has changed the attitudes of many people. On the job, in the schools, in the stores, in business, your neighbors, friends, and even relations. The warm friendly feeling is gone.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0096144212445451">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>While WMAN’s statement served to align the neighborhood with a liberal coalition across the city and reaffirm the community’s commitment to racial justice, some Mount Airy residents believed that the agenda was subverting local efforts to protect the neighborhood. In response to what these residents perceived as a soft-on-crime effort, a splinter group emerged in West Mount Airy.</p>
<p>In January 1974, the group called a preliminary meeting at the Germantown Jewish Centre to organize volunteer auto patrols to survey the area and report any suspicious activity to the police.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0096144212445451">56</xref></sup> While local business owners at first reported progress, by the summer the volunteer structure of the new group had weakened, and the leaders of the effort believed that a formal organization was necessary to move forward. According to reports, “these people decided to organize outside the structure of West Mount Airy Neighbors primarily because, over the years, WMAN had been slow and ineffective in trying to deal with youth and crime problems.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0096144212445451">57</xref></sup> Described by the <italic>Chestnut Hill Local</italic> as a group of black men seeking to “give the community, particularly its youth, some attention,” West Mount Airy Action, Inc. (WMAA) quickly focused in on the problem of increased crime in the neighborhood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0096144212445451">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>In reality, WMAA did have some white members. But the predominantly black organization evidenced the continuing and evolving divide in the experience of living in the interracial neighborhood. In the middle of the 1970s, the issue of crime brought together the cultural shift toward racial pride and self-help that by the late 1960s had gained salience among the middle-class African American residents of West Mount Airy with the long-standing disconnect between many of the neighborhood’s white and black residents over the meaning of integrated space. A group of African American home owners in the neighborhood made the decision to organize on their own behalf, to attempt to achieve through their own innovation what WMAN had not been able to do through its traditional organizing tactics.</p>
<p>These black leaders had not moved to Mount Airy to live out an abstract sense of justice. Just as in the early 1960s, they believed that the integrated community could offer them stability and safety, protections from the problems associated with the urban decay of the city’s black ghettoes. If liberal white community leaders were more focused on fighting police brutality than on preserving the neighborhood, these black residents believed, then they would fill the void by safeguarding against criminal activity. In this way, the crisis of crime in the neighborhood became a lens through which black residents could assert their own autonomy; the creation of a new crime prevention program became the battleground for the fight over racial representation and local conrol.</p>
<p>The new organization wasted little time in making its presence known in the community. “There are presently growing problems in West Mount Airy of increasing crime and disruptive youth,” WMAA leaders said in an early report. “Our goal of community crime prevention, in cooperation with existing city and private agencies, will be to reduce the number of active anti-social gangs, and gang members, and to help reverse the rising crime rates in our area.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0096144212445451">59</xref></sup> The fledgling community organization, incorporated as a nonprofit in October 1974, gained the support of the Philadelphia Police Department as the board developed a town watch program to comb the streets and alert officers to any sign of disruption.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0096144212445451">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>As official policy, WMAN endorsed the new institution. On November 27, 1974, the WMAN board adopted a statement of support for the goals and programs set forth in WMAA’s mission. “While we [WMAN] have had many successes in dealing with community problems,” the declaration read, “the problems of anti-social juveniles and an increasing crime rate have frustrated our entire community. We have spent a great deal of time and effort working on the problem and have realized that our organizational resources are insufficient.” WMAN pledged ongoing support and collaboration with WMAA.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0096144212445451">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>By the spring of 1975, though, some members of the WMAN board came together to stage a covert coup of the burgeoning crime fighting group. In early April, WMAA peppered the neighborhood with a flyer publicizing an upcoming meeting. “Don’t Be a Victim!” the announcement read. “Because we believe you love your family, home, and neighborhood, and are concerned about their safety, we are asking you to join us in a well-organized massive and sustaining effort to make our streets safe from the destructive and terrorizing activities of misdirected youth.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0096144212445451">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meeting was to be held at the Germantown Jewish Centre on April 7. On April 6, four members of WMAN, acting independently of the organization and without any institutional authority, printed their own flyer, on WMAN letterhead, and distributed it in the affected area. “Don’t Be a Victim of Scare Tactics!” the response announcement read. “West Mount Airy Action tells us we are in the heart of a high crime area. But are we? The Fourteenth Police District doesn’t think so. WMAA claims to have an answer on April 7. But will they? Are vigilante patrols and funding of repressive programs the answer? West Mount Airy Neighbors thinks not. There are better ways to deal rationally with community concerns of all kinds. WMAN urges you to attend the meeting and counteract this negative approach to our neighborhood.” The flyer was signed by four members of the WMAN leadership, including former executive secretary Ruth Steele and Douglas Gaston, III, board president.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0096144212445451">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following night, a large group of West Mount Airy residents gathered at the synagogue. While the meeting began peacefully, by the end any sense of order had broken down, with representatives of the two dissenting factions screaming at each other from across the room. Community members, unaware of the rising tensions, were shocked by the displays of aggression, and many left believing that the two organizations were butting heads at an institutional level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0096144212445451">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>On April 8, WMAN executive secretary Flora Wolf issued an internal memo to all board members, calling for an emergency meeting. She described the events that had transpired over the previous two days, leading up to the melee at the WMAA meeting. “The quarrel between the two organizations was aired in a noisy, public way,” she wrote, “that cannot fail to lessen our image in the community.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0096144212445451">65</xref></sup> According to Wolf, these renegade actions were threatening to break the organization apart. WMAN had to form a united front on external issues within the community for the long-standing institution to maintain its position as a viable neighborhood clearinghouse. The board had adopted a policy of support with regard to WMAA, said Wolf, and nothing had changed to mitigate that pledge. The WMAN board of directors met on April 14 to issue a unanimous reprimand to President Gaston and the three other offending members.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0096144212445451">66</xref></sup> But the incident, and the attendant fallout, continued to follow the organization.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1975, WMAA applied to the Governor’s Justice Committee for the disbursement of $24,906 in federal funds to help implement its community initiatives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0096144212445451">67</xref></sup> Individual residents of the neighborhood—many with ties to WMAN but acting outside of the bounds of the organization—mounted a campaign to oppose the governmental support, reportedly declaring that the crime prevention group was invoking “unnecessary emotionalism on the issue of public safety in [the] neighborhood.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0096144212445451">68</xref></sup> The critics submitted a petition to the Governor’s Committee on April 23, at which point Judge Harvey Schmidt, chairman of the state’s Community Crime Prevention Committee, called for a community-wide effort to resolve the tension before the funding body would consider the request.</p>
<p>Once again, at first, on an institutional level, WMAN and WMAA worked together to set a series of guidelines for a collaborative relationship between the organizations. But still, individual members of the community protested. On May 8, the Regional Council of the Justice Committee ordered an unprecedented public hearing to allow both sides to defend their positions.</p>
<p>WMAA president Oliver Lancaster began his testimony by addressing the discord in the neighborhood. “Unanimity in a community of 7,000 people is not going to be possible,” he said, “but West Mount Airy Action, Inc. and West Mount Airy Neighbors are growing together.” He went on to describe the ongoing efforts by the two organizations to reach a collaborative coexistence. They had agreed to exchange board representatives, to develop mutual block organizations, to coordinate meeting and event calendars, and to review each other’s work, he told the committee. Having two community organizations could rip the neighborhood apart, said Lancaster. Or, through mutual exchange and innovative partnership, it could make it stronger.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0096144212445451">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>Opponents to the funding enumerated three critiques. First, they said that WMAA had not articulated a concrete strategy with regard to youth. Furthermore, they maintained that the organization could not provide the necessary matching funds. Finally, they asserted that roving WMAA volunteers would cause hostility between police and teenagers. “I have no personal hang-ups about the people in WMAA,” testified WMAN member Edward Simms, “but they’re going to put people in cars driving around and they’re going to see kids—my kids—and think they’re acting suspiciously.” The new organization, Simms and others maintained, would create a culture of fear in the community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0096144212445451">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>Within the context of the urban racial landscape of the mid-1970s, the rhetorical connection that Simms made between the actions of the largely black-led WMAA and a culture of fear called to mind the general sense of anxiety that many white Americans felt toward the black militant movement. As historian William Van Deburg writes, “Black Power spokespersons . . . spoke often of white America’s deep-rooted fear and distrust of power—especially if it was concentrated and under black control.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0096144212445451">71</xref></sup> While Simms’s comment hinted at a sort of institutional turf war between WMAN and WMAA—with some members of WMAN bristling at the prospect of having their authority tempered—his remark also implied a patently racialized conception of localized control.</p>
<p>At the end of the May 8 meeting, the state provisionally approved WMAA’s request for funding, pending the mending of relationships within the neighborhood. Residents feared the fallout from the rising tension. In an anonymous editorial published in the May 22 <italic>Germantown Courier</italic>, one community member called for an end to the hostility. “The bonds between neighbors that made West Mount Airy a vital community must not be allowed to dissolve as a result of recent controversy that divided the neighborhood,” the author wrote. “The people of both factions and all groups must wipe the slate clean and rationally discuss the direction West Mount Airy is to take. It will take all the resources of the community to heal the wounds and find the best answers for everyone concerned. The people of West Mount Airy have worked too hard at making their community a healthy place in which to live, to let their efforts go down the drain in the wake of a single dispute. The fight must be forgotten and brotherhood remembered.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0096144212445451">72</xref></sup> Though such comments did not overtly mention racial strife, the invocation of a sense of “brotherhood” spoke to a return to the postwar integrationist ethos on which the community was built. It seemed to imply a call to the black leaders of WMAA to temper their perceived militancy in the interest of restoring a sense of stability to the neighborhood.</p>
<p>On May 23, WMAA surprised the entire community by withdrawing its request for support. “With 7,000 people living in Mount Airy,” said president Lancaster, “it’s going to be very difficult to stop them from raising objections or circulating petitions. We’re going to resolve the corporation and let it go.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0096144212445451">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>The next day, Lancaster issued a public letter to neighborhood residents, formally declaring the end of WMAA. “In spite of West Mount Airy Neighbors’ enthusiastic expression and actions of support as an organization,” he wrote, “several of our neighbors and members have been very successful in their strategies to destroy the formalizing of fifteen months’ efforts to more ably serve our community with a positive thrust at crime prevention.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0096144212445451">74</xref></sup> Lancaster went on to name individually the WMAN members who had derailed the efforts. “Our board does not wish to be a party to the extension of the disruption and destruction of our community that has been so carefully orchestrated,” he continued. “We love West Mount Airy and because we do, we take immediate steps to de-escalate our efforts, fulfill our contracted obligations, and fade quietly into the night.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0096144212445451">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>The dissolution of WMAA effectively put an end to the institutional struggle for control in West Mount Airy. For WMAN leaders, the episode seemed to legitimate their rightful place as the official clearinghouse of the community and to prove that their time-honored integrationist agenda and governing principles could effectively lead the neighborhood into the waning years of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Throughout the country, once-integrated communities were beginning to tip. Shaker Heights, Ohio, Takoma, D.C., and Oak Park, Illinois, were all witnessing creeping population changes. Gradually, sections of these communities had shifted from intentionally integrated neighborhoods toward middle-class black enclaves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0096144212445451">76</xref></sup> West Mount Airy, though, had managed to avoid this transition, its population equalizing at a ratio of roughly 45-55 black-white.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0096144212445451">77</xref></sup> WMAN leaders believed that the defeat of WMAA proved the success of their own continued vigilance in maintaining community cohesion and racial and economic stability.</p>
<p>In June 1975, Doug Gaston, who had been at the center of the WMAA controversy, stepped down as the WMAN president, following the completion of his term. Chris Van de Velde, a relative newcomer to the community, was elected to fill the role, and many hoped that he would be able to bring closure to the events of that spring. “The time has come to mend the differences that have tested the West Mount Airy community,” wrote a <italic>Germantown Courier</italic> staff writer. “The election of Van de Velde . . . is an encouraging beginning, but he can only be effective with the cooperation of all concerned.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0096144212445451">78</xref></sup> The new president, who arrived with a demonstrated commitment to urban sustainability, sought to usher West Mount Airy into a new era.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0096144212445451">79</xref></sup> He had been drawn to the neighborhood because of the region’s long-standing reputation as an integrated community, and he brought with him a belief that localized community groups like WMAN could serve as the solution to the problems facing American cities.</p>
<p>Van de Velde’s arrival in West Mount Airy coincided with a pressing need to create stability out of communal upheaval. Using the early organizing efforts as a model, the new president set out to reframe the conversation, to cast Mount Airy as a model of an alternative urbanism. The new manifestation of WMAN recast the community as a place for liberal-minded families to make a choice to live intentionally. It did not focus on repairing racial hostilities, nor did it minimize racial difference. As <italic>Philadelphia Inquirer</italic> staff writer wrote in 1979, “[I]f neighboring Chestnut hill is home for the well-to-do, then West Mount Airy is the home of those who could be and, in many cases are, but choose to live differently.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0096144212445451">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>And in a sense, this model worked. WMAN led the neighborhood through the rest of the twentieth century by imploring residents to be active, engaged citizens. With Van de Velde as president, the organization restabilized the community, maintaining its original integrationist intention while seeking out new ways to have a vocal presence in larger city and regional affairs. Scholars and activists continued to look to West Mount Airy as a model of intentional living.</p>
<p>But even as the community served for some as a symbol of racial equality, it remained a site of contradiction. The neighborhood could never reconcile the relationship between racial inclusivity and economic exclusivity, white and black home owners continued to struggle to find common ground in the lived experience of integration, and residents wrestled with how to be a universal model of racial justice in a nation that was increasingly challenging the viability of racial integration. As West Mount Airy moved into a new century, community leaders worked to situate the neighborhood within a growing national conversation over the meaning of integration in a post-civil-rights America.</p>
<p>West Mount Airy, as a site of intense deliberation, offers a unique opportunity to examine the problem of residential integration at the source; neighborhood integrationists made it their mission to understand, interact with, and put into practice the ideals of an integrated society. Community leaders attempted to create and manage integration in the face of the same tensions that existed in many cities across the country. Some of their attempts saw success; others quickly fell apart. As historian Tom Sugrue writes in the epilogue of his recent tome on the northern civil rights experience, “[A]ll the trends that have reshaped the experiences of blacks and whites in the north are visible in microcosm in West Mount Airy.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0096144212445451">81</xref></sup> Taken together, what residents and civic leaders experienced here mirrored the struggles that neighborhoods were facing in cities across the country, amid rapidly transitioning demographics and widespread cultural transformation.</p>
<p>In this way, this study of integration in West Mount Airy offers something different from previous studies on residential integration; it examines both the ideal of integration and the fraying of that ideal. This research paints integration not as an utopian project toward racial justice, nor as an epic failure. In this narrative, integration was a project spawned by white and black home owners out of both a concern for sustaining a community and a commitment to a civil rights agenda. By looking at the neighborhood of West Mount Airy, we can see how these two interests came together, and where they were in tension. This research complicates the narratives of integration, of racial justice, and of northern cities, and it contributes to our broader understanding of the dynamics of race, class, and power in postwar America.</p>

<p>This article builds on a wealth of scholarship that has examined the relationship between race and urban residential space in the postwar decades. Much of this existing research has focused on the resegregation of American cities. Scholars such as Arnold Hirsch, Thomas Sugrue, Jonathan Rieder, and James Wolfinger have come together to craft a narrative in which African Americans moving into previously all-white enclaves prompted a racialized struggle over space. In this tale, neighborhoods became sites of violence and antagonism, as clashes mounted over the primacy of private property and individual freedom, and the quest for racial equality. At the same time, the expansion of the housing market into newly forming suburbs afforded middle-class whites the opportunity to escape the prospect of racial interaction and heightened fears of economic downfall among the white working class, whose sole financial viability lay in their homes.

<p>Although during the 1930s, President Roosevelt’s New Deal administration offered a widespread critique of unfettered capitalism and pursued an agenda of redistributive economic policies, by the years surrounding the Second World War, the government had moved away from a class-oriented agenda. As historian Alan Brinkley writes, rather than reimagining the institutions through which capitalism functioned, these policies “would reshape the economic and social environment in which those institutions worked.” Postwar liberal reformers turned from economic transformation to rights-based politics, which placed race relations and equality of opportunity at the center of the national agenda.

<p>Ibid., 133. According to Smith, this “racial democracy” paradigm emerged as the dominant orientation among Chicago’s black professionals during and after the Second World War, in large part because of what he calls “the hegemony of anti-Communist ideology” that was pervasive in postwar American politics. Although the 1930s had seen the prominence of a vision of class-based equality—a paradigm of “social democracy”—the cold war hysteria of the late 1940s and 1950s forced more progressive black Americans to “blunt [the] more radical thrust” and submerge their economic rhetoric to such an extent that it was no longer visible as a separate ideology.

<p>Scholar Gary Orfield, codirector of the National Civil Rights Project, encountered similar results in a longitudinal study examining twenty-five years of African American opinion. In his research, Orfield found that by offering a false choice between education and integration, the majority of his sample selected quality schooling as their primary goal. Such a correlation, says Orfield, existed because superior education was the most salient factor in favoring integration.

<p>In 1959, when WMAN was founded, 14.44 percent of the neighborhood’s home owners were African American. The numbers increased gradually but consistently: by 1966, Mount Airy was 36 percent African American and 64 percent white. According to scholar Leonard Heumann, WMAN worked to attract white buyers to the area to offset the growing trends toward black resettlement in the neighborhood and ensure the stability and sustainability of an integrated community. Though the area experienced a renewed interest from white would-be buyers by 1960, it also saw a marked increase in the number of black home owners. Through 1965, African American buyers dominated the housing market. In 1966, for the first time in sixteen years, West Mount Airy saw white and black sales equalize. Says Heumann, “[L]eaders in the community recognized 1966 as the year that the increase in black buyers began to decline, and all of them feel 1966 was the first year in a continuing trend toward racial stability.” Heumann, “Definition and Analysis,” 145.</p>

<p>Ibid. Historian Matthew Countryman has written about the rise of black power among the black masses in Philadelphia in the years following World War II. Countryman argues that this trend arose out of a sense of frustration over the failed promise of liberalism of the late 1940s and early 1950s. It was not until the late 1960s, however, that this ethos of cultural nationalism began to affect the African American community of West Mount Airy on a large scale.

<p>West Mount Airy stabilized at roughly a 45-55, black-white ratio, and remained as such through the twentieth century.
