<abstract>
<p>This study examined reading performance of 102 Chinese Mandarin-speaking 4th graders in their second language (L2, English) as a function of performance in their first language (L1, Chinese). The results revealed that for Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) and Rapid Alternating Stimulus (RAS) measures, the mean naming time decreased monotonically in high-achieving, average, and low-achieving readers. RAN and RAS differentiated poor readers from good and average readers but failed to differentiate between good and average readers. RAN deficits occurred in poor readers in both languages. Comparison of memory profiles revealed that patterns varied depending on the mode of stimulus presentation or response. Low-achieving readers performed poorly on a subtest involving visual components only and did relatively better on a subtest involving verbal components only. Poor readers in Chinese also encountered difficulties in learning English as a L2. RAN-character accounted for unique variance in two Chinese reading measures. RAN-letter explained unique variance in English mid-term reading grade. The unique variance captured by the Color Span Subtest 1 (visual-visual) was found in Chinese reading comprehension but not in English reading comprehension. Reading performance in L1 was predictive of reading performance in L2 and vice versa.</p>

<p>There has been robust empirical evidence supporting the clinical utility of rapid automatized naming (RAN) in identifying children with reading difficulties, particularly in those who speak English or other similar alphabetic languages. Memory function independent of RAN has also demonstrated its unique contribution to the underlying mechanism of reading difficulties. However, writing systems can be primarily based on morphemes (e.g., Chinese), phonemes (e.g., English), and syllables (e.g., Japanese), thus the relation between the sound and the print that encodes that language might be different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411424209">Coulmas, 1989</xref>). What happens when children are learning to read in two essentially different languages and their reading proficiency in their first language dramatically differs from their proficiency in their second language?</p>
<p>A substantial number of empirical investigations have demonstrated that rapid automatized naming either predicted or was correlated with reading acquisition in alphabetic languages (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022219411424209">Blachman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022219411424209">de Jong &amp; van der Leij, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022219411424209">Manis, Doi, &amp; Bhadha, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022219411424209">Stanovich, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022219411424209">Wagner, Torgesen, &amp; Rashotte, 1994</xref>). The continuous trial of RAN requires the participants to name all presented and highly familiar items consecutively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022219411424209">Denckla, 1999</xref>). The distinctive features of RAN included that RAN tasks discriminated good from poor readers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022219411424209">Bowers, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022219411424209">Bowers, Steffi, &amp; Tate, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0022219411424209">Wolf, Bally, &amp; Morris, 1986</xref>); RAN contributed to independent variances in word reading and reading comprehension and was not a subsidiary component of phonological processing measures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022219411424209">Bowers &amp; Newby-Clarke, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022219411424209">Clarke, Hulme, &amp; Snowling, 2005</xref>); RAN explained variances in both reading fluency and accuracy, but accounted for more variances in the fluency measures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022219411424209">Bowers, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022219411424209">Katzir et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0022219411424209">Young &amp; Bowers, 1995</xref>); alphanumeric RAN (e.g., letters and numbers) overperformed nonalphanumeric RAN (e.g., colors and objects) in relation to reading measures (e.g., reading rate, decoding skills; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022219411424209">Bowey, McGuigan, &amp; Ruschena, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022219411424209">Compton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022219411424209">Meyer, Wood, Hart, &amp; Felton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411424209">Savage &amp; Frederickson, 2005</xref>); and RAN appeared to be language specific with a stronger relationship to reading in orthographically consistent languages (e.g., Dutch and German) than in English (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022219411424209">de Jong &amp; van der Leij, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022219411424209">Mann &amp; Wimmer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022219411424209">Patel, Snowling, &amp; de Jong, 2004</xref>). However, the evidence for the RAN and naming tasks in general differentiating dyslexics and nondyslexics is not consistent. Recent reviews independently conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022219411424209">Savage (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022219411424209">Vukovic and Siegel (2006)</xref> indicated that literature of RAN deficits is often complicated by intercorrelated relations between RAN and other measures such as phonological processing, and both groups advocated further investigation into the independent evidence of automaticity of rapid naming.</p>
<p>Disregarding the various debates regarding what functions are measured by RAN, the predominant theories explaining the relationship between RAN and reading have focused on phonological processing and orthographic processing. RAN has been placed within the domain of phonological processing, alongside phonological awareness and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022219411424209">Wagner et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022219411424209">Wagner, Torgesen, Laughon, Simmons, &amp; Rashotte, 1993</xref>), and RAN deficit has been defined as the deficit of âefficiency of phonological code retrievalâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022219411424209">Vellutino et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022219411424209">Wagner et al., 1993</xref>). RAN is also considered to be connected to reading through orthographic processing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022219411424209">Bowers, Golden, Kennedy, &amp; Young, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022219411424209">Bowers &amp; Wolf, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0022219411424209">Wolf, Bowers, &amp; Biddle, 2000</xref>). Based on the orthographic processing model, RAN deficit prevents the connections between phonemes and orthographic patterns at subword- and word-level representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022219411424209">Ehri, 1992</xref>), limits the quality of orthographic representations in long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022219411424209">Perfetti, 1992</xref>), and increases the amount of repeated practice warranted before an orthographic code is learned as a lexical or sublexical unit and before representations of sufficient quality are achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0022219411424209">Wolf et al., 2000</xref>). The orthographic processing model highlights the value of orthography-to-phonology mapping and memorization, which are particularly important in learning a character language.</p>
<p>With an emphasis on timing, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022219411424209">Denckla (1972)</xref> maintained that RAN deficit was not the dramatic failure to name but was the result of long latencies, a hesitancy termed <italic>lack of automaticity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022219411424209">Denckla, 1972</xref>), which has profound and practical implications for children who acquire the capacity of automatized naming more slowly and also perform tasks tapping into that capacity more slowly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022219411424209">Denckla, 1999</xref>). Instead of focusing on timing, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219411424209">Manis, Seidenberg, and Doi (1999)</xref> emphasized the arbitrary attribution between the symbol and its name, predicting a stronger relationship to reading when reading tasks involved a higher level of arbitrary orthography-to-phonology mapping. Chinese is essentially a character language; the characters form the basic units of the Chinese written system and are logograms: Each symbol represents a semanteme or morpheme (a meaningful unit of language), and one symbol corresponds with one syllable. In comparison to English, Chinese as a nonalphabetic language has a less regular grapheme-phonological relation; thus, pronunciation of Chinese characters makes more demands on rote memorization, which requires children to become facile at making relatively arbitrary associations between print and sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022219411424209">Chow, McBride-Chang, &amp; Burgess, 2005</xref>). As a result, such arbitrary attributions may be particularly important in nonalphabetic languages.</p>
<p>Investigations of rapid naming have examined nonalphabetic languages, such as Japanese (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411424209">Kobayashi, Haynes, Macaruso, Hook, &amp; Kato, 2005</xref>) and Chinese (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022219411424209">Chow et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219411424209">Liao, Georgiou, &amp; Parrila, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022219411424209">Chow and colleagues (2005)</xref> reported that rapid automatized naming skills appeared to be important to concurrent Chinese Cantonese reading and were relatively stable over time. RAN tasks were significant predictors of Chinese character recognition fluency in Grade 2 and of both accuracy and fluency in Grade 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219411424209">Liao et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411424209">Kobayashi and colleagues (2005)</xref> reported that RAN hiragana (Japanese syllabary symbols) and RAN kanji (Japanese morphosyllabic symbols) predicted reading speed in first graders, and RAN hiragana and RAN number were the only significant predictors of reading accuracy and speed in kindergartners. In a study involving 243 Chinese Mandarin-speaking children ranging from Grade 1 to Grade 5, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022219411424209">Ding, Richman, Yang, and Guo (2010)</xref> found that RAN-character emerged as a significant and most consistent predictor over various Chinese reading measures. The findings indicated the importance of morpheme-syllabic RAN tasks in nonalphabetic languages.</p>
<p>In comparison to RAN deficits, memory functions in relation to reading have received relatively less attention. Immediate memory defects aside from a slow rate of rapid naming were considered as significant correlates of reading disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0022219411424209">Wood, Richman, &amp; Eliason, 1989</xref>). The attention addressed to memory functions in reading may be due to the multifactor explanation of reading disabilities, which hypothesizes that reading disabilities may result from a defect of one or more critical subprocesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022219411424209">Mattis, 1978</xref>), deficits in perceptual and/or linguistic skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022219411424209">Fletcher &amp; Satz, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022219411424209">Satz &amp; Morris, 1981</xref>), subtle defects in components of language development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022219411424209">Rourke, Young, &amp; Flewelling, 1971</xref>), and a processing deficiency (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022219411424209">Pirozzolo &amp; Rayner, 1979</xref>). The central role of memory regardless of learning disability subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022219411424209">Torgesen, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022219411424209">1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022219411424209">Vellutino, 1979</xref>) maintains that poor recall in itself may be more important than an identified language or visual-perceptual deficit in a child with a reading disability. The modality-specific sequential memory deficits within either auditory or visual systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022219411424209">D. J. Johnson &amp; Myklebust, 1967</xref>) or memory dysfunctions across modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022219411424209">Senf &amp; Freundl, 1972</xref>) have been suggested as the underlying cognitive correlates of many reading disorders.</p>
<p>In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022219411424209">Lindgren and Richman (1984)</xref> explored immediate memory functions and the memory mediation process in children (ages 8 and 12) with reading disabilities using the <italic>Color Span Test</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022219411424209">Richman &amp; Lindgren, 1978</xref>), which was designed to evaluate intra- and intermodal functions by varying stimulus and response modalities. The differences suggested the differential results (i.e., younger children showed more difficulties) in the relative influence of specific modalities in these children, with an emphasis on the role of intramodal verbal factors across ages. The results, however, should be interpreted with caution given that the children were selected on the basis of a verbal intellectual deficit. Specific memory profiles were identified in three groups of children with different subtypes of reading disabilities depending on the mode of stimulus presentation or response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022219411424209">Lindgren, Richman, &amp; Eliason, 1986</xref>). The findings indicated that it is possible to identify preferred memory strategies, which may have implications for selection of the most appropriate reading instruction for subgroups of children with reading disabilities. A later study involving the use of the <italic>Color Span Test</italic> revealed that three specific reading disability subgroups (i.e., perceptual-motor disorder, verbal disorder-general, and verbal disorder-memory) all performed considerably below normative levels, with better performance on verbally presented items than on visually presented items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0022219411424209">Wood et al., 1989</xref>). When stimuli are visually presented, children with reading disabilities may not consistently utilize verbal mediation strategies for coding or retrieval of visually presented stimuli. Conclusively, these results found that children with reading disabilities experience significant difficulties on tasks of immediate memory and that such difficulties are contingent on the mode of stimulus presentation and response. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022219411424209">Ding and colleagues (2010)</xref> implemented the first empirical study of the <italic>Color Span Test</italic> with Chinese children. The findings revealed that struggling readers performed relatively poorly on subtests involving visual components, whereas a reversal (i.e., better performance on subtests involving visual cues) emerged with good readers. The study confirmed the value of recognizing visual-verbal intermodal processing and visual intramodal functions in Chinese reading. Memorization involving visual components appears particularly important in Chinese reading skills. The findings lead to the question of to what extent the memorization involved in two essentially different languages might differ.</p>
<p>Current literature regarding both rapid automatized naming and immediate memory functions as separate variables in early and intermediate Chinese reading proficiency is limited. In particular, little attention has addressed Chinese Mandarin-speaking children who speak English as a second language (L2) and whose Chinese reading proficiency is far more advanced than their English reading proficiency. Overlap in childrenâs performance on reading tasks across languages is often referred to as <italic>transfer</italic>. One would expect that skill transfer would be more amenable in two alphabetic languages, in comparison to an alphabetic and a nonalphabetic language like Chinese (a character language). The evidence of transfer of reading across alphabetic languages has been demonstrated in numerous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022219411424209">Geva &amp; Siegel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022219411424209">Gholamain &amp; Geva, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022219411424209">Wade-Woolley &amp; Geva, 2000</xref>). Findings are more heterogeneous when the investigations involved children using different writing systems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022219411424209">Gottardo, Yan, Siegel, &amp; Wade-Woolley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022219411424209">Gottardo, Yan, Siegel, &amp; Wade-Woolley, 2001</xref>). A crucial perspective helping to resolve conflicting research in learning of L2 might be the heterogeneous characteristics of childrenâs level of proficiency in each language, relations between two writing systems, and the instructional context of the two languages examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022219411424209">Bialystok, McBride-Chang, &amp; Luk, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on a review of the existing literature, few studies have examined the contribution of RAN and memory functions as separate skills related to reading performance in Chinese speakers who are second-language learners (SLL) of English. The present study posed several investigation hypotheses. First, it was expected that naming time for both RAN and rapid alternating stimulus (RAS) would decrease as a function of group effect in high-achieving, average, and low-achieving reading groups in both first language (L1) and L2. In this study, the terms <italic>high-achieving, average</italic>, and <italic>low-achieving readers</italic> are interchangeable with the terms <italic>good, average</italic>, and <italic>poor readers</italic>. We expected that RAN deficit might occur in both L1 and L2, even if L1 and L2 used different writing systems. Second, it was anticipated that good, average, and poor readers might demonstrate differentiated memory processing patterns on subtests measuring immediate memory functions, with essential differences on measures involving visual components. Third, children with reading difficulties in Chinese might also encounter difficulties in reading of English. Fourth, the predictive powers of RAN subtests might differ in Chinese and English reading measures. Fifth, the predictive powers of the <italic>Color Span Test</italic> might differ in Chinese and English reading measures. Finally, reading performance in L1 might explain unique variances of reading performance in L2 and vice versa.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants were 102 fourth graders in the City of Shantou in Mainland China. The participants were primarily recruited from families with relatively low socioeconomic status (SES) in that city. The children averaged 10.77 years old with a standard deviation of 0.74. Participants were from two classrooms within the same school that maintained the same curriculum and similar class schedules for the two classes. All participants were typically developing children without documented intellectual disabilities or severe mental health diagnoses. It is important to clarify the differences between <italic>bilingualism</italic>, referring to equal fluency in two languages, and <italic>second-language acquisition</italic>, referring to the process of appending a new language to an established system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022219411424209">Bialystok et al., 2005</xref>). The participants recruited were considered second-language learners of English because these children spoke Chinese Mandarin as L1 at school, at home, and in the community and learned English as a required school subject. They had received formal education of Chinese for 4 years and English for 1 year. Unlike many Western countries where a language other than the native language is often taken as an elective subject, the Chinese government mandates that the majority of public schools must provide English classes beginning in fourth grade; thus, English is a mandatory subject taught on a daily basis. All school instruction study was delivered in Chinese, with the exception of English classes. As a result, the participants had to learn both languages, and the participantsâ proficiency in Chinese was far more advanced than their proficiency in English.</p>

<title>Rapid automatized naming and rapid alternating stimulus</title>
<p>The RAN (object and letter) tasks required continuous rapid naming of 50 items of five randomly repeated objects or letters. One Chinese-specific RAN, RAN-character, was constructed based on the RAN test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022219411424209">Denckla &amp; Rudel, 1976</xref>). The RAN-character task in this study consisted of five frequently used characters of âå°º,â âè¡£,â âé£,â âä¹,â and âåºâ to explore the utilization of Chinese-specific RAN tasks. On the one hand, these five stimuli are individual characters. On the other hand, they can be compounded to make complex characters such as è¿, ä¾, æ«, æ± , and ç¡ and can be viewed as essential parts that make up Chinese characters. Five Chinese characters were selected based on high frequency, and all five characters were selected from first-grade textbooks to ensure familiarity and automaticity. The RAS task was designed based on the English version of the RAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0022219411424209">Wolf &amp; Denckla, 2005</xref>), which measured retrieval speed with set switching between 50 items of randomly repeated objects and characters. In addition to rapid naming, RAS required shifting, which tapped into executive functioning and was expected to be challenging for children with reading difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022219411424209">Wolf, 1986</xref>). The participants were asked to read out loud the presented stimuli in order. All RAN and RAS tasks were administered in Chinese except for RAN-letter.</p>

<title>Color Span Test</title>
<p><italic>The Color Span Test</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022219411424209">Richman &amp; Lindgren, 1978</xref>) was administered in Chinese to measure the ability of the participants to retain color names in sequences of increasing length (i.e., from a two-color trial to an eight-color trial). The presentation of the stimuli and the requested responses from the participants varied for each subtest of the <italic>Color Span Test</italic>. The testing materials consisted of three cards (8 Ã 11 inches) with eight color chips arranged in different positions on each card. The cards were alternated on each trial to avoid the use of spatial memory. The design of the cards ensured that no color had the same vertical or horizontal alignments from card to card. The alternation of the alignment minimized the use of spatial cues to aid retention. Colors were used as stimuli to minimize hierarchical groupings or semantic associations that are often associated with digits and words. The test was designed to measure immediate sequential memory based on verbal mediation. The original <italic>Color Span Test</italic> consisted of four subtests involving different stimulus and response combinations, which were visual-visual, visual-verbal, verbal-visual, and verbal-verbal combinations. For this study, only <italic>Subtest 1</italic> (visual-visual) and <italic>Subtest 4</italic> (verbal-verbal) of the <italic>Color Span Test</italic> were administered due to the preliminary findings in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022219411424209">Ding et al. (2010)</xref> showing that normal readers and struggling readers showed larger variances on tasks that involved visual cues only and smaller variances on tasks that involved verbal cues only. For <italic>Subtest 1</italic> (visual-visual), the examiner presented one color card to the child and pointed to a string of color chips arranged in random positions on a card and then asked the examinee to point to the same color chips in the same order on an alternated card that had different positions for the colors. The subtest began with two colors in a string (e.g., blue, yellow) with two trials at the same level. After the child successfully completed both trials with two colors, he or she would be given trials with increasing difficulty (e.g., three-color, four-color). If a child failed both trials at the same level (trials with the same number of colors), the subtest was discontinued. The maximum score possible on this subtest was 14. For <italic>Subtest 4</italic> (verbal-verbal), no color cards were needed. This subtest was similar to a digit span test, except that color names were used instead of digits. The examiner read two color names to the child (at the rate of one name per second) and asked the child to repeat the names in the same order. The same discontinuation rule and the same maximum score possible were applied. The Cronbachâs alpha of the <italic>Color Span Test</italic> was .83.</p>

<title>Chinese passage reading fluency (Chinese PRF)</title>
<p>Participants were required to read aloud a grade-appropriate short story (approximately 250 words in length). These Chinese passages were selected from the standard fourth-grade Chinese textbooks published by The Peopleâs Education Press. The examiner timed the participant and recorded omission and commission errors. WPM (correct words per minute) was calculated after the test. The Peopleâs Education Press is the official government-sponsored publishing agency with a focus on publishing government-mandated textbooks for Chinese elementary and secondary school children. The majority of Chinese school systems use similar textbooks and teaching materials published by the Peopleâs Education Press. Unlike Western countries, standardized and commercially published achievement tests are not commonly used in Chinese school systems, whereas nonstandardized curriculum-based tests are often used, and schools often follow the guidelines and testing samples specified by the Peopleâs Education Press. Thus, we designed testing instruments that were consistent with reading levels specified by the Peopleâs Education Press.</p>

<title>English passage reading fluency (English PRF)</title>
<p>Participants were required to read aloud a grade-appropriate short English story (approximately 50 words in length). The participants were entry-level learners of English, so it was expected that their reading speed in English would be much slower than their Chinese reading speed. The English passages were selected from the standard fourth-grade English textbooks published by The Peopleâs Education Press. The participants were expected to have learned these English stories since the stories were from the standard textbook and the participants were tested at the end of the school year. The examiners timed the participants and recorded omission and commission errors. WPM was calculated after the test.</p>

<title>Other measures</title>
<p>The classroom teacher provided the most recent midterm Chinese and English reading grades for each participant as part of the background information. In the Chinese school system, standardized testing is not used as often as it is in the United States. Instead, each grade often had uniform midterm and final exams, which were closely related to curriculum, to evaluate student progress in general. Thus, such measurements were similar to curriculum-based measurements, which were informative for teachersâ decision making.</p>

<sec id="section11-0022219411424209">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were tested in 20- to 25-minute sessions on the measures described previously. Given that Chinese was the participantsâ primary language and they had been learning English for less than 1 year, their Chinese reading ability was considered a more stable criterion. Based on the performance on Chinese passage reading fluency, students who scored 1 standard deviation at or above the mean were classified as high-achieving readers. Students who scored 1 standard deviation at or below the mean were classified as low-achieving readers. The rest of the students were classified as average readers.</p>

<title>Rapid Automatized Naming and Rapid Alternating Stimulus</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics for all RAN and RAS measures are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022219411424209">Table 1</xref>. For the RAN-object naming task, the mean naming time for the high-achieving, average, and low-achieving groups were 46.02, 51.09, and 59.28 seconds, respectively. The mean naming time for the RAN-letter, RAN-character, and RAS followed a consistent pattern of relatively faster naming speed in high-achieving readers and slower naming speed in low-achieving readers. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the between-group mean differences, with significant differences in naming time for all RAN and RAS tasks. RAS errors occurred more frequently in low-achieving readers in comparison to average and high-achieving readers. However, the standard deviations of the mean differences were fairly large, which indicated that the patterns of RAS errors might be inconsistent in low-achieving readers. Overall, for all RAN and RAS tasks, the mean naming time followed a monotonically decreasing curve in the high-achieving, average, and low-achieving groups.</p>

<title>Correlations of Measures in Two Languages</title>
<p>Partial correlations among rapid naming variables, immediate memory measures, and reading measures for all participants are shown in the lower diagonal of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022219411424209">Table 5</xref>. We calculated these relationships by controlling for childrenâs age as covariates. All RAN and RAS tasks were significantly intercorrelated. Among the three RAN measures (i.e., object, letter, character), RAN-character and RAN-letter had the highest correlation (<italic>r</italic> = .865, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The correlation coefficient between RAN-object and RAN-character (<italic>r</italic> = .765, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) was slightly larger than it was between RAN-object and RAN-letter (<italic>r</italic> = .710, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). RAN and RAS measures were all significantly correlated with Chinese passage reading fluency, Chinese midterm reading grades, and Chinese reading comprehension. RAN and RAS measures were all significantly correlated with English passage reading fluency and midterm reading grades. When the tasks were similar (e.g., Chinese passage reading fluency vs. English passage reading fluency), all of the measures significantly correlated, except Chinese reading comprehension versus English reading comprehension. When the tasks were different, all of the measures were significantly correlated, except for two pairs (e.g., Chinese passage reading error vs. English midterm reading grade, Chinese passage reading error vs. English reading comprehension).</p>

<title>Predictors of Reading Measures</title>
<p>Hierarchical regressions were conducted to determine to what extent the RAN measures and <italic>Color Span Test</italic> measures would explain variability in both Chinese and English reading measures. When Chinese reading measures were the dependent variables, childrenâs age as a control variable was entered in the equation as Step 1. Childrenâs English reading measures, RAN measures, and <italic>Color Span Test</italic> measures were entered in the equation as Step 2, Step 3, and Step 4, respectively. A similar procedure was conducted for English reading measures as dependent variables. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0022219411424209">Tables 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0022219411424209">7</xref> show the final Î² weights for all these tasks. When we examined reading fluency, both English passage reading fluency and RAN-character contributed unique variance to Chinese passage reading fluency. However, only Chinese passage reading fluency contributed unique variance to English passage reading fluency.</p>

<p>A similar set of analyses examined the RAN and <italic>Color Span Test</italic> measures in relation to both L1 and L2 performance on reading comprehension.

The <italic>Color Span Subtest 1</italic> (visual-visual) was found to predict unique variance in the Chinese reading comprehension above RAN measures, indicating the importance of rote memorization as an important source of variability in Chinese reading skills.

<p>Another set of analyses examined the RAN and <italic>Color Span Test</italic> measures in relation to performance on midterm reading exams on both L1 and L2.

The analysis was only conducted for Chinese reading comprehension because the <italic>Color Span Test</italic> was administered in Chinese. The analysis shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0022219411424209">Table 7</xref> indicated that the amount of variance accounted for by RAN-character dropped slightly from 30.6% to 30.3% for Chinese reading comprehension after entering the <italic>Color Span Test</italic> subtests as independent variables. The results did not support the idea of RAN being an indirect measure of working memory, which in turn is intimately involved in reading skills. More interesting, only the <italic>Color Span Subtest 1</italic> (visual-visual) contributed significant variance (7.4%) to Chinese reading comprehension, whereas the <italic>Color Span Subtest 4</italic> (verbal-verbal) had only a marginal contribution (1.7%).

<p>It is important to remember that poor readers in this independent sample should not be considered as children with diagnosed reading disabilities, but those with difficulties in reading fluency and other reading measures. The first finding in this study was the fact that the mean naming time on RAN and RAS subtests decreased monotonically among poor, average, and good readers, concurring with observations of both English readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411424209">Savage &amp; Frederickson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022219411424209">Wigg, Zureich, &amp; Chan, 2000</xref>) and Chinese readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022219411424209">Ding et al., 2010</xref>), who were proficient readers of Chinese and entry-level readers of English. The trajectory of their rapid naming on tasks administered in Chinese (RAN-object, RAN-character, RAS) among good, average, and poor readers was essentially parallel to their performance on tasks administered in English (RAN-letter). An early report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022219411424209">Denckla and Rudel (1976)</xref> indicated that RAN total time is associated with dyslexia, which is not related to intellectual deficits, and that children with dyslexia have slower naming time than good readers on RAN, which is related to reading but does not require reading. In this study, such an explanation is strengthened in the context that these children had advanced proficiency in Chinese reading and had only letter-level or word-level proficiency in English reading; however, RAN deficits occurred consistently in both languages in low-achieving readers regardless of their proficiency level in each language.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0022219411424209">Wolf and Bowers (1999)</xref> previously postulated a theoretical explanation of the complexity of RAN, which requires numerous components of working memory, including supervisory attention, orthographic and phonological codes, and executive coordination of unrelated codes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022219411424209">Amtmann et al. (2007)</xref> considered RAN-letter as a possible measure of the time-sensitive phonological loop because it requires time-sensitive cross-mode integration (orthographical sublexical letter representations and phonological lexical representation of names) and overt articulation of familiar phonological word forms of strings of related letters over the course of many trials. Repeatedly, sustained involvement of the naming of letters is required in the working memory system, which is similar to the reading system that requires the coordination of orthographic and phonological processes over time. Although our analysis of the mediation effect of the <italic>Color Span Test</italic> between RAN and Chinese reading did not support the idea of RAN as an indirect measure of working memory, the importance of memorization standing alone was identified.</p>
<p>The importance of RAN tasks, especially for RAN-character, cannot be fully explained without interpreting some unique characteristics of Chinese. First, Chinese is essentially a logographic script. Chinese compound characters often have the orthographic representations of a phonetic radical of a pool of about 800 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022219411424209">Hoosain, 1991</xref>) and a semantic radical of a pool of about 200 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022219411424209">Shen &amp; Bear, 2000</xref>). However, the phonological cues provided by the phonetic radicals in each Chinese character are relatively unreliable and variable in comparison to phonological cues to assign sounds to English letters embedded in English words. Chinese characters are often recognized by part of or the whole character. Most Chinese characters are introduced and learned in formal education settings because a character cannot be decoded unless the character or part of the character is introduced or taught (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219411424209">Liao et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, rote memorization plays an important role because Chinese characters are assembled by unpronounceable radicals or strokes based on prespecified sequence rules. Because of a less regular grapheme-phonological relation in Chinese, fluent pronunciation of Chinese characters makes high demands on rote memory to the point that children can rapidly make relatively arbitrary associations between print and sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022219411424209">Chow et al., 2005</xref>). This explains the importance of arbitrary attribution in Chinese reading tasks that require higher levels of arbitrary orthography-to-phonology mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219411424209">Manis et al., 1999</xref>). Second, the five RAN-character tasks were all taught by the end of first grade and were overlearned Chinese characters (å°º-ruler/chi3/, è¡£-clothes/yi1/, é£-wind/feng1/, ä¹-too/ye3/, åº-out/chu1/), and each represents one simple morpheme. These simple morphemes can be compounded to make Chinese compound characters (è¿/chi2/, ä¾/yi1/, æ«/feng1/, æ± /chi2/, ç¡/chu3/) with similar or deviated pronunciations and tones. Fast speed in automatizedly recognizing and naming simple morphemes may be essential for readers to recognize and name more complex compound characters at a fast pace. Third, although a direct measure of orthographic processing was not involved in this study, the importance of RAN-character might be explained by the relationship between RAN-character and orthographic processing skills involved in Chinese reading. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219411424209">Liao and colleagues (2008)</xref> reported that RAN tasks shared more variance with orthographic processing in fourth graders than it did in second graders. Skilled Chinese readers do not decode characters primarily by their phonological representations, but gain direct access to the lexicon by orthographic representations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022219411424209">Chen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022219411424209">Ju &amp; Jackson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022219411424209">Shu &amp; Anderson, 1997</xref>). RAN-character might tap into arbitrary orthography-to-phonology mapping, which is essential for Chinese reading.</p>
<p>In addition to having slower RAN speed, poor readers were slower on RAS and made more errors on RAS tasks, which required both rapid automatized naming and inhibition and shifting between familiar visual stimuli. On one hand, RAS requires part of the supervisory (selective) attention that regulates constant shifting among alternating categories (objects and characters). On the other hand, it also requires inhibition, which is the ability to suppress irrelevant information and focus on relevant information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022219411424209">Miyake et al., 2000</xref>). Such shifting and inhibition may contribute to the overall efficiency of verbal working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022219411424209">Gunter, Wagner, &amp; Friederici, 2003</xref>), which is essential in reading. It is important to note that the standard deviation of the RAS errors was fairly large in this study, which partly may be due to the heterogeneity of the poor readers recruited.</p>
<p>All RAN and RAS subtests appeared to differentiate consistently among those with reading difficulties and those without reading difficulties. All subtests failed to differentiate good and average readers. The findings are consistent with the notion of a stronger relationship between RAN tasks and the reading of struggling readers than the reading of fluent readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022219411424209">T. C. Johnston &amp; Kirby, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022219411424209">McBride-Chang &amp; Manis, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022219411424209">Meyer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022219411424209">Scarborough, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0022219411424209">Wagner et al., 1997</xref>). Adequate and fluent readers may have already mastered and surpassed the level of âautomaticityâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022219411424209">Denckla, 1972</xref>) needed for success in more advanced reading tasks such as decoding and comprehension. Thus, such measures did not differ significantly between the average and good readers.</p>
<p>The second finding was related to the measure of immediate memory functions. Children with poor reading skills performed significantly worse on the <italic>Color Span Subtest 1</italic> (visual-visual) than did good and average readers. Such observation is consistent with an earlier report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022219411424209">Van der Meere, Van Baal, and Sergeant (1989)</xref> suggesting that children with learning disabilities presented impaired memory search processes. The low-achieving readers also performed slightly worse on the <italic>Color Span Subtest 4</italic> (verbal-verbal), but the difference was nonsignificant in comparison to the performance of high-achieving and average readers. The results suggest that difficulties in memory processes in poor readers are contingent on the modes of stimulus presentation or response, which confirmed the findings reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022219411424209">Lindgren and colleagues (1986)</xref>. The low-achieving readers performed relatively well on the subtest involving verbal components only but significantly worse on the subtests involving visual presentation and visual-motor responses, concurring with the findings reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022219411424209">Ding et al. (2010)</xref>. Ding et al. reported a reversal (i.e., better performance on subtests involving visual cues and relatively worse performance on subtests involving verbal cues only) in good readers; however, such a reversal was not identified in this sample of good readers. A possible explanation might be related to the essential differences of the participants. Ding et al. recruited students ranging from Grade 1 to Grade 5. This study only recruited fourth graders who had received formal Chinese education for 4 years and had received English education for 1 year. Chinese reading teachers typically begin to emphasize verbal rote memorization of long reading paragraphs in third grade. Thus, by the end of fourth grade, all levels of readers might have had ample opportunity to rote memorize information presented through a verbal modality and are often asked to recite paragraphs from textbooks. Over-practice in daily classroom activities might contribute to relatively better performance by all levels of readers on the <italic>Color Span Subtest 4</italic> (verbal-verbal). The <italic>Color Span Subtest 1</italic> (visual-visual) was a relatively novel task for these children; thus, there was less influence from school practice, and low-achieving readers performed worse than the other readers.</p>
<p>Another interpretation might be the possible use of a verbal mediation strategy in the <italic>Color Span Subtest 1</italic> (visual-visual). Successful examinees might have used verbal labels (e.g., yellow and blue) to generate ânamesâ for the colors that they just saw, and later used the attached ânamesâ as verbal mediation to help them âretrieveâ their memory of the colors that were presented and relocate them in the alternated card. The low-achieving group had particular difficulty on the <italic>Color Span Subtest 1</italic> with a visual stimulus and visual-motor response, suggesting possible difficulties in efficient coding, storage, or retrieval of visual labels; visual-verbal intermodal transfer; and use of verbal mediation (i.e., generating verbal names for the colors). It is also possible that poor readers were less able to implement memory strategies in general and the verbal-verbal task was simpler than the visual-visual task.</p>
<p>The third finding underscores the relative constancy of reading performance regardless of reading proficiency in two essentially different languages. Faster readers in Chinese continued to be faster readers in English. Children with difficulties in Chinese reading measures continued to demonstrate difficulties in English reading measures. The between-group differences were significant for all Chinese and English measures. For English comprehension tasks, we found that these children were barely functioning at a comprehension level on the presented tasks, although these tasks were the simplest tasks adopted from the GORT-4. In other words, both good and poor readers found the English comprehension tasks very difficult (with means ranging from 4.06 to 6.10 out of 15 points). There was a floor effect for the measure of English reading comprehension.</p>
<p>The correlations between RAN and RAS tasks, memory subtests, and reading measures were calculated. As expected, RAN-character and RAN-letter demonstrated the strongest correlation (<italic>r</italic> = .865, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) because they represent the basic units of Chinese or English reading. Although RAN-character may not clearly belong to alphanumeric symbols, it shares more similarities with alphanumeric symbols than with nonalphanumeric symbols such as colors and concrete objects. When reading tasks were similar, all Chinese reading measures and English reading measures were significantly correlated, except for Chinese and English reading comprehension. This might be due to the floor effect for the measure English reading comprehension.</p>
<p>Other findings identified a number of variables that accounted for unique variance in Chinese and English reading measures and indicated some language-specific observation. For reading fluency, English passage reading fluency and RAN-character accounted for unique variance in Chinese reading fluency. Conversely, only Chinese passage reading fluency explained unique variance in English passage reading fluency. For reading comprehension, the English midterm reading grade and the <italic>Color Span Subtest 1</italic> (visual-visual) explained unique variance in Chinese reading comprehension. Conversely, only Chinese passage reading fluency and the Chinese midterm reading grade accounted for unique variance in English reading comprehension, but the <italic>Color Span Subtest 1</italic> (visual-visual) did not. Such differences indicate that memorization is an importance source of variability in Chinese reading skills. For midterm reading grade, the English midterm reading grade and RAN-character explained unique variance in the Chinese midterm reading grade. Conversely, the Chinese midterm reading grade, RAN-character, and RAN-letter explained unique variance in the English midterm reading grade. In short, the findings regarding RAN measures confirmed the predictive power of rapid naming of symbolic information (i.e., RAN-character in Chinese and RAN-letter in English) in both alphabetic and nonalphabetic scripts. Although RAN-letter as a predictor of English reading was not as consistent as RAN-character as a predictor of Chinese reading, it could be due to the fact that this group of participants had received formal English instruction for only 1 year. Thus, their reading performance on L2 might not be as consistent as their performance on L1. The findings regarding the <italic>Color Span Test</italic> indicated the importance of memorization in Chinese reading. The findings pertaining to Chinese and English reading measures highlighted the predictive values of reading skills in the childrenâs L2 (alphabetic orthography) for learning in their L1, even if the orthography of their L1 is nonalphabetic.</p>
<p>Finally, we examined the postulated explanation for the component of working memory involved in RAN in Chinese reading after considering the possible mediation effect of memory tasks by using hierarchical multiple regressions. The amount of variance of RAN-character that accounted for Chinese reading comprehension dropped only slightly after the <italic>Color Span Test</italic> subtest scores were entered into the model. It appears that the <italic>Color Span Test</italic> did not mediate the relationship of RAN-character to Chinese reading. More interesting, only the <italic>Color Span Subtest 1</italic> (visual-visual), which required working memory and changes between modalities, explained unique variance in Chinese reading comprehension. The <italic>Color Span Subtest 4</italic> (verbal-verbal), which only required straight rote memorization of stimuli presented in a verbal modality, did not explain unique variance.</p>

<title>Limitations and Conclusions</title>
<p>This study had a number of limitations. First, our participants were limited to 102 children in one school in the City of Shantou in Mainland China. Children in Mainland China begin learning simplified Chinese coupled with Pinyin (i.e., an alphabetic phonetic system mainly used in Mainland China to represent pronunciation of Chinese characters in Mandarin) in first grade and begin official learning of English in fourth grade. The instructional contexts in Mainland China are essentially different from those in Hong Kong, where children learn traditional Chinese without a phonetic system for pronunciation and begin learning English in first grade or kindergarten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022219411424209">Ho &amp; Bryant, 1997</xref>), and in Taiwan, where children learn traditional Chinese with the Zhu Yin Fu Hao system (i.e., a nonalphabetic phonetic system used in Taiwan to represent pronunciation of Chinese characters in Mandarin) and begin learning English at various grade levels ranging from Grades 3 to 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022219411424209">Huang &amp; Hanley, 1997</xref>). The findings in this study may have limited generalization for SLL children in Hong Kong or Taiwan due to differences in instructional contexts. Second, the English reading comprehension task was considered too challenging for these participants. English instruction in China emphasizes letter, word, and grammar instruction at the early stage of English learning. Thus, these children were unfamiliar with testing items presented in a multiple-choice format for reading comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022219411424209">Hu, 2009</xref>). This limitation also indicates that future investigators should consider instructional contexts and test-taking experiences during instrument development. In addition, the Chinese reading comprehension task had a low reliability. Third, the classification criterion was based on a onetime measure of passage reading fluency in Chinese. An ideal classification should be based on childrenâs performance on reading fluency across multiple measures (e.g., significantly poor fluency for 2 consecutive years). Finally, RAN-character in Chinese might not be equivalent to RAN-letter in English. The equivalent of RAN-character in Chinese would be short words or syllables in English such as CAN, ACT, and RAN. The major challenge of designing a Chinese task equivalent to RAN-letter lies in the fact that the Chinese writing system is not formed by alphabetic letters. Chinese compound characters often comprise a phonetic radical and a semantic radical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022219411424209">Shu &amp; Anderson, 1997</xref>). If a radical is pronounceable, such as å°º in è¿, then that radical can independently serve as a word. The five characters (âå°º,â âè¡£,â âé£,â âä¹,â and âåºâ) used in this study can serve as independent words or morphemes to make up compound characters. If we explore units smaller than Chinese words, such as radicals like âåâ and âäº»,â they are unpronounceable and cannot serve as stimuli for RAN. Such a limitation indicates that absolute equivalence in reading instruments is difficult to obtain when the mechanisms of two writing systems substantially differ from each other. Comparison of RAN-color, RAN-object, and RAN-number might reveal more generality of RAN across scripts.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the findings of this study confirm the importance of rapid naming in both Chinese reading and English reading and complement the literature on L2 learning in early readers. The findings in the present study can be summarized from several aspects. First, the importance of rapid naming is demonstrated not only in alphabetic languages such as English but also in nonalphabetic languages such as Chinese, which is essentially a character language with a less regular grapheme-phonological relation. Naming time decreased as a function of group effect in poor, average, and good readers. However, RAN tasks appeared to differentiate good and poor readers, but lost differential sensitivity in good and average readers. RAN deficits occurred in poor readers in both languages. Second, the essential differences of memory function in good and poor readers involved a mechanism that taps into both working memory and short-term memory. Poor Chinese readers had particular difficulties with tasks that required working memory and visual-visual processing but performed relatively better on verbal-verbal processing. The findings indicate that good and poor readers might utilize different visual strategies and verbal mediation skills during complex intermodality processes. Third, poor readers of L1 also had difficulty with L2. Fourth, RAN-character consistently accounted for variances in Chinese reading measures and RAN-letter accounted for variances in English midterm reading grade. Fifth, the <italic>Color Span Test subtest 1</italic> (visual-visual) accounted for unique variance in Chinese reading comprehension but not in English reading skills, indicating the role of memorization in Chinese reading skills. Finally, reading performance on L1 was predictive of reading performance on L2 and vice versa, indicating the importance of examining cross-language skills, even if L1 is morpheme-syllabic and L2 is alphabetic.</p>
