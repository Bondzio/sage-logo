<abstract>
<p>Web surveys are being increasingly incorporated into national survey data collection programs in the United States because of their cost/time-efficiencies. Yet, response rates and data quality issues in web surveys remain important challenges. As a basic study designed to better understand data quality in a mixed mode national survey, this article investigates the degree to which web versus mail survey modes affect unit and item responses. Findings indicate that the web survey mode produces a lower unit response rate compared to the mail mode. However, the web mode elicits higher data quality in terms of item responses to both closed- and open-ended questions. These mode effects on data quality remain after sociodemographic variables are held constant. Given the increasing integration of web survey questionnaires into mixed mode studies, additional research is necessary to understand and document the processes that underlie mode differences when responding to self-administered surveys.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Web surveys have been increasingly incorporated into national survey data collection programs of which the dominant mode has historically been mail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894439311404508">Couper, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894439311404508">Dillman, Smyth, &amp; Christian, 2009a</xref>, p. 417). However, concerns regarding mode effects in mixed mode surveys have increased as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894439311404508">Börkan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894439311404508">Couper &amp; Miller, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894439311404508">Dillman et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894439311404508">Link &amp; Mokdad, 2006</xref>). Do different self-administered survey modes—web and mail surveys—produce different responses? Can we say that web and mail responses in a mixed mode survey are equivalent? These questions are becoming increasingly critical as mixed mode surveys continue to grow in popularity.</p>
<p>Considerable research has now examined data quality and/or measurement errors related to web surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894439311404508">Couper &amp; Miller, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894439311404508">Dillman et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894439311404508">Heerwegh &amp; Looseveldt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894439311404508">Knapp &amp; Kirk, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894439311404508">Manfreda, Bosnjak, Berzelak, Haas, &amp; Vehovar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894439311404508">Roster, Rogers, Albaurn, &amp; Klein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894439311404508">Schonlau, Asch, &amp; Du, 2003</xref>), and much of this work has been devoted to comparing web and mail surveys in terms of both unit and item response rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894439311404508">Akl, Maroun, Klocke, Montori, &amp; Schunemann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894439311404508">Bandillar, Bosnjak, &amp; Altdorfer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894439311404508">Bech &amp; Kristensen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894439311404508">Beebe, Locke, Barnes, Davern, &amp; Anderson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894439311404508">Börkan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894439311404508">Converse, Wolfe, Huang, &amp; Oswald, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894439311404508">Couper, Blair, &amp; Triplett, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894439311404508">Denscombe, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894439311404508">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894439311404508">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894439311404508">Greenlaw &amp; Brown-Welty, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894439311404508">Kaplowitz, Hadlock, &amp; Levine, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894439311404508">Kwak &amp; Radler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894439311404508">Link &amp; Mokdad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894439311404508">Lorenc, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894439311404508">McCabe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894439311404508">McCabe, Boyd, Couper, Crawford, &amp; d’Arcy, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894439311404508">McCabe, Diez, Boyd, Nelson, &amp; Weitzman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894439311404508">Miller, Kobayashi, Caldwell, Thurston, &amp; Collett, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894439311404508">Schaefer &amp; Dillman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894439311404508">Schonlau et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0894439311404508">Shih &amp; Fan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894439311404508">Wolfe, Converse, &amp; Oswald, 2008</xref>). The findings of these studies have been inconsistent and vary according to target population, survey samples, and administrative designs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0894439311404508">Appendix A</xref>). Considerable variability in unit responses and/or item responses by mode has been reported in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894439311404508">Bech &amp; Kristensen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894439311404508">Denscombe, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894439311404508">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894439311404508">Greenlaw &amp; Brown-Welty, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894439311404508">Grondin &amp; Sun, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894439311404508">Link &amp; Mokdad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894439311404508">Kaplowitz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894439311404508">Kwak &amp; Radler, 2002</xref>), while others have found null mode effects on item responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894439311404508">Akl et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894439311404508">Bandilla et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894439311404508">Börkan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894439311404508">Lorenc, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894439311404508">Miller et al., 2002</xref>) and/or unit response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894439311404508">Akl et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894439311404508">Schaefer &amp; Dillman, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Web surveys, in general, have produced lower unit response rates compared to mail surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894439311404508">Bech &amp; Kristensen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894439311404508">Beebe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894439311404508">Converse et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894439311404508">Couper et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894439311404508">Kaplowitz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894439311404508">Kwak &amp; Radler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894439311404508">Miller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0894439311404508">Shih &amp; Fan, 2008</xref>). A few exceptions, mostly studies of college aged populations and professionals, have reported higher response rates to web compared to mail survey questionnaires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894439311404508">Greenlaw &amp; Brown-Welty, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894439311404508">McCabe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894439311404508">McCabe et al., 2002</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894439311404508">Greenlaw and Brown-Welty (2008)</xref> report a 52% unit response rate for web versus a 42% rate for traditional mail in a study of professional employment in which survey modes were randomly assigned. Other studies of college students and professionals have found no mode differences in unit response rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894439311404508">Akl et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894439311404508">Shaefer &amp; Dillman, 1998</xref>). The variability in these findings across studies likely reflects survey population as well as survey design differences, including survey topics and administrative features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894439311404508">Couper, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894439311404508">Dillman et al., 2009a</xref>).</p>
<p>Data quality in web versus mail surveys is also inconclusive. Several scholars assert that there are no mode effects on item responses rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894439311404508">Akl et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894439311404508">Bandilla et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894439311404508">Börkan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894439311404508">Lorenc, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894439311404508">Miller et al., 2002</xref>), while others report that web surveys produce higher item response rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894439311404508">Denscombe, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894439311404508">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894439311404508">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894439311404508">Kwak &amp; Radler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894439311404508">Schaefer &amp; Dillman, 1998</xref>). The tasks involved in completing a questionnaire vary somewhat for web and mail respondents. For example, while most people have some familiarity with paper questionnaires, responding via web requires some degree of familiarity with computers and their peripherals (such as keyboard and mouse), as well as manual dexterity in webpage navigation and scrolling. However, computer savvy respondents may feel more comfortable when they click or type answers into a computer compared to handwriting in a paper questionnaire. The graphical layouts and interactive electronic applications of web surveys can also encourage respondents to be more engaged in the survey response process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894439311404508">Couper, 2008</xref>). Along these lines, researchers have noted that the graphical layout of a web survey and the ease of typing rather than handwriting may elicit more open-ended responses in web compared to mail questionnaires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894439311404508">Christian &amp; Dillman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894439311404508">Denscombe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894439311404508">Smyth, Dillman, Christian, &amp; Mcbride, 2009</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894439311404508">Wolfe et al. (2008)</xref> have reported a survey in which a web questionnaire elicits lower item response to open-ended numeric questions compared to a mail version of the instrument. Furthermore, the effects of web questionnaires on open-ended responses have been tested mostly within the computer savvy portion of the survey population since they were based mostly on surveys of college students or professionals.</p>
<p>In fact, most of the mode comparisons of web with mail have not been conducted with general population samples but rather with college students or professionals who are believed to be more Internet savvy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894439311404508">Schonlau et al., 2003</xref>, p. 218). Data quality or measurement errors by mode, especially in connection with mixed mode survey designs, have not been fully explored despite the increasing practical demands to incorporate web surveys into mixed mode designs. Only a few studies have examined mode effects targeted at the general population. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894439311404508">Link and Mokdad (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894439311404508">2006</xref>) compared the response rates of web with mail surveys in general population surveys conducted in four U.S. states. They reported very low unit response rates to the web surveys; web response rates ranged from 13.1% to 19.2%, whereas mail response rates ranged from 37.8% to 53.6%. Studies conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894439311404508">Lorenc (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894439311404508">Bandillar et al. (2003)</xref> compared item nonresponse to web and mail surveys and found no differences across modes. In contrast, a study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894439311404508">Bech and Kristensen (2009)</xref> suggested that web surveys may obtain more substantive responses from the general public, and even from older respondents. The authors investigated mode effects in a mixed mode national survey targeted at older persons aged 50 to 75 years in Denmark. They found that web surveys, compared to mail surveys, produced not only lower item nonresponse rates but also fewer “don’t know” responses.</p>
<p>In sum, previous studies comparing the data quality obtained in web and mail surveys have produced mixed findings on this topic. While research focusing on mode effects continues, little has been done to understand how it is that mode influences data quality in the general population. The limited findings on mode effects in mixed mode general population surveys reinforce the belief that more research is needed to better understand potential disadvantages and advantages of each mode.</p>
<p>As an exploratory study designed to better understand the data quality of a mixed mode national survey, this article aims to investigate whether and the extent to which different self-administered survey modes—web and mail surveys—produce different data quality. Data quality is examined by both unit and item response rates. Item responses are investigated by the frequency of item nonresponses in both closed- and open-ended questions. In addition, substantive responses in closed-ended questions and the number of themes in an open-ended question were compared by mode. The data for this study come from the 2008 Gallup Health panel survey which employed a probability-based sampling of the U.S. general public. Information about this panel survey is next presented.</p>

<title>Data Source</title>
<p>Data employed in this study came from a 2008 health survey conducted by the Gallup Panel. The Gallup Panel is a probability-based panel of the general U.S. public and employs both web and mail survey methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894439311404508">Dillman et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0894439311404508">Rao, Kaminska, &amp; Mccutcheon, 2010</xref>). In the first stage of recruitment, the Gallup Panel uses random digit dialing (RDD) to recruit a sample of the U.S. general public as panelists. During the first telephone contact, the respondent (classified as the primary member in the household) is asked to join as a member of the Gallup Panel. Those who agree are asked to complete a basic demographic questionnaire which invites the respondent and up to three additional household members (ages 13 and over) to join the panel. Upon joining, recruited members are assigned to one of the two survey modes to participate in Gallup Panel surveys: mail or web. The assignment of members to a particular mode is not random and is based on a set of questions about household Internet access and use. Members who report using the Internet twice per week or more and who provide an e-mail address are assigned to receive panel surveys via the web survey mode. Respondents who report using the Internet less than twice a week or who do not provide an e-mail address are assigned to receive paper questionnaires by mail (for more information about the initial recruitment process of Gallup Panel, refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0894439311404508">Rao et al., 2010</xref>). Gallup Panel members participate in an average of three surveys per month. They are provided with no monetary incentives for responding. The survey instead attracts panelists with the reputation of Gallup polls and continuously persuades them that “their participation is a way for their voice to be heard” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894439311404508">Dillman et al., 2009a</xref>, p. 344). However, Gallup Panel members occasionally receive token thank you gifts, such as pens and notepads, in appreciation for their continued participation. They also receive a copy of a magazine produced exclusively for Gallup panelists, which highlights the impact of the opinions collected through the panel.</p>

<title>Gallup Panel Health Survey</title>
<p>The 2008 health panel survey was sent to all active panel members who were assigned to receive surveys via mail or web. The Health survey examined in this study was conducted from February 2 to March 18, 2008. The purpose of the survey was to obtain incidence of various health ailments and panel members’ attitudes, opinions, and beliefs about health and health care issues. While the Gallup panel’s probability-based sampling is expected to better recruit the general public than nonprobability opt-in panels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894439311404508">Dillman et al., 2009a</xref>), at any time the sample selected for a particular Gallup panel study may not be representative of the general public in its entirety.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0894439311404508">1</xref></sup> The Gallup panel members who were selected for the health survey were found to be older, more educated and wealthier than the U.S. general population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0894439311404508">2</xref></sup> While African Americans were underrepresented, Whites were overrepresented, compared to the national estimates. The survey was sent to 55,921 active panel members assigned to receive mail or web surveys. The assignment distribution of web and mail was close to equal (49.2% web and 50.8% mail).</p>
<p>The health survey questionnaire consisted of 67 questions in total, which were laid out in different sections so that related questions were in proximity to each other. The survey questionnaire was designed using principles from the total design method for self-administered questionnaires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894439311404508">Dillman et al., 2009a</xref>) and in such a way that the same visual presentation features (such as font style, color, etc.) were used for both web and mail respondents. This unified mode construction is believed to reduce needless mode effects on how questions are constructed and ensure that respondents in both modes receive the same mental stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894439311404508">Dillman et al., 2009a</xref>, p. 326). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0894439311404508">Figure 1</xref>
 illustrates an example of a unified mode construction of the open-ended question that is analyzed in this study. We note that these alternative versions offer a close, but not an exact, replication of one another. While a booklet-size questionnaire was prepared for the mail survey, which is the case with most of the Gallup Panel mail surveys, the web questionnaire consisted of multiple pages in order to facilitate faster downloading of each page. The wording, sequence, response categories, and skip patterns for survey questions in each mode were identical. Also, the layouts of the mail and web questionnaires were designed to look as similar as possible.</p>

</fig>
<p>Lastly, no prenotification of any kind (letter/email) was sent to either mail or web panel members. While panel members assigned to the mail survey mode received the survey along with a prepaid return envelope, an e-mail was sent to those assigned to the web survey mode that explained the purpose of the survey and had a link to the survey website. While all web panelists were referred to the same website, each individual e-mail invitation contained a unique, randomly generated access code required to take the survey. This ensured that access was provided only to authorized e-mail recipients. Respondents were allowed to suspend the web survey and return later to complete it at the point where they left off. Once the web survey was completed, the used access code became invalid and could not be used for any other Gallup Panel surveys. Two reminder e-mails were sent to web respondents. The first was dispatched 7 days after the survey launch, and the second was sent 7 days after the first reminder. No reminder letters or postcards were sent to the mail panelists, however, in order to reduce postage costs. Both the mail and web surveys were designed to require approximately 15 min to complete.</p>

<title>Model and Measures</title>
<p>Unit response rates were first compared between web and mail respondents. The sample of 55,921 panelists was used in this analysis. Response rates were calculated as the ratio of those who completed the survey to those who were assigned to the survey. Survey completion refers to the cases which submitted their online responses to the survey administrator on the last screen or who mailed their paper responses back to the administrator. This calculation is equivalent to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894439311404508">American Association for Public Opinion Research (2011)</xref> response rate formula no. 1.</p>
<p>Unit responses to the web survey were first compared with those to the mail survey using the chi-square test. Then, logistic models were employed to compare the likelihood of completing the survey by mode, since the dependent variable was a dichotomous measure of survey completion. This variable was assigned a value of 1 if the assignees completed the survey by submitting their responses via mail or web. Otherwise, it was assigned a value of 0. Our independent variable was a dichotomous indicator of survey mode. A value of 1 was assigned to those who were assigned the web survey mode, with a value of 0 assigned to those who were assigned to the mail survey mode. A logistic regression model facilitated additional mode comparisons after adjusting for 28 sociodemographic covariates (discussed below).</p>
<p>Data quality was compared by mode in three ways. First, item nonresponse was examined by comparing the number of unanswered items to closed-ended questions by mode. Then, nonsubstantive responses were investigated by comparing the frequency of “don’t know” responses to the web survey with those to the mail survey. Lastly, item nonresponses in open-ended questions were compared by mode. In addition to the number of item nonresponses, the number of themes reported in the open-ended comment box was compared by mode. The sample of 39,149 respondents was used for these analyses on data quality.</p>
<p>Regarding item nonresponse to closed-ended questions, 50 items asked of all respondents were available for analysis. The total number of item nonresponses for the web survey was compared with those to the mail survey using <italic>t</italic> tests. Subsequently, Poisson regression models were employed to examine the effects of mode on item nonresponse because the dependent variable, a count of the number of item nonresponses, was not normally distributed.</p>
<p>For a comparison of nonsubstantive responses, “don’t know” responses in the web and mail surveys were examined. The “don’t know” response was included as an explicit response choice in 8 out of the 50 closed-ended questions. “Don’t know” responses were first compared via <italic>t</italic> test and then Poisson regression analyses were conducted since the dependent variable was a count of the number of “don’t know” responses.</p>
<p>Open-ended responses were also compared by mode. Two open-ended numeric questions and one comment question were used for these comparisons. Open-ended numeric questions regarding respondents’ weight and height were asked in the first half of the survey. An open-ended comment question regarding the survey was placed at the end of the questionnaire. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0894439311404508">Figure 1</xref> illustrates, respondents were asked to enter any additional comments in the open-ended comment box and to classify their comments as being positive, a problem report, a suggestion, or a contact information update. Respondents who checked any of the three classifications—a positive comment, a problem report, or a suggestion—were considered to have provided an open-ended response. The contact information updates were not counted as an open-ended response in the analysis. Item responses for each open-ended question were compared by mode. First, simple chi-square tests were used for a comparison of item nonresponses by mode and logistic regression analyses were conducted in order to investigate mode effects on item nonresponse. Additionally, a count of the number of comment classifications checked as part of an open-ended comment question was compared by mode in order to explore differences in the quality of open-ended responses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0894439311404508">
<title>Multivariate Adjustments</title>
<p>Significant sociodemographic differences were observed between web and mail assignees within the panel. Web assignees were younger, more educated, and wealthier than were mail assignees. They were also more likely to be married, employed, and home owners. They were less likely to be rural residents and African American, compared to mail assignees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0894439311404508">3</xref></sup> Consequently, 28 control variables representing several sociodemographic characteristics were added to all the models in order to examine the independent effects of survey mode on data quality, net of these other factors. These control variables included a dummy variable for gender, five dummy variables representing various age categories, five dummy variables representing race/ethnic groups, two dummy variables representing degree of urbanity of residence, four dummy variables reflecting level of educational attainment, four dummy variables representing levels of household income, one for marital status, one for employment, one for home ownership, and four dummy variables representing length of stay in the panel.</p>

<sec id="section7-0894439311404508">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>The overall unit response rate for this survey was 70.0% (AAPOR RR1). A total of 39,149 of the 55,921 sampled completed the survey. In general, the web survey elicited significantly lower response rates compared to the mail survey. The response rate to the web survey was 67.0%, compared to a 72.9% response rate to the mail survey, χ<sup>2</sup> = 229.9, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, effect size (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>) = 0.13.</p>
<p>In order to further examine potential patterns of mode effects, χ<sup>2</sup> tests were performed separately for a number of subgroups, which were defined by gender, age, race, employment status, household income, education level, marital status, urbanity of residence, and length of stay in the Gallup panel (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0894439311404508">Table 1</xref>
). Within most of these subgroups, the web survey was found to consistently produce lower unit response rates with the exception of the under 35-year-old age group. Interestingly, for this age group (<italic>n</italic> = 5,026), the response rate for the web survey was slightly higher, 48.7% vs. 45.7% for mail; χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.3, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> = .038, ES (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>) = 0.06. However, the positive effect of web mode on survey unit response was limited, in that the effect of the web mode became negative once the 23 sociodemographic covariates (except age dummy variables) were introduced (i.e., Model 2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0894439311404508">Table 2</xref>
).</p>

<p>The effect of mode on data quality was investigated by comparing item nonresponse rates between the web and mail survey modes. Overall, the number of unanswered items was fairly small in both modes. The average number of missing items was 1.3 out of 50 total items (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.45; <italic>n</italic> = 39,149). Over 70% of all respondents had no missing items.</p>
<p>The web survey produced a lower item nonresponse rate compared to the mail survey—a significant difference with a moderate effect size, <italic>t</italic> value = 43.2, <italic>df</italic> = 39,147, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .000, ES (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>) = 0.45. The average number of missing items among web survey respondents was 0.3 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.69, <italic>n</italic> = 18,634), which was much lower than the 2.2 average among mail survey respondents (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.78, <italic>n</italic> = 20,515). Web respondents were more likely to have no missing items (85%), compared to mail respondents (63%). In contrast, 6.5% of the mail respondents left about half of all items (20–30 items out of 50) unanswered, whereas only 0.1% of web respondents did so.</p>
<p>The web survey was found to consistently produce lower item nonresponse rates across sociodemographic subgroups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0894439311404508">Table 4</xref>
). This finding was consistent across gender, age, and race groups, as well as across residential variables (home ownership and urbanicity), educational, income, employment and marital status, and length of duration in the Gallup panel. Poisson regression analyses were conducted to examine the effect of mode on item nonresponse before and after introducing controls for each of these sociodemographic characteristics. Model 1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0894439311404508">Table 5</xref>
 confirmed that the web survey mode produced a significantly lower number of missing items compared to the mail survey mode. The negative effect of the web survey mode on item nonresponses remained even after applying the multivariate controls for sociodemographic characteristics (i.e., Model 2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0894439311404508">Table 5</xref>). In this analysis, each of the sociodemographic measures examined continued to also have independent effects on item nonresponse.</p>

<p>Next, nonsubstantive responses were compared. The mean value of “don’t know” responses was 0.3 out of 8 items which included an explicit “don’t know” response option (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.59, <italic>n</italic> = 39,149). Across modes, the mean value of “don’t know” responses was 0.27 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.55, <italic>n</italic> = 18,634) for web and 0.32 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.63, <italic>n</italic> = 20,515) for mail. This difference in the mean number of “don’t know” responses between web and mail questionnaires was marginal—statistically significant but fairly small in terms of effect size, <italic>t</italic> value = 7.4, <italic>df</italic> = 39,147, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .000, ES (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>) = 0.07. This finding was consistent with the regression analyses (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0894439311404508">Table 6</xref>
) in which mode effects were found to be limited. In a bivariate regression model without controlling for the sociodemographic characteristics of respondents, the web mode was found to decrease the likelihood of obtaining a “don’t know” response (i.e., Model 1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0894439311404508">Table 6</xref>). However, the mode effect disappeared when sociodemographic characteristics of respondents were introduced (i.e., Model 2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0894439311404508">Table 6</xref>).</p>

<p>Finally, item responses to the open-ended questions were compared between the web and mail survey modes. In both numeric and text responses, mode effects on item nonresponse were identified. The web survey produced lower item nonresponse to each of the two numeric questions concerned with individual height, 7.5% vs. 0.6%; χ<sup>2</sup> = 1,100, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, ES (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>) = 0.35 and individual weight, 8.2% vs. 1.2%; χ<sup>2</sup> = 1,000, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, ES (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>) = 0.33.

<p>The web survey was also found to decrease item nonresponse to the optional comment question included at the end of the questionnaire, 80.4% vs. 84.9%; χ<sup>2</sup> = 135.3, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, ES (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>) = 0.12. The logistic regression analysis of this item (not shown) also provided evidence that the web survey mode produced higher open-ended response rates to text responses after controlling for respondent characteristics. However, there was no mode difference in the number of unique themes discussed in answering the final open-ended question. On average, each person responding to this question mentioned one out of three of the various themes (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.18, <italic>n</italic> = 6,744). Differences across modes were minimal (1.03 themes for mail mode and 1.04 for web mode).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings demonstrate differences between the web and mail survey modes in terms of response rates and data quality in a mixed mode national panel survey. Overall, the web mode elicited lower response rates while simultaneously producing higher data quality. That is, the web survey mode produced greater unit nonresponse and less item nonresponse. These findings confirm previous reports of the negative effects of the web survey mode on response rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894439311404508">Bachmann, Elfrink, &amp; Vazzana, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894439311404508">Bech &amp; Kristensen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894439311404508">Couper et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894439311404508">Kaplowitz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894439311404508">Kwak &amp; Radler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894439311404508">Link &amp; Mokdad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894439311404508">Miller et al., 2002</xref>). Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894439311404508">Link and Mokdad’s (2006)</xref> research, in particular, this study also demonstrated that the response rate to a web survey mode was lower than that to a mail survey mode in a general population survey across most of the sociodemographic subgroups classified by gender, race, education level, income, and others. Even in the youngest age group, where the web survey seemingly (and intuitively) enjoyed a somewhat higher response rate, the positive effect of the web survey mode was found to be negative after multivariate adjustments were introduced. This suggests that findings from some previous studies of specific populations, such as university students or professionals, which report higher response rates to the web survey mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894439311404508">Greenlaw &amp; Brown-Welty, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894439311404508">McCabe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894439311404508">McCabe et al., 2002</xref>) might not be generalizable to general population samples. More attention to survey sample composition, survey topics, and administrative designs will be necessary when examining mode effects on response rates for specific sociodemographic subgroups.</p>
<p>This study also confirms and extends previous findings of a positive effect of the web survey mode on data quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894439311404508">Bech &amp; Kristensen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894439311404508">Denscombe, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894439311404508">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894439311404508">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894439311404508">Kwak &amp; Radler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894439311404508">Schaefer &amp; Dillman, 1998</xref>). In the survey reported here, the web mode produced lower item nonresponse to both closed-ended and open-ended questions, compared to the mail survey mode. These findings were found to persist, even after controlling for other sociodemographic variables that might also be associated with data quality. Contrary to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894439311404508">Wolfe et al.’s (2008)</xref> report on the negative effects of the web survey mode on open-ended numeric responses, this study finds a positive effect of the web survey on open-ended numeric response rates.</p>
<p>Still, mode effects on substantive responses were in general found to be limited. The web survey produced fewer “don’t know” responses to closed-ended questions, but this mode effect disappeared after other sociodemographic characteristics of respondents were introduced. The mode difference in the themes reported in an open-ended comment box was also minimal. However, this marginal difference needs to be interpreted with caution because the three themes covered in the open-ended responses were quite broad. The assigned themes might not be effective to detect any differences in substantive responses. Future study analyzing the actual contents of open-ended responses can be informative and will further our understanding of mode differences in substantive responses.</p>
<p>This study used analytical models that controlled for sociodemographic differences in the composition of mail and web samples in order to minimize sociodemographic confounding that might have been associated with our results. However, analytical controls might not be enough to isolate the effects associated with nonrandom assignment of individuals to mail or web samples. The results of this study need to be understood in the context of a consumer panel wherein assignment of members to a particular mode (mail or web) is not random and rather is based on Internet access and willingness to provide an e-mail address for panel correspondence. That said, a study with random assignment to survey mode is essential in order to investigate mode effects that are completely independent of respondents’ access and willingness to participate in a particular survey mode. In this regard, assessments of mode effects in national mixed mode surveys using experimental designs are needed.</p>
<p>Moreover, the findings of this research need to be carefully interpreted. Other questionnaire and survey administration designs might have also influenced response rates and data quality in addition to the survey mode effects suggested here. Since two reminders were provided only for web survey respondents, the unit response rates for the web survey might have been much lower than for the mail survey if no reminders had been provided for either. The differences of web and paper questionnaires might have also affected item responses, although the questionnaires were basically designed to have a unified mode. As previous studies suggest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894439311404508">Christian &amp; Dillman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894439311404508">Denscombe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894439311404508">Grondin &amp; Sun, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894439311404508">Wolfe et al., 2008</xref>), question topics and wordings, question order, question format, and any technical or visual designs might have affected data quality across the two modes in different ways.</p>
<p>It is also important to recognize that characteristics of panelists and the uniqueness of panel surveys might also affect the findings. It needs to be considered that the sociodemographic characteristics of panelists did not fully represent the U.S. population. In addition, the response patterns of experienced panelists might also contribute variance to the results of this study, although the length of stay in the panel was included as a control in all multivariate models.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this study enhances our understanding of mode effects in general population surveys. In a U.S. national panel survey, fewer survey recipients respond to a web survey compared to a mail survey request, but those who do respond to the web survey provide more information, with fewer missing answers both to closed- and open-ended questions. These mode effects are consistently found across sociodemographic subgroups classified by gender, age, race, education level, income, marital and employment statuses, urbanity of residence, and the length of stay in the panel. That is, which mode the panelists are assigned to in a mixed mode survey appears to affect their unit and item response rates.</p>
<p>Future experimental research into mode effects in a general population survey with random assignment to survey mode would be beneficial to further document the generalizability of the findings from this study. Given the widespread and increasing use of web questionnaires as part of mixed mode survey strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894439311404508">Couper &amp; Miller, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894439311404508">De Leeuw, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894439311404508">Dillman et al., 2009a</xref>), this study suggests that additional studies of mode variability will become increasingly valuable. It will be beneficial to identify the specific mechanisms that underlie the observed mode effects. That is, we still need to understand which elements of the web and mail modes contribute to differences in survey response rates and data quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894439311404508">Couper, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894439311404508">Das, Ester, &amp; Kaczmirek, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894439311404508">Dillman et al., 2009a</xref>). Future research should focus on empirically demonstrating the processes responsible for these mode differences and suggesting practical guidelines to improve the quality and equivalence of data collected in mixed mode, self-administered surveys.</p>
