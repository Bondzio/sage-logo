<p><italic>Becoming the Second City: Chicago’s Mass News Media, 1833–1898</italic> is authored by former news reporter Richard Junger, now of Western Michigan University. It is beautifully written, is often riveting, and captures the fascinating rawboned rancor and glories of nineteenth-century newspaper feuds, and the rich, often cutthroat, and frequently licentious tradition of journalism in Chicago as that city and its newspapers matured and prospered in the years before and the decades following the Civil War.</p>
<p>There are many of the “usual suspects,” such as the unpredictable William F. Storey of the <italic>Chicago Times</italic>, who gave Abraham Lincoln so much trouble, and Joseph Medill and Charles Ray of the Chicago <italic>Tribune</italic>, who championed Lincoln’s presidential ambitions. The great controversy of the nineteenth century—that of slavery and abolition—is played out in the careers and newspapers of Chicago. Storey and the <italic>Times</italic> staked their opposition to abolition on the value of white, male labor, while Medill’s <italic>Tribune</italic> opposed the South’s peculiar institution on moral grounds. According to one historian, Medill “influenced the course of American history in his use of the <italic>Tribune</italic> as a political weapon.”</p>
<p>Junger includes a detailed view of the Haymarket Square incident in 1886. According to one source, that complicated event may have resulted from too much newspaper coverage in a pre-echo of modern criticisms of the media. The book also presents a fascinating view of Chicago’s Great Fire in 1871 and the 1893 Columbian Exposition.</p>
<p>Junger’s recounting of the acrimonious competition among Windy City newspapers, sprinkled with nasty barbs directed at each other, is just as entertaining to the modern reader as it was undoubtedly to Chicagoans over 150 years ago. Based on rich primary sources, blended with perspectives of pertinent secondary sources, <italic>Becoming the Second City</italic> is a rich addition to the literature of nineteenth-century urban journalism.</p>
<p>Anthony Collins reported for <italic>Newsweek</italic> early in his career and then spent three decades for CNN, hopping from one news hotspot to another. In <italic>Capturing the News: Three Decades of Reporting Crisis and Conflict</italic>, he recalls many of his assignments over the years. He interviewed key leaders, such as West Germany’s Willy Brandt, actress Claudia Cardinale in Moscow, and many others.</p>
<p>Collins is a very strong, clear, and professional writer. In <italic>Capturing the News</italic>, Collins goes back in time to recount these stories and brings a smoothness to them that should be a lovely trip back in time for other reporters or a guide for students who are interested in what lies ahead in this changing world. Professors of newswriting and reporting will find this short book a delightful addition to their syllabi to add spark and style to the classroom.</p>
<p>Scott A. Bonn’s <italic>Mass Deception: Moral Panic and the U.S. War on Iraq</italic> is a brilliant and powerful theoretical tour de force. “Moral panic,” in Bonn’s analysis, is exemplified by the selling of the Iraq War to the American public by President George W. Bush and his acolytes.</p>
<p>Moral panic, Bonn contends, occurs when “the threat is presented and characterized in a manner that typically far exceeds the objective level.” Bonn persuasively argues that “central to the moral panic approach is an argument that public fear is mutually beneficial to state managers and the news media.”</p>
<p>Bonn integrates many communication theoretical perspectives in his narrative. Among these are agenda setting, critical sociology (the Frankfurt School), priming, political rhetoric, social constructionism, and others. His use of theory is a virtual primer for advanced undergraduate and graduate students. Communication theory often stands outside actual political life, but not in Bonn’s hands. He marshals data that include content analysis of various kinds, public opinion data, and other types of evidence.</p>
<p><italic>Mass Deception</italic>’s chapter 7 is, perhaps, the capstone of his argument and explores the lessons of the Iraq War, and Bonn does find support for the Frankfurt School analysis of society. But Bonn also suggests there are alternative perspectives. He urges readers to remember this when it comes to leadership and citizens: “Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.”</p>
<p>Whether readers will agree with the central thrust of his argument or not, this study is a mature reflection of what the literature of mass communication can support and is an intellectual triumph.</p>
