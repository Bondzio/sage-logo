<abstract>
<p>This article draws on psychological theory relating to the emergence of self and subjectivity to examine transnational adoptee experiences of their own circulation as children. The article juxtaposes state policies and adoptive parent discourses that standardize adoption as a unidirectional process that requires a clean break from the past, and more complex renditions by the adopted themselves of subjectivity as a temporally dynamic and open-ended process of coming into being. Drawing on narratives of return by adoptees born in Ethiopia, India, and Korea who were adopted by parents in Sweden and the United States, the article suggests that their experiences in the orphanages, hospitals, and families from which they were adopted complicate understandings of what it means to circulate, while opening up standardizing descriptions of family, childhood, and belonging.</p>

<p>The unconscious is that chapter of my history that is marked by a blank or occupied by a falsehood: it is the censored chapter. But the truth can be rediscovered; usually it has been written down elsewhere. Namely:</p>
<p>–in monuments: this is my body …</p>
<p>–in archival documents: these are my childhood memories …</p>
<p>–and, lastly, in the traces that are inevitably preserved by the distortions necessitated by the linking of the adulterated chapter to the chapters surrounding it, and whose meaning will be established by my exegesis. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0907568213483599">Lacan, 1977</xref>: 50)</p>

<p>In this article I draw on the concepts ‘dynamic temporality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0907568213483599">Conrad, 2012</xref>) and ‘isomorphism without identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0907568213483599">Gibbs, 2010</xref>: 194) to explore and explain adoptee experiences of their own circulation as children. I focus on their developing awareness of becoming (adoptable) through a series of operations that constituted them as objects of exchange, but that may only be apprehended as such retrospectively, on their return to the sites of their physical or legal abandonment. My analysis builds on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0907568213483599">Igor Kopytoff’s (1986</xref>: 73) analysis of commoditization ‘as a process of becoming, rather than as an all-or-none state of being’; on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0907568213483599">Claudia Fonseca’s (2004</xref>: 168) observation that children are ‘objects of exchange which themselves carry memories’; and on the discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0907568213483599">Yngvesson and Coutin (2006</xref>: 187) of value as ‘made visible in a return of some sort, which, in turn, establishes the meaning of the original product.’</p>
<p>In what follows, I juxtapose state policies that cancel the pre-adoptive past of a child (including his or her period of circulation through temporary sites of care, such as hospitals, orphanages, foster families, or with a birth parent) so that he or she can develop a fixed ground of belonging and identity in the adoptive family, and more complex renditions by the adopted themselves of subjectivity as emergent and non-identical, forged in relations of power, and (de)materializing in journeys back to the sites of their abandonment. By examining narratives of return by the adopted to the hospitals, orphanages, courts, and families that were left behind with their adoption, I suggest ways that the past is called forth in a ‘present moment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0907568213483599">Stern, 2004</xref>) in which the adopted child and the child left behind take shape vis-a-vis one another. In this way, narratives of return challenge assumptions of subjectivity as a fixed sense of self that is rooted in time and place; and they disorder the notion of development as a linear process through which each child ‘progresses’ in order to achieve a coherent self, complicating standardizing depictions of children.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0907568213483599">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>To illustrate the power of a ‘present moment’ in the apprehension of what it means to circulate, I begin with four narratives of return in which the adopted child and the child (or the mother) who might have been (or might become) ‘me’ take shape vis-a-vis one another.</p>

<title>Revisiting the ‘past’</title>
<p>In an article written in a Swedish adoptive parent journal in 1980, Annika Grünewald describes a return visit with her 10-year-old daughter Kanthi to the orphanage in Kolkata, India, from which she had been adopted five years earlier. Recounting the child’s complex emotional response to their day at the orphanage, where they found children who ‘sat with crossed legs and did nothing,’ Grünewald recalls her daughter’s words when they returned to their hotel that evening: ‘What if you had adopted one of them instead and she had been standing there today looking at me?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0907568213483599">1980</xref>: 5). Here, the return to the orphanage materializes for the child what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0907568213483599">Walter Benjamin (1968</xref>: 255) describes as a ‘true picture of the past’ that ‘can be seized only as an image which flashes up at that instant when it can be recognized and is never seen again’ – a moment of choice/danger that illuminates the power dynamic involved in ‘standing there … looking at me’ and the arbitrariness of a choice in which some other child might have been ‘me’ and returned to look at Kanthi in the orphanage.</p>
<p>In a second account, Jaclyn Aronson, who was adopted in 1983 from South Korea, describes her memories of children being ‘groomed’ for adoption in the United States by the orphanage director at Angel Babies Home in Seoul, where she spent five months when she was eight years old:<disp-quote>
<p>Angel Babies Home was a temporary place. After I understood we were all going to America, I began to question why I was still there. … I had watched my friends groomed and then disappear. I watched children run into the orphanage announcing that they had seen pictures of their American family. They described houses that were larger than I had ever seen. … They received gifts from their American families and were excited about their departure dates. These children were all younger than I.</p>
<p>Each day we stood in front of Miss Shin and the other orphanage teacher as they called out names and took the children to the office. I listened carefully but my name was not called. After a few months I stopped listening. One day as I was playing with Legos while the other children hurried to the front, I heard my name. I did not look up because I knew it was another girl with the same name. Then I heard it again. I looked up to see that Miss Shin was signing for me to walk to her. She placed her arm around me.</p>
<p>‘You be good for those American people.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0907568213483599">Aronson, 1997</xref>: 22–23)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The tension here between the child in the orphanage whose ‘name was not called’ and ‘another girl with the same name’ who was to be groomed for adoption to the United States was suggested in an interview in which Aronson described Kim Hyo Jin, the eight-year-old child at the orphanage, and Jaclyn Campbell Aronson (the child Hyo Jin ‘became’ when she went to the United States), as ‘not one and the same’:<disp-quote>
<p>For me, I often see Hyo Jin as the little girl who never got the chance to grow up past eight and a half years. I don’t know if her growth was stunted when I became Jaclyn Campbell Aronson or when she stopped being Kim Mi Young’s child. Or in the orphanage when she was no one’s child. But my memories of life in Korea are vivid. (Interview, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0907568213483599">Yngvesson, 2010</xref>: 157)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0907568213483599">2</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A third narrative is provided by Sofia Berzelius, who was adopted by Swedish parents in the early 1970s from an orphanage in Addis Ababa. She returned for the first time in 2000 and visited the hospital where she was born and her mother died in childbirth. There she found records containing details of her birth and her birth mother’s death, and was also taken to the operating theatre where she was born, where she experienced ‘this really, really amazing feeling, because suddenly I just touched ground, it was fantastic just to see. It was like, “Yeah, OK, so this is where it started.” ’ (interview, 26 August 2002). Berzelius returned to the hospital in 2006, when she was pregnant with her first child, in spite of the objections of her adoptive mother, who worried about the risks of the journey and lack of cleanliness at the hospital. In a conversation in her Stockholm apartment in May of that year, as she cradled her newborn daughter in her arms, Berzelius explained to me the importance of this journey ‘back’ to her own beginnings, before bringing her own child into the world. She acknowledged her terror that she, too, like her birth mother, would die in childbirth, and spoke of her joy when the baby was born and she realized they had both survived (interview, 12 May 2006).</p>
<p>Finally, ChuChu Schindele, who, like Sofia Berzelius, was adopted from Ethiopia by Swedish parents when she was a child, describes her most recent return to Addis Ababa, with her husband and two-year-old daughter, in 2008. Schindele was reunited with her birth parents and siblings in Ethiopia in the 1990s and has remained in contact with them since that time. She returned in 2005 for a second celebration of her marriage with her extended family in Addis, following the initial celebration in Stockholm. The trip in 2008 was planned so that her daughter could be introduced to her Ethiopian cousins. Flying back to Sweden after the visit, ChuChu tells me during a conversation in 2011, there was a moment when ‘It felt like the circle was complete. It’s hard to explain. It’s just what I felt with my daughter on my lap. … I had made this same trip when I was her age, and now I was bringing her home.’</p>

<title>‘The present moment’</title>
<p>Child psychiatrist Daniel Stern defines ‘the present moment’ as ‘the <italic>now</italic> while life is actually being experienced’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0907568213483599">2004</xref>: 7). Stern notes that unlike the narrative view of time, which ‘aims at life verisimilitude’ and ‘give[s] us back the feeling of continuity in life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0907568213483599">2004</xref>: 6), the present moment ‘is the passing moment in which something happens as the time unfolds. It is the coming into being of a new state of things, and it happens in a moment of awareness. … It is a small window of becoming and opportunity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0907568213483599">2004</xref>: 7). Drawing on Husserl’s understanding of duration, Stern notes that the past of the present moment ‘is still echoing at the present instant,’ while the future of such a moment acts ‘at the present instant to give directionality, and a sense of what is about to unfold’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0907568213483599">2004</xref>: 27). In Jaclyn Aronson’s description of the moment when Hyo Jin saw the orphanage director signing for her to go to the front of the room to be ‘groomed’ for adoption to the United States, the routine of watching her friends ‘be groomed and disappear’ became instead ‘a moment of awareness’ that marked ‘the coming into being of a new state of things’ for her. Likewise, in Kanthi’s experience at the orphanage in Kolkata, ‘something happened’ in the encounter with the children that disrupted the continuity of her belonging with her family in Sweden. In that encounter, ‘the past of the present moment’ was ‘echoing’ to re-situate her in the orphanage at a moment when she might <italic>not</italic> have been chosen, in this way ‘disordering the space’ of the orphanage (and of Sweden as a nation where children adopted from India and other so-called developing countries could be seamlessly incorporated through adoption) (and see Coutin, this issue, on the ‘disordering of space’).</p>
<p>In what follows, I explore the ways subjectivity is reconfigured in adoptee narratives of return, with particular attention to the ways time is bridged, reversed, or manipulated in present moments to create an emotional convergence between ‘past’ and ‘present.’ As suggested in the narratives above, adoptee stories of reconnection and return are marked by fluid boundaries between now and then, between the orphanage child and the adopted child, between Swedish adoptee and Ethiopian birth mother, providing examples of what poet and child psychologist Rachel Conrad terms ‘<italic>dynamic temporality</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0907568213483599">2012</xref>: 209, emphasis in original) in their accounts of return journeys to the orphanages, hospitals, and families that were left behind when they were adopted. Dynamic temporality entails ‘a remodeling of time that involves stretching out duration, crossing temporal frames, subverting linear trajectories, or otherwise claiming power over time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0907568213483599">2012</xref>: 216). Subjectivity in these accounts is conceptualized ‘not as a given or absolute, a fixed sense that is rooted in time [and place], but as a continual process of coming into being in relation to … experiences and other subjectivities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0907568213483599">2012</xref>: 205).</p>
<p>In these narratives of return, the abandonment of the child, which is marked by the death of a parent or by the moment when one child was adopted and the ‘other’ child was left behind at the orphanage, is both relived and transformed in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0907568213483599">Anna Gibbs (2010</xref>: 193) describes as ‘a rendering’ or a relation between things in which ‘ “like a flash, similarity appears” ’ (quoting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0907568213483599">Foucault, 1973</xref>: 247). This relation between things, Gibbs argues, involves the experience of <italic>both</italic> difference and similarity, or what she describes as ‘isomorphism without identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0907568213483599">2010</xref>: 195): the adopted child as the child who was left behind in the orphanage, in Kanthi’s account; the child in the orphanage as ‘inside’ the adopted child but ‘not one and the same,’ in Jaclyn Aronson’s narrative; the adopted child as the adoptee’s child and the return to Sweden as the original journey to Sweden, in ChuChu Schindele’s story of return; and the adoptee as the birth mother who survives, in Sofia Berzelius’s narrative. Both ChuChu and Sofia return, so to speak, as/with the child who was <italic>not</italic> adopted, in this way reclaiming the abandoned child as their own and positioning themselves as the birth mother who survives (who keeps her child). Kanthi’s return, by contrast, like Jaclyn Aronson’s memories of the ‘grooming’ of children for adoption at Angel Babies Home, illuminates a subverted story of danger in the conventional narrative of rescue, with the ‘adoptee’ as a hard kernel of reality that exceeds the coherence and completeness that legal narratives of adoption seek.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0907568213483599">3</xref></sup> (And see Leifsen, this issue, for a related discussion that interrogates adoption and the belongings it affirms in favor of a more fluid and unstable developmental process through which children come into being.)</p>
<p>As this discussion suggests, adoptee narratives of return and the figurations of childhood they evoke can be good to think with, and not just for reimagining discourses of adoption and the exclusions of family as a space of belonging. Rather, engagement of the adopted with the orphanage, the birth family, and the child who might have been me illuminates a process of becoming in which all children engage. This process destabilizes a framework of development in which ‘childhood’ is a fixed element, while claiming power over time – and thus over subjectivity – as ‘neither an incoherent series of events nor an immutable substantiality, impervious to evolution’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0907568213483599">Ricoeur, 1991</xref>: 32). Adoptee stories of return and the transgressions of linear time and fixed spaces of belonging – the orphanage, the home, the kingdom of Sweden, the nation of Ethiopia – they offer are thus powerful tools for a more general rethinking of conventional narratives of development and the fixed categories that underpin them.</p>

<title>‘Looking like who you are’</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think life is a lot easier if you look like who you are: if what on the outside people can expect from you is what you expect of yourself. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0907568213483599">Jacobson, 2008</xref>: 72, quoting mother of a child adopted from China).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This statement by the adoptive mother of a child born in China both illuminates a conventional adoption narrative in which the child moves from one world to another, but her identity– who she is assumed to <italic>be</italic> (on the ‘inside’) – is defined by birth and is unchanging; and speaks to a familiar identity narrative in which inside and outside must ‘match’ or cohere if the child (or adult) is to have a ‘whole’ rather than a fragmented (damaged) self-concept (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0907568213483599">Yngvesson and Mahoney, 2000</xref>). The concept of fixing the (adopted) child’s identity, whether by mandating her or his legal rebirth as the ‘as-if-begotten’ child of the adoptive parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0907568213483599">Modell, 1994</xref>: 2) or by ‘keeping’ her or his ‘birth culture’ in the adopting nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0907568213483599">Jacobson, 2008</xref>) is one of the ways ‘the script of “real” relationship is, as it were, written again’ through adoptive kinship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0907568213483599">Modell, 1994</xref>: 3). ‘Real’ relationships are those in which the child produces family belonging through biogenetic connection to each of the parents. Likewise, ‘real’ cultural relationships are those in which the child’s (or the adult’s) ‘inside’ and his or her ‘outside’ <italic>belong together</italic>, and in which the outsides of adult and child belong together, pointing to the ways in which a racialized politics of surfaces works to constitute belongings that are more than ‘skin deep.’ As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0907568213483599">Elspeth Probyn (1996</xref>: 35) argues, ‘surface’ is not merely ‘superficial’ but is always figured by ‘the deep historicity of why, how, where, and with whom we may feel that we <italic>belong</italic>’ (emphasis in the original).</p>
<p>In this sense, the ‘mismatch’ of adoptive parent and child, visible in the transracially adopted child’s ‘difference,’ and the ‘mismatch’ of culture to child, visible in the presence of, for example, the ‘Ethiopian’ or ‘Chinese’ child in families and nations where they ‘do not belong,’ is one of the ways that adoptive kinship instantiates a ‘pull’ to a canceled ‘real’ that is arguably its key discursive feature. As transnational/transracial adoptions surged in the last decade of the 20th century and the first years of the 21st, peaking at over 45,000 children in 2004, celebration of the so-called ‘birth culture’ of the adopted child by the adoptive family became a standard feature of adoption practice, particularly in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0907568213483599">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Celebration of the child’s birth culture includes ‘roots trips’ to the birth country of the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0907568213483599">Yngvesson, 2003</xref>), ‘culture camps’ that train children in what are considered to be key features of their culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0907568213483599">Aronson, 1997</xref>), and forms of cultural immersion such as language training, attending special schools, and a range of everyday practices that ‘keep’ the culture of the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0907568213483599">Jacobson, 2008</xref>), fixing what is otherwise perceived to be a split between the child’s ‘inside’ experience and her or his ‘outside’ appearance. In this way, the child should be able to experience her- or himself and be seen by others as ‘the same’ child.</p>
<p>A key finding in Heather Jacobson’s research contrasting culture-keeping efforts of China- and Russia-adoptive mothers is that the greater the perceived racial difference between parent and child, the more assiduously is culture-keeping practiced by the adoptive mother. Widely encouraged by the adoption industry as a way of ensuring healthy self-esteem among adopted children who otherwise might be ‘at risk for a multitude of disorders’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0907568213483599">2008</xref>: 66), culture-keeping makes possible an acknowledgment of the adopted child’s unique origins, Jacobson suggests, while doing so in a manner ‘that does not necessarily jeopardize the feeling of exclusive kinship adoptive parents crave’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0907568213483599">2008</xref>: 93).</p>
<p>A central assumption underpinning the culture-keeping efforts of China-adoptive mothers in Jacobson’s study was the view that their child’s (Chinese) ethnicity was ‘primordial and fixed to their children through place of birth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0907568213483599">2008</xref>: 82), an understanding of ethnicity that, Jacobson notes, ‘not only fixes “culture” to the child, but … fixes the notion of “culture” as well’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0907568213483599">2008</xref>: 73). As one mother observed, ‘participating in Chinese culture was obligatory for her daughters “because it is their culture. When they look in the mirror, they can see that they’re different and they know that they’re from China, that they’re Chinese” ’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0907568213483599">2008</xref>: 71). For the mothers, ‘bringing Chinese ethnicity into their homes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0907568213483599">2008</xref>: 112) was a way of compensating their daughters for what they regarded as the ‘ “huge loss” ’ involved for the child in being ‘ “stripped … of her culture’ ” through adoption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0907568213483599">2008</xref>: 77).</p>
<p>In a related study on the ‘culture work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0907568213483599">2012</xref>: 194) of Belgian parents of children adopted from Ethiopia in the late 1990s and early 2000s, anthropologist Katrien De Graeve argues that:<disp-quote>
<p>… the adoptive child’s Ethiopian ethnic identity is often taken for granted and seems inextricably bound up with the color of its skin. … [E]ven if adopted children live in Belgium and within the family for several years, their parents still tend to … see their children’s Ethiopian ethnic identity as bestowed upon them at birth, not even hyphenated with Belgian ethnicity, but completely Ethiopian. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0907568213483599">2012</xref>: 205)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Like the mothers interviewed by Jacobson, the culture work of Belgian adoptive parents was considered crucial to their child’s identity construction and for empowering the child, but differed from the work of the China-adoptive mothers in that the Belgian adopters focused particularly on the need to provide their children with ‘a positive image of [their] birth country’ in the context of negative prejudices associated with Ethiopian poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0907568213483599">2012</xref>: 200). De Graeve sums up the Belgian parents’ Ethiopian culture work as ‘like balancing on a tight-rope, as they do not want to burden their child with a negative image of its place of birth, while the disastrous condition of the birth country figures prominently in the justification of its transfer away from that place’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0907568213483599">2012</xref>: 186).</p>
<p>While the previous section drew on narratives of return by adoptees to upset notions of childhood as a fixed marker of linear time in the development of subjectivity, this section illuminates ways that adoptive parents seek to fix a racialized understanding of their child’s identity through efforts to ‘keep’ the culture of the child, so that the child will recognize her or himself when she or he looks in the mirror. As I argue in the next section, however, these efforts to ‘fix’ the child by celebrating her or his cultural ‘nature’ as ‘Ethiopian,’ ‘Korean,’ or ‘Chinese’ are in tension with the child’s experience of <italic>not</italic> looking like who she or he ‘is,’ but of connection to an unknown past that manifests itself as a disturbing presence, both in the mirror and in the child’s everyday life (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0907568213483599">Nordin, 1996</xref>). In this sense, the very forces that would fix the child’s identity contribute to her or his fluid subjectivity as alternately, and sometimes simultaneously, one ‘self’ and another.</p>

<title>‘Dynamic temporality’ in journeys back</title>
<p>Even as adoption organizations and adoptive parents in the 1990s and early 2000s focused increasingly on the importance of culture work in producing adoptive children who look like who they ‘are,’ adult adoptees were producing a powerful body of film and writing that challenged facile assumptions about the significance of culture ‘loss’ for their own sense of identity and ‘healthy self-esteem.’ Rather, this work underscores the contradictions of adoptive subjectivity, contradictions that include what Astrid Trotzig, in one of the earliest memoirs published by the first generation of Korean adoptees, <italic>Blod är Tjockare än Vatten</italic> (<italic>Blood is Thicker than Water</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0907568213483599">1996</xref>), describes as the way in which, when one is adopted,<disp-quote>
<p>… everything stands out clearly, painfully clearly: Like hearing that a mother is irreplaceable, not exchangeable and knowing that the one that is meant is the biological mother and thinking: My mother was ‘replaced.’ Two times. I have my third mother now. At the same time, of course, she is the only mother. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0907568213483599">Trotzig, 1996</xref>: 45)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0907568213483599">5</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Concern about the fate of the birth mother is a persistent theme in interviews with adopted adults, as well as in their fiction, memoirs, academic research, and films. Another early work by a Korean-born adoptee that takes up this issue is Jaclyn Aronson’s undergraduate thesis, ‘<italic>Not my homeland’: A critique of the current culture of Korean international adoption</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0907568213483599">1997</xref>), from which an excerpt is quoted in the first section of this article. Born in South Korea in 1975 and adopted by US parents in 1983, Aronson explores the tension between her adoptive mother’s concern as she was growing up that she attend Korean language school and Korean culture camp, so that she could ‘put together your Korean self with your American self’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0907568213483599">1997</xref>: 79), and her own deep ambivalence about Korea, as expressed in frightening nightmares about her birth mother. Unlike Trotzig, who was found abandoned in front of a police station in Pusan when she was an infant, Aronson was relinquished by her mother to child welfare officials in that city when she was eight years old and has vivid memories of the time she spent in Korea.</p>
<p>By the time she was in her late teens and early twenties, Aronson had developed a powerful critique of what subsequently came to be called ‘culture-keeping,’ or what she describes as ‘knowing Korean culture or “owning Korean culture” ’ and the idea that this ‘helps foster a sense of identity [for the adopted child] and helps to defuse the crisis of “who am I?” ’ Based on her experience as an adoption counselor at a Korean culture camp in the 1990s, Aronson notes that ‘The culture presented at these camps is … [the] essence of a singularized Korean identity,’ an identity of which ‘there is no essence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0907568213483599">1997</xref>: 79). Rather, she suggests that the concept of an essential Korean identity that is celebrated in the culture camp makes it possible to avoid uncomfortable issues that made South Korea the leading source of children for international adoption in the second half of the 20th century. Aronson asks: ‘How do we “reconnect” with the culture that, for its part, relinquished or abandoned us as our birth mothers and birth fathers did? Where are adoptees taught to process these issues?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0907568213483599">1997</xref>: 80).</p>
<p>With her adoptive mother’s support and encouragement, Aronson searched for and was reunited with her birth mother in 1993 and remains in contact with her today. She points out that, ‘Too often in our society, a romantic notion of the birth mother prevails and makes little to no room for a real woman with real circumstances’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0907568213483599">1997</xref>: 4). At a workshop for adoptees on search and reunion, organized together with her adoptive mother in 2005, Aronson described her terrible sense of guilt on leaving Korea after that first reunion, when she realized that while she herself ‘had been adopted to a much better and happier life,’ for her birth mother, nothing had changed: ‘she was still illiterate, she was still poor, she was still drinking heavily, and sick, and I just – got very angry. … I almost felt a kind of rage at Korea: why they couldn’t make room in their society for our family, why, when the country was developing and kind of getting better, why they couldn’t take her along, and why she had to kind of remain in a place, to me, [that] was just so awful’ (recording provided by Aronson for author).</p>
<p>Aronson engages here with key issues relating to stratified reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0907568213483599">Colen, 1995</xref>) – the mobility of the adoptable child (the advantages that are secured by her circulation); the erasure (and immobility) of the birth mother, whose fixity is emblematic of her poverty, her illness, and her inability to nurture her child; and problems in the concept of restoring the adopted child’s culture through culture camps or heritage tours that celebrate origins, while ignoring the circumstances that produce adoptable children and the relevance of these circumstances to the lived experience of the child. As Aronson’s story suggests, the journey ‘back’ into what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0907568213483599">Lacan (1977</xref>: 50) terms ‘the censored chapter’ (the pre-adoptive history that is canceled with the adoption) unsettles any notion of ‘completing oneself’ in such journeys, just as it challenges the legal narrative of a ‘clean break’ that frees the child from his or her pre-adoptive history. Rather, Aronson’s narrative illuminates the ways returns open up the past, complicating conventional understandings of identity as rooted in one place or another, while revealing the ways subjectivity unfolds in ‘a continual process of coming into being in relation to one’s experiences and other subjectivities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0907568213483599">Conrad, 2012</xref>: 205).</p>
<p>The tensions noted by Jaclyn Aronson between an idealized birth culture or birth mother and the realities (e.g., of poverty, gender, and patriarchy) that may lead to a child’s abandonment and adoption, are also explored in the narratives of Swedish adoptees born in Ethiopia in the late 1960s and early 1970s. A common theme in their accounts is the negative media images of Ethiopia (depicted as a place of poverty, starvation, and death) as they were growing up and, as in the narrative below, the ways these shaped their own longings and fears about what one adopted woman, Sara Nordin, describes as ‘this “Ethiopianness” that is such an irritating presence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0907568213483599">Yngvesson, 2010</xref>: 116).</p>
<p>ChuChu Schindele, whose return to Addis Ababa with her two-year-old daughter in 2008 is one of the vignettes in my opening section, describes below her memories of first becoming concerned about Ethiopia:<disp-quote>
<p>It was when there was the huge famine there – 1984. Do you remember that? It affected me deeply. I thought it was really hard (<italic>jättejobbigt</italic>). And I thought that all the people they showed on TV were my parents and my brothers and sisters. I became really upset that they had such a terrible time and I thought that my family had all died. It was a terrible sadness and I became ill because of it. So then I got very involved in the Red Cross, in SIDA, in all kinds of causes. … But it began with the feeling that it was my family that suffered. (Interview in Stockholm, 22 August 1999)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Schindele made her first return trip to Ethiopia as part of a Red Cross mission when she was 17. She had not planned to search for her birth family on the trip, although her adoptive mother persuaded her to take her papers with her.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0907568213483599">6</xref></sup> When she arrived in Addis, however, ‘it was the same thing again [as in 1984], that one sees people who sit on the street and beg. For me it meant that all of them, those who were the sickest, had to be my brother. And so I gave the Red Cross person my papers, and they found my family.’ Her family, she discovered, included nine brothers and sisters, and her parents, who were divorced. She was the only child who had been placed in adoption.</p>
<p>Schindele’s narrative points to the relationship between media representations of the suffering and poverty in Ethiopia as she was growing up and the ways her own subjectivity as (not) Swedish took shape in this context. This was manifested in what she describes as the ‘sharp limits’ she drew for herself in her teens about who she could ‘be together with’ – ‘that I shouldn’t be together with any white guys because <italic>I wanted someone who looked like me</italic>’ (emphasis added) – and in her ‘terrible sadness’ at the thought that her family in Ethiopia could be suffering during the famine in Ethiopia in 1984. As was true for Sofia Berzelius, whose experience of coming into being as simultaneously ‘like’ her mother (who died in childbirth at a hospital ‘for the very poor’ in Addis Ababa) and as ‘not like’ her mother (she delivered her first child safely in Stockholm) is described above, Schindele’s first trip back to Ethiopia became a defining moment in the complex process of coming into being as simultaneously Ethiopian <italic>and</italic> Swedish, an experience that created an intense emotional struggle for her.</p>
<p>In contrast to Berzelius, whose discovery of her birth records and experience in the delivery room realized a subjectivity that had previously been unimaginable other than in stereotypes of poverty and death presented to her as she was growing up, Schindele found a family (and a self) with whom her experience of connection was ‘too much for me’ and on her return to Sweden she entered the hospital, where ‘I lay and cried for maybe two days. I hadn’t been able to have any feelings when I was down there, but when I came home to Sweden it all came over me again.’ Her adoptive mother came to visit her in the hospital ‘and just lay next to me in the bed, without speaking. She didn’t try to ask me a lot of things. She didn’t try to draw any conclusions from what had happened. … She didn’t feel that her own mothering had been put in question.’</p>
<p>Coming to terms with her relationship to her Ethiopian family has been no less complicated for Schindele than it has been for Jaclyn Aronson with her birth mother in Korea, although the circumstances are very different. In both cases, their adoptive parents have been extremely supportive, although with some reservations about what this means for their adopted children. And in both cases, the vast disparity in economic resources between adopted child and birth parent or birth family has been a key issue. Schindele explains the tensions involved in her effort to rebuild a relationship with her Ethiopian family in this way:<disp-quote>
<p>I feel that I have tried and I have given what I could. I have not been able to move there and I haven’t wanted to live there permanently. But I can travel there and stay for a longer period of time and that makes me feel calmer and gives me a certain distance. I don’t think that I should feel guilty because I don’t – or should have, or, you know –. And yet it has become clear to me that these people are incredibly close to me. In that sense, they are <italic>not</italic> distanced. They are really important to me and will always be so. <italic>But I no longer have to search for a part of myself in the same way.</italic> (Interview, 26 August 2002, emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As a result of this process of simultaneously gaining distance from and coming emotionally closer to her birth family, and specifically her birth mother (Schindele’s adoptive father died when she was a child, so she is the only child of an adoptive mother), Schindele explains, ‘The actual adoption no longer exists for me. That was 25 years ago and what is it now? Now it is a constellation of two mothers and that is what I try to relate to.’</p>
<p>In contrast to the exclusions mandated by adoption law, which render not only the child who is adopted but the woman who gave birth to him or her disposable and replaceable, Schindele’s and Aronson’s more inclusive rendering of who they relate to as ‘family’ claims power over time, creating an emotional convergence rather than a clean break between past and present, and between the child or parent who was left behind and the child who was adopted. In this reconfiguration, the adopted child is no longer ‘free’ to circulate but is <italic>engaged in</italic> relationships that ‘are incredibly important to me and will always be so’ (cf. Leifsen’s discussion of ‘chosen circulation’ in this issue; and Stryker’s discussion of interventions by therapists to terminate the child’s emotional engagement with his or her pre-adoptive ‘past,’ also in this issue).</p>
<p>I recalled this interview with ChuChu Schindele as I read the manuscript recently of a soon-to-be published book by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0907568213483599">Elise Prébin (2013)</xref>, whose account of being ‘adopted back’ by her South Korean birth kin breaks new ground in the exploration of how ‘family’ is (re)constituted in such circumstances and provides as well a moving account of her own coming into being as (‘once more’) the child of her birth mother and other relatives. The core of Prébin’s narrative, like Aronson’s and Schindele’s, is the painstaking process involved in rebuilding a relationship between a child that has been ‘lost’ to adoption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0907568213483599">Prébin, 2009</xref>) and her former relatives. The process is painstaking because it involves reimagining the nature of the parent–child relationship as flexible and dynamic, rather than as ‘given or absolute’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0907568213483599">Conrad, 2012</xref>: 205) and as continually coming into being ‘in relation to … experiences and other subjectivities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0907568213483599">2012</xref>: 205) –other mothers, other relationships – rather than rooted in time and place. Like subjectivity (which is the focus of Conrad’s analysis), the parent–child relationship is ‘ “performatively produced through the continuous unfolding of action” ’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0907568213483599">2012</xref>: 205, quoting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0907568213483599">Gallacher and Gallagher, 2008</xref>: 510), rather than ‘ “fixed and essential” ’ (quoting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0907568213483599">Warming, 2011</xref>: 49).</p>
<p>What is compelling about this approach to parenting or mothering as a ‘constellation’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0907568213483599">Fonseca, 2004</xref>) is that it works <italic>with</italic> the elements of ‘adoptee kinship’ – the experience that ‘ “I could be you, you could be him, he could be her” ’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0907568213483599">Kim, 2010</xref>: 95) – to create a new configuration. Adoptee kinship is constituted by the child’s legal abandonment and his or her orphan status, and captures the ways in which an adoption decree <italic>both</italic> cuts off the child from his or her ‘past’ <italic>and</italic> creates an adoptive body that is always already the child who was left behind (and see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0907568213483599">Yngvesson, 2002</xref>: 238–240 for a related argument). The blurring of these two bodies is arguably the ‘force’ – what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0907568213483599">Avery Gordon (1997</xref>: 8) describes as a kind of ‘seething presence’ – that ‘draws us affectively, sometimes against our will and always a bit magically, into the structure of feeling of a reality we come to experience, not as cold knowledge, but as transformative recognition,’ pulling the adopted child ‘back’ to an abandoned self that refuses to be ‘cut off’ by an adoption decree. This pull back and the potential it provides for ‘linking the adulterated chapter to the chapters surrounding it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0907568213483599">Lacan, 1977</xref>: 50) may provide the relational ground for reconceptualizing not only the forms of ‘kinning’ required to make families complete through adoption, but for reconfiguring the family template on which adoptive kinship is based.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0907568213483599">
<title>Becoming (adoptable)</title>
<p>In spite of the force of state policies and practices that are devised to fix the adopted child to her or his new family and to what is understood to be her or his ‘cultural identity’ in such a way that the child looks like who s/he ‘is,’ the ‘as ifs’ of adoptive kinship (as if genealogical, as if Ethiopian or Korean) exert a constant tug on the child to return to what are imagined to be his or her biological and cultural ‘origins.’ Such a return, or circulation back, promises self-completion: ‘finding oneself’ at the moment of discovering someone who ‘looks like me’ at the orphanage, or ‘touching ground’ in a world that is said to be one’s own. But as the narratives I have presented here suggest, returns are as likely to disrupt belongings as to complete them, in that they materialize moments of transition when one child who ‘might have been me’ was canceled and a new child came into being in its place.</p>
<p>In this article I have explored what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0907568213483599">Stern (2004</xref>: 7) describes as ‘present moments’ that mark these points of transformation in return trips by the adopted to the orphanages, hospitals, and families that were sites of their abandonment and their production as adoptable. I have focused particularly on the experience of encountering a ‘self’ that could have been (or could become) me, but whose development was fixed (in time and place) by ‘my’ production as a ‘good’ that could be chosen for circulation to Sweden or the United States in adoption. I argue that the experience of ‘grooming for adoption’ at the orphanage and/or of culture-keeping in the adoptive family to create a child who is a commoditized replica of his or her ‘culture,’ produces what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0907568213483599">Eleana Kim (2010</xref>: 95) describes as ‘adoptee kinship’ – the experience of exchangeability, such that ‘ “I could be you, you could be him, he could be her.” ’ I juxtapose the conjunction of exchangeability and of alienation that is an effect of the cut-offs that characterize adoptee kinship, with the efforts of Swedish and American adoptees to develop a more fluid constellation of kin from the fragments that remained in the aftermath of their adoption. Like the constellation of mothers described above, such assemblages suggest the potential for a different kind of circulation, one that is contingent on the child’s <italic>engagement</italic> in relationships – on the child’s ‘enchainment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0907568213483599">Yngvesson, 2002</xref>: 238–240) – rather than on the child’s freedom, opening up the possibility of forms of family and of subjectivity that are fluid rather than fixed and performative rather than essential, while complicating standardizing depictions of the kinds of relational configurations that are ‘in the best interest of the child.’</p>

<p>In this article, I focus on the mother–daughter relationship – the relationship of adopted women to their birth (and to a lesser extent to their adoptive) mothers – and its implications for their rethinking of subjectivity, family, and belonging. My focus on mothers and daughters is an effect, at least in part, of my ongoing connection to a group of women adoptees who now have children of their own and whose discussion of their own relationship to a birth parent, a birth record, and their own (biological) child has provided a way for me to begin to engage with the generational impact of adoption, as well as allowing me to experiment with the ways ‘dynamic temporality’ may be fruitful for understanding the significance of childhood for the subjectivity of the adult adoptee. I hope to expand this work in the future to include attention to the gendered dimensions of these issues.</p>

<p>Interviews included in this article were carried out between 1995 and 2011 as part of an NSF-funded research project. They were selected from a larger sample of interviews conducted with 24 transnationally adopted young adults and adults between the ages of 18 and 40 who were adopted in Sweden or the United States. Names of interviewees were changed when they so requested. Most, however, requested that I not change their names, since the erasure of identities in legal adoption has been a key issue for adoptees, and some of those interviewed for this article had a particular investment in using the name they were given at birth, together with their legal (adoptive) surname.</p>

<p>Significance of the adopted child’s ‘difference’ is not the same, cross-nationally. In Sweden, for example, a key feature of adoptive parenting is to insure the ‘Swedishness’ of the adopted child and his or her difference from ‘the immigrant child’; but the tension between ‘inside’ Swedishness and an ‘outside’ marked by ‘cultural’ difference is central to a multicultural state project that encourages certain forms of difference as long as ‘the Swedish’ is undisturbed.
