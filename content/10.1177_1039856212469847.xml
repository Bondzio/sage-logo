<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>We were interested in psychiatry training in relation to patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Accordingly, we surveyed junior consultants and advanced trainees across different hospital networks in Victoria, and asked them whether they were satisfied with the amount of training they received for treating patients with BPD.</p>
<p>A total of 40 medical staff participated in the survey (28 advanced psychiatric trainees, nine junior consultant psychiatrists who were within 3 years of finishing their training, and three who did not state their level of training). Surveys were distributed during routine training offered to psychiatric medical staff in three different Victorian public mental health services. A survey instrument was constructed for the study (internal reliability Cronbach alpha coefficient .915). It comprised eight questions, which asked about the usefulness of training for treating BPD, along with confidence in treating BPD in specific clinical settings and for making clinical decisions. Usefulness was rated as poor, adequate, good, very good or excellent. Confidence was rated as not confident, somewhat confident, adequately confident, very confident, or extremely confident. The survey also included a number of qualitative questions.</p>
<p>We found that that respondents believed that their training for treating BPD in the areas of case formulation, risk management, prescribing medications, team dynamics, informing clients/families about diagnosis, and providing psychotherapy was not very useful. They also indicated that they lacked confidence in knowing how to respond to patients with BPD in emergency department settings. Their responses to survey questions were not significantly affected by whether they were junior consultants or advanced trainees (<italic>p</italic>&gt;.05). Respondents stated that they thought there should be more emphasis on BPD in the curriculum, particularly in regard to learning psychotherapeutic approaches for BPD.</p>
<p>A closer examination of the responses revealed that trainees felt there was an overemphasis on prescribing medications and not enough training in psychotherapeutic treatments for BPD. This is of interest in light of the Draft National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) clinical guidelines for the management of BPD, which recommend the use of structured psychological therapies that have been specifically designed for BPD. The draft guidelines suggest that medication should not be used as a primary therapy for BPD because it does not change the nature and course of the disorder. The guidelines further state that time-limited use of medicines can be considered as an adjunct to psychological therapy to manage specific symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212469847">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Based on our survey results, we would like to make a number of suggestions for training. First, we suggest that the Victorian and wider RANZCP training objectives be reviewed so that the weighting given to BPD is equivalent to that given to other serious mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia. Second, we recommend that the training is founded on competency-based assessment in line with the RANZCP fellowship competency statement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212469847">2</xref></sup> Under the medical expert criteria, trainees need to be able to demonstrate skills in psychotherapeutic and other interventions to treat patients with complex health conditions (criterion 5). They also need to be able to critically apply research, psychiatric knowledge, and treatment guidelines to enhance patient outcomes (criterion 7). In order for trainees to meet this requirement in respect to BPD, they need to be able to provide psychotherapy for these patients and offer treatment that is consistent with NHMRC guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212469847">1</xref></sup> Finally, we suggest that public mental health services need to provide more opportunities for trainees to take on psychotherapy cases that relate to BPD, to acquire training in psychotherapeutic approaches for BPD, and to gain access and exposure to opportunities provided by specialist BPD services.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our survey results suggest that psychiatric trainees would benefit from changes in RANZCP training so that the training is more reflective of the demand and need in public mental health for treating cases of BPD. Training should be consistent with the upcoming release of the NHMRC clinical guidelines for treating BPD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212469847">1</xref></sup> (We wish to thank A/Prof Richard Newton for his contribution to this manuscript.)</p>
