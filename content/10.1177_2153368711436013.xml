<abstract>
<p>Data from a survey of residents of a Southern Ute Indian reservation in Colorado carried out by Abril (2007) are used to compare perceptions of crime seriousness held by members of an American Indian tribe with those of non-Indians living on the same reservation. There are few significant or substantial differences between the two groups. These findings bear on debates in criminology and the sociology of law regarding the extent to which the content of the criminal law reflects a broad consensus in society or entails the imposition of rules made by and for dominant groups on subordinate groups holding different cultural values and norms. Additional data are deployed to assess subcultural explanations of high levels of interpersonal violence on American Indian reservations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The degree to which assessments of the seriousness of crimes are socially uniform has long figured in theorizing about crime. Louis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2153368711436013">Wirth (1931</xref>) and Thorsten <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2153368711436013">Sellin (1938)</xref>, for example, maintained that group differences in moral standards of different segments of the American population lead to crime when children socialized into one morality violate legal norms reflecting a different ethic. In Edwin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2153368711436013">Sutherland’s (1939)</xref> formulation of differential association theory, differences in definitions of criminality among different social groups also explain group differences in involvement in crime. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2153368711436013">Wolfgang and Ferracuti (1967</xref>) argued that spatial variation in levels of violence reflects subculturally distinct appraisals of violence.</p>
<p>Some historical patterns provide <italic>prima facie</italic> support for the pluralist position, at least in relation to some laws and some violations of those laws. No one could seriously doubt that Jim Crow laws supporting racial segregation in the United States. South—and the seriousness of violations of those laws—were differentially appraised by Blacks and Whites; that apartheid in South Africa was differently regarded by Black and White South Africans; and that Nazi race laws and their violations were differently assessed by German Jews and non-Jews. During the Prohibition Era in the United States, “wets” and “drys” held highly disparate views of the Volstead Act, and of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in violation of this act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2153368711436013">Sinclair, 1962</xref>).</p>
<p>A contemporary Asian episode gives further support to the pluralist perspective. Following the recent conviction in Pakistan of a defendant who justified the assassination of a governor who defended the rights of women and minorities by referring to the victim’s “blasphemous” statements, the audience in the court “showered him with rose petals,” and some of his supporters “burned tires and denounced the sentence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2153368711436013">New York Times, 2011</xref>). Events like this arise regularly in connection with contentious politics. They are associated with law violations that are undertaken to advance a political cause, and in relation to the state’s deployment of the law to intervene in political conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2153368711436013">Turk, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these well-known examples of cultural diversity in the assessment of laws and their violations, some major theorists have held that when it comes to the criminal law’s core prohibitions of interpersonal violence and theft, attitudes among various social groups are fairly homogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2153368711436013">Kornhauser, 1978</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2153368711436013">Robert Merton’s (1938)</xref> anomie theory posits the existence of a fairly uniform American culture that encourages striving for success, while de-emphasizing the importance of adhering to lawful means when doing so.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2153368711436013">1</xref>
</sup> Merton’s failure to discuss cultural differences in assessments of the wrongfulness of criminal acts as contributing to class differences in criminality suggests that he did not consider them important. Even parents who violate the law themselves, Travis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2153368711436013">Hirschi (1969</xref>, pp. 108–109) has argued, are unlikely to let their children know of this, much less encourage or reward their children for illegal activity. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2153368711436013">Sykes and Matza (1957</xref>) suggest that parents will generally endorse conventional values as to the wrongfulness of delinquency even when they themselves engage in illegal activities. Consequently parents are unlikely to transmit their own idiosyncratic views to their offspring, and there will be little correlation between parental views and their children’s views.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2153368711436013">2</xref>
</sup> It follows that even if there is some individual variation in attitudes toward the law and its prohibitions, these differences do not contribute to stable, self-perpetuating group differences in attitudes toward crime, or in criminal behavior.</p>
<p>This early body of theorizing rested largely on impressions about the homogeneity of culture, rather than systematically collected data on attitudes and opinions. Some of the work reasoned circularly, with high levels of crime being taken as indicators of a subculture of violence, whose existence explained the high levels of crime. More recently, however, survey researchers have attempted to assess the uniformity of social values in the United States, permitting questions of cultural homogeneity to be addressed empirically. One recent summary of this body of research concludes that “all people in the United States, regardless of social class, share an overarching set of values” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2153368711436013">Tittle &amp; Paternoster, 2000</xref>, p. 420, drawing on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2153368711436013">McClosky &amp; Zeller, 1984</xref>, p. 11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2153368711436013">Reinarman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2153368711436013">Tittle, 1980</xref>, pp. 42–53). Because assessments of crime seriousness rest on the values protected by the laws that define crimes, these findings seemingly imply that there is low variation in assessments of crime seriousness in the contemporary United States. Values, however, are very broad, and even when they are shared, they may be applied differently to specific policy issues by different individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2153368711436013">McClosky &amp; Zeller, 1984</xref>, p. 231). For example, two individuals might agree on the importance of protecting human life, but disagree on the implications of this importance for abortion rights. Likewise, two persons might strongly value marriage but differ on the acceptability of same-sex marriage. Some researchers have, therefore, tried to measure assessments of the seriousness of criminal offenses among different socially defined groups within the United States and in other nations more directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2153368711436013">Evans &amp; Scott, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2153368711436013">Gibbons, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2153368711436013">Kornhauser, 1978</xref>, pp. 214–242; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2153368711436013">Newman, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2153368711436013">Rose &amp; Prell, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2153368711436013">Rossi &amp; Henry, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2153368711436013">Rossi, Waite, Bose, &amp; Berk, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2153368711436013">Schrager &amp; Short, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2153368711436013">Scott and Thakeb, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2153368711436013">Sellin &amp; Wolfgang, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2153368711436013">Warr, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2153368711436013">Wolfgang, Figlio, Tracy, &amp; Singer, 1985</xref>). This research has identified some variation in public rankings of crime seriousness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2153368711436013">Tittle’s (1980)</xref> survey shows significant disagreement on the moral unacceptability of marijuana smoking and illegal gambling, much less for assaults and thefts. While some of this research identifies group differences in crime seriousness evaluations, overall, the differences appear not to be large.</p>
<p>Given the existence of some evidence that is supportive of each position, as well as evidence that is inconsistent with each position, it seems imprudent to treat the two perspectives as mutually incompatible, that is, as if one position had to be 100% right and the other 100% wrong. It is a fair generalization of the empirical evidence to assert that in all large-scale complex societies, there are some points of relatively strong consensus and some of substantial dissent, some points in time at which dissent is expressed in overt conflict, and others in which it is not. With this understanding, theory and research might profitably focus on the extent and social location of agreement and disagreement, and on the circumstances under which overt conflict emerges, is expressed, and comes to an end.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-2153368711436013">3</xref>
</sup> This line of investigation can be advanced by research that identifies issues along which populations divide, and considers the ways in which these divisions become manifest.</p>
<p>The present study is intended as a small contribution to this enterprise by building on research conducted by Julie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2153368711436013">Abril (2007</xref>) to compare assessments of crime seriousness held by Indian and non-Indian residents of a Southern Ute Indian reservation located in southwest Colorado. Abril’s study is the first to examine assessments of crime seriousness held by American Indians, and to compare their views with those of non-Indians. As such, it extends the investigation of cultural difference into an understudied domain.</p>
<p>Abril uses the assessments of crime seriousness she collected in her research to test ideas about the effect of perceived collective efficacy on assessments of crime seriousness and to compare the assessments of Indians with those of Indians residing on the reservation. She also studies appraisals of violations of Indian cultural norms that are not embodied in the criminal law. An American Indian reservation is of particular interest for the study of cultural differences in perceptions of crime seriousness and cultural norm violations because it may be more isolated socially and culturally from “mainstream” American society than other populations that have been studied in this connection. Arguably, residents of American cities are exposed through schools, jobs, and mass media to the range of norms and values of the broader society, even if they live in racially or ethnically segregated neighborhoods. This may be less true on an Indian reservation. If there are important attitudinal differences toward behavioral norms, they should be found here.</p>
<p>Abril’s analysis of the measures of crime seriousness in her sample concludes that there are substantial differences in perceptions of crime seriousness between the two groups.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-2153368711436013">4</xref>
</sup> For each of the 16 crime categories she studied, she reports a probability of .000, meaning that the likelihood of the observed differences arising from the vagaries of random sampling from a population in which the true differences are 0 is less than 1 in 1,000. For nine of the crime categories, non-Indians rated the crime as more serious than Indians, while for the remaining seven categories, Indians rated the crime more serious. A comparison of the mean ratings given by Indians and non-Indians in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2153368711436013">Table 1</xref> of this article shows which group rated the given crime as more serious.</p>

<italic>Note</italic>: Starred offenses failed the homogeneity of variance test at the .05 level. Means and standard deviations for individual offenses are taken from Table 5 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2153368711436013">Abril (2007</xref>); for overall seriousness ratings, from Abril’s Table 2.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>All of the cultural values tests in Abril’s analysis yielded significant differences, some at the .05 or .01 level, others at the .001 level. For each of the 10 comparisons involving violations of cultural norms, Indians rated a violation as more serious than did non-Indians. However, eye-ball inspection of Abril’s significance tests for the crime differences (in her Table 5 on p. 190) shows that they cannot be correct. The differences in group means for each crime are quite small, while the standard deviations are substantial. It would take a much larger sample for differences so small to be significant at the .000 level. This apparent miscomputation suggests the need for further analysis. This article presents such a reanalysis in the form of a replication that utilizes Abril’s data to reexamine the differences between Indian residents’ assessments of crime seriousness and those of non-Indians. This reanalysis confirms that one part of her statistical analysis contains computational errors. Specifically, the probabilities associated with Abril’s <italic>t</italic> tests for the differences of means measuring perceptions of crime seriousness are incorrect.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2153368711436013">
<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>Abril’s data set consists of responses to a 72-item questionnaire by 667 residents of the reservation, of whom 312 were Indian. The remaining 355 were not. The achieved sample consists of a 31.8% response rate (based on the 2,096 adult reservation residents who were sent the questionnaire). As detailed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2153368711436013">Abril (2007</xref>), the Indians in the sample were contacted on the basis of being listed in the tribal enrollment register, while the non-Indians were selected randomly from the county voter registration. Seriousness ratings on a 6-point scale were obtained for 16 different types of crimes and also for breaches of 10 different Indian cultural values. Subjects were classified as Indian or non-Indian on the basis of subject self-reports.</p>
<p>Following Abril, the present analysis uses Student’s<italic> t </italic>statistics to assess the statistical significance of the mean differences between the two groups of responses to the various items in the survey instrument. Prior to the computation of the <italic>t</italic> statistic, I carried out an <italic>F</italic> test for the homogeneity of variance. The results of this test for the equality of the variances of the scores in the two groups dictated the formula used to pool data from the two groups in estimating the standard error of the estimated difference of means<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-2153368711436013">5</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2153368711436013">Blalock, 1972</xref>, pp. 220–228; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2153368711436013">Sattherthwaite, 1946</xref>). All tests were conducted at the .05 significance level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2153368711436013">
<title>Results</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2153368711436013">Table 1</xref> displays the mean seriousness ratings and the standard deviations of those ratings for each of 16 different offenses, and for the overall mean seriousness ratings. Asterisks identify the variables characterized by inhomogeneity of variance.</p>
<p>Of the 16 coefficients in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2153368711436013">Table 1</xref>, only two are significant at the .05 level. Specifically, on average, Indians thought that taking someone’s work tools was less serious than non-Indians believed, and that drinking alcoholic beverages in public was more serious than non-Indians considered it to be. For just one of these offenses—stealing someone’s tools—the difference between the two group means was significant at the .02 level. For the other 14 offenses, the differences were not significant at the .05 level.</p>
<p>Before taking these few significant differences seriously, it must be recalled that when conducting multiple tests, the likelihood of finding a “significant” effect by chance increases. In carrying out 16 independent tests at the .05 level, the chances of obtaining two or more significant coefficients by chance when there are actually no differences in the population can be computed from the binomial distribution to be .394. The probability of obtaining one significant result in 16 independent tests at the .02 level is .04, which fails to achieve statistical significance at the .02 level. Both results suggest that there is a nontrivial possibility of the differences found in the sample being absent in the population from which the sample was drawn.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, the <italic>t</italic> test is problematic for our analysis in that it is based on the assumption of a simple random sample, which is not the case here due to the nonresponses. It is unknown whether the nonresponsiveness was distributed at random among the target population of the survey. I, like Abril, and indeed, like most researchers who analyze survey data, ignore the potential biases that could have been introduced by the exclusion of nonresponsive subjects from the analysis.</p>
<p>In addition, the <italic>t-</italic>tests are based on the assumption of statistical independence, which, technically speaking, is not valid here, because the same respondents rated each of the 16 items. Fortunately, in this particular analysis, the nonindependence of the ratings does not bias the analysis. The results obtained from the comparison of means through <italic>t </italic>tests are identical to those obtained by regressing the outcome variable on a dummy variable specifying a respondent as Indian or non-Indian. The regression coefficient for the dummy variable will be equal to the difference of group means, and the <italic>t </italic>test for the coefficient will be the same as well. Provided that the independent variable is the same in all regressions, the same coefficients and <italic>t</italic> tests are obtained even when the ratings are correlated as a result of having been carried out by the same subjects, when the estimation is done using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2153368711436013">Zellner’s (1962)</xref> “seemingly unrelated regressions,” a generalized least squares estimation procedure that takes the nonvanishing correlations of the prediction errors into account. These coefficients and their associated <italic>t</italic> tests are identical to the ordinary least squares estimates. In our case, the relevant predictor is the dummy variable distinguishing Indians from non-Indians. Consequently, the nonindependence of observations is not relevant to our estimation procedure. But the results suggest that any differences observed in Abril’s survey may be due to nothing more than the random fluctuations associated with the sampling. In addition, we have seven tests with positive signs and nine with negative signs, a result that is also consistent with chance fluctuations produced by a generating process in which the distinction between Indians and others is largely irrelevant.</p>
<p>A further analysis, suggested by this pattern of alternating signs for the differences, makes it possible to test whether, overall, Indians and non-Indians differ in the degree to which they consider criminal law violations to be serious. Abril carries out such a test by summing the seriousness ratings for the 16 offenses, and testing the mean of the sums for the two groups for statistical significance. This procedure has the appealing feature of reducing measurement error relative to true score variation, because random errors will tend to average out to zero when the summation is done over 16 different measured outcomes. Abril reports that the summed seriousness ratings for the Indians were 66.60, with a standard deviation of 12.073, while for the non-Indians, they were 66.74 with a standard deviation of 10.785. She indicates that the probability associated with this difference is .000, which is highly significant. When correctly computed on the assumption that the two variances are unequal, however, the probability level is actually .89. It is safe to say that the Indians and non-Indians are in strong agreement as to the overall seriousness of the criminal offenses studied.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-2153368711436013">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Introductory statistics courses commonly emphasize that tests of statistical significance do not measure the importance of observed differences. For that purpose, one should look at the magnitudes of differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2153368711436013">McCloskey, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2153368711436013">McCloskey &amp; Ziliak, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2153368711436013">Morrison &amp; Henkel, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2153368711436013">Ziliak &amp; McCloskey, 2008</xref>). Comparing mean seriousness ratings of Indians with those of non-Indians, we see that the largest difference is for drinking alcoholic beverages in public. Here, the difference is 3.42–3.17, or .25. On average, then, the mean seriousness of this offense as rated by Indians, was about 8% higher than the ratings given by non-Indians. This is not a large difference. Both Indians and non-Indians rated this offense as the least serious of the 16. For the other offenses, the differences were smaller.</p>
<p>The previous tests compared the absolute differences in seriousness ratings of the two groups. Another way we can assess the differences is to examine the correlation between the two groups’ ratings for the 16 offenses. Pearson’s <italic>r </italic>for the mean ratings is .974, while Spearman’s ρ is .972. Consequently, the relative seriousness rankings of the Indians and non-Indians correspond almost perfectly.</p>
<sec id="section4-2153368711436013">
<title>Implications for Law</title>
<p>Abril’s analysis concluded that there were significant differences between Indians and non-Indians living on the same reservation community in the seriousness with which they view criminal law violations. The reanalysis of the data presented here finds little evidence of those differences. The magnitudes of the average ratings of crime seriousness for different offenses were small, and most of them were not statistically significant.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-2153368711436013">7</xref>
</sup> In another part of her study, Abril found significant differences in the seriousness with which violations of traditional tribal norms and valences (such as disrespect for tribal elders, non-Indians practicing traditional spiritual ceremonies or trespassing on Indian ceremonial or burial grounds) were regarded. These results were in the direction anticipated: Indians thought these infractions to be worse than non-Indians, and they were moderate in magnitude. When it comes to violations of the criminal law, however, we do not see evidence of cultural pluralism. Indians and non-Indians ranked the seriousness of different crimes quite similarly in both absolute terms, and relative to one another. This study, then, lends added support to the findings of other researchers, that assessments of crime seriousness for run-of-the-mill crimes are relatively homogeneous among social groups in the contemporary United States. Because this finding pertains to a comparatively isolated social group, where one might think differences in perceptions of crime seriousness would be more pronounced, the finding suggests that it may be futile to continue searching for them in settings where social and cultural integration is larger.</p>
<p>The findings that crime seriousness perceptions are similar among reservation Indians and non-Indians is consistent with several different theoretical perspectives on the origins of law and its functions in modern society. A functionalist might see the similarities in assessments as indicating that by and large, the core of the criminal law maintains norms that are necessary to the functioning of an organized, orderly collective social life. Because the behavioral norms benefit every group, they would be valued by Indians and non-Indians alike. A conflict theorist studying survey results like those analyzed here but deriving from other Indian reservations might see the results as demonstrating the success of the U.S. government in reducing original differences between Whites and Indians to insignificance in the decades since the U.S. government defeated the Indians militarily, and established reservations. However, the Southern Utes were never defeated militarily by the U.S. government; they consented to a treaty without having fought a battle. Still, the threat of military action very likely figured in this decision, and the establishment of the reservation may still have led to a partial loss of cultural autonomy. This possibility suggests that a static comparison of perceptions at a particular moment may fail to reveal cultural differences that existed in the historic past, but that have been obliterated by social processes in which one group comes to dominate another and suppresses the norms and supporting culture of the subordinated group. Consequently, the historian and the anthropologist may be as relevant as the survey researcher in providing information about cultural differences in crime seriousness evaluations.</p>

<title>Implications for the Etiology of Homicide</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2153368711436013">Wolfgang and Ferracuti (1967</xref>), there should be a close correspondence between homicide rates and cultural assessments of homicide. If we take the views of the non-Indians living on the Southern Ute reservation as typical of non-Indians more generally, we can test this correspondence by comparing homicide rates on the reservation with rates outside the reservation. In all of 2008 up to November 25 of that year, there were two homicides on the reservation. This figure provides a lower limit for the homicide count in 2008. The total population of the reservation was about 8,000, implying a rate of about 25 per 100,000 population<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-2153368711436013">8</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2153368711436013">Burnett, 2006</xref>). This contrasts with a murder rate of about 3.3 per 100,000 in Colorado in 2006, and 3.1 per 100,000 in 2007 (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2009). Subject to the uncertainties associated with the estimation of a rate based on an extremely small number of cases, the Southern Ute reservation has an exceptionally high homicide rate. We do not have information as to whether the homicides on the reservation were committed by Indians or non-Indians, but the survey research does not suggest that this high rate could be due to views of homicide that are distinct to Southern Utes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-2153368711436013">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Further evidence that the American Indian population cannot be considered carriers of a subculture of violence comes from patterns of victimization. Between 1976 and 2001, Indians were just 0.7% of murder victims in the United States, a slightly smaller percentage than their representation in the population, 0.9%. Of these killings, the offender was White, Black, or Asian in about 43% of the time. Though Indians had higher rates of victimization of violent crimes not ending in death than other racial–ethnic groups, victims often reported that their assailants were White or Black, not Indian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2153368711436013">Perry, 2004</xref>). Of all those arrested for violent crimes (homicide, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault), about 1% were Indian, in line with population percentages (FBI, 2001, p. 252, table 43; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2153368711436013">Perry, 2004</xref>). The high homicide rate on the Southern Ute reservation, then, appears to be structural in origin, rather than subcultural. The stereotype that Indian reservations are economically depressed would lead one to suspect that extreme poverty is the relevant structural condition underlying the high homicide rate, but the Southern Utes are one of the wealthiest American Indian tribes,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-2153368711436013">10</xref>
</sup> making this explanation suspect. If further research confirms that homicide rates on the reservation are substantially higher than elsewhere in Colorado, the factors responsible warrant further investigation.</p>

<p>Of the many studies examining the effects parents have on their children’s involvement in juvenile delinquency, only a few directly examine the correlation between parents’ views of the seriousness of different delinquent acts and those of their children. One of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2153368711436013">Liska, 1973</xref>) found the correlations to be small to moderate in magnitude (0.18 for interpersonal aggression, 0.25 for theft, and 0.40 for vandalism) in a sample of university students. Studies that examine the impact of parental attitudes on children’s use of alcohol or recreational drugs typically find a relationship, but one that is weaker than the influence of peers (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2153368711436013">Bahr, Hoffman, &amp; Yang, 2005</xref>).

<p>In this connection, it is worth noting that conflict need not imply differences in values. Conflict can arise between individuals or groups when they value the same thing, and there is not enough of it to satisfy all desires. Social theorists have been aware of this possibility at least since Thomas Hobbes argued in his Leviathan that men’s pursuit of wealth and glory in the state of nature would, unless checked, lead to a war of all against all.</p>

Abril reports logistic regression coefficients for five independent variables and an intercept, along with their standard errors. She reports four of these coefficients as having an associated probability that is .004 or less, indicating that these coefficients are highly significant. She indicates that two variables have nonsignificant probabilities—collective efficacy (<italic>p</italic> = .124) and crime seriousness (<italic>p</italic> = .146). In logistic regression, the ratio of coefficient to standard error follows a normal distribution. When I conducted this test by comparing the observed ratio with a normal distribution for each of Abril’s six coefficients, I obtained probabilities ranging from .82 to .99. None of them comes close to statistical significance at the .05 level. Abril also quotes a Wald statistic for each coefficient. The Wald statistic is distributed as a chi-square. None of Abril’s Wald statistics comes close to significance. It is not clear from Abril’s narrative just what models are being summarized in this table, but whatever models they are, the significance levels she reports appear to be badly in error.</p>

<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2153368711436013">Abril (2005: ix)</xref>, there are approximately 1,500 Southern Utes living within the boundaries of the reservation, as well as about another 11,000 non-Utes, of whom about 30% are American Indians. Using this larger population estimate reduces the homicide rate by about a third. This lower rate is still quite high by Colorado standards. However, because the rate is computed on the basis of a very small number of homicides, the computed rate is not estimated with great accuracy.</p>
