<p>In his attempt to win reelection to the presidency in 1964, Lyndon Johnson went to great lengths to portray his opponent, Senator Barry Goldwater, as a radical hot-head, who was far too likely to resort to nuclear weapons in conflicts with other countries to be safe as president. As part of this effort, the Johnson campaign’s advertising agency, Doyle, Dane, Bernbach (DDB) ventured beyond previously accepted practice to develop advertisements that relied on emotion rather than analysis and reason to convince voters to elect Johnson. Most prominent among those efforts was what became known as the Daisy Girl ad, which portrayed a 3-year-old girl in a field picking flowers. She picks a daisy and begins plucking the petals from the flower. The camera zooms in on her right eye and the scene changes to a mission control countdown that leads to the detonation of a nuclear bomb. The final shot is a graphic that urges a vote for President Johnson in the November election.</p>
<p>Although the ad only ran once as a paid commercial, news coverage was extensive. An estimated 100 million people saw the ad as it was played repeatedly during newscasts. The reaction from the Goldwater campaign was immediate and fierce, even leading the campaign to complain to election officials about the ad.</p>
<p>In his book about the Daisy Girl ad and its effects, Louisiana State University professor Robert Mann argues that the Daisy Girl ad revolutionized political advertising. He says the ad, “and the other spots produced for Johnson qualify as the first television spots of the modern political era—an era in which presidential candidates increasingly and effectively used emotion, not reason, to win elections” (p. 109). Prior to the Johnson ads, Mann says political advertising consisted mainly of speeches, interviews, call-in programs, and documentary films—a far cry from the 30- and 60-s spots that have since become commonplace.</p>
<p>In <italic>Daisy Petals and Mushroom Clouds</italic>, Mann first describes the political situation in the United States. He details how the Kennedy administration dealt with the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 and how it resulted in Americans’ collective fear of the seeming likelihood of nuclear war with the Soviet Union. He then moves to an examination of Goldwater’s numerous statements about the use of nuclear power and why war is sometimes needed in extreme circumstances, thus laying a basis for why the Daisy Girl ad was effective. Mann describes Goldwater’s ill-advised comments about allowing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization commanders decision-making authority about when to use tactical nuclear weapons in the event of an attack by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in Europe. Mann also details the Goldwater comments’ effect on the primaries and other preparations for the 1964 presidential campaign.</p>
<p>The book then turns to a detailed examination of how DDB was chosen to prepare the advertising campaign for the Johnson presidential run, followed by a discussion of considerations within the reelection team about the wisdom of the radically new advertising campaign. The final two historiographical chapters examine the public and Johnson campaign reactions to the ad, and how the Goldwater team responded. In his conclusion, Mann draws on the evidence presented in earlier chapters to justify his thesis that the Daisy Girl ad changed political advertising forever.</p>
<p>Mann’s book is highly readable and well sourced. Many of the sources are original documents found in the Johnson Presidential Library in Austin, TX. Others are contemporary press reports from the era. He also cites other scholars’ research, particularly in the area of political advertising. A strength of the book is a lengthy appendix in which are reproduced many original memos from both the White House and the Democratic National Committee that give insight into the thought processes followed as the major players made decisions about the advertising campaign. The book also includes 16 pages of black and white photos showing the various players, screen captures of the Daisy Girl ad, representative DDB ads, and so forth. This inclusion adds excellent context and brings to life many of the important individuals discussed inside.</p>
<p>The book would be useful in a political communication or political advertising course, particularly at the graduate level. It could also be profitably used in an advanced undergraduate course.</p>
