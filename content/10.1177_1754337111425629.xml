<abstract>
<p>Seven cricket bats, four standard and three significantly different designs, were tested for a set of mechanical properties: equivalent bending stiffness, moment of inertia, and freely-suspended vibration. These properties are known to be related to the performance of the cricket bats in terms of pick up weight, vibrations imparted to the batsman, and energy imparted to the cricket ball. The aim of this work was to determine whether these novel designs improve the bat’s performance parameters. Intuitively correctly, results showed that by redistributing the mass of the bat further away from the rotational axis the moment of inertia increases. This results in an increase of the ball’s rebound speed after collision. Carbon fibres inserted in the handle of the bat were found to improve its vibrational performance and provide the advantage of having a stiffer blade combined with a relatively less-stiff handle, which is an optimum for imparting maximum energy to the ball.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>All bats used in professional cricket must comply with the laws of the game of cricket as stated in Law 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754337111425629">1</xref>]. The intention of Law 6 is to maintain the balance between bat and ball [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754337111425629">1</xref>], to ensure a fair access to equivalent-quality equipment for all, as well as encouraging innovation within the traditional parameters of the game.</p>
<p>Cricket bat performance can be defined in terms of a number of key parameters, including ‘sweet spot’, stiffness, moment of inertia, and coefficient of restitution. The transfer of energy at the sweet spot is maximal, resulting in the most powerful shots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754337111425629">2</xref>], while the transfer of energy to the hands is minimal, resulting in minimum reaction force at the hands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754337111425629">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754337111425629">3</xref>]. In order to increase the ‘sweet spot’ zone, various attempts have been made to introduce the use of alternative materials in bat design, such as aluminium for the blade or a hollow handle filled with a carbon fibre core [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754337111425629">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754337111425629">6</xref>]. These designs do not conform to the current definition of the laws of the game and are currently banned from professional games. However, several composite bats are available on the open market.</p>
<p>During bat–ball collisions a certain amount of energy is absorbed by deformation of the bat and is dissipated in the form of vibrations. The magnitude of these vibrations as felt at the handle by the batsman depend on the location of the impact on the bat’s hitting surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754337111425629">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754337111425629">3</xref>]. The bat vibrates at a certain frequency range which is determined by the impulse duration. This corresponds to the natural frequency at which the bat vibrates and is affected by its mass characteristics, stiffness, and geometric profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754337111425629">3</xref>]. Experimental modal analysis has enabled researchers to define each bat’s ‘sweet spot’ as the region of low vibrational energy absorption. A mode shape or vibrational mode is a pattern of motion in which a structure vibrates at a certain frequency and indicates the level of excitation. A node of a vibration mode is the point at which there is no vibration of the bat. Nodal point positions are important when assessing bat performance, since vibrational modes are not excited when the ball strikes the bat at nodes of given modes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754337111425629">3</xref>]. In this case little or no energy is absorbed by the bat and, hence, the lower frequency vibrations are not excited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754337111425629">2</xref>]. This results in high frequency vibrations with small magnitudes being observed due to a phenomenon known as the dwell time. The dwell time of an impact is the length of time for which the ball is in contact with the bat. During the dwell time the oscillation returns to the neutral position resulting in transfer of energy back into the ball and, hence, reducing the energy absorbed at high frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1754337111425629">7</xref>]. Thus, with the reasoning that for impacts at nodes the low frequency modes are not excited, minimal energy is absorbed and a definition of the ‘sweet spot’ of a bat is created.</p>
<p>The bat’s mass and moment of inertia determine the amount of effort required by the batsman not only to swing but also to control the bat during the swing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754337111425629">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1754337111425629">8</xref>]. The moment of inertia (MoI) is a direct measure of the ‘pick up’ weight of a bat, equivalent to the ‘swing weight’ of a tennis racquet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1754337111425629">9</xref>]. Taking under consideration that during impact the bat behaves in some respect as a physical pendulum, Gutaj [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1754337111425629">7</xref>] estimated the bat’s moment of inertia by measuring the vibration period of a torsional pendulum arrangement, a technique previously used by Brody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1754337111425629">9</xref>] for measuring the moment of inertia of tennis rackets. Fleisig <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1754337111425629">10</xref>] defined the linear and angular velocities of baseball and softball bats using motion data and showed that a linear correlation exists between bat linear velocity and bat MoI. Several authors have shown that there is a clear correlation between the MoI and the coefficient of restitution (CoR) (the ratio of the difference of the bat’s and the ball’s velocities after the collision to that before the collision) of a bat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754337111425629">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1754337111425629">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1754337111425629">11</xref>]. Smith and Cruz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754337111425629">6</xref>] suggested that swing speed of the bat increases non-linearly as the MoI of the bat decreases, and this is intuitive as, unlike in baseball, where there is always a near-horizontal swing, the cricket bat most frequently is struck by swinging toward gravitation. The increase in swing speed will provide a greater resultant ball-batted speed. However, it is also suggested that the decrease in MoI would reduce the effective swing weight of the bat and hence reduce the energy transfer from the bat to the ball [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1754337111425629">9</xref>]. In reality, there is a competition between the two factors, where the bat angular momentum due to MoI has a slightly larger effect than the swing speed resulting from a reduced weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754337111425629">6</xref>]. A study by Singh and Smith [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1754337111425629">12</xref>] showed that by keeping constant bat–ball CoR, a 4.5 per cent increase in MoI can increase bat performance by 0.85 per cent. In addition, a bat with a greater MoI imparts greater energy to the ball for the same angular velocity and thus will strike the ball further. There are two ways of increasing the MoI of a bat. The first is to increase the mass of a bat. The second is to redistribute the mass of the bat further away from the rotational axis. In the light of the different designs of bat available that have significantly redistributed mass by reducing blade hitting area, it was decided to quantify the MoI of the different bats available according to the method of Brody [<bold>9</bold>].</p>
<p>Bat stiffness is a term frequently used in bat design and can refer to either the bat’s flexural rigidity or radial stiffness. Flexural rigidity of a material is the force required to bend the object by unit length whereas radial stiffness of a bat is its resistance to deformation when a force is applied. Studies conducted by Smith and Cruz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754337111425629">6</xref>] and Gutaj [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1754337111425629">7</xref>] showed that the bat’s CoR increased when the flexural rigidity of the bat was increased, but decreased when the radial stiffness increased. This provides a conflict in the design stage of a bat, and the bat stiffness must be closely monitored to provide optimum CoR, as bats with higher CoR will produce the greatest post-impact ball velocity.</p>
<p>The aim of this work is to test a selection of cricket bats – two of which contravene Law 6 – to determine whether these novel designs have an effect on their physical properties and performance. Based on the analysis of the literature, bat stiffness (bending stiffness), moment of inertia, and freely suspended vibration analysis were conducted, as these physical properties have been directly associated with rebound characteristics of the bats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754337111425629">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1754337111425629">11</xref>].</p>

<title>2.1 Vibration analysis</title>
<p>All cricket bats were excited with the impulse hammer technique, where an impulse hammer is used to excite the bat over a range of frequencies and a miniature accelerometer (ICP, PCB Piezotronics, NY, USA) is used to measure the frequency response. By selecting one response location and exciting the structure at several different points along the bat’s hitting surface all of the structure’s modal parameters can be obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1754337111425629">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1754337111425629-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>A two-channel FFT analyser was used to calculate the ratio of acceleration over force and the frequency range was set at 0–1200 Hz. The accelerometer was attached on the back of the blade near the toe region using a thin layer of wax. This position was chosen as it did not correspond to any of the nodes of vibration, so was likely to detect the greatest amplitude at lower modes of vibration.</p>
<p>Each of the cricket bats tested had a series of equally spaced impact points along the blade’s hitting surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1754337111425629">Fig. 2</xref>). Only Bat 1 had seven horizontal lines instead of nine because of its shorter blade. During testing each of the points was impacted three times by the hammer and the average frequency response was quantified using appropriate software SignalCalc ACE (Dynamic signal analyzer, Data Physics, Silicon Valley, USA). To ensure accuracy during repeated impacts at each point the coherence function was used as a data quality assessment tool to identify how much of the output signal was related to the measured input signal.</p>

</fig>
<p>The average frequency response was used to determine the natural frequencies of the modes of vibration of the bat excited upon impact. In this study the bat was ‘freely suspended’ during testing. The ‘freely suspended’ boundary condition strings are used in order to support the bat in two positions at the end of the handle and at the end of the blade so that the bat is free to vibrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1754337111425629">13</xref>] as the resonance frequencies and mode shapes of the bat under these support conditions best model the handheld response to ‘within 7 per cent’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754337111425629">3</xref>]. As proposed by Brooks <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754337111425629">3</xref>], the mode shape coefficients for the first three bending modes were collected and scaled to unit mass. Under this scaling condition the modal mass can be viewed as the amount of mass that is participating in each mode of vibration. Since the structure was freely suspended during the test, then the low frequency residuals can be a direct measure of rigid body mass properties of the structure. The scaled mode shapes were used to calculate the energy absorbed at each excitation point on the blade maintaining constant the position of the accelerometer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754337111425629">3</xref>].</p>

<title>2.2 Moment of inertia</title>
<p>The moment of inertia about an axis through the handle of the bat was determined by turning the bat into a physical pendulum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1754337111425629">Fig. 3</xref>). The period of a physical pendulum is given by the formula:</p>

<p>A 0.006 m hole was drilled through the handle of the bat and a rod was inserted through the hole to form an axis of rotation. A frame was manufactured out of mild steel to support the rod so as to allow the bat to be held in a vertical position in order to swing freely. Each bat was displaced through varying angles (<italic>θ</italic>) ranging up to 10 °, so that the small angle approximation was valid, from the vertical position, and then released. For each initial angle of displacement, 10 full cycles were recorded using an electronic timer, and the mean period (the time required for a pendulum to oscillate through one complete cycle) was determined. The mass of each bat was then determined to within 0.001 kg.</p>

<p>All testing was performed on a uniaxial materials testing machine (Instron Model 5866, High Wycombe, UK). A 1000 N load-cell (accurate to within ± 0.5 per cent of relative load) was used. The cricket bats were placed over two supports made of mild steel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1754337111425629">Fig. 4</xref>) and were loaded up to 2000 N. All testing was performed at a constant 0.005 m/sec deflection rate. Load, time and deflection were recorded at a sampling frequency of 40 Hz.</p>

<p>The first three modes of vibration for all bats occurred at similar frequencies with two exceptions. Bat 7’s first bending mode is at roughly twice the frequency of the other bats, while its second bending mode occurs at a frequency almost 60 Hz less than the next lowest mode frequency: Bat 6. In addition, Bat 2’s second and third modes of vibration occur at a noticeably higher frequency than the others’ corresponding modes.</p>
<p>In order to compare the characteristics of all the bats tested with each other, the results for each line have been plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1754337111425629">Fig. 5</xref>. The shape of the energy profile was similar for all the bats tested up to 0.32 m from the toe region. The lowest energy absorptions occurred at the ‘sweet spot’ zone which lies somewhere between 0.08 – 0.26 m from the toe, and indicate the presence of a ‘sweet spot’ in that area somewhere between 0.12 – 0.18 m. The ‘sweet spot’ region was defined as the region of impact where the absorbed energy was less than 0.5 J [<bold>3</bold>] but it should be noted that the energy calculations presented here are relative ratios useful when comparing different bats and not absolute values of energy absorption.</p>

<p>The energy plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1754337111425629">Fig. 5</xref> show that, for Bats 1, 5, 6, and 7, the size of the ‘sweet spot’ zone is greater than for Bats 3 and 4. The size of the sweet spot zone for the two carbon handled bats was 0.19 m, and for the bat with the shorter blade was 0.18 m. For the traditional designs the size of the ‘sweet spot’ zone ranged between 0.135 and 0.16 m. Most of the bats show characteristics that approximately coincide for all four longitudinal impact lines, with only Bat 3 and Bat 7 showing noticeable variation across the width of the blade.</p>
<p>The MoI results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1754337111425629">Table 3</xref>. The actual values for the swing weights vary arbitrarily between approximately 0.27 and 0.35 kg.m<sup>2</sup>, with Bat 1 having a higher swing weight in general. Bat 1 has a 6 per cent higher MoI than the next higher MoI, that of Bat 7, and 20 per cent higher than Bat 6. This can be attributed to its thicker profile lower on the bat. The centre of mass of all the bats tested was within 6 per cent of each other.</p>

<title>4 Discussion</title>
<p>In this study three different tests were conducted in order to look at the performance of seven bats, five legal bats (four standard designs and one novel) and two bats currently defined as not within Law 6, with handles made of carbon fibre.</p>
<p>The energy profiles of all the bats tested were similar up to 0.32 m from the toe, and demonstrated that they had equivalent ‘sweet spots’. When comparing the energy absorption curves for the same longitudinal line of each bat, all the ‘sweet spot’ locations were centred on similar relative positions on the blade, with only Bat 1 having a significantly different ‘sweet spot’ location relative to the blade’s length (at 40 per cent of the blade length as opposed to 30 per cent for the other bats). This is clearly due to the shorter blade. When the ball strikes above this point, the traditional design has a lower vibrational energy than Bat 1. Changing the geometric profile of the bat and inserting carbon fibres into the handle increased the size of the ‘sweet spot’ zone.</p>
<p>Most of the bats showed consistent performance across the width of the bat. As stated by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754337111425629">3</xref>] any impact that occurs close to the central axis of the bat will not excite any torsional modes of vibration – one major source of discomfort for the batter. This means that the vibration performance towards the edges of the bat is important, as they can affect the batter’s ability to exert some control over a mis-hit shot. If the energy absorption is more towards the edges or outside the ‘sweet spot’ region, it will cause more energy to be dissipated in torsional oscillations, causing the bat to twist in the user’s hands, so reducing the degree of control over a shot. Apart from Bat 3 and Bat 7, the results of the hammer tests for the other bats overlap, meaning that they are likely to show the same vibrational response. These results are consistent with previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754337111425629">3</xref>] and suggest that they give dependable performance across the width of the blade, with the same energy being transferred to the user at each point. While this does not necessarily mean that a shot hit near the edge will produce the desired result, the discomfort to the batter will be less noticeable and, hence, they may be able to retain better control over a mis-hit.</p>
<p>The similarity in natural frequencies between the other bats is due to the fact they are all made of English willow, meaning their overall stiffness is similar. Bat 2 and Bat 7 both had two of their first three modes of vibration at significantly different frequencies to the others. While in Bat 7 the carbon handle may have influenced this somewhat, there is little explanation for why Bat 2 has the second and third bending modes higher than the corresponding modes for most of the other bats. What is of interest is that Bat 5, which also has carbon fibres in the handle, did not appear to have this response; these two bats (Bat 5 and Bat 7) came from different manufacturers. A previous study by Stretch <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754337111425629">5</xref>] showed that the rebound characteristics of composite bats were no better than those reported for willow bats. However, taking into consideration that, as the frequency of the first bending mode increases, so the CoR increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754337111425629">5</xref>], Bat 7 will perform better than the traditional bats.</p>
<p>The results for an equivalent bending stiffness show much variation for all bats tested. Bat 1 is the stiffest, which is probably due to the robust rectangular cross section that is maintained along the length of the blade and is different from the standard bat design of the other bats. The other full sized bats show great variation in results, with Bat 2 being 40 per cent less stiff than Bat 3. It is known from baseball bat literature that a stiff blade combined with a relatively less stiff handle is an optimum for imparting maximum energy to the ball combined with minimising vibration discomfort to the batsman. The traditional cricket bat design achieves this partially through the cane/rubber handle (less stiff) and willow blade (stiffer). Bat 1 and Bats 5 and 7 seem to have taken this a little further, the former by stiffening up the blade more without stiffening up the handle and the latter by introducing carbon fibres in the handle. Both of these modifications are likely to have a performance advantage without compromising batsman comfort, and future work in this area should include dynamic testing of bat performance in order to compare their response in an impact situation. Bat 1 had the highest MoI, although its mass is within 10 per cent of the mass of the other bats, meaning that it has approximately the same wood content. This means that the wood lost from reducing the blade length has been redistributed into increasing the thickness of the profile around the lower region of the bat. While this means more force is required from the batsman in lifting the bat, it also means that the effectiveness of the collision between the bat and ball increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1754337111425629">11</xref>], leading to a higher CoR compared to the traditional bats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754337111425629">5</xref>]. Due to the thick profile meaning more mass is concentrated around the bottom of the bat, where batters aim to hit the ball, it will also transfer more momentum to the ball in the ball–bat impact. However, this comes with the disadvantage that the overall hitting area of the bat is less due to the reduced length of the blade, giving the user less margin for error when trying to hit the ball.</p>

<sec id="section8-1754337111425629" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>5 Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study MoI, bat stiffness (bending stiffness) and freely suspended vibration analyses were conducted. A total of seven bats were tested, and cricket bats of significantly different design were compared with traditional designs. Results showed that by redistributing the mass of the bat further away from the rotational axis the MoI increases, which aims to increase the bat’s CoR transfering more momentum to the ball. Carbon fibres in the bat provide the advantage of having a stiff blade combined with a relatively less stiff handle, which is an optimum for imparting maximum energy to the ball combined with minimizing vibration discomfort to the batsman. Which one of these characteristics affects the bat’s CoR more was not quantified in this study. Where the vibration performance of a bat is concerned carbon fibres marginally improved it meaning this is an area that may hold some scope for innovation by bat manufacturers, subject to ensuring that the bats conform to the laws of the game.</p>
