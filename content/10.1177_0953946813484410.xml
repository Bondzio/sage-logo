<abstract>
<p>Traditionally Christian ethical reflection has taken the form of what is called nowadays ‘virtue ethics’. This article compares the approach to virtue ethics in the Byzantine thinker, Maximos the Confessor, and the Western thinker, Thomas Aquinas. They both share the heritage of Plato and Aristotle. Maximos develops a concern for the virtues that is practical and ascetic; although he recognizes and uses the traditional classical terminology, he prefers a new Christian terminology, based more directly on the Scriptures. In contrast, Aquinas accepts and uses the classical terminology, adding to it Christian ‘theological’ virtues. His concern is much less directly practical than Maximos, and more directed to the kind of society in which the virtues can flourish. This contrast between the ascetical and political (which should not be overdrawn) is manifest in Dumitru Stăniloae and Josef Pieper, introduced as modern interpreters of Maximos and Thomas respectively.</p>

<p>To attempt to make such a comparison in a single essay is clearly absurd; all that it is possible to do is to set these two giants of the Christian theological tradition—St Maximos, the greatest of the Byzantine theologians and the most influential in the later Orthodox tradition, and Thomas Aquinas, the greatest of the schoolmen and the most influential in the later Catholic tradition—in the tradition to which they both belong, and see how they received and interpreted that tradition, and raise some questions about similarities and differences. The subject is ‘virtue ethics’, as it has been called since the 1950s and the work of Oxford philosophers such as Philippa Foot and Iris Murdoch, and not wider issues, in which such a comparison would also be fruitful, and perhaps more important.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0953946813484410">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>For Foot and Murdoch, the recovery of virtue ethics was a challenge to and critique of Kantian and post-Kantian approaches to ethics which focused on how to make ethical decisions, how to decide in moral dilemmas, either by paying attention to the intention behind the act or to the consequences of the decision: concern with the intention mostly became, as with Kant, a question of deciding on one’s duty, what one ought to do (and so: deontological); concern with consequences was developed by the utilitarians, for whom ethical decisions were a matter of weighing up the consequences in terms of the quantity of happiness that would follow from the decision. There were refinements. But Foot and Murdoch wanted to return to the classical tradition as found in Plato and Aristotle whose ethical reflection turned not on how we make decisions—by an act of will (the concept of will is notoriously absent from discussions of ethics in classical and Hellenistic philosophy)—but on what was involved in being good human beings, a notion that was explored by the ‘excellences’, ἀρϵταί, <italic>virtutes</italic>, ‘virtues’ that made a human being good. This notion of virtue was not even primarily moral—especially in Greek, for ἀρϵτή could be applied to objects that manifested excellence: a sword could have ἀρϵτή, by being sharp and well-balanced, for example—but it was generally agreed that human excellence involved moral qualities, even if it was not exhausted by them, though some philosophers—the Stoics for instance, and arguably Plato—believed human excellence was intrinsically moral (in contrast to Aristotle, whose ‘large-hearted man’, μϵγαλόψυχoς, manifested his virtue in his wealth, his intelligence, even his way of walking and conducting himself, as well as in strictly ‘moral’ qualities).</p>
<p>In the <italic>Symposium</italic>, when Agathon, the host, comes to give his speech in praise of love, ἔρως, he speaks first of the god’s beauty and then of his goodness; the discourse on his goodness treats one by one his virtues: justice, for he neither gives nor receives injury; temperance, for ‘love, by controlling pleasures and desires, must be eminently temperate’; courage or fortitude, ‘for we hear, not of love caught by Ares, but of Ares caught by love—Aphrodite’; and wisdom, σoφία, for it is through love, that Apollo, the Muses, Hephaestus, Athena and Zeus inspire humankind in the crafts and music and poetry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0953946813484410">2</xref></sup> The goodness of love is manifest in δικαιoσύνη, σωφρoσύνη, ἀνδρϵία, σoφία: justice, temperance, courage or fortitude, and wisdom, understood here clearly in a practical way. These were to become the four cardinal virtues, and we find them again in Plato’s <italic>Republic</italic>, this time related both to the tripartite structure of the soul and the matching tripartite structure of the city state, the πόλις. As the state consists of rulers, guards or soldiers, and the peasantry or working class, so the soul consists of a rational element—the mind, intellect, or νoῦς, an aggressive or powerful element—the spirited or incensive part, the θῦμoς, and the desiring element—the ἐπιθυμητικόν. The rulers and the νoῦς need wisdom, σoφία; the guards and the θῦμoς courage, ἀνδρϵία. Temperance is a matter of ‘the unanimity and concord’ of all three parts, though it is especially necessary for the working class and the desiring part of the soul. Justice, too, is concerned with the balance between the three parts of the city or the soul: a balance achieved when each part is fulfilling its own role and when the guards and the working class—or the θῦμoς and ἐπιθυμητικόν—are subject to the guidance of the rulers or the intellect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0953946813484410">3</xref></sup> This brief glance at Plato reveals two ways in which the virtues can be seen to operate: on the one hand, in relation to the individual and the ordering of his love, and on the other in relation to the functioning of society. Just as for Plato, and many philosophers of classical and late antiquity, there is a profound analogy between the human and the cosmos, so too there is an analogy between the individual and the city.</p>
<p>Aristotle developed Plato’s notion of virtue, and his refinements were to have a far-reaching influence on later understanding of virtue. Aristotle’s treatment of virtue is more analytic than Plato’s and concerned to explore differences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0953946813484410">4</xref></sup> Whereas for Plato, virtue is ultimately indivisible—temperance requires wisdom and courage and justice—for Aristotle the distinctions in the virtues are more prominent. The principal manifestation of this is found in the first of the virtues, the virtue of primarily the intellect, which Plato called wisdom, σoφία. Aristotle makes a distinction between σoφία and φρόνησις, between intellectual wisdom, contemplation, and moral wisdom, the understanding of our moral behaviour. This expresses his distinction between intellectual virtue and moral virtue: the cardinal virtues are the moral virtues, ἠθικαὶ ἀρϵταί, concerned with our action, πρᾶξις, in the world; beyond that is intellectual virtue, σoφία, concerned with the contemplation of reality, at its highest with eternal reality.</p>
<p>In later philosophy, especially in late antiquity, both these approaches are found, the one interpreting the other; it was remembered that Aristotle had been a disciple of Plato, and his thought was often interpreted in terms of his master. Within the Christian tradition, the reception of the notion of virtue has a variety of contexts and caused a number of problems. We can only sketch these in now. There are principally two contexts: the doctrine of virtues is used to interpret the moral examples found in the Scriptures—a good example is found in Ambrose, <italic>De Officiis</italic> I.115-21; but a more important context, employing both the doctrine of virtues and the tripartite notion of the soul to which it is related by Plato especially, is that of ascetic literature. The principal problem is that the notion of virtue could suggest that by our own efforts we could become good or virtuous, which goes counter to the Christian conviction that humankind has fallen away from its original condition and needs grace—the grace of the Resurrection through the triumph over death on the Cross—in order to be restored to the state for which it was intended by the Creator. Nevertheless, among Christians, when the notion of virtue is maintained, there is always a—sometimes unstated—presupposition that virtue is dependent on the operation of grace; sometimes this presupposition is so silent as to be thought absent (as is the charge against Pelagianism). It might be wondered why Christians rallied to the notion of virtue, given that much of the Scriptures considers moral goodness in terms of obedience to commandments, rather than the formation of human virtue (an exception being the Wisdom literature, which was indeed highly valued in early Christian ethical thought). Part of the reason is, paradoxically, connected with their belief in the Fall of humankind: given that, and the consequences for humankind, any approach to ethics that remained at the level of behaviour seemed quite inadequate—ethical behaviour had to flow from a reconstructed human nature: it was a matter of being, of ontology. Virtue ethics addresses the question of goodness at this level, for it is concerned more with what human beings are, rather than how they make moral choices, how they behave. This awareness of the effect of sin and the need for grace is manifest in many ways, especially in the ascetic tradition. On the one hand, there is much more systematic interest in the opposite of virtues—the vices, or, in the ascetic tradition, the λoγισμoί, the trains of thought that tempt and distract us. Evagrios, the first ‘philosopher of the desert’, as Guillaumont has dubbed him, devotes a good deal of time to the λoγισμoί, and their classification. This is not, I think, primarily a doleful concern with the ravages of sin and the Fall; rather an awareness that what we can do is less to cultivate the virtues than to struggle against the assaults and distractions that the Christian is beset by; what we are doing is more clearing the way for the operation of grace than building up the self through the virtues, something beyond our sinful powers. Another manifestation of this awareness of the need for grace can be found in how virtue is thought of. Although the traditional list that we find in Plato and Aristotle is acknowledged, more attention is paid to other ‘virtues’, unacknowledged, at least directly, by the classical tradition: virtues such as humility, obedience, love.</p>

<title>Virtue in St Maximos the Confessor<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0953946813484410">5</xref></sup></title>
<p>All this lies in the background of the tradition as St Maximos the Confessor develops it in his reflection on the nature of virtue. At one point in the <italic>Dispute with Pyrrhos</italic>, the deposed patriarch remarks with amazement: ‘What then? Are the virtues natural?’ (Aristotle had denied that the moral virtues are natural: <italic>Eth. Nic</italic>. II. 1103a.18-20.) Maximos replies that they are. Pyrrhos comes back with the objection that if the virtues are natural, why do they not exist equally in those of the same nature? But they do, Maximos replies to the baffled patriarch (at least according to most MSS). How do you account for such inequality amongst ourselves? Pyrrhos retorts. Maximos responds: ‘Because we do not equally act out what is natural. If everyone acted out what was natural in accordance with their origin, then just as there is one nature manifest in all, so it would be with virtue, and there would be no better or worse.’ Pyrrhos objects that ‘if what is natural to us proceeds not from disciplined training [ἀσκησις], but from creation, and virtue is natural, why do we acquire the virtues, which are natural, through toil and disciplined struggle?’ Maximos responds thus:
<disp-quote>
<p>Disciplined training and the toils that go with it were devised simply for the purpose of separating from the soul in those who love virtue the deceit that infects it through the senses. It is not as if the virtues have been lately introduced from outside. For they were inserted in us from creation, as has been already said. Once therefore deceit has been completely expelled from us, at that moment, too, the soul manifests the radiance of its natural virtue. He therefore who is not foolish is sensible; and he who is not cowardly or foolhardy is courageous; and he who is not undisciplined is chaste; and he who is not unjust is just. By nature reason is wisdom, discernment is justice, the incensive faculty is courage, and the desiring faculty chastity. Therefore with the removal of what is contrary to nature [παρὰ φύσιν] only what is natural [κατὰ φύσιν] is accustomed to be manifest. Just as, if rust is removed, there is manifest the natural gleam and lustre of iron.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0953946813484410">6</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Virtue is natural; the cardinal virtues describe the lineaments of that nature. It is only because of a deceit lodged in the soul that disciplined training and toil are necessary. I have avoided translating ἀσκησις as asceticism, for that seems to me to prejudge immediately issues that need consideration. The word ἀσκησις generally means training or exercise, so I have translated it ‘disciplined training’, but the verb from which it is derived, ἀσκέω, originally meant to work with raw materials, and I am attracted by the idea that the root meaning of ἄσκησις, too, is to work with raw materials, the raw materials of our humanity, and out of it to make something fine. It seems to me to accord with what Maximos meant by ἄσκησις, for he saw humankind as created in the image of God with the purpose of attaining the divine likeness. That working with the raw materials of our humanity—even in paradise—would entail uniting our being and our eternal being, both gifts of God, by means of being well, and so bringing into being an eternal well-being in which the divine image attains the divine likeness. This triad—being–well-being–eternal being—is a fundamental aspect of Maximos’s ontology of the created rational being, and expresses Maximos’s idea that virtue, well-being, unites God’s gifts of being and eternal being, leading to eternal well-being, the eternal life with God for which created rational beings are intended.</p>
<p>This ἄσκησις is the principal concern of the first stage of the Christian life, πρακτική, as Maximos calls it, adopting the terminology of Evagrios (I have translated it ‘ascetic struggle’). The ultimate purpose of this is to learn how to love. As to the structure of this ascetic struggle, there are two chapters, right at the beginning of his <italic>Centuries on Love</italic>, that give a brief account of it. The two chapters (2 and 3) manifest a chiastic structure:
<disp-quote>
<p>Ἀπάθϵια gives birth to love; hope in God to ἀπάθϵια; patience and longsuffering to hope; all-embracing self-mastery is the source of these; the fear of God is the source of self-mastery; and faith in the Lord produces fear.</p>
<p>He who believes in God fears punishment; he who fears punishment masters the passions; he who masters his passions endures tribulation; he who endures tribulation will possess hope in God; hope in God separates off all earthly inclination; the intellect separated from this will possess love towards God (<italic>Centuries on Love</italic> I.2-3).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0953946813484410">7</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The first of these chapters has the sequence: love—ἀπάθϵια—hope—patience-and-longsuffering—self-mastery—fear-of-God—faith-in-the-Lord; the second has the matching chiastic structure: faith-in-God—fear-of-punishment—mastery-of-the-passions—tribulation—endurance-of-tribulation—hope—separation-from-earthly-inclination [= ἀπάθϵια]—love-of-God. There are several points to note about this sequence. First, it is a sequence; there is a way that leads to love. Love is something that we can learn. This is, it seems to me, an immensely heartening fact. There is a whole discourse about love that regards it as a kind of inspiration; it just happens, in some kind of amazing way we are swept off our feet. Maximos knows about that, too, but he is also intensely practical: we want to love—this is how to do it. There is a sequence, a progression that we can follow, that starts with faith and leads to love. Another point to notice about these two chapters (not, I think, generally pointed out) is that they are an expansion of Rom. 5:3-5. There the apostle says:
<disp-quote>
<p>Not only that, but we also boast in tribulations, knowing that tribulation brings about endurance, and endurance testing, and testing hope; and hope is not ashamed, because the love of God is poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit that is given to us.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Note the sequence: tribulation–endurance–testing–hope–love. Maximos’s sequence provides an introduction to tribulation from faith, via fear and self-mastery, and makes ἀπάθϵια the bridge from hope to love. The parallel is so close that it cannot be chance coincidence. The main difference between the apostle and the monk is that Paul envisages a situation of persecution—that is what θλῖψις, tribulation, refers to—while Maximos envisages the life of a monk, where the tribulation arises from the spiritual struggle of his monastic life, and so leads him to introduce the classic monastic virtues of self-mastery, ἐγκράτϵια and ἀπάθϵια—calm, detachment, serenity. The transition from martyr to monk is a commonplace in scholarship about the rise of monasticism, and is discernible here.</p>
<p>Maximos makes no direct reference here to the gift of the Holy Spirit as the source of the love of God in our hearts, which is the apostle Paul’s main point. The allusion to the Pauline passage suggests however that this struggle is necessary if we are to find in ourselves a heart open to receiving the Spirit of Love. If our hearts are to become open to God, then they need a radical restructuring from what they have become as a result of the Fall; it is a broken and contrite heart, καρδίαν συντϵτριμμένην καὶ τϵταπϵινωμένην, that God will not despise. Maximos expresses this in a characteristically dense passage in <italic>Ambiguum</italic> 41.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Since then human kind has not been moved naturally, as it was fashioned to do, around the unmoved, that is its own beginning (I mean God), but contrary to nature is voluntarily moved in ignorance around those things that are beneath it, to which it has been divinely subjected, and since it has abused the natural power of uniting what is divided, that was given to it at its generation, so as to separate what is united, and in this way piteously endangering itself by moving almost into non-being, therefore ‘natures have been instituted afresh’, and in a paradoxical way beyond nature that which is completely unmoved by nature is moved immovably, if I might so say, around that which by nature is moved, and God becomes a human being, in order to save lost humanity. Through himself he has, in accordance with nature, united the fragments of the universal nature of all, manifesting the universal λόγoι that have come forth for the particulars, by which the union of the divided naturally comes about, and thus he fulfils the great purpose of God the Father, to ‘recapitulate everything both in heaven and on earth in himself’, ‘in whom everything has been created’ (<italic>Amb</italic>. 41: 1308CD).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This apparently rather dry and Aristotelian account is really about love and its distortions. It is love that makes things change and move, and the ultimate source of love is God, the unmoved mover, who causes movement by being loved: κινϵῖ ὡς ἐρώμϵνoν. The story of the Fall is, for Maximos and the rest of the Fathers, a story about man’s failing to move in love towards God, who created him and is immovably at the centre of everything, and instead seeking to make himself the centre of the world, though in reality subjecting himself to creatures beneath him. Love for God is replaced by self-love, φιλαυτία, but this self-love leads to the love of what is beneath man, and the whole metaphysical scheme of things is turned upside down. Man therefore fails to fulfil his cosmic function of holding everything together as the bond of the cosmos, as God constituted him, and thus he drifts towards non-being, extinction. To remedy this, God does something that seems utterly incredible. The unmoved mover, God Himself, moves, makes the creation, or more precisely man, the centre of his loving concern, and becomes incarnate. God himself takes on in Christ humanity and the cosmic function man was created to fulfil, and restores the cosmos to its original state of harmony. This amounts to the ‘institution of natures afresh’, as Maximos puts it, using an expression from one of St Gregory the Theologian’s sermons. The ‘institution of natures afresh’ is for Maximos a deeply troubling expression, which he returns to consider several times, for nature, φύσις, is what God has made, and is inviolable. What happens, as Maximos explains, is not that natures themselves are changed—that would mean the destruction of their inner meaning and purpose, their λόγoς—rather it is their way of existence, their τρόπoς ὑπάρξϵως, their movement, in the language of the passage just quoted, which had been distorted, that is radically changed, so as to correspond to the λόγoς φύσϵως as originally constituted by God. In the passage quoted Maximos uses three terms: κατὰ φύσιν, παρὰ φύσιν, ὑπὲρ φύσιν—according to nature, against nature, above or beyond nature. The original state of the cosmos is κατὰ φύσιν, its fallen state is παρὰ φύσιν; what is needed to restore the cosmos is something that is ὑπὲρ φύσιν. This reveals something important about love: God created the cosmos and humanity out of love, he redeems it out of love, but that redeeming love manifests the truth that the love of God is something beyond nature, something that flows from the inner being of God himself.</p>
<p>The language of nature is important to Maximos for two, closely related reasons. First, the drama of redemption is not about superficial refashioning of human behaviour; it is about something ontological, about the way things fundamentally are. That is why, I think, Maximos is so keen to express his understanding of the drama of sin and salvation in metaphysical, cosmological language. The story of human sin and redemption is a story about the cosmos, not just about human decisions and motivation. But even at the level of the human we are dealing with something better thought of as ontological, concerned with the way things are, rather than something simply moral. What is needed if man is to attain the destiny set before him by God when he created him is for his whole being to be fundamentally restructured. It is not just a matter of learning to behave morally, nor a matter of accepting the truth about things: both these have to spring from a surge of love within that transforms what it is to be human, indeed reveals that the deepest human reality discloses an openness to God through which man is transformed into the divine.</p>
<p>In summary, Saint Maximos’s understanding of the virtues is fundamental, though expressed in somewhat different terminology from the philosophical tradition on which he draws. Virtue is natural, because it is implicit in our being created by God in his image and likeness. Ascetic struggle is necessary, because we have departed from what is natural. Maximos quite naturally lists the cardinal virtues as delineating the moral nature of man, but when he comes to the practice of the virtues, we find other notions asserting themselves, terms more practical, more immediate to the ascetic task in hand: tribulation, endurance, hope, detachment, love.</p>

<title>Virtue in Thomas Aquinas</title>
<p>The notion of virtue occupies a huge place in Aquinas’s <italic>Summa Theologiae</italic>. It is first mentioned in the first section of the Second Part (<italic>Prima Secundae Partis</italic>), which is concerned with human beatitude and what is involved in our return to that. This leads into a discussion of the passions that need to be redirected if humans are to come to blessedness. Then follows a long discussion of virtue: its nature, the distinctions between the virtues (especially the distinction between moral and intellectual virtue, and between moral and theological virtue).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0953946813484410">8</xref></sup> The discussion is fundamentally Aristotelian: virtue is not natural, but the result of habit; to the Aristotelian discussion of intellectual and moral virtue is added the Christian crowning of the theological virtues of faith, hope and love (<italic>caritas</italic>). Aquinas returns to the notion of virtue in the second section of the Second Part, which is devoted to the virtues, theological and moral or cardinal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0953946813484410">9</xref></sup> The genius of Aquinas’s account is the range of his discussion of the virtues. This is true particularly of the cardinal virtues, and dramatically so in the discussion of justice, the second of the cardinal virtues. It begins with topics that seem familiar enough: justice itself, injustice, judgement, restitution, crimes against justice—murder, injury, theft, false accusation, detraction, derision, cursing, fraud, usury. It continues with religion, which concerns justice in our relation to God—devotion, prayer (which includes the striking understanding of prayer as ‘interpreting our desires’: IIa-IIae. 83. 1 ad 1), worship, sacrifice, tithes, vows, praise of God, superstition, idolatry, divination, and so on.</p>
<p>This is a very different discussion from what we find in Maximos: very different, and yet fundamentally concordant. The virtues, for Aquinas, delineate the nature of man, both in relation to his eternal destiny (the ‘theological’ virtues) and in relation to his life in this world (the cardinal virtues). Although Aquinas discusses them separately, and distinguishes them clearly, it is nonetheless clear that in our actual experience of living a virtuous life as baptized Christians the virtues interlock and interact. For all the influence of Aristotle, Aquinas is aware of the truth that Plato recognized: that virtue is one and inseparable. For both Maximos and Aquinas virtue is about nature, human nature—human nature engaged in the natural order that God created. Nevertheless, there is a clear distinction for Aquinas between cardinal and theological virtues, and this distinction is hardly present in Maximos at all. There seem to me two reasons for this. The first, and most fundamental, has to do with their understanding of nature. For Aquinas, however qualified in practice (as we have noticed), there is a fundamental distinction between the realms of nature and grace, which is reflected in the distinction between the cardinal and theological virtues. For Maximos, however, created nature is already graced, by virtue of creation; the nature of anything is determined by its λόγoς, and this λόγoς is implicit in Christ, the Λόγoς of God. Maximos, it seems to me, can hardly conceive of the clear distinction Aquinas draws between nature and grace, cardinal and theological virtues. The fact that for Maximos virtues are natural, whereas for Aquinas they are a matter of habit, also seems to be relevant here: Maximos instinctively taking an inclusive view of nature, in contrast to Aquinas’s clear distinctions, in this case a distinction that severs virtue from nature, however much virtue is concerned with what is natural. Secondly, and maybe consequent on this, the treatment of the virtues in the two thinkers seems to be utterly different. Maximos’s discussion is intensely practical: how do we pursue the virtues, how do we cultivate them (or weed the raw material of our human nature so that virtue can flourish), how do we come to love, to manifest the fundamental orientation of our nature as God created it? In contrast, Aquinas’s discussion seems much more theoretical: he is concerned to explore the way the virtues relate, and the entailments that follow from them; he is concerned to root everything concerned with human living in the virtues that represent the perfection of human nature, its characteristic excellences. Aquinas is not unpractical, just as Maximos is not untheoretical. For Aquinas, however, the practice of the virtues follows from a consideration of what they are, what they entail, and—particularly important—the kind of human society promoted by the practice of the virtues and in which the virtues can flourish; Aquinas—like Plato and Aristotle—is acutely conscious of the way in which human beings are social; it is hardly possible for virtue to be a simply individual endeavour. And with Maximos, it is not that he lacks a theoretical dimension, far from it, but his theory—his contemplation of the nature of reality—seems to consist of insights glimpsed from the perspective of his concern to develop true ways of seeing: insights that are the fruit of participation in the realities we understand, not some sort of dispassionate analysis.</p>

<title>Virtue in Fr Stăniloae and Josef Pieper</title>
<p>We could take this discussion further by exploring more deeply the writings of Maximos and Aquinas, but this would open up a vast field of study that could not be distilled in the pages of an essay. Instead, I want to conclude this essay by doing something rather different: to compare two thinkers of the twentieth century, whose thought was indebted to one or other of the great theologians we have briefly compared. The two thinkers are the Romanian Orthodox theologian, Fr Dumitru Stăniloae, and the German philosopher, Josef Pieper. The choice of Josef Pieper is obvious: he thought of himself as a Thomist, and his meditations on Thomist philosophy and theology, expressed in mostly rather short treatises, provide insight into how Aquinas has been interpreted in the twentieth century. The choice of Fr Stăniloae is perhaps less obvious—his learning was vast and extensive—but it has often seemed to those who read him that it was the cosmic vision of St Maximos that most inspired his own theological vision. Their lives spanned the twentieth century: Fr Stăniloae was born in 1903 and died in 1993; Josef Pieper was born in 1904 and died in 1997. They both lived through the darkest days of the twentieth century: Fr Stăniloae suffered under the communist regime imposed on Romania at the end of the Second World War, and spent five years (1958–63) in prison and concentration camps; Josef Pieper suffered under the Nazi regime in Germany, banned from university employment.</p>
<p>Fr Stăniloae is one of the major Orthodox theologians of the twentieth century. As well as studying in Romania, where he taught for most of his life, he studied in Athens, Munich, Berlin, and Paris, where he wrote a thesis on St Gregory Palamas. St Maximos was a major influence on Palamas, and though Fr Stăniloae’s engagement with the Fathers is extensive—he translated an expanded version of the anthology of Byzantine ascetic wisdom known as the <italic>Philokalia</italic> into Romanian, with extensive notes, as well as many other Byzantine theologians—St Maximos was especially important to him. To explore his understanding of the place of the virtues thoroughly it would be necessary to examine his translations and comments, as well as look at his own treatises, but there is no space for that here. His treatises need to be read with care, for they were written to replace older textbooks of theology in Romania during the communist period, and the censors allowed Stăniloae little scope to reconfigure his presentation, which he would surely have done, had he had the opportunity. There is therefore very little on the virtues in his <italic>Teologia Dogmatică Ortodoxă</italic>;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0953946813484410">10</xref></sup> for such teaching it is necessary to turn to his <italic>Spiritualitatea Ortodoxă: Ascetica şi Mistica</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0953946813484410">11</xref></sup> The structure of this book has a passing reminiscence of Aquinas’s <italic>Summa Theologiae</italic> in that the section on the virtues is preceded by one on the passions, the virtues being presented as the means to the purification of the passions. The list of virtues presented, however, bears no relationship to the list of classical philosophy. It consists of faith, fear of God, repentance, self-control, the guarding of the mind, longsuffering, hope, meekness and humility, and dispassion or freedom from passion (ἀπάθϵια). The list is modelled on the list we have already discussed, found in the first of Maximos’s <italic>Centuries on Love</italic>, and indeed Fr Stăniloae refers to it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0953946813484410">12</xref></sup> Fr Stăniloae draws on many other writings than those of Maximos, notably the <italic>Ladder of Divine Ascent</italic> by St John Climacus, the Xanthopoulos brothers’ <italic>Directions to Hesychasts</italic>, and St Isaac the Syrian’s <italic>Ascetical Homilies</italic>, but his fundamental orientation is provided by Maximos. The virtues are means of purification of the passions, of the attachment to self and the world that is the result of the Fall. The notion that the virtues disclose a sense of human excellence virtually falls from view, though there is much about how the practice of the virtues discloses a vision of the world as God created it, something that is developed further on in Stăniloae’s discussion of illumination, which includes the contemplation of God in nature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0953946813484410">13</xref></sup> What Fr Stăniloae has taken from Maximos is very much what we have found in him: an intensely practical guide to the development of a life of love and prayer.</p>
<p>Josef Pieper’s engagement with the virtues is much more direct and explicit. Over the course of his life he published several, mostly short, books on the virtues, both the cardinal and the theological virtues. The first of these books, published in 1934, the year after Hitler’s seizure of power, was, significantly, on fortitude (or courage).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0953946813484410">14</xref></sup> Fortitude means, according to Pieper, the readiness to die: ‘Fortitude that does not reach down into the depths of the willingness to die is spoiled at its root and devoid of effective power.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0953946813484410">15</xref></sup> It is not, however, a courting of death, nor does it imply that life is regarded as of little worth; on the contrary, fortitude is readiness to face the loss, ultimately of life itself, for higher goods ‘the loss of which would injure more deeply in inmost core of human existence’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0953946813484410">16</xref></sup> Fortitude is the third of the cardinal virtues, to be guided by prudence and justice. Throughout this short book, Pieper takes attitudes that are misunderstood and breathes new life into them. Fortitude is manifest in patience and endurance, but this does not mean ‘an indiscriminate, self-immolating, crabbed, joyless and spineless submission to whatever evil is met with, or worse, deliberately sought out’.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>To be patient means to preserve cheerfulness and serenity of mind in spite of injuries that result from the realization of the good. Patience does not imply the exclusion of energetic, forceful activity, but simply, explicitly and solely the exclusion of sadness and confusion of heart. Patience keeps man from the danger that his spirit may be broken by grief and lose its greatness. Patience, therefore, is not the tear-veiled mirror of a ‘broken’ life…, but the radiant embodiment of ultimate integrity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0953946813484410">17</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The fact that endurance and patience are so close to the nature of fortitude, rather than aggression or self-confidence or wrath, is bound up with the nature of the world in which we live:
<disp-quote>
<p>Power is so manifestly of the very structure of the world that endurance, not wrathful attack, is the ultimately decisive test of actual fortitude, which, essentially, is nothing else than to love and to realize that which is good, in the face of injury or death, and undeterred by any spirit of compromise. It is one of the fundamental laws of a world plunged into disorder by original sin that the uttermost strength of the good manifests itself in powerlessness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0953946813484410">18</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is not difficult to see how immediate such considerations were as Hitler’s Germany began to take shape. In his last chapter, Pieper takes his reflections into the very heart of the Christian life. Speaking of those who enter the darkness of purification at the hand of God in prayer, he says:
<disp-quote>
<p>The Christian who dares to take the leap into his darkness and relinquishes the hold of his anxiously grasping hand, totally abandoning himself to God’s absolute control, thus realizes in a very strict sense the nature of fortitude; for the sake of love’s perfection he walks straight up to dreadfulness; he is not afraid to lose his life for Life’s sake; he is ready to be slain by the sight of the Lord.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0953946813484410">19</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Pieper’s consideration of fortitude is quite remarkable. Basing himself on Aquinas’s discussions of fortitude, he wrote a tract for the times that was intended to speak directly to the hearts of his fellow Germans, caught in the grip of unparalleled evil. It was not simply a discussion of morality; it had political relevance, and went beyond any merely pious concern for the cultivation of virtue.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It seems to me that our comparison of Stăniloae and Pieper paints in deeper colours the contrast we have already noticed in our comparison of St Maximos and Thomas Aquinas. St Maximos speaks from a tradition of ascetic, indeed monastic, wisdom, full of the experience of those who have sought to live a life of faithfulness to God in prayer. Stăniloae follows his master closely in this. Aquinas, in contrast, is concerned with the analysis of concepts, the concepts in which we explore our understanding of the nature of the human person and of human society: the political relevance of Aquinas is more immediate—his discussion of justice adumbrates in some quite practical ways the structures of a society conducted in accordance with the nature of the human beings who constitute it. We find this in Josef Pieper’s discussion of fortitude at the beginning of the darkest days of Germany’s subjection to the Nazi ideology.</p>
<p>Perhaps what emerges from this discussion of different ways of approaching virtue in one great theologian from the Christian East and another great theologian from the Christian West is—beyond evident differences of approach—a fundamental complementarity. Both approaches are committed to an understanding of moral behaviour as fundamentally a matter of virtue; that is, the moral life is seen less as a sequence of moral choices to be decided in accordance with some kind of moral calculus, and more as the fruit of a moral vision that enshrines fundamental moral and metaphysical values—less a matter of doing (though it is important to act) and more a matter of being. Western thought, represented by Aquinas, explores the nature of the world and society that will flow from commitment to such a life; Eastern thought, as represented by Maximos and the Byzantine ascetical tradition, explores the ways in which we may become human beings capable of recognizing and striving for the values implicit in the world created by the God of Love.</p>
