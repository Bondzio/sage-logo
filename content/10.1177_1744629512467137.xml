<p>For many health and or social care practitioners of a certain age (and I like to think I am too young to consider I qualify for this), the phrase <italic>better services</italic> has a particular resonance, as it is recognised as being the start of the title of the 1971 White Paper, in the United Kingdom, called at that time <italic>Better services for the mentally handicapped</italic>. Over 40 years ago, the need to move towards a model of community-based care was being highlighted not only as desirable but as necessary and that future services should be developed along these lines. Although the need for specific intellectual disability services was acknowledged, and continued to be seen as part of an overall framework of services, the importance of living as part of the local community rather than just physically being located in it was recognised as an important distinction. Many developments in the lives of people with intellectual disabilities have occurred during the last 40 years, and overall there is a sense that services for people with intellectual disabilities in many countries including the United Kingdom have improved, with perhaps people believing that the reduction in large long-term hospital care, and the development of smaller community-based homes aligns itself with the implicit assumption that things must be better in the new services and that the problems of the older services have been solved. Following that logic, the answer to the question within the title of this editorial, <italic>are we there yet</italic> would be ‘yes’. However, I would argue that such an answer all too often is informed by nothing other than contemporary ideology – that current services are simply better than what we used to have. If one seeks a more sophisticated rationale for the answer and add to the question what evidence we have for believing things are better, namely to move beyond ideological assumptions, then often the conversation seems to change and will often conclude with examples of personal experience and personal knowledge to support the assertion that things are better; an answer to the larger question about evidence remains unanswered. There is a need to move the current level of debate beyond, for example, ideological rhetoric, personal examples or local reports into good or poor quality services and instead raise the level of sophistication of debate to one where there is a need to support claims with robust evidence.</p>
<p>Articles within this issue of <italic>Journal of Intellectual Disabilities</italic> hopefully contribute to raising this level of debate by reporting on examples of the types of evidence and methods used to generate claims of improved services for people with intellectual disabilities. This issue presents articles that provide examples of well-conducted studies, alongside an examination of research methods, along with identifying where services need further research. For example, Sines and colleagues provide evidence from their work that several domains within quality of life were shown to improve for people with intellectual disabilities who moved from NHS campus accommodation in the United Kingdom into smaller community-based units. Although improvements were noted over all of the domains measured, the largest improvements were found in areas such as governance, autonomy and choice as well as quality and location of housing. Huneke et al. highlight how doctors involve people with intellectual disabilities in decision making about their medication, which provides supportive evidence of increased autonomy. So both of these articles provide some evidence to support the answer being ‘yes’ to the question ‘better services . . . are we there yet?’</p>
<p>Although it could be argued that the improvement in autonomy and choice reported by Sines and colleagues are focused on the individual with intellectual disabilities, it should also be noted that the other two areas of major improvement were procedural or facility related. However, it should also be noted that key areas, many of us may value about the location of our house when considering our quality of life, such as the development of relationships, social interaction and well-being, all demonstrated limited improvement. Equally notable is that despite the provision of information by doctors, Huneke et al. present us with a real challenge as they argue that although people with intellectual disabilities are actively involved in important decisions about their lives, they report that many people do not have a sufficient knowledge to meet the criteria for informed decision making, despite having been provided with some information.</p>
<p>Over the past 40 years, a large body of research evidence has been established in relation to some aspects of services for people with intellectual disabilities, but many new challenges will continue to emerge, Doody and colleagues illustrate an emerging area of services that will need attention, highlighting the potential role of intellectual disabilities nurses to become a major resource in supporting and developing services for older people with intellectual disabilities. Bringing together the role of intellectual disability nursing and research, Mufuba and Gates highlight the importance of robust research design when working within intellectual disability services, and not becoming reliant on very limited sources of data rather to triangulate evidence, a point also demonstrated by Sines et al. within their research design.</p>
<p>Mafuba and Gates go on to explore and advocate the use of sequential multiple methods as a contemporary strategy for undertaking research. They argue that sequential multiple methods involve the use of results obtained through one data collection method to determine the direction and implementation of subsequent stages of a research project. They also explore the significance of triangulating research at the epistemological, theoretical and methodological levels to enhance research. In the final article, Disley and colleagues provide a fascinating report on what staff in services for people with intellectual disabilities perceived they brought to and received from their work-based relationships? They point to a number of studies involving staff who work in services for people with intellectual disabilities, where they have used equity theory as a theoretical framework. They point out that in this theory, people evaluate social relationships through the comparison of inputs and outcomes, essentially what a person brings to and receives from a relationship. Little is known about what constitute inputs and outcomes for staff working in services for people with intellectual disabilities. They used semistructured interviews with 15 staff to find out what constituted inputs and outcomes for staff who work with people. These interviews were conducted in the first half of 2008 in the United Kingdom, with data being analysed using template analysis. A wide range of inputs and outcomes were identified by staff, which was grouped under high-level themes relating to relationships with their employers, their coworkers and the service users. The utility of the findings, in terms of informing future research, is discussed.</p>
<p>Considering the overall findings within this issue and the continuing need for development then may be the answer to the initial question posed at the outset to this editorial ‘are we there yet?’ is no longer a definite ‘yes’, but perhaps continues to need to be a more qualified ‘maybe’. This is not to underplay the progress that has been made. This issue of <italic>Journal of Intellectual Disabilities</italic> demonstrates the continued need for the contribution of interdisciplinary research, and the need for this to be focussed on areas that are important and relevant to the lives of individuals with intellectual disabilities, and that continue to enhance the research methods to generate more reliable and valid evidence to inform services moving forward. As I step down as Editor of this journal, and Professor Ruth Northway takes on the role of Editor, I am reassured that the journal continues to provide a forum as envisaged at its inception by Professor Bob Gates for the exchange of best practice, knowledge and research between academic and professional disciplines across an increasing range of professionals to bring about advancement of services for people with intellectual disabilities, and I look forward to seeing the journal continuing to grow in all of these areas.</p>
