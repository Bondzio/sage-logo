<p>Rituals matter, and early modern Europeans were keenly aware of this. They mattered so much that to tamper with them was to invite disaster. When the new viceroy of the Kingdom of Naples arrived from Spain, in November 1654, his declared mission was to provide ‘good administration’ for his subjects. This included reforming the ‘too great a number of festival days, which had become a little less than infinite’, in the words of a contemporary chronicler. Not everyone considered the ‘violation of feast days’ mandated by the viceroy to be a good idea, however, and when plague struck the city in 1656 one widespread opinion was that it was due to divine wrath in response to the elimination of civic feast days. When the plague eventually subsided – not before having killed an estimated two-thirds of the city’s inhabitants – the viceroy rescinded his order and reinstated the festival calendar.</p>
<p>Civic rituals defined early modern cities, both for their own citizens as well as for outsiders and visitors. In <italic>Becoming Neapolitan</italic>, historian John Marino explores the relations Naples and its inhabitants enacted with the sacred, in all their diverse manifestations. Marino is an expert guide to the city and its practices – and indeed sixteenth- and seventeenth-century guide books to the city constitute an important primary source – taking us from vice-regal entry processions (known as <italic>possessi</italic>) to the all-important celebration of saints’ feasts and other church holy days, from court masques by humanist literati like Giambattista Basile to the ecclesiastical patronage of baroque art and architecture. Marino’s main point is that through these religious representations and ritual practices the inhabitants of what was then western Europe’s largest city, clergy, nobles and commoners, struggled with one another to assert political and cultural power. In so doing, they fostered a unified Neapolitan identity. At the same time, it was an unequal battle: in the years following the popular revolt of 1647 and the plague of 1656 the Counter-Reformation church and the vice-regal state came to exert ever greater control over public celebrations and rituals, subordinating the old nobility and breaking the resistance of the <italic>popolo</italic>.</p>
<p>Marino divides his material into a number of thematic chapters, each well illustrated. Perhaps Chapter Five works best, with its microhistorical focus on a single feast and its changing functions and meanings. In ‘Allegrezza: the city rules’, the focus is on changing celebrations of the feast of St John the Baptist, where a cult dating back to the earliest public foundations of Christianity in the Roman Empire, and associated with festivities linked to the summer equinox in popular culture, was increasingly appropriated by the Spanish viceroys, from the late sixteenth to the mid-seventeenth century. As part of the celebrations, the viceroy and the non-noble representative, the <italic>eletto del popolo</italic>, led a procession that wound its way through the streets and squares near the bay, specially decorated and illuminated for the occasion, receiving and greeting the captains of the <italic>popolo</italic>’s 29 districts and the consuls of the different city guilds at set places along the way. The feast was both a civic and a popular one; there was little ecclesiastical involvement. Indeed the post-Tridentine church authorities, taking advantage of Spanish decline in the later seventeenth century and divisions and rivalries in city government, imposed its own celebration of Corpus Christi, and by the 1690s the Neapolitan feast of St John the Baptist was no more.</p>
<p>Why Marino should seek to spoil the clear focus of this chapter and end it with two additional, short discussions (on the Forty Hours devotion and Masaniello’s funeral, respectively) is beyond me. If the sheer wealth of detail and the painstaking reconstruction of practices and ceremonies is one of the book’s main strengths, its lack of a clear organizing principle is arguably its main weakness. The book is made up of a series of vignettes which together, one after another, build into a broader view of the city; what is lacking is the glue to hold these rich and diverse vignettes together. And whilst this certainly adds to our knowledge of the role of city rituals in the capitals of early modern Italy, adding a long overdue southern, Spanish perspective to earlier studies of Florence and Venice, one wishes that, in addition to the detail, there was more substantive analysis of the nature of the ritual, whether from a symbolic perspective or from the more practical angle of its relationship to how the city was governed over the period. The book’s introduction lays out the groundwork and suggests the possibilities, but by the book’s end the reader is somewhat overwhelmed and disorientated, a feeling the conclusion does nothing to counter, offering by way of finale yet another vignette, this time on art collections and the meanings they had for their Neapolitan owners.</p>
