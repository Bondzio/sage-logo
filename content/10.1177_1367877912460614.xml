<abstract>
<p>This article investigates the queer feminist Swedish media projects <italic>HallonTV</italic> and <italic>DYKE HARD</italic> in order to argue that media production is constitutive of political movements as such. Particular attention is paid to an integral dimension of the constitution of such a political collectivity, namely its affective features. It is concerned with how a sense of ‘community’ comes to be ‘experienced’ by those who are involved, first-hand, in the development and extension of its messages to a wider public. Theoretically, the article proposes that these features will be better appreciated through both a harnessing of the discourse theoretical framework of Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe as well as a reworking of the anthropologist Victor Turner’s idea of communitas.</p>

<p>The cheerful signature tune of Sweden’s pioneering and, to date, only queer feminist television show, <italic>HallonTV</italic> (‘Raspberry Television’), is accompanied by a scene in which two men of visibly different generations are exiting a Stockholm underground station. A yellow ball appears in the image, caught by the older one of the two. Previous to the event, they show no visible interest in each other; the entrance of the ball cuts through this mutual indifference: each turns to the other, soon spotting another lonely person and passing the ball on, a sign of joy and solidarity. Bitte Andersson, one of the key people behind <italic>HallonTV</italic> – and former owner of the queer feminist bookshop Hallongrottan (‘the Raspberry Cave’)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1367877912460614">2</xref></sup> in Stockholm (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367877912460614">Gunnarsson Payne, 2009</xref>) – explains in one of our many interviews that while this introductory scene is somewhat of a caricature of mainstream television programmes, the intended symbolism is absolutely sincere. At the heart of <italic>HallonTV</italic> is the attempt to bring about an inclusive community between a diverse set of people who identify with and support the queer feminist cause. While this symbolism might, at a first glance, seem trivial, it gets to the nub of what this article aims to discuss – namely the significant role which media production plays in the articulation of political movements, as well as the crucial and often overlooked affective component of such constitutive processes. With this general thematic established I wish to make two specific interventions on the relation between media production and political community formation.</p>
<p>I argue that queer and feminist collectivities are necessarily constructed through processes of mediation. As such, I take mediation (and hence media production, understood in its broadest possible sense) to be <italic>constitutive</italic> of <italic>any</italic> political movement – and this would be a general rule of political mobilization as such. In this article I shall take the opportunity to investigate more specifically into an integral dimension of mediation and political collectivity, namely the role that <italic>passions</italic> play in such processes. Empirically, this article will explore how a sense of community came to be experienced by those who are involved, first-hand, in the development of a queer feminist media project and what strategies they used to achieve an extension of its messages to a wider public. Methodologically this article is a result of a thorough documentation of this process, consisting of a multi-sited ethnography (both on- and offline) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367877912460614">Hannerz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367877912460614">Hine, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367877912460614">Marcus, 1995</xref>), in-depth qualitative interviews, participant observation on sites of production, as well as observations of the finished product on the internet and on the television screen. Through such varied methods of data collection, my aim has been to show the ways in which this activist media project serves not only to produce ‘alternative’ images and representations, but also to develop playful and experimental notions of political collectivity. Theoretically, I shall begin to formulate a model of movement media that takes into account the constitutive role that movement media plays with regard to the emergence, maintenance and transformation of political movements, and the ways in which both affect and the production of collective identities are crucial components in this process. I shall argue that such processes will be better appreciated through a harnessing of the theorization of political theorists Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367877912460614">Laclau, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367877912460614">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367877912460614">Laclau and Mouffe, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367877912460614">Mouffe, 2005</xref>) as well as a reworking of the anthropologist Victor Turner’s idea of communitas, and introduce the concept of what I shall call <italic>mediating communitas</italic>.</p>

<title>Introducing the <italic>Hallon</italic> team</title>
<p>The first episode of <italic>HallonTV</italic> went on air for the first time in May 2007. This pilot became the starting point for an ambitious production schedule of film and television output for feminist and queer content. Embracing the multifarious ways in which, today, visual content can be transmitted, <italic>HallonTV</italic> operates simultaneously on numerous platforms. Each episode was broadcast on the community channel Öppna Kanalen (the Open Channel) in Stockholm and online, on Hallongrottan’s website using the video streaming tool Vimeo.</p>
<p>Since <italic>HallonTV</italic> was last shown in 2009, the <italic>Hallon</italic> team have continued their media production in the form of the queer feminist lesbian Thai-boxing action trailer <italic>DYKE HARD 2 – Muay Thai Fire!</italic>. The trailer format was chosen not only for its shorter length (hence shorter production time and lower costs), but also for its artistic and political possibilities. A trailer, Bitte argues – in contrast to a short film – migrates more easily beyond the confines of narrow middle-class audiences and <italic>cinéastes</italic>: ‘A trailer is something everyone can understand. Everyone knows that concept, everyone has time to watch one and it’s easy to distribute.’ During the time of its production, <italic>DYKE HARD 2</italic> was planned to make up only the first of a series of queer feminist fake trailers of different genres (e.g. science fiction, horror, prison and biker films).</p>
<p>A year after the premiere of <italic>DYKE HARD 2</italic>, which was held at Stockholm Pride festival 2010, however, a new website was set up to announce yet another forthcoming project of the <italic>Hallon</italic> team: ‘Welcome to the upcoming movie Dyke Hard’s official website!’ The previously planned series of ‘trailers without films’, we discover, has now been abandoned in favour of a full-length feature film that ‘of course’ takes the form of ‘a musical staged in the 1980s’, and featuring characters ranging from lesbian rock musicians to Thai boxers, ghosts, ninjas, prison escapees, evil roller derby girls, motor cyclists and mysterious billionaires.</p>
<p>The team of media activists behind these three projects (the <italic>Hallon</italic> team) comprises a core team of three or four people, as well as a more fleeting collective of actors, interviewees, media producers with their own media products and other voluntary contributors – most of whom initially crossed each other’s paths in the bookshop, Hallongrottan. Despite that, both Bitte and Martin (two of the core members), when interviewed, sought to play down the importance of Hallongrottan as a meeting place for the <italic>Hallon</italic> team. For me, as an ethnographer and outsider, it is difficult not to interpret the significance of the ‘zone free from heterosexist norms’ that it offers slightly differently (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367877912460614">Andersson, 2008</xref>: 29). Even though, as Bitte and Martin themselves emphasize, the everyday practices involved in their media production have not always taken place in the physical space of the shop, it has indeed served as a space in which some of the most significant friendships and close relationships have been formed. Hence, it has certainly served as a space which has offered an important condition of emergence for what Turner would call ‘spontaneous’ communitas to occur in the first place.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1367877912460614">
<title>Introducing the concept of ‘mediating communitas’</title>
<p>In modern western society, Turner found that the ‘values of communitas’ could be found in various youth cultures of his time (the beat generation, hippies, teeny-boppers), all of whom had in common that they had ‘opted out’ of hegemonic society and its social hierarchies to deliberately obtain ‘the stigmata of the lowly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367877912460614">1995 [1969]</xref>: 112). In a similar manner, I argue that the queer feminist communitas that is being both lived and represented through the media activism of the <italic>Hallon</italic> team, constitutes a vivid example of an ‘opting-out’ of what, using Turner’s terminology, one could call the ‘structure’ (or ‘closed society’) of hetero-patriarchy. Communitas is thus defined as ‘anti-structure’, which is to say a communitas is always positioned against a ‘state’ – state here to be understood not in the narrow conception of the nation-state, but rather as ‘any type of stable or recurrent condition that is culturally recognized’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367877912460614">1995 [1969]</xref>: 94).</p>
<p>In his original formulation, Turner distinguishes between three modalities of communitas: existential or <italic>spontaneous</italic> communitas, <italic>normative</italic> communitas and <italic>ideological</italic> communitas. <italic>Spontaneous</italic> communitas is best exemplified with various forms of social ‘happenings’ where a sense of togetherness is transitory only (limited to the time and place of a given event). In the context of political activism (queer, feminist or other) such affective communion may occur during events such as political demonstrations or meetings as well as cultural activities such as festivals or concerts. Two of the key characteristics that set this form of togetherness apart from other forms of social interaction, are described by Turner as: <italic>first</italic>, its ‘scrutinization of the central values and axioms of the culture in which it occurs’, or what he has called ‘anti-structure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367877912460614">1995 [1969]</xref>: 167); and, <italic>second</italic>, the way in which it is experienced by its participants, namely as a form of ‘full, unmediated communication’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367877912460614">1977</xref>: 46).</p>
<p>As Turner argues, however (and this is crucial for the theoretical argument put forward in this article), ‘the spontaneity and immediacy of communitas – as opposed to the jural-political character of structure – can seldom be maintained for very long’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367877912460614">1995 [1969]</xref>: 132). The concepts of <italic>normative</italic> and <italic>ideological</italic> communitas, therefore, both seek to describe the processes that may take place if an event of spontaneous communitas transforms into more stable forms of collectivity. <italic>Normative</italic> communitas occurs when resources are beginning to be organized and mobilized, and when social control is starting to be exercised among members in order to pursue common goals. Over time, such attempts to ‘capture and preserve spontaneous communitas in a system of ethical precepts and legal rules’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367877912460614">1977</xref>: 46) becomes progressively more difficult to distinguish from the very ‘state’ they position themselves against.</p>
<p>The concept of <italic>ideological</italic> communitas describes the process by which successful movements, despite losing the initial spontaneous and anti-hierarchical ethos, intentionally strive to uphold liminality by formulating a rigid ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367877912460614">1995 [1969]</xref>: 177–8). As such, Turner describes the latter as:<disp-quote>
<p>at once an attempt to describe the external and visible effects – the outward form, it might be said – of an inward experience of existential communitas, and to spell out the optimal social conditions under which such experiences might be expected to flourish and multiply. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367877912460614">1974</xref>: 132)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The explanatory force of Turner’s argument lies, as I see it, in his detailed effort to explain a movement’s tendency towards stagnation; what happens when ‘the spontaneity and immediacy of communitas’ cannot be maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367877912460614">1995 [1969]</xref>: 132). Significant for my argument, however, is that, unlike Turner, who tends to describe this tendency in terms of unavoidable ‘loss’, I would like to emphasize not only the inevitability of such stagnation (if, that is, something of the initial event is to be maintained), but also its necessary and productive potential. Spontaneous communitas is ‘dislocatory’ in the sense that it constitutes a radical break with a sedimented structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367877912460614">Laclau, 1990</xref>), which means that the <italic>only</italic> way to maintain something of its experienced radicality is to represent it; only through repeated representations can communitas turn into movement. This is why movement media (including practices such as dance, music, posters, leaflets, zines, etc.) should not be seen as something that merely <italic>re-</italic>presents or communicates an already existing movement, or something that simply transmits an already formulated set of ‘messages’. Rather, it ought to be understood as something that plays a constitutive role for the very movement it seeks to represent – and thus is necessary for its emergence, maintenance and transformation <italic>as</italic> movement. Thus, we must not fall into the trap of regarding the ‘original’ affectively laden collectivity of spontaneous communitas as more ‘authentic’, or somehow ‘better’ than its subsequent representations.</p>
<p>Hence, while Turner’s original formulation is useful to shed light on the ways in which political ‘passions’ often emerge in and through ‘mass’ events that generate a temporary sense of communion, I argue that it fails to acknowledge the important function that political discourse has in offering ‘not only policies but also identities which can help people make sense of what they are experiencing ’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367877912460614">Mouffe, 2005</xref>: 24–5). The partial stagnation that takes place through the construction of political identities through practices such as the writing of manifestos, the instigation of formal meetings and roles, the repetition of certain style elements, and the production and distribution of music, dance and ‘alternative media’, etc. is thus crucial for the subject to retroactively make sense of the passions experienced in communitas – but also as a way for the movement to expand and to continuously reactivate such passions as a way to keep the movement alive.</p>
<p>In the following, the media projects <italic>HallonTV, DYKE HARD 2</italic> and <italic>DYKE HARD</italic> will be discussed as a way of mediating queer feminist communitas, and showing how these projects can all be understood as a reactivation of what perhaps best can be called a queer feminist ethos, thereby continuously reactivating the meaning of ‘queer’ as being ‘not fully owned, but only and always redeployed, twisted, queered from a prior usage and in the direction of urgent and expanding political usages’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367877912460614">Butler, 1993</xref>: 19).</p>

<title>Welcome to the freak show: expanding queer feminist collectivity</title>
<p>On the official website, <italic>HallonTV</italic> is described as a: ‘journalist entertainment and culture programme with a focus on feminism, LGBTQ-issues and hence sexual politics’. The aim of initiating <italic>HallonTV</italic> was to create a forum for queer feminist culture broadly speaking, including anything feminist and/or LGBTQI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, intersex). Bitte describes the television show as having ‘a very traditional format – a bit like the <italic>Muppet Show</italic>’. Indeed, it is a programme that has its very own puppet at the helm: a gender neutral, purple and furry hand-sewn doll named Elle (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1367877912460614">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1367877912460614-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The format is interspersed with a number of individual contributions, such as interviews and documentaries as well as fictional pieces like, for example, the surreal soap opera <italic>Päronsoppa</italic> (Pear Soup) and the series <italic>Flickdetektiverna</italic> (Girl Detectives) – a parodic crime series in which Elle, the hand-puppet, is kidnapped and a small group of both trans- and cisgendered ‘girl detectives’ must find the show’s host. Additionally, the show comprises contributions from other alternative media producers. In every episode Elle encourages anyone to send in their own materials. This invitation goes so far as to offer the assistance of the <italic>Hallon</italic> production team and its equipment. When asked whether it was feasible to make such a commitment, Bitte explained to me that ‘hardly anyone ever gets in touch’, and so has not been a problem. She adds that they have done one such collaborative feature, together with FHOBIT – a Swedish organization for LGBTQI people with disabilities. Retroactively, Martin tells me that he had both hoped and expected that more people would submit their own contributions to <italic>HallonTV</italic>, not least considering the fact that they offered an opportunity for everyone with any connection to feminist, queer or gay issues to show their work to a significant number of viewers, completely free of charge. This striving for the creation of a space in-common was repeated on various occasions by the members of the <italic>Hallon</italic> team interviewed. For one of the overarching principles of the project is to serve as a meeting point between various queer and/or feminist perspectives. As such, <italic>HallonTV</italic>’s inclusive ethos extends beyond an already determined yet diverse set of feminist and LGBTQI modes of identification; it seeks to enlarge and extend the very queer feminist collectivity itself.</p>
<p>Similar to the DIY ethos associated with a renaissance in feminist politics in recent years – a central norm that <italic>HallonTV</italic> follows is its ‘amateur’ aesthetic. A tactic to inspire others to ‘do-it-themselves’, blurring the dichotomy between ‘the passive audience’ and ‘the active television producer’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367877912460614">Duncombe, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367877912460614">Triggs, 2006</xref>) – a dichotomy which Bitte argues is enhanced by the professionalism of mainstream television: ‘You can’t even <italic>look</italic> like the people on TV, and everything about it is completely alienating.’ The purpose of <italic>HallonTV</italic> was, therefore, to construct an inclusive media project where ‘everyone’ could participate. As such, <italic>HallonTV</italic> explicitly follows in the footsteps of earlier political and cultural movements which have consciously practised the ‘Do-It-Yourself!’ maxim, which, while having genealogical roots in earlier subcultures, is most often associated with the rise of the punk movement in the late 1970s – a movement to which both Bitte and Martin have previous connections, not least through their engagement as punk musicians and zinesters. The importance of this connection is confirmed by Martin in an interview, when asked whether DIY is an explicit source of inspiration. However, the comparisons can be overextended. For example, the zine genre can be said to have developed an easily recognizable cut-and-paste DIY aesthetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367877912460614">Duncombe, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367877912460614">Triggs, 2006</xref>). But <italic>HallonTV</italic> does not have such a prototypical genre format to signify their commitment to the DIY tradition.</p>
<p>These strategies can be described as a modality of what the anthropologist Victor Turner has called ‘the liminoid’: plural, fragmented and experimental phenomena which ‘develop most characteristically outside the central economic and political processes, along their margins, on their interfaces, in their “tacit dimensions”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367877912460614">Turner, 1977</xref>: 44). As a ‘liminoid medium’, <italic>HallonTV</italic> does not simply reverse the hegemonic mediascape, it represents a set of subversive and radical critiques of both hetero-patriarchy and consumer capitalism – or, more specifically, the contemporary heteronormative, sexist and capitalist mainstream media.</p>
<p>Despite positioning themselves on the margin, these liminoid practices of <italic>HallonTV</italic> do not simply represent a minoritarian oppositional politics. <italic>HallonTV</italic> is continuously interrogating its own borders, striving to open up – not only to existing ‘queer’ subjects but also to incorporate other modes of marginal identities (that is, identities which have not previously been recognized as belonging to the queer feminist struggle). Bitte mentions, for example, that there are some regular visitors to Hallongrottan who often come to the shop for free coffee, a biscuit and a chat but who, since they belong to an older generation and a different socio-economic group, would not belong to the expected target group of queer feminist activist produced culture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1367877912460614">4</xref></sup> She explains:<disp-quote>
<p>Well, we have had some feedback from people who have watched it on the Open Channel, and who would never have found it on the internet, or people who don’t have access to the net. We have some regulars who, without ever needing to buy anything, are hanging out here at Hallongrottan because we have free coffee and cookies every day. Some of these people are mentally ill or have drug problems, and they’re older than me, between 40 and 70. And if you’re poor or have problems like these you might not have followed the whole internet craze at all.… It’s quite fun when they’ve watched <italic>HallonTV</italic> on the Open Channel because it feels rather unexpected that they would have seen it at all. Otherwise the whole feminist and queer movements are rather segregated by age and class (and other aspects), so in this way we can reach out to other generations as well. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367877912460614">Andersson and Gunnarsson Payne, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By broadcasting on Öppna Kanalen, the team hoped to reach ‘new target groups’, that is to say, people who would not normally have visited Hallongrottan. In the same interview Bitte also explains that Öppna Kanalen is like a freak show – this is not meant in a pejorative sense, one must understand. What Bitte means by such a statement is that ‘it is more representative of <italic>how people really are</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367877912460614">Brynge, 2008</xref>). When asked what impact she thinks <italic>HallonTV</italic> has had, Bitte laughs and says ‘Nothing!’, but clarifies such a statement by adding that the project to date has not been properly exposed to have any dramatic effects outside of the rather small production team. While the feedback has been sparse (quantitatively speaking), she appreciates what little feedback has been received, not least because it is a sign that they have reached out to people beyond the queer and feminist movements.</p>

<title><italic>HallonTV</italic>: queer feminist beginnings and possible futures</title>
<p>While it is not possible to talk of <italic>one</italic> single ‘original’ event which was, on its own, constitutive of <italic>HallonTV</italic> and its subsequent follow-up projects, the significance of spontaneous interpersonal meetings has to be underscored. In the case of the <italic>Hallon</italic> team, it should not be forgotten that such initial meetings took place in a context which, in itself, functions as a ‘queer’, and therefore ‘liminoid’ space, which is defined by its inhabitants as Other than ‘the state of gender’. As such, the media production of the <italic>Hallon</italic> team can be understood as an attempt to capture, represent and expand these ‘original’ experiences of dislocatory and spontaneous queer feminist communitas. Perhaps needless to say, this attempt to preserve something of this positive experience happens continuously in a quite physical and concrete way, according to which each project meeting in itself constitutes a singular collective experience with the shared aim of making media, in which certain positions, norms and expectations are successively formed (positions, norms and expectations which are necessary for the continuation of the cooperation within the team) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367877912460614">Turner, 1969</xref>: 132). More important, however, for the understanding of what constitutes a <italic>mediating</italic> communitas, this attempt to maintain and expand this initiating experience takes place through the actual media representations which are produced as a result of these physical meetings. This may be the reason why <italic>HallonTV</italic> does not just offer an ‘alternative space’ in terms of the production meetings, but also in terms of the creation of a mediated space, a mediating communitas, into which a potential, and hitherto unknown audience, is invited.</p>
<p>For the <italic>Hallon</italic> team, the constitutive outside becomes embodied by ‘mainstream media’, including its mutually interdependent sexist, heteronormative, racist and capitalist elements. As such the purpose of <italic>HallonTV</italic>’s very existence is to provide an ‘alternative’ to the existing ways of thinking and doing gender (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367877912460614">Atton, 2002</xref>). Such an ‘alternative’ forms an inclusive collectivity which embraces what the team themselves refer to as ‘norm-breaking’ identities and forms of expression – often but not always in relation to gender and sexuality. In that sense, <italic>HallonTV</italic> begins with a radical break with a ‘state’ consisting of a set of social interrelated sedimented structures, such as consumer capitalism and a dualist and heteronormative gender system (although it should be noted that such a ‘break’, of course, does not take place in a vacuum but builds on the successes and setbacks of previous sexual-political struggles). As a political act <italic>HallonTV</italic> is described by its creators as a response to a lack of feminist and queer culture in mainstream media, a lack which is both a symptom of and reproduces a wider cultural invisibility of feminist and queer cultures: ‘Mass media aren’t really that interested in queer culture, so we just have to do it ourselves instead’, explains Bitte, and emphasizes the strong impact media have on one’s self-image.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We’re thinking that since media have an enormous influence over our self-perception, if you never see yourself represented in the media, it’s almost like you don’t exist, or like there’s something wrong with you. And I think most people feel like this, because the media, in principle, don’t represent anyone, really, as it just consists of super-edited people that are all perfect and popular, young and slim. So, the aims are to be a forum, to be emancipatory for the own group, and to change representations of men, women and trans people and just people in general. I realize that we don’t have the same influence as [mainstream] media, but you have to start somewhere. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367877912460614">Andersson and Gunnarsson Payne, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When Bitte states that ‘it’s almost like you don’t exist’, this can be interpreted in two ways. On the one hand we can read such a claim in terms of the mere invisibility of a queer collectivity (that is, a collectivity which lurks on the margins of the mediascape). But, on the other hand, Bitte’s claim can be understood in far more radical terms, as if she were positing the very non-existence of a queer feminist <italic>legitimate political subject –</italic> a legitimate political subject that would come into existence through a ‘pointing out’ of relations of social injustice, that would emerge out of a re-articulation of the ‘givenness’ of a structural relationship and show it <italic>as</italic> oppressive. For while ‘queer’ identities have largely been absent from both the small and the big screen, they have (when visible) often been represented either as figures of fun or derision. The effects of such cinematic representations, as has been well documented, have been the consolidation of a heteronormative ‘state of gender’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367877912460614">Russo, 1987</xref>). It is in light of these dominant processes that I understand Bitte’s earlier remark about being part of a ‘freak show’: the freaks metonymically come to represent ‘real people’.</p>
<p>The positing of the non-existence of a queer political subject should not be understood ‘objectively’. It is not a question of whether such a pronouncement is empirically felicitous or not. Politically, such claims have a poignancy and a function that renders their falsification (or for that matter verification) inappropriate. Rather, I would argue, they are part of the process of subjectivation by which Bitte makes sense of her experiences as part, specifically, of a media project, and, more generally, her place within a queer political community. We should therefore interpret this positing of non-existence as following a certain logic that opens up the possibility precisely for political intervention. This statement, asserting the non-existence of queer culture in mainstream media, precisely does so in order to circumscribe a lack. Only when such a non-existence is articulated <italic>as</italic> lack (as missing, as deficit) does any intervention make sense, that is, an attempt to begin filling this lack (embracing what is missing, rectifying the deficit) with a ‘queering’ of media content. As such, a communitas always needs to begin with a politicization of a current ‘state’ which, through a set of repetitive acts, has been sedimented and hegemonized and thus become perceived as ‘normal’ – a politicization, that is, which is an articulatory act which constitutes a ‘state’ <italic>as lacking</italic> and hence as something in need of ‘filling’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367877912460614">Žižek, 1997</xref>: 211).</p>

<title><italic>DYKE HARD</italic>: the cinematic adventures of the <italic>Hallon</italic> team</title>
<p>Their next project came to be a queer lesbian Thai-boxing action trailer with the title <italic>DYKE HARD 2 – Muay Thai Fire!</italic> In similar terms to <italic>HallonTV</italic>’s introductory scene and signature tune, this trailer begins with representations of queer feminist togetherness – harmony, even. After showing a two-headed fortune teller looking into her crystal ball, various images of queer nightlife are depicted: short film clips of what I understand to be a glamorous femme-looking night club singer, lesbian couples kissing, a male pole dancer, a group of butches raising their glasses in a disco and a male-to-female transgendered waitress are shown while the dark speaker voice states that: ‘In the queer community, trouble seems far away …’ The queer harmony, however, is soon to be interrupted with a front-up picture of Anna, the main character. The speaker voice continues: ‘Anna … is nice, gentle, and kind. But all that is about to change when her dark past catches up with her.’ Exactly what is represented by ‘her dark past’ is open for interpretation, but after the initial representations of ‘queer harmony’ there follows a series of, among other things, violent clips in which Anna is fighting enemies, presumably from this ‘dark past’ of hers. The open-ended format of the trailer leaves the viewers to draw their own conclusions as to what, or whom, this ‘dark past’ represents.</p>
<p>‘For this project’, continues Bitte, ‘I wanted to “flex my muscles”, both literally and metaphorically.’ Literally, meaning that she wanted this film to include her new passion of Thai boxing, which would give her the opportunity to play a physically strong character; metaphorically, meaning that she wanted it to be less amateurish, technologically speaking and instead use a form that would give her and Martin ample scope for aesthetic experimentation. ‘Of course it will be amateurish in comparison to [mainstream] trailers, but not in the same way as <italic>HallonTV</italic>’, she explains.</p>

</fig>
<p>Instead of embodying the DIY ethos via deliberate low-fi aesthetics, this time, the inclusive ethos takes the form of its easily recognizable action trailer format. The main aim of the new project is to entertain; it ‘has more of the function of a normal action film, only that it’s feminist!’ explains Bitte. Simply put: <italic>DYKE HARD 2</italic> should be more fun to watch, compared to <italic>HallonTV</italic>, which, with its slower pace and less conventional narratives and aesthetic expressions, might have been less compelling in terms of entertainment. Once initial decisions about form and genre were decided upon, film school student Alexi – another central member of the <italic>Hallon</italic> team – joined the process. Alexi proposed that the trailer should be filmed using the traditional Super 8 format, which despite being more expensive than using only digital technology would nonetheless be financially feasible, given the contracted form of its presentation.</p>
<p>The reason for choosing the action genre for their trailer is explained by Bitte: she had previously noticed that so called ‘female fury’ films had been very popular when she had screened them publicly in Hallongrottan. While these films always attracted a large audience and provoked ample laughter, there had nevertheless always seemed to be another, heterosexist, side to these films; the viewer would always have to ‘put up with’ a lot of female nudity represented in a sexist manner in order to see women handling weapons. This structural ambivalence was, according to Bitte, conducive to a queering of the genre:<disp-quote>
<p>So I thought that one could take everything which is fun from those films, and just [ignore] everything which is bad, so that one will get to watch female aggressivity without watching it through the male sexualizing gaze. So I think that’s emancipatory and fun. It’s entertainment.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Bitte explains that the attempt to combine entertainment with emancipatory representations is an explicit response to the dominant perception of feminist activism, on the one hand as ‘serious’, ‘laboured’ and (hetero-) sexist mainstream Hollywood films, on the other as ‘fun’ and ‘relaxing’. Feminism, she says, should not and does not <italic>necessarily</italic> have to be ‘serious’ or ‘difficult’. It does not need to be heavily theoretical, but can also be silly and funny, something which can be used for recreational purposes.</p>
<p>As such, the trailer project can be understood as much less dichotomous in its relationship to the ‘mainstream’. Instead of articulating the project in direct opposition to the mainstream as its constitutive outside, this project seemingly attempts to overcome the dichotomy between mainstream and alternative as such, and exploit and subvert some prototypical genre features of action trailers on the basis that they are widely familiar and commonly appreciated outside a narrow middle-class audience. In addition, both Bitte and Martin claim in their respective interviews that the action film genre lends itself more readily to homo-eroticism between men, not least because, as they say, ‘macho elements’ such as fighting and flexing one’s muscles seem to compensate for other, less traditionally masculine expressions – such as hugging and crying between men. In action, they state, ‘the whole emotional register is available’. And yet, while both Bitte and Martin appreciate the ease with which action films lend themselves to queer readings, they nonetheless diagnose a lack, that is, a lack of female action heroes:<disp-quote>
<p>While there are a lot of homo-erotic gay tendencies within action film – and within film more generally, really – there is a shortage of lesbian [homo-eroticism]. And, [in action film] women are normally just there to be rescued all the time.… So, one could of course reject the whole genre and say that it’s just a load of male chauvinist bullshit, but, I don’t know, I’m a girl and I enjoy it, and I’ve almost always enjoyed so called <italic>female fury</italic>, depictions of violent women…</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As with all her work, Bitte explains, the issue of representation is crucial, by which she means that she wants to contribute by creating and distributing non-stereotypical images of genders, sexualities and ethnicities, normally invisible or distorted in mainstream media. Her overarching aim is to contribute to changing the meaning of widely available images, and hence change, as she expresses it herself ‘people’s self-image and world view – like, pretty big goals!’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367877912460614">Gunnarsson Payne, 2009</xref>). The ‘norm-breaking’, in and of itself, has become the norm – though a norm which, somewhat paradoxically, attempts to direct its critical interrogation towards itself. In its practical manifestation, this constant striving to interrogate norms shows itself in a recurrence of self-critical discussions.</p>
<p>A year after <italic>DYKE HARD 2</italic> was screened at Stockholm Pride, a new website was set up, announcing yet another upcoming project of the <italic>Hallon</italic> team. Under the heading ‘A lesbian rock’n’roll adventure’ we read: ‘Welcome to the upcoming movie Dyke Hard’s official website!’ On this website the reader learns that ‘Dyke Hard is a feature-length movie currently being produced in Stockholm and Stjärnhov (Sweden) by a group of film nerds in love with trash.’ But instead of – as might be expected – continuing the implied narrative of the trailer, the feature-length film is described in this way:<disp-quote>
<p>The movie is about a failed lesbian rock group on their way to a battle of the bands in the big city. They team up with a Thai boxer on her way to a martial arts tournament and together they go through all kinds of adventures with ghosts, ninjas, cyborgs, prison breaks, evil roller derby girls, a motorcycle gang and a mysterious billionaire. Of course this movie is a musical and of course the story takes place in 1986. In true John Waters style we explore female comedy to the chocking max, but men-loving viewers need not worry – [there] will be plenty of [pole dancers], prison guards, cute bears and body builder ballet as well. Also tranny chasers should love this movie since several of the main characters and many of the extras are transgendered or transsexual. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367877912460614"><italic>DYKE HARD</italic>, 2011</xref>)</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1367877912460614-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The queerness of the film is signalled not only by the reassuring words aimed at ‘tranny chasers’ (a term sometimes used to describe persons who are attracted to transgendered or transsexual people) and ‘body building ballet’, but also in its use of unexpected combinations of characters (ninjas, cyborgs, ghosts, etc.) that normally would belong in different genres (martial arts film, science fiction, horror film, etc.). The queerness of the film thus stretches far beyond the identity politics – and neither does it presume all of its viewers necessarily to identify themselves as queer: ‘However you do not need to be queer or feminist to enjoy this movie, the eye candy alone is outstanding…’ The plot of the film is described as being ‘based on a previous series of fake trailers’ of different genres that were made as ‘a kind of wish list to the film industry’ and the text continues:<disp-quote>
<p>After having made one trailer, the action film one, they completely changed their minds and decided to put the sci-fi trailer, the horror-trailer, the prison trailer, the biker trailer and the other trailer ideas together in one feature-length movie instead.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although the main reason given on the website is pragmatic (to get more screen time for all of their efforts), the <italic>bricolage</italic> of genres and characters that result from merging the planned fake trailers into a feature-length film ends up breaking with the cultural expectations of genre. More importantly, however, this conglomerate of genres comes with a cast that equally breaks up any expectations of the combination of characters in a film. As such, the ‘queer community’ is not only represented as consisting of ‘freaks’ (in the aforementioned meaning of the term), but also of a highly unexpected combination of characters – thus representing the same inclusive <italic>ethos</italic> that has always permeated the activities of Hallongrottan as well as <italic>HallonTV</italic>. Hence, the combination of characters comes to represent not only more or less already culturally recognizable ‘queer subjects’ (lesbians, ‘tranny chasers’, polyamourous relationships) but also characters that hitherto have not been culturally recognized as queer (female rock musicians, Thai boxers), as well as characters that can be read as representing the hitherto unknown, potentially future (and certainly liminiod!) queer subjects (ghosts, cyborgs).</p>

<title>Concluding reflections: queer feminist movement media and the concept of ‘mediating communitas’</title>
<p>Nearly a decade after Butler argued for the continuous critical interrogation of ‘queer’ and for its ‘expanding political usages’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367877912460614">1993</xref>: 19), we can now conclude that ‘queer’ indeed in many contexts has become precisely such a ‘site of collective contestation’. More specifically, I would argue that it has come to function as what Laclau has termed an <italic>empty signifier</italic>, that is a ‘surface of inscription’ for a set of social demands – ‘demand’ meaning both ‘request’ and ‘claim’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367877912460614">2005</xref>: 73). Like all empty signifiers, queer always becomes visible ‘through the presence of its absence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367877912460614">Laclau, 1996</xref>: 53). It is this ever-present absence that provides its political potency and its capacity to continuously make claims for further inclusions to be made in its name (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367877912460614">Gunnarsson Payne, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367877912460614">2012</xref>). As such, the constitution of a queer political subject (as does <italic>any</italic> political subject) ‘requires the passage – via equivalences – from isolated, heterogeneous demands to a ‘global’ demand which involves the formation of political frontiers and the discursive construction of power as an antagonistic force’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367877912460614">Laclau, 2005</xref>: 110). But, as Laclau has also convincingly argued, this thesis of his only explains the <italic>form</italic> that the investment (in, in this case, ‘queer’) takes, but not the <italic>force</italic> in which this investment consists. In his own words: ‘It is clear, however, that if an entity becomes the object of investment – as in being in love, or in hatred – the investment necessarily belongs to the order of <italic>affect</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367877912460614">2005</xref>: 110). It is to explain this affective dimension of movement media production that I turn to Victor Turner in order to develop the concept of ‘mediating communitas’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1367877912460614">5</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>HallonTV</italic> and <italic>DYKE HARD</italic> become a prime example to effectively demonstrate just how this might be put into practice. Significantly, they show how, in the production of media, the community it is addressing is by no means pre-established or pre-constituted. The production of media is itself an experimentation and exploration of notions of – in this case, queer feminist – community, at a highly localized level. The production of the fictive worlds of the <italic>Hallon</italic> team can on the one hand be understood as an attempt to represent a set of ‘norm-breaking’ groups (feminists, lesbians, polyamorists, those who are psychologically ill, etc.) under the common label of ‘queer’ and belonging to a ‘queer community’. On the other hand, their media production should not merely be understood as transmitting an already formed political ‘message’ by an already constituted group, with an already formed ‘target group’, but rather as a continuation of an experience of ‘togetherness’ that is actively produced among the members within the limited time and place of the media production. Unlike Turner’s theorization of ‘ideological communitas’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367877912460614">1974</xref>: 132), <italic>mediating</italic> communitas occurs not through the stagnation of organizational forms, but instead becomes such an ‘outward form of inward experiences’ through the production of affectively laden visual-auditory materials (images, sound, language) that seeks to represent actual and imagined feelings of togetherness as well as potential or futures of the movement. Furthermore, I argue that it is precisely this claim for continuously re-articulating imagined futures and yet further inclusions that functions as the driving force behind the constant re-invention of the <italic>Hallon</italic> team’s ‘queer subjects’ – the invention of yet new ‘freaks’ to be represented through their media production. This movement towards continuously extended inclusions is characteristic of the potential of an empty signifier to serve a productive function not only in linking various disparate and particular political demands under one and the same ‘banner’, but also in constituting a political subject – in this case, a queer feminist political subject.</p>
<p>Through this continuous inclusionary mechanism, ‘queer’ as a <italic>political</italic> signifier has gone from representing a particular group (‘the homosexual’) to being extended to include feminists as well as norm-breaking sexualities more generally (‘tranny chasers’, ‘polyamory’, etc.) and to include also other ‘freaks’ (‘psychologically ill’, ‘homeless’, etc.). By extension, the signifier of ‘queer’ comes to serve a more all-encompassing, even universalist, function. It comes to represent at the same time, the <italic>deviant</italic> (queer, freak) and ‘everyone’ (because everyone is really ‘a freak’). As such, it is safe to say that <italic>HallonTV</italic> and its following-up projects not only ‘change what we know’ in the usual sense, but that it also, by relentlessly interrogating the boundaries of what (and who!) can be included in the queer feminist struggle, continually produces new possible struggles – and new, possibly yet unimaginable, queer feminist futures.</p>
