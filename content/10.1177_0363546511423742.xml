<abstract>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: Over the long term, acute patellar dislocations can result in patellar instability, with high recurrence rates after nonoperative treatment.</p>
<p><bold>Purpose</bold>: To compare the results of operative (reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament [MPFL]) versus nonoperative treatment of primary patellar dislocation.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design</bold>: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: Thirty-nine patients (41 knees) (mean age, 24.2 years; range, 12-38 years) with acute patellar dislocation were randomized into 2 groups. One group was treated nonoperatively with immobilization and physiotherapy, the other was treated surgically with MPFL reconstruction; both groups were evaluated with minimum follow-up of 2 years. The Kujala questionnaire was applied to assess pain and quality of life, and recurrence was evaluated. Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> or Fisher exact test was used in the statistical evaluation.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: The statistical analysis showed that the mean Kujala score was significantly lower in the nonoperative group (70.8), when compared with the mean value of the surgical group (88.9; <italic>P</italic> = .001). The surgical group presented a higher percentage of “good/excellent” results (71.43%) on the Kujala score when compared with the nonoperative group (25.0%; <italic>P</italic> = .003). The nonoperative group presented a large number of recurrences and subluxations (7 patients; 35% of cases), whereas there were no reports of recurrences or subluxations in the surgical group.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Treatment with MPFL reconstruction using the patellar tendon produced better results, based on the analyses of posttreatment recurrences and the better final results of the Kujala questionnaire after a minimum follow-up period of 2 years.</p>

<p>Acute patellar dislocation represents 2% to 3% of knee lesions and is the second most common cause of traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546511423742">36</xref></sup> In the long term, acute patellar dislocations can result in patellar instability with recurrence rates of 15% to 44% after nonoperative treatment, pain, inability to return to sports (reported by up to 55% of patients), and patellofemoral arthrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511423742">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most first-time traumatic patellar dislocations are treated nonoperatively, except when there was associated patellar displacement or osteochondral fractures of the lateral femoral condyle. However, studies that observed a recurrence rate of up to 44%, findings of slow-developing symptoms with previous pain in the frontal region of the knee, and recurring instability rate above 50% after nonoperative treatment led to an increase in initial treatment with surgical repair and reconstruction of the medial patellar stabilizers (medial patellofemoral ligament [MPFL], vastus medialis obliquus, and medial patellar retinaculum).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511423742">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511423742">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546511423742">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546511423742">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Major changes have been made recently in our understanding of the natural history of acute patellar dislocations, although literature on this subject is still scarce. There are few randomized controlled studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511423742">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511423742">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511423742">28</xref></sup> and only one systematic review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546511423742">36</xref></sup> Conclusions based on results of existing studies should be made carefully because of the vast diversity of methodologies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511423742">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511423742">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546511423742">36</xref></sup> As a result, there is a great deal of controversy regarding the ideal management in primary patellar dislocations.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to analyze and compare, both prospectively and randomly, the results obtained using 2 kinds of approach (reconstruction of the MPFL with patellar tendon vs nonoperative) in the treatment of traumatic patellar dislocation, in relation to the Kujala score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511423742">22</xref></sup> and to recurrence.</p>
<sec id="section1-0363546511423742" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Material and Methods</title>
<p>From 2003 to 2006 we evaluated 44 patients with diagnosis of primary patellar dislocation (23 men and 21 women; mean age, 24.02 years; range, 12-38 years). The diagnosis of primary patellar dislocation was based on the history of a laterally displaced patella and on physical examination, tenderness of the medial retinaculum, a positive apprehension test, and corresponding effusion or hemarthrosis of the knee joint. All the patients had radiographs of the affected knee (AP and lateral views of the knee in extension and axial patellar radiographs with 30° of flexion) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed for detection of potential chondral or osteochondral fragments and to confirm the diagnosis and injury to the MPFL.</p>
<sec id="section2-0363546511423742">
<title>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</title>
<p>The inclusion criteria for this prospective study were as follows: (1) occurrence of acute lateral patellar dislocation up to 3 weeks before treatment, (2) no history of previous surgery on the knee or serious lesion in the affected knee, (3) no coexistent serious tibiofemoral ligament lesion requiring repair, (4) absence of large osteochondral fragments (diameter &gt;15 mm) requiring fixation, and (5) patient’s authorization for participation in the study.</p>
<p>The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) previous surgery on the injured knee; (2) conditions associated with serious neuromuscular or congenital diseases; (3) patients younger than 12 years of age; (4) patients with patellar dislocation or symptoms of patellar instability in the affected knee prior to acute lesion; (5) nontraumatic patellar dislocation (eg, dislocation during gait or squatting with moderate stress on the knee, resulting in dislocation without acute pain in the knee); and (6) patients unable to comply with the treatment protocol.</p>
<p>Two patients were excluded, as they had osteochondral fragments (diameter &gt;15 mm) that required fixation, and 3 patients (11.3%) were lost in the follow-up period.</p>
<p>Thirty-nine patients (41 knees) with acute patellar dislocation were randomized in 2 groups (nonoperative group and reconstruction group) and evaluated with minimum follow-up of 2 years. For randomization, after the arrival of the patient to the emergency department and explanation of the protocol, we conducted a draw for the 2 groups: nonoperative or surgical/reconstruction.</p>
<p>One group (18 patients; 20 knees) received only nonoperative treatment (physical therapy), whereas the other group (21 patients; 21 knees) was treated surgically with reconstruction of the MPFL with patellar tendon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511423742">6</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511423742">Figure 1</xref>). The mean age for the reconstruction group was 23.95 years (range, 12-37 years) and for the nonoperative group was 24.10 years (range, 18-38 years). The average follow-up of patients was 44 months (range, 24-61 months). Nonoperative cases mean follow-up was 48 months (range, 24-61 months) whereas the surgical cases average follow-up was 38 months (range, 24-48 months). The difference in follow-up was due to the difficulty in calling patients in public service. We believe that the individual who is operated on may worry more and return when called with greater periodicity than the nonoperated group. None of these patients were in our previous studies.</p>

<p>In the nonoperative treatment group, the patients wore a brace in extension for 3 weeks followed by physical therapy focusing on range of movement and strengthening of quadriceps. During this period they initiated isometric quadriceps exercises as well as analgesia, cryotherapy, and electrical stimulation. Weightbearing was allowed after 3 weeks. In the third week, exercises for gain of movement were increased and the ergometric bicycle without load was introduced.</p>
<p>Initial proprioception and closed kinetic chain exercises were carried out and gradually evolved to open kinetic chain exercises. The objective was the patient’s return to previous sports activities in approximately 16 to 24 weeks.</p>
<p>In the reconstruction group, we started the procedure arthroscopically to diagnose and treat possible cartilage lesions in all the patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511423742">6</xref></sup> The surgical incision started proximally at the level of the superior margin of the patella, centrally between the patellar medial margin and the medial epicondyle. A descending incision was then made, directed toward the superomedial margin of the tibial tubercle. The medial third of the patellar ligament (PL) was separated from the rest of the ligament with dissection until the patella was reached. The PL was carefully detached from the patella up to the transition between the proximal third and medial third of the patella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511423742">Figure 2</xref>). We placed the stitches between the periosteum and the ligament using FiberWire nonabsorbable sutures (Arthrex, Naples, Florida) to safely rotate the graft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546511423742">Figure 3</xref>). The femoral insertion of the MPFL covered a more posterior area proximal to the medial epicondyle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546511423742">Figure 3</xref>). A tunnel was then perforated using a drill posterior and superiorly to the medial epicondyle and anterior and inferior to the adductor tubercle of the same diameter as the graft and this was fastened with an absorbable interference screw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546511423742">Figure 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546511423742">37</xref></sup> At the end, the distal edge of the vastus medialis muscle was sutured to the graft that reconstructed the ligament, bestowing a dynamic component on the reconstruction. No lateral release procedure was performed.</p>

<p>Rehabilitation started on the day of the patient’s first postoperative visit and the patient used an immobilizer for 3 weeks; isometric quadriceps exercises were started during this period, as were analgesia, cryotherapy, and electrical stimulation. The physical therapist performed passive knee mobilization during the visits, and weightbearing was allowed immediately after surgery. In the third week, exercises for regaining motion were increased, and the ergometric bicycle without load was introduced. Initial proprioception and closed kinetic chain exercises were performed and gradually evolved to open chain exercises. The objective was for the patient to return to previous sports activities in approximately 10 to 12 weeks.</p>
<p>The Kujala questionnaire was applied to assess the patient’s evolution in relation to pain and quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511423742">22</xref></sup> Recurrence was defined as a recurring patellar dislocation that required a further visit to the physician or hospital. Patellar instability was defined as recurrence and/or subjective sensation of subluxation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511423742">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Initially, the mean Kujala scores in the nonoperative and surgical groups were compared by means of the single-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). Afterward, still with the objective of comparing these mean values, we used the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for age, sex, and knee side, as these factors can influence the comparison of interest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511423742">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The necessary assumptions for use of the proposed models were evaluated and proved adequate for the data.</p>
<p>In addition to the analysis of Kujala scores in their original form (continuous variable), we also conducted the analysis of this variable after being qualitatively characterized as poor (Kujala ≤64), fair (Kujala between 65 and 84), and good/excellent (Kujala ≥85), as proposed by Sillanpäa et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546511423742">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>The associations between the Kujala categories and the variables group, sex, and knee side were evaluated by means of Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> or by Fisher exact test when the latter proved more suitable. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the ratio of chances between Kujala (considering 2 categories: poor/fair and good/excellent) and group, both in a univaried manner and when controlling by covariates age, sex, and knee side.</p>
<p>Also, the associations between predisposing factors (crossing sign<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511423742">17</xref></sup> [yes/no], trochlear bump [≥3 mm], femoral trochlea depth [≤4 mm], and patellar height–Caton-Dechamps method),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511423742">11</xref></sup> groups, and Kujala scores were evaluated by Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> or Fisher exact test. The radiographs taken for measurements of all the parameters were a true lateral view (when the posterior borders of the medial and lateral femoral condyles are superimposed or have a distance of no more than 2 mm) of the knee in 30° of flexion. The measurements were performed by OsiriX Imaging Software (Pixmeo, Bernex, Switzerland). Statistical significance was set at <italic>P</italic> ≤ .05.</p>
<p>The primary outcome used to calculate a sample size was Kujala. The sample size needed to compare the means of two groups ensuring a 90% power (1 – β = 0.90) and a significance level of 1% (α = .01) should be at least 22 individuals in each group. Considering the same power and a significance level of 5%, the sample size became at least 16 individuals in each group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511423742">31</xref></sup></p>

<p>Considering the division of the score in 2 categories, we concluded that the chance of a patient being classified with a good/excellent Kujala score was greater for those treated with surgery and is 7.5 times that of patients treated nonoperatively, with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) ranging from 1.9 to 30.0. This ratio of chances also appears significantly different from 1 after control by the variables sex, affected knee side, and age of patient (OR, 7.2; 95% CI, 1.7-29.6).</p>
<p>When we considered the predisposing factors, it was possible to observe a statistically significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) between groups only in the crossing sign, showing that there is a higher percentage of patients with crossing sign in the nonoperative group (95%) than in the reconstruction group (58.3%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0363546511423742">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Recurrence and/or Subluxation in the Nonoperative Group</title>
<p>In relation to recurrence and/or subluxation in the nonoperative group, it was observed that of the 20 knees evaluated, 35.0% (95% CI, 14.1%-55.9%) presented with recurrence (4 patients) or only subluxation (3 patients). It is also worth taking note that of the 2 patients who had both sides affected, one of them presented with recurrence on the right side and subluxation on the left side, and the other did not present any occurrence on either side.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There are many studies relating to the surgical treatment of patellar dislocations with more than 100 surgical, open, or arthroscopic techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546511423742">36</xref></sup> but few controlled randomized studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511423742">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511423742">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511423742">28</xref></sup> and only 1 systematic review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546511423742">36</xref></sup> comparing the nonoperative and surgical treatments.</p>
<p>In these studies, the authors recommend nonsurgical treatment for primary patellar dislocations except in cases where there is evidence of an osteochondral fragment. In the case of the presence of an osteochondral fracture, arthroscopy is recommended for removal of the fragment or open repair according to its size. More specifically, the well-designed randomized prospective study of Nikku et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511423742">28</xref></sup> compared surgical with nonoperative treatment in 125 patients with a 2-year follow-up. The results were evaluated subjectively by the general opinion of the patients (excellent, good, fair, and poor), by the Lysholm score, and by the Hughston visual analog scale (VAS). The authors concluded that the surgical and nonoperative treatments produced almost identical results after 2 years in relation to the subjective scores, recurrence of instability, and function. However, further complications occurred only after surgical treatment. Conclusions based on this study are difficult to make because of the reports of nonoperative treatment made by Mäenpäa and Lehto,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511423742">23</xref></sup> who showed that more than half of recurrences occurred 2 years or longer after the first dislocation.</p>
<p>In 2005 Nikku et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511423742">27</xref></sup> published their randomized prospective study on 125 patients over an average period of 7 years. The study compared the nonoperative treatment, with immobilization and functional rehabilitation, with lateral proximal realignment surgery (realignment of the extensor mechanism, repair of medial patellar ligaments, and/or release). Their clinical results were very similar between the nonoperative and surgical groups. Therefore, they did not recommend proximal realignment surgery for the treatment of primary patellar dislocations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511423742">27</xref></sup> This study was a level 1 randomized prospective trial, with long-term follow-up that compared the surgical conduct to the closed treatment of primary patellar dislocations. Moreover, episodes of redislocation and recurring subluxation were collectively placed in a group, called instability episodes, which contributed toward the slightly higher rate of recurrence in their series. We believe, like Stefancin and Parker,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546511423742">36</xref></sup> that the difference in surgical procedures makes a comparison between the 2 studies of Nikku et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511423742">27</xref></sup> and our study impossible. As observed in many other surgical procedures, the results of the series of MPFL repair cases seem to overestimate the success rates when compared with those of the randomized trials. In addition, a great variety of different surgical procedures was performed in the surgical group in the Nikku et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511423742">27</xref></sup> study. Surgical intervention in 10% of the patients consisted of isolated lateral release. In an additional 81% of the patients, the medial retinaculum was repaired or plicated, but the MPFL was not specifically used. Consequently, these results should not be extrapolated for procedures that involve MPFL repair or reconstruction. Finally, the Nikku et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511423742">27</xref></sup> trial included both adults and children. Therefore, comparing the results from the Nikku et al studies to ours is very difficult because we used only a single surgical technique involving the MPFL (now widely used) and did not analyze children younger than 12 years.</p>
<p>Another prospective and comparative study, conducted in a nonrandomized manner, was that of Sillanpäa et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546511423742">35</xref></sup> In our opinion, limitations of the study are that magnetic resonance was carried out only in the nonoperative group and the fixation of the surgical group was performed only on the patella. Another 2 comparative studies were those of Palmu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546511423742">30</xref></sup> and Buchner et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511423742">5</xref></sup> However, the first studied only patellofemoral dislocation in children and adolescents, and the second was a retrospective study in which the authors excluded patients with predisposing radiographic factors; in a total of 126 patients, they did not find a significant difference between the surgically and nonoperatively treated groups in redislocation and reoperation rates, level of activity, or functional and subjective outcomes.</p>
<p>Finally, a recent prospective and randomized study was that of Christiansen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511423742">9</xref></sup> The main critique of this study is that the patients from the surgical group were submitted to ligament repair on average 50 days after the traumatic episode and the lesion was fixed only at the femoral site.</p>
<p>We recently presented a nonrandomized prospective study comparing nonoperative treatment with MPFL repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511423742">7</xref></sup> In spite of the better rates of subjective scores and the lower number of recurrences of the surgical group in relation to the nonoperative group, 2 patients experienced subluxations with the same minimum follow-up time as our study on MPFL reconstruction.</p>
<p>Our study is the first prospective and randomized study comparing nonoperative treatment with a technique for reconstruction (and not repair) of the MPFL described previously by Camanho et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511423742">6</xref></sup> We believe that MPFL reconstruction is the most adequate surgical way of treating a traumatic acute patellar dislocation, as despite the controversy concerning at which site the MPFL lesion occurs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511423742">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546511423742">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546511423742">35</xref></sup> there are studies demonstrating that the intrasubstance lesion of the MPFL is not that infrequent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511423742">14</xref></sup> Nomura<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511423742">29</xref></sup> showed the site of the MPFL lesion through open exploration carried out on 27 knees after acute patellar dislocation. The MPFL suffered avulsion of its femoral insertion in 10 knees, and an intra-substance tear of the ligament was identified in another 16 knees. In their study, Sillanpäa et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546511423742">35</xref></sup> observed an internal tear in the MPFL substance in 10 patients (23%). In our clinical practice, MRI often reveals a focal lesion on the femur or patella; yet in many cases we also observe alterations in the ligament, due to either a partial or total lesion or just stretching of the MPFL. This can indicate that the repair and reinsertion of the MPFL in the adductor tubercle, which is the MPFL insertion site, or failure to identify and correct incompetence of the MPFL at the rupture site, would compromise reasonable surgical treatment. These proposals were also suggested by Christiansen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511423742">9</xref></sup> and Hautamaa et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511423742">19</xref></sup> respectively.</p>
<p>Another aspect that may be an advantage of reconstruction in relation to the repair of the MPFL is that we believe there are cases in which 1 or more sites is injured. Even in lesions in which apparently only 1 site presents a rupture, the ligament may have suffered a stretch in substance before the break.</p>
<p>Some series of cases also present encouraging results with MPFL reconstruction in the treatment of acute patellar dislocation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511423742">13</xref></sup> The importance of associating techniques that remake the anatomy and biomechanics of the MPFL is essential in surgery. Feller et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511423742">15</xref></sup> and Boden et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511423742">4</xref></sup> refer to the importance of the MPFL in the proprioception of the surrounding musculature. Through biomechanical studies, some authors conclude that the MPFL accounts for approximately 50% to 70% of total lateral restriction and is therefore the primary medial stabilizer of the patella.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511423742">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511423742">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511423742">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546511423742">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546511423742">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another important aspect in our technique is that we also perform a fixation of the graft to the vastus medialis, introducing a dynamic component to reconstruction. We believe that lateral release should never be executed in acute cases. According to the literature, the role of lateral release is not clear when combined with surgery of medial patellar structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511423742">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511423742">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546511423742">35</xref></sup> It was concluded that the performance of lateral release in patellar instability does not improve the clinical results, whereas this procedure can be beneficial for instable and painful patellae.</p>
<p>The role of lateral release is not clear, but some authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511423742">12</xref></sup> have suggested that lateral release can even increase lateral patellar instability, as their biomechanical study verified that the lateral retinaculum contributes 10% to the retention force. It is not known whether the lateral release performed in the Desio et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511423742">12</xref></sup> study caused any effect on patellar instability. It was theorized that lateral release could cause additional instability in hypermobile patellar articulation. In our study however, the dislocations were primary traumatic lesions and no hypermobile patellar articulation was found.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511423742">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511423742">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511423742">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511423742">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546511423742">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although recent reviews<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511423742">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546511423742">36</xref></sup> still consider nonoperative treatment the first option, some studies associate this treatment with evolution to recurrences. In 1979, McManus et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511423742">24</xref></sup> published a study on the natural history of acute patellar dislocation. Recurring dislocations occurred in 15% of the patients, with an additional 33% of patients experiencing sensations of instability or apprehension. Hawkins et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511423742">20</xref></sup> also related the natural history of acute patellar dislocation. Redislocation occurred in 15% of the patients, and a sensation of insecurity or instability of the knee persisted in another 20% of the patients. Mäenpäa and Lehto<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511423742">23</xref></sup> monitored 100 patients treated nonoperatively after patellar dislocation for 13 years on average. Forty-four percent of the patients presented with recurrence, and another 19% presented with occurrence of subluxation and patellofemoral pain.</p>
<p>It is surprising that there is little evidence in relation to the nonoperative treatment of primary patellar dislocation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511423742">25</xref></sup> Treatment protocols range from immediate mobilization without the use of a brace to plaster cast immobilization in extension for 6 weeks. Immobilization in extension could provide medial structures, particularly the MPFL, with the best means for their healing. However, this occurs at the expense of stiffness that frequently accompanies prolonged immobilization. Patient compliance can also be a factor in the decision for nonoperative treatment. For these reasons, many clinicians decide on a short period of immobilization followed by knee rehabilitation with or without a brace.</p>
<p>In our study, patients in the nonoperative treatment group remained in extension with the brace for 3 weeks followed by physical therapy focused on range of movement and strengthening of quadriceps.</p>
<p>Lesions of the articular cartilage are more common than believed formerly and were reported in about 10% to 40% of the cases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511423742">5</xref></sup> yet according to Nomura,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511423742">29</xref></sup> this incidence can reach up to 95% of primary patellar dislocations. What we took into consideration is the fragment size and intraoperative evaluation of the need to fix the lesion. In our study, we excluded 2 patients with osteochondral fragments (diameter &gt;15 mm) that required fixation.</p>
<p>Regarding our results, we consider the superiority of the results of the reconstruction group versus the nonoperative group evident, both in relation to recurrence (and consequently instability) as well as the specific Kujala patellofemoral score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511423742">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>In relation to the Kujala score, our results on quantitative analysis showed an evident advantage of the reconstruction group. According to the Sillanpäa et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546511423742">35</xref></sup> study, the Kujala score can be analyzed qualitatively: with a maximum possible score of 100 points (without symptoms), a score of 95 points or more is excellent, 94 to 85 is good, 84 to 65 is fair, and 64 or below is poor. Analyzing our sample group in this manner, we still showed superiority of the surgical group in the results of this score.</p>
<p>When we looked retrospectively at the predisposing factors considered in the literature (crossing sign, trochlear bump ≥3 mm; femoral trochlea depth ≤4 mm; patella height ≥1, 2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511423742">17</xref></sup> of 32 knees, we observed that only the crossing sign factor presented a difference between the groups. Also, patients who presented crossing sign had a worse mean score on the Kujala, and this difference was observed only in the quantitative analysis of the Kujala, not in the qualitative one.</p>
<p>Our study has some limitations: first was the short follow-up time (in spite of the minimum of 2 years) for us to evaluate mainly the recurrence rate. There is a tendency for redislocation with a longer follow-up time, both in the nonoperative and surgical series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511423742">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511423742">23</xref></sup> The short follow-up of the surgical series might explain the better results obtained after primary surgery.</p>
<p>Another critique is in relation to the number of patients studied in comparison with other studies in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511423742">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511423742">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511423742">27</xref></sup> However, we believe that our statistical analysis presented power of comparison in relation to the score used, since it was necessary for the sample size to be at least 16 patients per study group and for this to have been calculated with a power of 90% and type I error (α) of .05.</p>
<p>It was possible to conclude that treatment with reconstruction of the MPFL with the patellar tendon produced better results, based on the analyses of posttreatment recurrences and the better final results of the Kujala questionnaire after a minimum follow-up period of 2 years.</p>
