<title>Survey Quality Prediction (SQP) 2.0</title>
<p>The Research and Expertise Centre for Survey Methodology has announced a new version of the program Survey Quality Prediction (SQP). The program can be used at the moment free of charge at: http://www.sqp.nl. SQP 2.0 is a system for predicting and evaluating the quality of questions used in survey research. It allows survey researchers to create questions and obtain a quality prediction for them. The new version (2.0) of the program includes several interesting features. It contains a data base of approximately 3,000 questions in different forms of which the estimated quality is present as well. Based on a meta-analysis, it can also be used to make predictions of the quality of new questions not included in the data base. The program can also make suggestions for improvements of the questions if their quality is not good enough. The prediction and improvements can be made for questions in many different languages, including: English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Greek, Hebrew, Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Finish, Slovene, Czech, Polish, Russian, Bulgarian, Estonian, Latvian, Slovak, and Ukrainian.</p>
<p>The quality predictions can be used for several purposes. For example, they can be used for the selection or development of the best form of a question for a topic. They can be used for the correction for measurement errors in the estimation of correlations and other measures of relationships between variables. They can also be used for the control of comparability of questions after translation.</p>
<p>The program is unique and we think it is an important development in the improvement of survey research and the analysis of survey data. Therefore, we would like to announce also a course where we will introduce the program and show how the program can be used and a seminar where we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages with other experts in the field. You will find complete information regarding the course and the seminar at the following links: http://www.upf.edu/survey/activities/courses.html and http://www.upf.edu/survey/activities/seminars.html. For questions about the course or the seminar, feel free to contact us at recsm@upf.edu or at Research and Expertise Centre for Survey Methodology - RECSM, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Edifici ESCI-Born - Despatxos 19.517-19.527, Passeig Pujades, 1 - 08003 Barcelona; tel. +34 93 542 11 63, http://www.upf.edu/survey/ [mentioned briefly in the <italic>BMS</italic> 116].</p>

<bold>Equess</bold> - E-based Questionnaire Survey System Project (http://sofis.gesis.org/sofiswiki/Equess__e-based_questionnaire_survey_system, also mentioned briefly in the <italic>BMS</italic> 116), from June 2009 to May 2011 under the direction of Heinz Reinders (heinz.reinders@uni-wuerzburg.de). This research project aimed at developing and testing an electronic collection process from using PCs or laptops. The medium-term goal was to replace paper and pencil questionnaire surveys by Equess and by this means developing a more efficient way to carry out surveys. The focus was on developing an adaptive questionnaire system and the usefulness of this survey form in realistic scenarios. A comparative study with paper and pencil methods should determine the possibilities and limits of eventual applications. Keywords for this project are: process, interviewing, online surveys, questionnaires, computer, data mining. Tools and instruments involved include: survey techniques and analysis techniques of social science. The methods employed include: surveys, empirical and basic research, method development and comparison.</p>

One of the biggest improvements of the 2010 Brazilian Census Post Enumeration Survey (PES) conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) is the incorporation of new methodologies and technologies developed or improved throughout the last decade. The use of handheld devices for data collection, already experimented in the 2007 population count, was one of the successful innovations in the Census project, allowing for improvement in quality and timeliness in the data collection process. The use of new technologies had an effect on the structure and format of the data collected as it was delivered immediately after its collection. This change facilitates the need to perform automatic matching of census data with post enumeration survey data. In addition, the development of software packages that implement computational models for record linkage and matching has increased over the last 10 years, making it possible to find several software packages that perform similar tasks. To choose the best software for linking records from the Brazilian Census and the PES, IBGE concentrated efforts in studying software over the last two years. The studies involved assessment of corporate and free (open source) software, taking into account not only operational aspects, but also methodological issues for each package. The experiment was based on available documentation and software trial licenses, considering their suitability to the Brazilian Census PES project. The main findings of this study were presented in the following sections [of that issue of <italic>Survey Statistician</italic>].</p>
