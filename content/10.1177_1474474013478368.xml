<p>Reading archaeological studies can be tedious work. It can take considerable effort to wade through a morass of statistics, technical and theoretical jargon as well as patience to pick through the minutia of use-wear analysis on lithic tools. This effort can be further complicated by the inclusion of research material from disciplines outside of the archaeological purview and compounded by the research quagmires of environmental determinism and the concept of insularity that is an issue in both mainland and island archaeological studies. As a result the human, social element becomes obscured and the research is reduced to numbers neatly displayed in tables and graphs. Acknowledging these challenges within archaeological studies, Des Lauriers presents his research of the Baja California island, Isla Cedros, in a clear, concise style by adeptly combining diverse lines of inquiry from archaeological excavation, historical and contemporary ecological research, historical documentation and ethnography. He addresses the issues of insularity and environmental determinism in a manner that is accessible and pertinent to a wide range of social and scientific research interests.</p>
<p>Des Lauriers’s historical and contemporary ecological research encompasses the wider schema of island studies while focusing on the California archaeological debate. As Des Lauriers explains, the primary focus within current California archaeology has been on climate change as the major determinant in ‘the relationships between marine productivity, human exploitation patterns and the social responses to these changes.’ The inclusion of Isla Cedros into the dialogue broadens the knowledge base within California archaeology in particular and in island studies in general by providing fresh perspectives on the ‘social dimensions of human adaptation.’ Des Lauriers accomplishes this through archaeological excavations conducted on the island that have revealed a long-term occupation by maritime populations that extend back to at least 12,000 years. Archaeological evidence includes shell middens, burials, and fishhooks made of mussel shell (one of which may prove to be the oldest known fish hook in the archaeological record of the Americas), lithic tool assemblages and wooden fragments of watercraft. The use of historical documentation includes reports of encounters between the islanders and travelers such as Spanish explorers and Jesuit missionaries. These records provide information on the islanders’ use of watercraft, hunting and fishing activities, as well as chronicle the effects of foreign contact suffered by the islanders, with the eventual desertion of the island by the few survivors who left for the missions on the mainland. Des Lauriers uses members of the modern island fishing community as informants in his research of weather patterns and fishing strategies, based on his assertion that there are ‘ecological and social factors common to many fishing societies’, and therefore one can draw on similarities that exist between the contemporary and indigenous communities in terms of knowledge about the marine ecology of the island.</p>
<p>The history and archaeology of Isla Cedros is confidently revealed through Des Lauriers’s deft integration of diverse research strategies that aid him in keeping the social, human elements in sight while successfully navigating through the conceptual barriers of island insularity and environmental research paradigms. Through such efforts, he has set a standard for island studies research in the 21st century.</p>
