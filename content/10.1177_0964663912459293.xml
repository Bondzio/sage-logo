<abstract>
<p>Research indicates that individuals often endorse beliefs that false allegations in rape cases are commonplace and are also reluctant to believe a woman who states she was raped whilst drinking alcohol. On this basis, it can be hypothesised that people are increasingly likely to believe that false allegations occur more often when the complainant has been drinking. In order to examine the ways in which alcohol intoxication and false allegations of rape intertwine, this article critically examines the findings of four focus groups which were based around a vignette in which sex takes place between intoxicated individuals and consent is disputed. The article examines participants’ personal beliefs around three major themes: ‘not quite rape’; false allegations of rape; and voluntary intoxication and intercourse. Although participants acknowledged that sexual intercourse when drunk to the point of incapacity may amount to an unpleasant experience, it was held to constitute something distinctly different to rape. Participants also argued that it would be unfair to hold a defendant criminally liable for intercourse when parties were equally drunk and that alcohol-involved consensual sex may be reclassified as rape the next morning in order to rationalise regretted drunken behaviour.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is well documented that young people, including students, are high consumers of alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0964663912459293">Kypri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0964663912459293">YouGov, 2010</xref>) and that they frequently use alcohol to facilitate sexual encounters, including increasing their confidence to approach members of the opposite sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0964663912459293">Bellis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0964663912459293">Sumnall et al., 2007</xref>). Research also indicates that this association between alcohol and sexual outcomes serves to influence judgments around the consensual nature of alcohol-involved intercourse<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0964663912459293">1</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0964663912459293">George and Stoner, 2000</xref>). Indeed, recent social network responses to the conviction of the Welsh footballer Ched Evans for the rape of an extremely intoxicated woman, including the public ‘tweeting’ of the victim’s name, highlight the profound impact that alcohol consumption can have on third parties assessments of the legitimacy of alcohol-involved rapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0964663912459293">Bancroft, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Drawing upon the findings of an empirical research project with university students, this article provides a timely examination of young peoples’ attitudes and understandings around alcohol consumption, nonconsensual sex and the role of alcohol in the false allegation process. More specifically, the project examined how, and to what extent, perspectives around false rape allegations and voluntary intoxication intertwine. It also examined more broadly how alcohol-involved intercourse is perceived by students and, by implication, possible attitudinal difficulties that may arise in achieving convictions in alcohol-involved rape cases. To this end, four focus groups were conducted based on a real case in which sex took place between two very drunk acquaintances and consent was contested.</p>
<p>The analysis that follows provides critical insights into how complainant and defendant credibility and responsibility are constructed and explores what is deemed to constitute consent. This is an area where further research is required in order to develop understanding around attitudes that may impinge on the treatment of rape complainants who have been drinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0964663912459293">Stern Review, 2010</xref>) and to gain clarity on how the association between alcohol and sex may influence judgments around the consensual nature of intercourse and, by default, link to ideas and understandings around false rape allegations. The article also offers preliminary insights into perspectives that may be drawn upon by jurors in their deliberations of alcohol-involved rape cases.</p>
<p>The article is presented over four sections. To commence, an outline of the law of rape and the key issues and research which relate to this area are presented. Second, the study methodology is detailed followed by a critical analysis of the research findings. The final section of the article provides conclusions and suggestions for further research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0964663912459293">
<title>The law of rape and research context</title>
<p>In England and Wales, rape law was reformed in 2003 amongst concerns regarding the low reporting and conviction rate for the offence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0964663912459293">Home Office, 2002</xref>). Rape is now governed by Section 1 of the<italic> Sexual Offences Act 2003</italic> and involves the nonconsensual penile penetration of a person’s mouth, vagina or anus. As with the previous law, the absence of consent is pivotal: the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant did not consent and the jury must be satisfied that the accused did not hold a reasonable belief in consent. In making this latter assessment, the jury is to take into account ‘all the circumstances, including any steps [the defendant] has taken to ascertain whether [the complainant] consents’ (Section 1(2)).</p>
<p>For the first time, the 2003 Act implemented a statutory definition of consent. Section 74 states, ‘a person consents if he agrees by choice, and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice.’ Further significant reforms were implemented by virtue of Sections 75 and 76, which contain a range of evidential and conclusive presumptions regarding the absence of consent. Under these provisions, if the prosecution proves the existence of certain factors it will be presumed that the complainant did not consent and/or that the defendant did not hold a reasonable belief in consent. Whilst the presumptions in Section 75 are evidential and can therefore be rebutted by the defendant, under Section 76, lack of consent and/or belief in consent is conclusively presumed. Consequently, the circumstances which fall into this latter section are more narrowly construed, relating to cases involving certain types of deception. In contrast, the presumptions in Section 75 are wider and considered to represent situations in which most people would agree that consent was unlikely to be present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0964663912459293">Home Office, 2002</xref>: p. 16). They include the use, or threats, of violence along with cases of involuntary intoxication/drink spiking. For the purposes of the present analysis, cases that involve <italic>voluntary</italic> intoxication would only fall within Section 75 if the complainant was so drunk that she became unconscious (Section 75 (2)(d)).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0964663912459293">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 2006, a government consultation asked whether Section 75 should be amended to include situations involving extreme voluntary intoxication (Office for Criminal Justice Reform, 2006). One third of respondents argued that presumption Section 75(2)(d) should be changed to include situations in which the complainant was ‘too affected by alcohol or drugs to give free agreement’. Certain respondents referred to situations in which men may ‘seek to take advantage of the fact that women are drunk [voluntarily] and therefore have less capacity to resist pressure or coercion’ (Office for Criminal Justice Reform, 2007: p. 6). These proposals however were abandoned due to the fear of ‘mischievous accusations’ (Office for Criminal Justice Reform, 2006: p. 12), arguments that presuppose some linkage between intoxication and the potential for false rape allegations.</p>
<p>Voluntary intoxication short of the point of unconsciousness therefore falls under the general Section 74 definition of consent, where specific consideration is to be given to whether or not the complainant retained the capacity to consent. The complexities of capacity and intoxication are well documented in the case of <italic>R v Bree</italic> (2007). Whilst initially convicted for rape following sex with a complainant who was voluntarily and exceptionally intoxicated, his conviction was quashed on appeal due to the trial judge’s inadequate jury directions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0964663912459293">Cowan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0964663912459293">Elvin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0964663912459293">Gunby et al., 2010</xref> for a critical analysis of Bree, 2007). The Court of Appeal held that the jury should have received assistance with the meaning of the term ‘capacity’ when a complainant is affected by her own voluntarily induced intoxication and noted that ‘capacity to consent may evaporate well before a complainant becomes unconscious’ (Bree, 2007: p. 167). However, little further guidance was provided as it was considered to be a ‘fact-specific’ issue and not appropriate to create a ‘grid system’ which would enable the point of incapability to be linked to ‘some prescribed level of alcohol consumption’ (Bree, 2007: p. 167).</p>

<sec id="section3-0964663912459293">
<title>Rape myths, false allegations and intoxication</title>
<p>Despite the reforms to the law of rape in 2003, continued concerns regarding the criminal justice system’s handling of rape cases, along with the frequently reported 6% conviction rate and high levels of case attrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0964663912459293">Kelly et al., 2005</xref>), prompted a review into how rape complaints were handled by public authorities in England and Wales. The review noted that <italic>rape myths</italic> continue to impact upon the criminal justice process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0964663912459293">Sanders, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0964663912459293">Stern Review, 2010</xref>) including myths which presuppose many rape allegations are false (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0964663912459293">Ellison and Munro, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912459293">Kelly, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0964663912459293">Kelly et al., 2005</xref>). Such perspectives have historically influenced legal practice, including for example the extensive cross-examination of the complainant’s sexual history and corroboration warnings (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0964663912459293">Temkin, 2002</xref>). Whilst many of these provisions have been abandoned, or restrictions around their use applied, beliefs around the frequency of false rape reports continue to influence legal and political thinking and to problematise women’s accounts of rape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912459293">Kelly, 2010</xref>). Recent suggestions to provide anonymity for those accused of rape for example were premised partially on arguments that false allegations impact frequently in rape cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0964663912459293">Almandras, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Adherence to such perspectives, and their complex relationship to the police recorded no-crime code, has been documented amongst police officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912459293">Kelly, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0964663912459293">Kelly et al., 2005</xref>) as well as amongst members of wider society. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0964663912459293">Burton et al. (1998</xref>) found that from a sample of 2,039 young people 74% agreed that females often or sometimes ‘cry rape’ when really they just have second thoughts. The London-based <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0964663912459293">Opinion Matters (2010)</xref> survey identified one in five participants aged 18–50 years agreed that most claims of rape are probably not true, with men being more likely to endorse this perspective. More recent findings have documented that 47.7% of male students aged 18–24 years, compared to 33.6% of female, agreed with the statement that a significant proportion of rapes reported to the police were false allegations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0964663912459293">Gunby et al., 2012</xref>). Whilst gender is not a definitive predictor of adherence to false rape allegation beliefs, studies that have found gender distinctions may partially be explained through reference to differences in sexual expectations amongst young men and women (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0964663912459293">Beres, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0964663912459293">Gunby et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0964663912459293">Humphreys, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Ideas around the elevated nature of false rape allegations remain despite evidence that levels of false rape reporting are no different to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0964663912459293">Rumney, 2006</xref>), or potentially lower than (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912459293">Kelly, 2010</xref>), the levels of false complaints found across other crimes. Estimates suggest that between 2% and 8% of rape allegations are possibly false (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0964663912459293">Kelly et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0964663912459293">Lonsway et al., 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0964663912459293">3</xref></sup> Whilst further research is undoubtedly needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0964663912459293">Stern Review, 2010</xref>), ideas around the elevated frequency of false rape allegations appear to have a limited evidence base.</p>
<p>Running parallel are studies which highlight that third parties often hold a woman who was drinking prior to being raped partially accountable and are hesitant to convict the accused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0964663912459293">Finch and Munro, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0964663912459293">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0964663912459293">Gunby et al., 2012</xref>). If parties are depicted as equally intoxicated prior to nonconsensual sex, there is an increased reluctance to hold a defendant criminally liable for rape, even when the complainant’s degree of intoxication has rendered her incapable of giving consent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0964663912459293">Finch and Munro, 2005</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0964663912459293">4</xref></sup> However, when a defendant is depicted as sober, or less intoxicated than the victim, participants are more likely to hold the defendant criminally liable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0964663912459293">Finch and Munro, 2005</xref>). When evaluating whether a complainant is able to consent, participants have been found to focus on a victim’s level of consciousness at the time, with a number believing that as long as she maintained consciousness, she retained the capacity to reason (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0964663912459293">Finch and Munro, 2005</xref>), attitudes which contrast with the legal position (Bree, 2007).</p>
<p>It is possible to hypothesize that hesitance around believing an intoxicated female’s account of rape relates to assumptions around the accusation being false and the consequence of a sober retraction of consent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0964663912459293">Cowan, 2008</xref>). If rape victims believe such assumptions are made they may feed further into the culture of reluctance to report rape and seek support. Evidence illustrates that such fears are not unfounded with sceptical attitudes around alcohol-involved rape and false allegations impacting on the way cases are dealt with by police, prosecutors, judges and juries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0964663912459293">Stern Review, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section5-0964663912459293">
<title>Design, recruitment and materials</title>
<p>Four single sex focus groups were carried out with a total of 21 students (12 female and 9 male). Single sex groups were used in recognition that men and women often talk differently about rape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0964663912459293">Beres, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0964663912459293">Gunby et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0964663912459293">Schneider et al., 2009</xref>) and to minimise participants feeling inhibited to discuss perspectives due to having opposite sex individuals present. Participants were full-time undergraduate or postgraduate students studying on psychology (seven participants), criminology (three participants), medicine (two participants) and teacher training (nine participants) courses at an East Midlands university in England. A student sample was selected due to the 18 to 24-year demographic being increasingly at risk of experiencing nonconsensual sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0964663912459293">Abbey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0964663912459293">Walby and Allen, 2004</xref>). In light of students and young people using alcohol to facilitate sexual encounters, and the normalisation of heavy drinking amongst this group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0964663912459293">Bellis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0964663912459293">Kypri et al., 2005</xref>), students were considered an appropriate sample choice to enable informed debates to be generated which may be specifically pertinent to this demographic. The study vignette (see below description) was based around the behaviour of two students which further made the sample an appropriate choice in terms of asking participants to reflect on experiences they may be able to relate to.</p>
<p>Participants were recruited through nonprobability sampling techniques. Existing contacts at the given university were asked to disseminate information about the study to a subset of individuals. Six individuals volunteered to participate through this process and were asked to invite their peers to take part in the study. It is recognised that a nonrandom sampling approach, and the decision to include individuals within focus groups who were familiar with each other, may impact on the nature of discussions. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0964663912459293">Doherty and Anderson (2004</xref>) emphasise the potential for socially desirable responding (the tendency to give positive descriptions) when adopting discussion-based methods that examine controversial rape perspectives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0964663912459293">Ellison and Munro (2010a</xref>: p. 799) also acknowledge that individuals may be ‘well versed’ in ‘socially appropriate’ attitudes in relation to rape. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0964663912459293">Howarth (2002</xref>) argues that to enable controversial, sensitive, and distressing topics to be discussed openly and with confidence, group participants should be known to each other at some level. Due to the emotive nature of the research topic, desire to foster uninhibited conversation and potential for socially desirable responding – especially in the presence of unknown individuals – it was rationalised that the recruitment strategy suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0964663912459293">Howarth (2002</xref>) was appropriate. A focus group method was chosen to encourage debate between participants and to allow for the emergence of rich data. This approach also significantly reduces the directive influence of the interviewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0964663912459293">Morgan, 1997</xref>) and better corresponds to the process of jury deliberation, thus highlighting the complex and potentially contradictory ways in which attitudes inform deliberations.</p>
<p>Discussions were based around a vignette that modelled the facts reported in the Bree (2007) case. As discussed, this is recognised to epitomise the problems associated with having sex when parties are extremely drunk, thus enhancing the study’s ecological validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0964663912459293">Doherty and Anderson, 2004</xref>). The vignette described Benjamin and Michelle who were briefly acquainted, spending a night out, initially with another couple and then later alone. They were witnessed leaving a bar in the early hours of the morning and walking to Michelle’s flat where she vomits due to the alcohol consumed. Sex takes place which Michelle reports to a friend, and later to the police, as being nonconsensual. Michelle argues that her recollection was ‘very patchy’ (Bree, 2007: p. 161) despite recognition that she had not consented at the time. Benjamin maintains throughout his statement to the police that sex was consensual.</p>
<p>Whilst the authors were not aware of other studies that have used this case as a specific vignette, it was selected due to the fact that it has been the catalyst for much debate in the UK (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0964663912459293">Cowan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0964663912459293">Elvin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0964663912459293">Wallerstein, 2009</xref>). Study findings are therefore argued to be applicable to, and enhance, the wider international work which has examined the role of alcohol consumption on third parties’ attitudes towards sex and its consensual nature (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0964663912459293">Norris and Cubbins, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0964663912459293">Wall and Schuller; 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The limitations of the study methods are noted and their implications for generalisation. Whilst much research has used a vignette approach to examine the third-party assessments of rape, and make assumptions about juror behaviour in the trial context, it is recognised that such research cannot be deemed to inevitably generalise to real life jury decision making.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0964663912459293">5</xref></sup> The small sample size, recruitment from a single UK institution – of participants who were partially familiar – and the focus on a purely student sample all impact on the ability to make generalised claims. This is not inevitably problematic; as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0964663912459293">Finch and Munro (2006</xref>) argue, vignette research allows for the illumination of the reasoning process that different individuals use when reaching verdicts in rape cases, their factual knowledge, the triggers to spontaneous responses and the role of standards such as reasonable belief, in this process. The study thus lays important foundations for further, more heterogeneous, research to build upon.</p>
<p>A focus group guide was used to direct conversation and addressed the following topics:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Whether participants personally felt that Benjamin should be found guilty of rape and why.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>If not guilty of rape then of some other crime.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The factors that impacted on whether participants personally believed Michelle had been raped.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Whether participants’ personal perspectives would have differed if only Michelle had been drinking.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Initially, focus group participants were blind to the outcome of the Bree (2007) case. Towards the end of each focus group, participants were told that Bree (2007) was found `not guilty', in order to encourage further reflections on why Benjamin may have been acquitted. In light of the fact that most focus group participants had themselves decided that Benjamin should be acquitted, telling them that this had been the outcome resulted in no further information being elicited. Once focus groups had finished, all participants were informed of the decisions of both the jury and the Court of Appeal in the case.</p>
<p>All participants were provided with written copies of the legal definition of rape, sexual assault and the Section 74 consent definition to ensure they were aware of these definitions prior to commencing the focus group.</p>

<p>The transcripts were systematically scrutinised by one author using thematic analysis – a systematic approach to the categorisation and consolidation of study findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0964663912459293">Howarth, 2002</xref>) – and the qualitative software package, NVivo. Broad themes were identified and passages relating to each theme were grouped together and coded. Specific subthemes emerged and these were also coded, resulting in a hierarchical structure where lower order subthemes sat under the higher level theme. A total of 20% of the transcripts were checked for consistency in the allocation of codes and themes by a second author. No coding inconsistencies were identified.</p>

<title>Analysis and discussion</title>
<p>The following analysis focuses on three primary topics: ‘not quite rape’; ‘false allegations of rape’; and ‘voluntary intoxication and intercourse’. Within each higher order theme further subthemes were identified and examined in order to draw out key perspectives relating to intoxicated sexual intercourse and false allegations of rape.</p>

<title>Not quite rape</title>
<p>Participants were reluctant to label the vignette sex as rape and the subthemes that were developed to comprise this topic included ‘physical injury evidence’, which denoted the lack of injury within the case vignette. The subtheme ‘stereotype of rapist and rape’ was also developed to capture arguments around the behaviour of Benjamin failing to conform to that of a stereotypical sex attacker.</p>
<sec id="section9-0964663912459293">
<title>Physical injury evidence</title>
<p>The majority of participants did not perceive the sex depicted in the vignette to be representative of rape and almost all participants argued that they would have personally acquitted Benjamin. Key to this decision was their inability to be sure beyond reasonable doubt that rape had occurred, with certain misconceptions influencing judgements. It was argued that rape is ‘difficult to prove’ (Focus Group 1, Female 4; (FG1, F4)) and that there were no signs of ‘physical evidence’ (FG1, F1) indicating rape had taken place. Consistent with past research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0964663912459293">Ellison and Munro, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0964663912459293">2010a</xref>), multiple participants expected evidence of physical injury: ‘this is like such an unspeakable, horrible thing to happen to you, and I’ve no idea what it could possibly feel like. But I’d expect to see some scratches or bruises on her, or something’ (FG2, M3).</p>
<p>Several participants focused on this lack of physical evidence and argued that had severe bruising, cuts or broken bones been present, this would be indicative of rape and convince them of such. Corroborative evidence is typically absent in rape cases and a lack of physical injury undoubtedly makes an allegation harder to prove and the criminal burden of proof more difficult to reach. It was clear that for certain participants such evidential concerns influenced their arguments regarding the need for physical injury. However, for a smaller subset it was evident that rape was viewed as synonymous with violence. For this latter group there is perhaps a dissonance between the legal stance and lay expectation. That is, the law does not require evidence of injury in order for consent to be deemed absent (see <italic>R v Heard</italic>, 2007; <italic>R v Olugboja</italic>, 1981). Legally, the harms that arise from rape are viewed in relation to the sex that takes place without consent; the presence of injury simply acts to exacerbate the seriousness of the crime. Perspectives that assume rape involves injury may feed into ideas around false allegations of rape, where it may come to be assumed that if there is no evidence of violence, the allegation is potentially false.</p>

<sec id="section10-0964663912459293">
<title>Stereotype of rapist and rape</title>
<p>Participants emphasised that the defendant ‘offered to spend the night in her bed. So, obviously, he does not mean it in a conscious term to be rape’ (FG1, F2) and had not ‘pinned her down and shagged her’ (FG1, F4). Certain actions perpetrated by Benjamin prior to the sex, such as bringing Michelle a glass of water and helping to clean her up after having been sick, were perceived to demonstrate he was ‘obviously quite respectful of her’ (FG3, F5). Participants were consequently reluctant to define the sex as involving activity that should be criminalised: ‘… there’s a certain lack of morality on his part. He’s … I think, taking advantage of someone is vastly different to um … it’s vastly different to committing a sort of offence…’ (FG4, M1). Instead, it was argued that Benjamin had acted morally wrong, been ‘foolish’ (FG4, M2), made ‘an error of judgement’ (FG4, M1) and although a possible ‘scumbag’ (FG2, M4) for taking advantage, had not necessarily ‘done anything wrong in the eyes of the law’ (FG2, M4). Participants did not consequently feel that his behaviour was sufficient to warrant a prison sentence and further reasons for this perspective focused on the normalisation of the sex depicted: ‘it must happen too often to send people to prison for doing that’ (FG1, F4). Such normalisation suggests that the sex portrayed has to some extent come to be unquestionably accepted as reflective of the reality of heavy drinking situations, unsurprising in light of the noted research which demonstrates alcohol is used by young people to facilitate their sexual encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0964663912459293">Bellis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0964663912459293">Sumnall et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Whilst reluctant to describe the vignette sex as a crime, participants acknowledged it was ‘obviously an unpleasant experience’ (FG1, F4) but more in line with a ‘really bad one-night stand’ (FG1, F1). Sex was conceptualised to have been the result of mixed messages, poor communication and a reduction in inhibitions. Whilst these arguments lend weight to research that suggests when parties are equally intoxicated, participants look for a ‘mid-point’ between rape and consensual sex to describe that intercourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0964663912459293">Finch and Munro, 2005</xref>), the current study suggests that this mid-point behaviour is far more aligned with consensual sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0964663912459293">Gunby et al., 2012</xref>). The implications that stem from these arguments are that if participants are reluctant to conceptualise the situation depicted in the vignette as one that could involve the commission of a crime initially, they start from an assumption that will doubt the veracity of the complainant’s rape allegation. If the scenario is not what constitutes rape for them, then how can her complaint be conceptualised as true?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0964663912459293">
<title>False allegations of rape</title>
<p>The topic of false allegations was spontaneously raised by participants in all four focus groups without direction from the investigator, arguably demonstrating the pervasive nature of the issue. The subthemes that emerged from this topic included participants’ perceptions around the ‘motivations’ that drive a false allegation; ‘their frequency’; and the ‘ramifications of a false allegation’.</p>
<sec id="section12-0964663912459293">
<title>Motivations for a false allegation of rape</title>
<p>Participants in three of the groups raised for debate whether Michelle ‘regretted it afterwards…’ (FG2, M3) or questioned whether ‘she has consented in a way, but she doesn’t like the fact that she’s done it’ (FG3, F4), thus providing the backdrop for a false allegation to be made:
<disp-quote>
<p>…being used is a very schoolyard term to have used… it kind of shows that her initial reaction was that she’d been used; she hadn’t been raped. And then later on, perhaps when she’d thought about it… I don’t know, perhaps she altered events in her head, to say it’s rape (FG3, F3).</p>
</disp-quote>The possibility of a rape allegation being the consequence of events being ‘altered’ to fit with a rape experience is an issue individuals are entitled to consider when assessing the legitimacy of a case. However, the fact Michelle did not initially label her experience as rape is used by several participants to question the validity of her account. This perhaps highlights a limited understanding around the factors that impact on the labelling process (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0964663912459293">Bondurant, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0964663912459293">Kahn et al., 2003</xref>). Such findings sit within a wider framework that indicates third parties often expect rape complainants to adhere to stereotypical victim scripts which include the display of emotion, immediately reporting to the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0964663912459293">Ellison and Munro, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0964663912459293">Temkin and Krahe, 2008</xref>) and as currently suggested, to categorically identify and label that experience as rape.</p>
<p>Whilst a subset of participants argued that the vignette was unlikely to be a false report, protests were sometimes qualified: ‘I don’t see what she would get out of crying rape. I mean, unless she’s got a boyfriend or something’ (FG2, M5). The existence of a relationship appeared to increase the potential for a false allegation, based on the premise that such extreme actions would enable the complainant to ‘cover-up’ (FG4, M2) her indiscretion. False reports were also viewed as a method for seeking revenge, motivations identified in related literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0964663912459293">Ellison and Munro, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0964663912459293">Kelly et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0964663912459293">Lonsway et al., 2009</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>But also, I look at it um if she’s used the term been used, she could also be using this court case as a way to get back at him. If she feels, herself, that she’s been used, she could be thinking oh this is my way to get back at him, to show him that I didn’t want it to happen; that I feel used, so I’ll get my revenge, I’ll do payback more than anything, rather than feeling like she’s been raped afterwards (FG3, F2).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0964663912459293">
<title>Frequency of false allegations of rape</title>
<p>After the issue of false rape allegations had been raised by participants, they were asked whether they felt such reports were commonplace. Almost all participants argued they were likely to be infrequent due to there being ‘no real reward’ (FG3, F5) and that women would not want to go through the intrusive physical examination that would stem from making a claim. Whilst this perspective perhaps sits at odds with the frequency with which participants suggested the vignette could be an example of a false report, such a contradiction resonates with existent findings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0964663912459293">Ellison and Munro (2010a</xref>) for example, identified that when individually questioned on abstract rape perspectives, participants’ attitudes did not always mirror those which become apparent via the group process of deliberating a concrete case example. The social process of discussion, in conjunction with addressing issues of reasonable doubt and belief, resulted in a more complex interplay of factors being considered, which potentially triggered additional logics (including in the current instance, the possibility of an allegation being false). Whilst this may be one explanation for the dissonance in perspectives identified via direct questioning and the more subtle deliberative process, it is also possible that participants were aware that directly agreeing that false reports were frequent could have been perceived unduly unsympathetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0964663912459293">Doherty and Anderson, 2004</xref>), with such suggestions consequently remaining unendorsed.</p>
<p>Whilst directly arguing that false rape allegations were likely to be infrequent, participants nevertheless stated that ‘it’s easy to say rape, which I do think happens’ (FG1, F1). It may be the perceived ease with which a false allegation can be made which linked to assumptions around the vignette being an example of a false report. As noted, this philosophy has resonated within criminal law and impacted on rape legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0964663912459293">Rumney, 2006</xref>). Whilst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0964663912459293">Matthew Hale’s (1736</xref>: p. 634) famed argument that rape is an accusation easily made, yet hard to be defended, no longer resonates as profusely within legal thinking, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0964663912459293">Ellison and Munro (2010a</xref>) argue that the sentiment is still propelled via media reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0964663912459293">Gavey and Gow, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0964663912459293">Kitzinger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0964663912459293">Lilith Project, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0964663912459293">Lonsway et al. (2009</xref>) similarly argue that media accounts of false allegations, often made against popular cultural figures, contribute towards the overestimation of false allegations in everyday life and can serve to enhance assumptions around false allegations being commonplace, despite participants acknowledging to ‘not knowing anything about it really’ (FG2, M3).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0964663912459293">
<title>The ramifications of false allegations</title>
<p>Multiple participants across the groups argued that false reports can ‘ruin people’s lives’ (FG1, F1) and the ‘rumours will carry on’ (FG1, F6), even if the accusation is identified as false. In this sense, the wrongs of a false rape allegation were seen to relate to the impact of having the term rapist attributed to an individual. The repeated arguments that focused on men being wrongly and knowingly accused of rape, disproportionately outweighed the conversation held in relation to the harms of the rape offence to the complainant and wider society. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0964663912459293">Gavey (2005</xref>) has noted that an overriding focus around the ‘wrongness’ of false rape allegations, above and beyond the harms of rape itself, is an established feature of Western society and an example of the way in which the traumas of rape are marginalised.</p>
<p>Concern for the defendant was also expressed in relation to rape accusations and decisions to convict generally. Reflecting Ellison and Munro’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0964663912459293">2010b</xref>) findings, a participant argued ‘I don’t think his entire life and career should be marred by a conviction, based on this’ (FG3, F2), a comment that demonstrates awareness around the ramifications of being found guilty of rape. The majority of participants argued that in such ambiguous circumstances, and with such long-term implications, the defendant should be given the ‘benefit of the doubt’ (FG1, F5). Whilst such verdicts may relate to the problems of being sure beyond reasonable doubt when deciding on guilt, it was clear that for certain participants, in evaluating whether rape had occurred, the focus hinged on the harms of having the rape label attributed to the defendant.</p>
<p>Related to this issue, certain participants argued that the ramifications of being accused of rape made it irresponsible to take a complaint to the police unless the victim was <italic>sure</italic> rape has occurred: ‘so, if you’re not sure, then I think it’s quite irresponsible to make that claim’ (FG2, M2). Although this perspective was challenged, for a small number of participants there was the expectation that when memory of events was hampered by alcohol, at a minimum, the complainant should seek legal advice on how to proceed rather than ‘cry rape’ (FG2, M3) at the onset.</p>
<p>This argument again fails to recognise the impact of sexual offences where the associated trauma may inhibit the ability to take immediate coherent action. It perhaps also demonstrates a naivety over the workings of the criminal justice system and a complainant’s ability to access such legal advice, outside of the official police reporting route. The comment rightfully suggests that certain individuals may be confused about the sex they have experienced and may benefit from contact with someone suitably trained who could advise, and help categorise, what had been encountered without placing pressure to officially report the incident. It is possible that for certain individuals the reporting process is a fact-finding endeavour. If at the police reporting stage it is established that rape has not occurred, this may feed into notions of false allegations of rape, with the genuinely confused complainant being perceived to have made a hasty decision to report, which they subsequently retract, and which may come to be conceptualised as a retraction based upon a sober re-evaluation of the facts.</p>

<title>Voluntary Intoxication and Intercourse</title>
<p>Participants offered more general perspectives on alcohol-involved intercourse, with these conversations implicating potential difficulties in achieving convictions in alcohol-involved rape cases, whilst also elaborating further on the extent to which such views intertwine with wider ideas around false allegations. The subthemes developed included the ‘impact of alcohol on inhibitions’; Michelle’s ‘capacity to consent’; and the ‘dual impact of alcohol on defendant and complainant behaviour’.</p>
<sec id="section16-0964663912459293">
<title>Impact of alcohol on inhibitions</title>
<p>A large proportion of participants argued that alcohol reduces inhibitions and increases the potential for engaging in behaviours that may later be regretted: ‘alcohol lowers your inhibitions and fuels you to do things that perhaps you shouldn’t’ (FG3, F6). It was argued that if sex takes place during a period of extreme drunkenness, rape may be the ‘first reaction when they wake up’ (FG1, F3). It was rationalised that whilst sex may have been consensually engaged in at the time, it may be regretted the following day and re-labelled as nonconsensual:
<disp-quote>
<p>…has she not to some extent woken up and just regretted it, and kind of come to and suddenly thought oh God, what are people gonna think of me, what am I thinking of myself? So, it’s kind of an afterthought as well (FG1, F2).</p>
</disp-quote>It was clear that when participants talked about a complainant modifying the sex that took place to align it with a rape act, this was not always deemed a conscious or vindictive process, but one that may also be more subtle:
<disp-quote>
<p>When you’re drunk, you sometimes …. you know, you’re not sure what happened or what was a dream. And when you’ve spoken to Naomi, when you’ve still been drunk, that might all mesh into what you remember as well (FG2, M3).</p>
</disp-quote>False allegations were thus constructed as both the product of an overt decision to make a complaint for the purpose of covering up regretted sex as well as potentially being the product of more subtle processes which involved events being ‘altered’ during the course of trying to account for, and rationalise, regretted intercourse. It was clear that it was this impact of alcohol on inhibitions and behaviour specifically, which related to participants’ assumptions that false reports were more likely when drinking – either through an intentional decision to make a false claim or via the impact of alcohol on cognition, recollection and the restructuring of events the next morning. Indeed, this explanation was offered significantly more frequently than motivations that focused on making a false claim for the purpose of revenge or to protect an existent relationship. Whilst certain participants argued that having drank alcohol prior to a rape is likely to decrease a complainant’s likelihood of reporting the assault, due to fears around being perceived non-credible, the majority of participants argued that people are more likely to use alcohol ‘as their excuse’ (FG1, F5) for engaging in uninhibited behaviours. These findings support larger scale quantitative data which indicates that 81.1% of students (N = 869) aged 18 to 24 years agreed that being drunk when having sex increases the likelihood of a false rape allegation being made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0964663912459293">Gunby et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0964663912459293">
<title>Capacity</title>
<p>Section 74 of the <italic>Sexual Offences Act 2003</italic> makes clear that an individual must retain the capacity to consent in order for that consent to be valid. Participants emphasised the difficulties of evaluating the vignette case facts and being able to accurately gauge Michelle’s level of alcohol intoxication, and by default, degree of capability. Whilst a subset of participants focused on the complainant having been sick, and felt that this should have been a sufficient indicator to prevent the defendant from having sex with her, it was not deemed sufficient in isolation to convince participants that she lacked the capacity to consent entirely: ‘you can have a few drinks and be sick, and not even really be that drunk’ (FG3, F3). Certain participants also drew upon Michelle’s ability to effectively verbalise and walk without staggering to determine her capacity: ‘if you can walk, you know, quite well, you’d think that someone was okay’ (FG3, F3).</p>
<p>Whilst the law acknowledges that an individual may lose the capacity to consent before the point of unconsciousness, the study suggests that for certain participants, such extreme states of intoxication may only be deemed suitable markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0964663912459293">Finch and Munro, 2006</xref>). These comments are perhaps unsurprising in light of arguments around the capacity construct being unhelpful in illuminating the nuanced stages of intoxication. Under such circumstances, it is argued that lack of capacity will typically be judged through reference to an extreme point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0964663912459293">Cowan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0964663912459293">Elvin, 2008</xref>). Despite these comments, there was a consensus that alcohol impacts differently on people, making it difficult to establish the point at which an individual loses the capacity to consent:
<disp-quote>
<p>Alcohol affects different people differently, and there are different times alcohol will affect the same individual. You can have three beers and be absolutely fine on one night. You could have a beer and a cocktail another night and be blasted (FG1, F1).</p>
</disp-quote>Participants thus expressed their sympathy for the defendant at this point, arguing it would have been impossible ‘to judge it really’ (FG4, M2) and that in the absence of ‘a breath test’ (FG2, M5), it was unreasonable to assume he should be able to appreciate whether the complainant retained the capacity to consent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0964663912459293">
<title>The dual impact of alcohol on defendant and complainant behaviour: constructing female responsibility</title>
<p>When participants were asked who they personally felt should take responsibility for ensuring consent was clearly established in a sexual situation, all participants argued that responsibility should be shared, or, it was a man’s moral duty to ensure his partner was fully consenting. However, if both parties were equally intoxicated, men were deemed able to forfeit such duties: ‘I think in a normal sexual situation, it would be shared. But when you’re both drunk, I think it’s just whoever’s the most sober should make the decision’ (FG3, F4).</p>
<p>The majority of participants argued that if through alcohol the complainant was left too intoxicated to retain the capacity to consent to intercourse, alcohol may have similarly impacted on the defendant’s ability to identify whether his partner had the capacity, thus ‘making you more likely to think that they’d [the partner] given reasonable consent’ (FG2, M2). Whilst intoxication is not a factor that can be taken into account when determining whether the defendant held a reasonable belief in consent (<italic>DPP v Majewski</italic>, 1977; <italic>R v Heard</italic>, 2007), it was clear participants did not recognise this or, if they did, still sympathised with the drunken defendant: ‘but if he’s drunk to a certain extent that he does reasonably believe that B consents, then he hasn’t done anything wrong, in the eyes of the law’ (FG2, M6). It is realistic to assume that for certain individuals, extreme intoxication will incorrectly be viewed as a reasonable excuse for believing consent had been given.</p>
<p>When participants were asked whether they personally felt that Benjamin would have been found guilty of rape if only the complainant had been drinking, there was consensus across the groups that there would have been an increased likelihood. If sober, the defendant was perceived to be in a position where he could appreciate the complainant’s degree of capacity and had ‘enough coherence to have the responsibility to make the judgement call’ (FG1, F6): ‘If you’re sober and you know that someone is drunk, then you know full well that your moral responsibility is not to take advantage of them… I dunno if it’s a law thing… you just wouldn’t, would you?’ (FG2, M6). This argument implies that the law is not the motivator that drives appropriate sexual encounters, but rather a sense of morality influences behaviour. Moral responsibility, however, still appeared to be something that could be forfeited when parties were equivalently intoxicated, but not when there was a disparity in that intoxication. These findings support the research that has identified that third parties perceive it unfair to hold a defendant criminally liable for rape if each individual is equally intoxicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0964663912459293">Finch and Munro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0964663912459293">Gunby et al., 2012</xref>), yet are more inclined to label sex as rape when a complainant is drinking independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0964663912459293">Norris and Cubbins, 1992</xref>), or the defendant is less intoxicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0964663912459293">Finch and Munro, 2005</xref>). Whilst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0964663912459293">Finch and Munro (2005</xref>) argue that a less drunk or sober defendant is perceived to be in a position whereby he is able to ensure the complainant has the capacity to consent, the current study indicates that an intoxicated defendant is perceived to be in a disadvantageous position whereby he is unable to clearly gauge the complainant’s level of intoxication, and therefore her capacity. Being in such a position was seen to reduce the defendant’s responsibility for ensuring consent was present.</p>
<p>A subset of participants focused on the complainant’s lack of verbalised ‘no’ in rationalising why they were insufficiently convinced that rape had taken place: ‘…at no point has she said…. or she can’t recall saying no to sex’ (FG4, M1). The dissonance between the law, which does not require consent to be verbally expressed (<italic>R v Heard</italic>, 2007), and lay assumption is again apparent. Female participants specifically emphasised that sexual intentions must be effectively communicated:
<disp-quote>
<p>She needs to say no beforehand. There’s no point in saying I didn’t want to do it afterwards… that’s just gonna confuse everyone. So, like yeah, it’s up to the woman to say before it happens, yes or no in an obvious and clear way (FG3, F3).</p>
</disp-quote>The implications of this argument are multiple. It feeds into ideas around the retraction of consent which underpin previous arguments around false allegations being made upon re-evaluation of the sex that occurred, as well as suggesting that if a verbalised ‘no’ is not given, this could be deemed indicative of the allegation being false. It also implies that in the absence of clear articulation, the defendant will be left without sufficient ability to negotiate, or read, the sexual situation. As previously noted, under Section 1(2) of the <italic>Sexual Offences Act 2003</italic>, juries are required to take into account any steps taken by the defendant to ascertain consent, which could include asking a partner whether they are happy for the sexual interaction to progress. Despite being provided with the legal definition of rape, and participants therefore being aware of this responsibility on defendants, a minority (of women) still deemed the female to be the party who should take control over clarifying sexual expectations. Whilst research suggests that men are more likely to endorse attitudes which feed into beliefs relating to false allegations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0964663912459293">Gunby et al., 2012</xref>; Opinion Matters, 2010), women have been found to more frequently assume that other women should take some degree of responsibility for nonconsensual sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0964663912459293">Finch and Munro, 2007</xref>; Opinion Matters, 2010). This includes taking responsibility for avoiding miscommunication and for effectively communicating nonconsent through overt verbal responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0964663912459293">Ellison and Munro, 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>Whilst emphasising the need for sexual intentions to be clear, it was paradoxically noted that it could be a ‘passion killer’ for the man to ask whether he could have sex with his partner. In this sense, consent was still viewed as more natural and appropriate if controlled by the woman. The articulation of such arguments reflect the traditional sexual scripts that suggest men are responsible for the initiation of sexual encounters and the active pursuit of sexual outcomes, care of their higher sex drive. Women by contrast are seen to set sexual parameters and provide ‘control’ over the time and place of sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0964663912459293">Frith, 2009</xref>). It is interesting to note that women still drew upon these scripts of supposedly ‘normal’ male and female sexuality to ground their arguments and which perhaps provided a basis for explaining why women’s ability to verbally resist male sexual advances received such scrutiny.</p>
<p>Female participants also highlighted the importance of personal responsibility when drinking and recognising the ramifications of extreme drunkenness: ‘… I think people do have responsibilities to look after themselves. And I think that the amount that she drank, and the fact that she went out with another couple, will really go against her in that sense’ (FG3, F4). The disproportionate focus on women (as opposed to men) taking personal responsibility when drinking may relate to women being at enhanced risk of experiencing sexual offences initially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0964663912459293">Kershaw et al., 2008</xref>), hence their perceived role in attempting to reduce that vulnerability. Women are often subject to awareness raising campaign literature that warns them against the dangers of extreme drinking, leaving friends unattended on evenings out and accepting drinks from strangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0964663912459293">Neame, 2003</xref>), also potentially sensitising women to such arguments. Whilst it is acknowledged that campaign literature is increasingly incorporating messages that are directed at men, in attempts to reduce the prevalence of rape, such messages will take time to infiltrate into public consciousness and to temper those which have long focused on the modification of female behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0964663912459293">Neame, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Whilst all individuals should perhaps work towards recognising potential vulnerabilities when drinking, and to equally recognise such vulnerabilities in others, it is noteworthy that there was no comparable discussion around men needing to consider how much alcohol they consumed on a night out, or the possible impacts of their intoxication on their ability to read consent-relevant cues. The overriding focus on the steps that women should take to avoid sexual offences resonates with findings that indicate when rape occurs, the spotlight resides firmly on the female’s actions prior to the assault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0964663912459293">Finch and Munro, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0964663912459293">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0964663912459293">Kelly et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0964663912459293">Temkin and Krahe, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>A key aim of the research project was to investigate how perspectives towards false allegations and alcohol intoxication intertwine. By investigating such attitudes it is possible to reflect on the perceived role of alcohol within the false reporting process, provide insights into the way lay individuals apportion responsibility and illuminate stereotypes that may exist. Accordingly, the study falls within the recommendations of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0964663912459293">Stern Review (2010</xref>) to provide additional research that can enhance understandings of false rape allegations, thus enabling unfounded stereotypes to be challenged.</p>
<p>The study highlighted considerable consensus across participants’ perspectives regarding alcohol-involved rape. When members of a drinking dyad are presented as equally intoxicated, there was a reduced willingness to label the depiction of nonconsensual sex as rape. Whilst alcohol intoxication is not a defence to a sexual offence, it was evident that participants viewed comparable degrees of drunkenness as a factor that was sufficient to reasonably mitigate the defendant’s responsibility for ascertaining consent. When nonconsensual sex took place between equally intoxicated individuals, that intercourse was collectively constructed to be the unpleasant, but somewhat understandable, outcome of extreme intoxication; raising clear concerns around the potential for alcohol-involved nonconsensual intercourse to be re-categorised at trial as simply being constitutive of ‘bad sex’.</p>
<p>The impact of alcohol on cognition and inhibitions was deemed central in encouraging individuals to partake in behaviours they would not if sober. The potential for sex to occur, care of a disinhibited state, and later be reformulated as nonconsensual (either intentionally or via more subtle processes) to account for that behaviour, underpinned the assumption that false rape reports are more likely when drinking. Throughout the discussions it was evident that the focus remained on Michelle’s actions prior to the intercourse, including her failures for having not explicitly verbalised nonconsent and for placing herself in a vulnerable position. No equivalent arguments were made in relation to the steps Benjamin could have taken to ensure consent was present and how his extreme alcohol consumption may have increased his potential for misperceiving Michelle’s sexual intentions. To this end, additional awareness raising is paramount to help articulate the legal stance on rape, the rape victim experience, to emphasise that intoxication is not a defence to a charge of rape and to raise awareness around men also being instrumental in preventing nonconsensual experiences. Awareness raising should also focus specifically on attitudes held in relation to false allegations of rape and dissemination of the facts that can dispel such myths. It is acknowledged that further research is needed to help categorically clarify rates of false rape reporting and the factors associated with these allegations. Only then will the extent of the situation, and the contextual factors surrounding false reports, be fully understood.</p>

<p>It should be noted that almost all focus group participants felt Benjamin should be acquitted, whilst the actual jury in the case of Bree (2007) found him guilty. Unlike the Bree (2007) jury, the current study consisted of students and it may be that alcohol-involved experiences are partially normalised for this group, impacting on verdicts.</p>
