<abstract>
<p>Patients with critical limb ischemia have higher rates of death and amputation after revascularization compared to patients with intermittent claudication. However, the differences in patency after percutaneous revascularization of the superficial femoral artery are uncertain and impact the long-term risk of amputation and function in critical limb ischemia. We identified 171 limbs from 136 consecutive patients who had angioplasty and/or stenting for superﬁcial femoral artery stenoses or occlusions from July 2003 through June 2007. Patients were followed for primary and secondary patency, death and amputation up to 2.5 years, and 111 claudicants were retrospectively compared to the 25 patients with critical limb ischemia. Successful percutaneous revascularization occurred in 128 of 142 limbs (90%) with claudication versus 25 of 29 limbs (86%) with critical limb ischemia (<italic>p</italic> = 0.51). Overall secondary patency at 2.5 years was 91% for claudication and 88% for critical limb ischemia. In Cox proportional hazards models, percutaneous revascularization for critical limb ischemia had similar long-term primary patency (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.4, 2.6; <italic>p</italic> = 0.89) and secondary patency (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.2, 6.0; <italic>p</italic> = 0.95) to revascularization for claudication. Patients with critical limb ischemia had higher mortality and death rates compared to claudicants, with prior statin use associated with less death (<italic>p</italic> = 0.034) and amputation (<italic>p</italic> = 0.010), and prior clopidogrel use associated with less amputation (<italic>p</italic> = 0.034). In conclusion, percutaneous superficial femoral artery revascularization is associated with similar long-term durability in both groups. Intensive treatment of atherosclerosis risk factors and surveillance for restenosis likely contribute to improving the long-term outcomes of both manifestations of peripheral artery disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Death and amputation after revascularization are more common in patients with critical limb ischemia than in patients with intermittent claudication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1358863X12440141">1</xref></sup> This is related to severe comorbidities and advanced coronary and cerebrovascular atherosclerosis in patients with critical limb ischemia. However, the long-term patency of percutaneous revascularization of the superficial femoral artery for critical limb ischemia compared to claudication is uncertain. If critical limb ischemia is associated with poorer long-term patency after percutaneous procedures, this would impact long-term limb survival and function after percutaneous revascularization for critical limb ischemia.</p>
<p>We previously showed the importance of lesion length in determining long-term patency in patients with claudication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1358863X12440141">2</xref></sup> In this study, we assessed whether percutaneous superficial femoral artery revascularization among patients with critical limb ischemia had inferior long-term patency compared to patients revascularized for claudication. We also compared the long-term risk of death and amputation among critical limb ischemia patients compared to claudicants and assessed factors associated with these outcomes.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1358863X12440141">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>We used a retrospective cohort design to identify consecutive patients who had angioplasty and/or stenting of the superﬁcial femoral artery for intermittent claudication or critical limb ischemia from July 2003 through June 2007 by the Interventional Vascular Medicine Services at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the VA Boston Healthcare System. We compared the patency and outcomes of 111 patients with claudication to 25 patients with critical limb ischemia. Patients were referred to each tertiary care center from providers within and outside the hospitals, and evaluated in the Interventional Vascular Medicine Clinic prior to proceeding to revascularization. The Research Ethics Committees at each institution approved the protocol.</p>
<p>We reviewed the electronic medical records and procedure reports to collect data on patient demographics, procedure characteristics, atherosclerotic risk factors at the time of their index procedure and subsequent outpatient visits, and vascular studies (ankle–brachial indices (ABIs) and duplex ultrasound). Chronic kidney disease was deﬁned as a creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dl or dialysis dependence, coronary artery disease was deﬁned as angiographically documented coronary stenosis &gt; 50% or past coronary revascularization, and diabetes and hypertension by a history of these risk factors or medical treatment. Runoff was defined as the number of patent anterior and posterior tibial arteries into the foot and peroneal artery to the ankle. Lesion length was deﬁned as the total length of stents used in the index procedure or estimated from the angiogram using the known length of the angioplasty balloons and grouped into three categories (lesions &lt; 100 mm, &gt; 100–200 mm, or &gt; 200 mm).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1358863X12440141">
<title>Procedure details</title>
<p>All procedures were performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory by interventionalists with endovascular certification by the American Board of Vascular Medicine. Selective angiography was performed under local anesthesia via contralateral retrograde or ipsilateral antegrade common femoral artery access. Patients were anticoagulated with unfractionated heparin or direct thrombin inhibitors. Lesions were crossed using a variety of techniques including 0.014-inch, 0.025-inch, and 0.035-inch stainless steel or hydrophilic wires. Long lesions were usually crossed with either 0.014-inch coronary wires or 0.025-inch hydrophilic wires using a support balloon or catheter. The wire-loop method (‘subintimal technique’) was used rarely. All procedures used balloon angioplasty, and most were stented with nitinol self-expanding stents (70% of successful index procedures). Balloon diameters with a 1:1 ratio to the reference segment were used for balloon angioplasty. Nitinol self-expanding stents were deployed after balloon angioplasty if there were ﬂow-limiting dissections or signiﬁcant residual stenoses (&gt; 50%). Adjunctive therapy in the 153 successful cases included atherectomy in 10 (7%) limbs, laser therapy in 19 (12%) limbs, and a lumen re-entry device in nine (6%) limbs. Patients either received clopidogrel for 5 days prior to the procedure or received a loading dose of 300 mg after the index procedure. Antiplatelet therapy post-procedure included aspirin 81–325 mg daily indeﬁnitely and clopidogrel 75 mg daily for at least 1 month. Statin treatment was used almost universally (90% of patients).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1358863X12440141">
<title>Post-procedure follow-up</title>
<p>All patients were followed in the outpatient Interventional Vascular Medicine Clinic at their institution 1–2 months post-procedure, 6 months post-procedure, and then at 6–12-month intervals as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1358863X12440141">2</xref></sup> At each follow-up visit, patients were asked about the return of ischemic symptoms, had a physical exam including assessment of limb ulceration, had ABIs measured, and in most patients duplex ultrasound of the femoral artery was reviewed. Asymptomatic patients with more than a twofold acceleration in peak systolic velocity of the femoral artery by duplex ultrasound were followed more frequently to identify the recurrence of symptoms or more progressive stenosis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1358863X12440141">
<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>Outcomes included primary patency, secondary patency, death, amputation and major adverse vascular events. A major adverse vascular event was defined as failed primary patency, amputation or death. Failed patency was deﬁned as recurrent claudication symptoms with a decline in ABI to less than 0.9 and a decrease more than 0.15 below the post-procedural value, or a threefold or greater increase in peak systolic velocity in the femoral artery on duplex ultrasonography (&gt; 70% luminal stenosis)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1358863X12440141">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1358863X12440141">3</xref></sup> or target vessel revascularization. Failed secondary patency was deﬁned as failed patency after reintervention for restenosis or reocclusion of the treated vessel. Review of the electronic medical record and subsequent procedures identiﬁed patients with recurrent claudication symptoms or restenosis, reintervention with percutaneous treatments or bypass surgery, amputation and all-cause death up to 2.5 years after the index procedure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1358863X12440141">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All data were analyzed using STATA statistical software. Descriptive statistics used proportions or means and standard deviations where appropriate. Baseline differences were compared by ANOVA for continuous variables or chi-square tests for categorical variables. To address the main hypothesis, event curves were deﬁned for failure of each of the patency outcomes grouped by lesion length at the index procedure. The different outcomes of failed patency were analyzed using separate survival analyses with hazard ratios, 95% conﬁdence intervals and <italic>p</italic>-values from Cox proportional hazards models. Multivariable models were developed using a backward stepwise process entering variables with a univariate <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.3, and a <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.1 for removal. All Cox models used clustering by patient to account for any correlations in outcomes of different limbs in the same patient.</p>

<title>Procedural complications</title>
<p>Of the 128 successful procedures for intermittent claudication, four (3%) had complications. These were one hematoma related to a perforated circumﬂex branch and successfully treated by manual compression, one occlusion of the common femoral access site related to a vascular closure device and successfully treated by balloon angioplasty, and two cases of distal embolization including one asymptomatic posterior tibial artery occlusion and one distal popliteal artery embolus successfully aspirated with a multipurpose catheter.</p>
<p>Of the 25 successful procedures for critical limb ischemia, two (8%) had complications. These were one access site bleed successfully treated with blood transfusion and contralateral access with balloon tamponade of the common femoral artery, and another case of transient intra-procedure hypoxia and hypotension from pneumonia and sepsis.</p>

<p>Major adverse vascular events, defined as failed primary patency, death or amputation, were twice as high among limbs with critical limb ischemia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1358863X12440141">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1358863X12440141">Figure 2</xref>). Patients with critical limb ischemia had a higher mortality rate compared to claudicants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1358863X12440141">Table 3</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.003), with all deaths occurring before a second intervention.</p>
<p>There were four amputations in the critical limb ischemia group and none in the claudication group. These included two planned minor amputations, which were both related to gangrene at the time of initial presentation for the procedure. After successful percutaneous revascularization, one patient required a toe amputation on day 1 and the other a transmetatarsal amputation on day 6. The remaining two patients had major amputations. One patient had successful stenting of an occluded superficial femoral artery but failed percutaneous and surgical attempts to revascularize occluded tibial vessels and required an elective below the knee amputation. The second patient presented to an outside hospital 18 months following successful percutaneous revascularization of the superficial femoral artery with recurrent critical limb ischemia and subsequently underwent an above the knee amputation.</p>

Only post-procedural stenosis exceeding 20% was a significant factor related to failed secondary patency. In multivariable models, major adverse clinical events remained significantly higher in patients with critical limb ischemia, reflecting the inclusion of death and amputation, which were less common in claudicants.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Critical limb ischemia is usually a consequence of extensive atherosclerosis of the lower extremity arteries, and a break in the integrity of the skin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1358863X12440141">1</xref></sup> Contemporary treatment of critical limb ischemia involves either surgical or endovascular revascularization strategies, as medical therapy alone carries a high risk of limb loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1358863X12440141">1</xref></sup> Endovascular therapy for treatment of critical limb ischemia is increasingly the first line of therapy and has several advantages over surgical bypass. These include a less invasive procedure with lower short-term morbidity and mortality, a shorter hospital stay, and lower cost.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1358863X12440141">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1358863X12440141"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1358863X12440141">6</xref></sup> However, the durability of percutaneous revascularization may be inferior to surgical bypass.</p>
<sec id="section14-1358863X12440141">
<title>Patency after revascularization</title>
<p>In the setting of close clinical surveillance for restenosis, we found no difference in primary and secondary patency between percutaneous superficial femoral artery interventions for critical limb ischemia or claudication. Prior reports suggest inferior primary and secondary patency with percutaneous revascularization for critical limb ischemia compared to claudication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1358863X12440141">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1358863X12440141">8</xref></sup> However, these case series are limited by smaller numbers of patients with a mixture of iliac and infra-inguinal disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1358863X12440141">7</xref></sup> and/or shorter (12 months) follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1358863X12440141">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1358863X12440141">8</xref></sup> Our results suggest that the biological response to percutaneous treatments is similar between the two groups and supports increasing trends to endovascular treatment as a first-line therapy for critical limb ischemia. Failed primary patency was higher in longer lesions and greater residual stenosis was associated with failed secondary patency. These factors increase the importance of clinical surveillance for restenosis in patients with critical limb ischemia, as they do for patients with claudication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1358863X12440141">2</xref></sup></p>

The increased risk of major adverse vascular events among patients with critical limb ischemia was largely driven by the increased risk of death or amputation, as the patency rates and need for repeat revascularization were similar between the groups. Our long-term mortality rate over 2.5 years was similar to the BASIL trial which randomized 452 patients with critical limb ischemia to bypass surgery or percutaneous revascularization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1358863X12440141">6</xref></sup> In that trial only half the patients were alive with either treatment at 4 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1358863X12440141">6</xref></sup> Similar outcomes are reported in several observational studies of bypass surgery for critical limb ischemia with 5-year survival rates of 48–63%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1358863X12440141">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1358863X12440141">13</xref></sup> These studies and our experience highlight the importance of general cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with critical limb ischemia.</p>
<p>As most of the deaths in patients with critical limb ischemia are caused by coronary disease and stroke, the key to improving long-term mortality lies in treating modifiable atherosclerosis risk factors. However, many prior studies show that risk factor modification in patients with critical limb ischemia is suboptimal. In other reports of revascularization for critical limb ischemia, the use of statin therapy ranges from 34% to 46% and antiplatelet therapy ranges from 58% to 80%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1358863X12440141">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1358863X12440141">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1358863X12440141">15</xref></sup> In our series, 90% of patients with claudication and 82% of patients with critical limb ischemia were treated with statin therapy and all patients were on at least one antiplatelet agent. Although the number of events was small, prior statin and clopidogrel use in our study was associated with lower mortality and lower amputation rates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1358863X12440141">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Our study is retrospective and included a relatively small number of patients with critical limb ischemia. Although we found no substantial difference in patency and repeat revascularization outcomes between claudication and critical limb ischemia, the hazard ratios were slightly higher with critical limb ischemia, and may be statistically significant with greater numbers of critical limb ischemia patients. Poorer runoff was not associated with patency or revascularization, but was associated with death and amputation. Other studies of critical limb ischemia suggest poorer runoff is associated with worse patency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1358863X12440141">16</xref></sup> Our study suggests that poorer tibial and peroneal artery patency is more common in critical limb ischemia and likely reflects more extensive atherosclerosis and worse patient outcomes.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>While long-term death and amputation rates are higher in patients with critical limb ischemia compared to claudicants, percutaneous revascularization is associated with similar long-term durability in both groups. Intensive treatment of atherosclerosis risk factors and surveillance for restenosis likely contribute to improving the long-term outcomes with both manifestations of peripheral artery disease.</p>
