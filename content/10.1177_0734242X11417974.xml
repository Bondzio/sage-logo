<abstract>
<p>Solid waste comprised of a grass clippings mixture was decomposed using a locally-made compost bin in Pulau Pinang, Malaysia, to eliminate challenges associated with improper waste disposal. Bulk density, pH, moisture content, nutrients content, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio were determined over 77 days. A 34% reduction in compost bin volume was observed and bulk density and pH were also reduced from 732 to 482 kg m<sup>−3</sup> and 7.82 to 8.41, respectively, indicating fairly good performance. The final moisture content and C/N ratio were 44.06% and 14 : 1, respectively, and the results also showed that the presence of nutrients and heavy metals in the final compost were within acceptable limits for use as a soil conditioner. Final concentrations of N, P and K were 347 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>, 510 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> and 14.8 g kg<sup>−1</sup> and for heavy metals, Fe, Zn and Cu were 5308, 300 and 20 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, which considerably assisted in the decomposition process. Processed waste materials from the bin were shown to be excellent organic fertilizers with over 75% germination index for seeds grown into bean sprouts in 72 h. An improved bin design to eliminate greenhouse gas emission into the environment is suggested</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Proper waste management is very crucial to the well-being of the environment and this has become the main challenge in many countries, particularly in developing nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X11417974">Suman et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, various alternatives have been investigated as a way to reduce the amount of biomass disposed of in landfills. Among these is the use of bioremediation which may allow the conversion of putrescible waste materials into value-added products such as compost, biogas, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X11417974">Fauziah and Agamuthu, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Composting remained a basic activity of farming until the twentieth century, when various synthetic fertilizers were found to provide many of the nutrients occurring naturally in compost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X11417974">Bernal et al., 1998</xref>), often at a lower cost. Composting is a common treatment for biodegradable waste which could be an important technology in developing countries where waste materials usually have a high content of wet organic materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X11417974">Boldrin et al., 2009</xref>). Composting is the biological decomposition and stabilization of organic substrates, under conditions that allow the development of thermophilic temperatures as a result of biologically produced heat, to produce a final product that is stable, free from pathogens and can be useful, when applied to the land (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11417974">Haug, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11417974">Kianirad et al., 2010</xref>). Composting is also a possible alternative for treating solid organic wastes and the end products could be reutilized for land application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X11417974">Wong et al., 2001</xref>). The federal government of Malaysia supports source reduction of waste generation practices by providing technical and financial assistance programmes, making policies, conducting studies, and information dissemination. Presently, all source reduction policies and programmes administered at the federal level are voluntary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X11417974">MDC Sdn Bhd, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Grass clippings are a more energetic material than leaves,are capable of generating more heat and are produced widely throughout the year. The most important problem with off-site clipping disposal is that potentially valuable commodities, plant organic matter and the nutrients derived from it, are discarded as waste materials. Grass clippings traditionally have been bagged and hauled to landfills or yard waste processing centres. Typical yard waste is composed of approximately 25% tree leaves and limbs and 75% grass clippings. In recent years, dumping of grass clippings has become a problem because existing landfills are running out of space. This is because, for decades, landfills have provided convenient and cost-effective solutions to waste disposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X11417974">Hao et al., 2008</xref>). Grass clippings are 85% water, decompose rapidly and return nutrients to the soil with no thatch build up. However, if the collected clippings are not properly handled, they emit foul odours when decomposing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11417974">Allen and White, 2009</xref>). They also make up about 14% of municipal solid waste (MSW) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X11417974">US EPA, 1999</xref>). Thus, keeping yard waste out of solid waste management systems could have a significant impact on the amount of waste that requires management. Many communities are introducing backyard composting programmes in conjunction with landfill bans to reduce the amount of material that requires management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X11417974">Tchobanoglous et al., 1993</xref>). An important part of the residue used in the compost is goat manure, which produces healthier plants and higher crop yields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X11417974">Moral et al., 2009</xref>). The manure does not attract insects or burn plants as cow dung does. In fact, composts made from goat manure limit diseases and contains adequate amount of nutrients that plant needs for optimal growth. The manure retains nitrogen, thus increasing its fertilizing potency and the elevated concentrations of nitrogen is required in composting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11417974">Bernal <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). The mixture of pelletized goat droppings with dry leaves and grass clippings allows more airflow into compost piles which also speeds up composting time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11417974">Ahn et al., 2008</xref>). The objectives of this study therefore, were to assess the composting of solid waste, especially grass clippings, using a locally designed compost bin,and to evaluate the suitability of the compost as a planting media. Furthermore, the quality of compost material based on selected nutrients and heavy metals was determined.</p>

<title>Design of composting bin</title>
<p>In determining some of the parameters controlling composting, a small-size composting bin was set up in the Environmental Laboratory of Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), Engineering Campus, Nibong Tebal, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia, adopting the concept of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11417974">Kalamdhad et al., (2009)</xref>. A 150 L capacity bin with a cover made of 4 mm thick poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) sheet was used as a composting bin. The cover was to protect the waste from sunlight and rain water. The height and diameter of the bin was 80 and 60 cm, respectively. The 10 mm diameter openings in the walls of the bin were drilled to maintain the aerobic condition by facilitating air flow around the waste mass hence increasing the decomposition process. The base was 12 cm above the soil surface to protect the bin from water splash during rainy times.</p>

<sec id="section4-0734242X11417974">
<title>Sample preparation</title>
<p>Grass clippings, dry leaves and goat manure were used as composting materials. Grass clippings and dry leaves, obtained from within the campus, and goat manure collected from intensive goat feedlots at Kampung Bagan Samak, Bandar Baharu, Kedah were used for the study. Dry leaves were used to adjust the carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio because of the relatively high nitrogen content in grass clippings and goat manure. The grass clippings were air dried for 2 days to reduce moisture content and oxygen inflow, odours, souring and clumping problems. The grass clippings and dry leaves mixture was shredded into dimensions of less than 5 cm in size prior to composting. This was to maintain adequate porosity in the composting mass and also accelerate microbial attack. After the shredding process the grass clippings, dry leaves and goat manure were homogenized in the ratio 2 : 1 : 2 wet weight (w/w) to achieve a C/N ratio of 25–30. Initial moisture content was adjusted to 60% by addition of distilled water before depositing the mixture in the composting bin. The bin was 65% full to avoid preferential aeration pores and also to provide better aeration. The total weight of the composting materials inside the bin was 75 kg and the ratio of composting materials to bin volume was 0.102 m<sup>3</sup>:0.13 m<sup>3</sup>. The materials were turned manually every 3 days and sprinkled with water when required to maintain a minimum water content level of 45–65% until an acceptable quality of compost was obtained. After completing the process of sample preparation, composite samples of 200 g were taken and analysed to obtain the initial values of pH, moisture content, C/N ratio, nutrient content (N, P, K) and heavy metal concentration (Fe, Zn, Cu). This was considered as time-zero.</p>

<title>Determination of physical and chemical properties of the compost</title>
<p>The physical and chemical properties determined were; size distribution, bulk density, moisture content, pH, C/N ratio, nutrient content (N, P, K) and heavy metal concentration (Fe, Zn, Cu). This was done using standard procedures for each analysis. The pH was measured using a pH digital meter (Cyberscan pH 20 Series). For the C/N ratio, total C was determined using conventional methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11417974">Bernal et al., 1996</xref>). Total N was measured by the total nitrogen Kjeldhal (TKN) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X11417974">Moral et al., 2009</xref>). The moisture content was measured by using an electronic balance (Precision Electronic Balance HM-300) with precision of 0.001 g to get the wet weight of the sample. Temperature readings were taken directly using an analogue thermometer monitored daily at 0900, 1200 and 1500 h, as measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11417974">Kianirad et al.

<p>Composite samples were collected periodically at days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 49, 63, 70 and 77 for nutrient analysis. A 25 g air-dried sample was passed through the 1 mm sieve and diluted with 125 mL distilled water. The solution was agitated for 1 h using an orbital shaker and was filtered through Whatman No.1 paper. The filtered solution was used for nutrient analysis to determined total nitrate (<inline-formula id="inline-formula1-0734242X11417974">

<title>Compost maturity test (germination and seedling growth)</title>
<p>A simple germination index (GI) test on bean sprout seeds were conducted using the final compost extract to determine compost maturity before applying it as a growing media. Bean sprouts were used because they germinate and mature quickly. The final compost was put into containers (15 cm × 10 cm × 4 cm) with one container used as the control with cotton acting as media. Forty bean sprout seeds were planted in the compost as media. The containers were placed under artificial light and kept moist to maintain optimum germinating conditions. If 75% or more of the seeds germinated and grew into bean sprouts, then the compost was considered ready for use in any application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X11417974">Compost Maturity Tests, 2009</xref>). Phytotoxicity was evaluated according to the method proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11417974">Mari et al. (2003)</xref>. Immature compost may contain phytotoxins that will often kill seed embryos and seeds grown in immature compost may die immediately after sprouting.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<sec id="section11-0734242X11417974">
<title>Physical properties</title>
<p>The initial bulk density of compost was 732 kg m<sup>−3</sup> and the final bulk density was 482 kg m<sup>−3</sup>, indicating an appreciable reduction at the end of the composting process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11417974">Ahn et al. (2008)</xref> remarked that bulk density depended on air-filled porosity and moisture content of the materials. As the moisture content increased, voided air-spaces were filled with water and the air-filled porosity decreased. Increasing water in the air voids increased the mass of the materials. The physical changes were inherent from the first day of composting. White fungi-like materials appeared with a foul odour and on the 35th day of composting, a dark brown, soft and brittle product was visible in the bin. On the 77th day, the volume of compost in the bin had decreased from 0.102 to 0.067 m<sup>3</sup>, a reduction of about 34%. The final reduction in bulk density and reduction percentage were similar to the results from the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11417974">Colon et al. (2010)</xref>.

<p>The pH value changed during the composting process as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X11417974">Figure 1</xref>. It increased significantly during the mesophilic phase, followed by a gradual decrease after the thermophilic phase and increased slightly in the curing phase. Composting proceeded most efficiently at the thermophilic temperature when the pH was approximately 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11417974">Kalamdhad and Kazmi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11417974">Liao et al., 1996</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11417974">Kianirad et al.

<p>The moisture content decreased continuously during composting from the initial moisture content of 62.75%. However, a slight increase was observed at the initial stage due to the large proportion of grass cuttings which led to the occurrence of organic matter oxidization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11417974">Kalamdhad and Kazmi, 2009</xref>). This may be due to the condensation of water vapour that was visible due to temperature increase in the bin and also the high moisture content of the grass clippings which already existed in the initial compost mixture. The addition of more water was not necessary due to the high moisture content already existing in the initial compost mixture but was required to get the compost mixture to an acceptable quality. The recommended range of 45–65% moisture content was required throughout the composting period in order to maintain optimal microbiological activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11417974">Colon et al., 2010</xref>). Moisture content changes during the composting process are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X11417974">Figure 2</xref>. The mesophilic phase, psychrophilic and mesophilic micro-organisms in the bin increased the bin temperature and as a result of biodegradation of organic compounds, the temperature increased and reached 40–50°C.

<title>Nutrients</title>
<p>As both grass clippings and goat manure were rich in nitrogen before the commencement of the study, the role of dry leaves as a bulking agent was to adjust the initial C/N ratio to the desired level of 25–30 and provide degradable organic carbon. From this study, the C/N ratio decreased from 29 in the initial mixtures to 14 in the mature composts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X11417974">Figure 3</xref>). During the active phase of the composting process, organic carbon decreased in the material due to decomposition of the organic matter by the micro-organisms. This loss reduced the weight of the bin contents and decreased the C/N ratio. The degradation rate of the organic matter decreased gradually as composting progressed because of the reduction in available carbon sources and synthesis reactions of new complex and polymerized organic compounds (humification) prevailed over mineralization during the maturation phase. This process led to stabilized end products which acted as slow-release fertilizers for agricultural purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X11417974">Hao et al., 2004</xref>). A decrease of C/N ratio in the compost in comparison with the initial organic substrate may be due to a relative increase in the nitrogen content on loss of dry matter as carbon dioxide is emitted and water is lost by evaporation during mineralization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11417974">Kianirad et al. (2010)</xref> further confirmed that the C/N ratio decrease during composting is sometimes used to indicate compost stability, which agreed with the findings of the present study. The C/N ratio changes during the composting process are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X11417974">Figure 3</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X11417974">Boldrin et al. (2009)</xref> also remarked that the danger inherent in the C and N decomposition is that it ultimately leads to the emission of some major greenhouse gases such as methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>0). Direct emissions of these gases have been linked with the activities at composting facilities. When degraded C and N produce these gases in quantities sufficient to negatively impact the environment.</p>

The initial content of nitrate was 773 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> and the final content was 347 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X11417974">Figure 4</xref>). Chemical analysis indicated that some concern should be directed towards controlling nitrate loses from compost at the beginning and end of the final composting process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11417974">Bernal et al. (1996)</xref> suggested that since nitrate production during composting depended on the supply of oxygen, the pH and the C/N ratio of the mix; therefore, if these parameters were maximized, ammonification and nitrification could probably occur rapidly. Another source of nitrate could be the grass clippings themselves, because as the lawns were fertilized the clippings may well contain excess nitrates. These nitrates could leach rapidly beneath an unlined compost bin once the grass cell walls decompose.</p>

<p>The phosphorus in the organic material was released by a mineralization process involving micro-organisms. The initial phosphorus in the compost bin was 402 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> and the final total phosphorus after the maturation phase was 510 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X11417974">Figure 4</xref>). The high value of initial phosphorus in the compost was due to the higher content of grass clippings. The increase in phosphorus indicated higher microbial activities during the process leading to more mineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11417974">Kalamdhad and Kazmi, 2009</xref>). The evaluation of phosphorus showed a slight decrease after the seventh day and an obvious recovery subsequently occurred due to the net loss of dry mass in the composting bin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11417974">Huang et al., 2004</xref>). The maximum phosphorus content, 613 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> was recorded on the seventh day and a close monitoring of phosphorus showed a gradual increase after 28 days and a later decrease until the end of composting. This was also observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734242X11417974">Zhang and He (2006)</xref>. The loss of total phosphorus during the composting period was due to the mineralization of organic phosphorus and the consumption by microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11417974">Huang et al., 2004</xref>). These values were within the limits recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X11417974">Boldrin et al. (2009)</xref> both for wet and dry weights.</p>
<p>The initial potassium content was 9.7 g kg<sup>−1</sup> and the final content was 14.8 g kg<sup>−1</sup>, which was also recorded as the highest value during the composting period. Observations indicated that potassium changes were not stable during the first 35 days but gradually increased until the end of composting process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X11417974">Figure 1</xref>). The changes were unstable because the composting process was still in an active phase and decomposition was not fully completed. However, as the compost reached the maturation phase, the potassium content became stable and gradually increased until the end of the composting process.</p>

<sec id="section13-0734242X11417974">
<title>Heavy metals (iron, copper and zinc)</title>
<p>The initial iron concentration was 3006 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> and the final concentration was 5308 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>. Iron concentration increased steadily until after the 58th day when visible but gradual reduction was observed till the end of composting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X11417974">Figure 5</xref>). Further reduction could be achieved with longer detention time due to the anaerobic condition, moisture content and temperature increase within the composting bin. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X11417974">Tai and He (2007)</xref>, the type of compost and raw materials are a major consideration for metal condensation during composting. The compost included goat manure which had a higher iron content and increased the initial concentration of iron. A possible reason for the later drop in iron concentration was due to the bin composting method. A lack of aeration induced a high moisture condition which promoted metal loss through leaching.</p>

<p>The general symptoms of copper deficiency on the plants were colour changes from light green to yellow in the small grain crop, the death of leaf tips and twisted tips. Furthermore, the growth of small grains ceased and plants withered after reaching the tillering growth stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X11417974">Ryckeboer 2003</xref>). In the present study, initial and final concentrations of copper were 29 and 20 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0734242X11417974">Figure 6</xref>). A high zinc concentration could reduce copper availability because of the absorption of cations through the same mechanism which caused interference in the uptake.</p>

<p>However, similar but reverse behaviour was noticed in zinc. The concentration started at 280 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>. During the active phase, it decreased to 230 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0734242X11417974">Figure 6</xref>). The solubility of zinc was highly dependent on the pH and the presence of calcium carbonates decreased the availability of zinc due to higher pH. The concentration of zinc began to increase after the 12th day until it reached a peak concentration of 425 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>. A subsequent reduction of zinc to the low level observed was due to weight loss in the course of composting following organic matter decomposition, release of CO<sub>2</sub>, water and mineralization processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11417974">Amir et al., 2005</xref>). The final zinc concentration was 300 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>, which was still safe for any application. Therefore zinc release from the organic matter would be gradual and may not cause any toxicity problems for the plants.</p>

<title>Compost maturity test (germination and seedling growth)</title>
<p>A germination test was carried out to determine the maximum germination potential of seeds by comparing planting with and without adding the final grass clippings compost. This was used to evaluate the suitability of grass clippings compost as planting media. From 6 days observations, seeds planted in the compost germinated and matured quickly when compared with the control. Planting with compost showed that germination for all 40 seeds took place after only 3 days whereas seeds in the control container took almost 5 days to complete germination of 40 seeds. That 75% of the seeds germinated and grown into bean sprouts was an indication of the suitability of the compost bin for agricultural purposes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11417974">Colon et al. (2010)</xref> even recommends a germination index of 80% and above as a better test for non-phytotoxic use.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Composting time and quality of compost are important factors influencing the acceptability of a composting process which is strongly affected by the efficacy of the composting bin among many other factors,. The performance evaluation of locally made and low-cost compost using grass clippings was carried out at USM in Malaysia. The purpose was to achieve a faster and better decomposition of waste materials in a manner that is less harmful to the environment. Temperature played a crucial role in the decomposition process which resulted in a rapid reduction in C/N in the bin. All the nutrients and heavy metal concentrations considered were within permissible limits for effective bin performance. The phytotoxic compounds were greatly reduced, resulting in a higher germination index. The germination tests showed that the residue of waste materials in the compost would not hinder use of this compost as a planting media for agricultural purposes. Thus, application of this process can reduce the extent of pollution of groundwater due to improper waste decomposition occasioned by poor waste disposal and management systems. An improved design to eliminate indiscriminate emissions of greenhouse gases from the bin into the environment is suggested for better efficiency.</p>
