<abstract>
<p>Intravenous administration of heparin and heparin-bonded extracorporeal circuits are frequently used to mitigate the deleterious effects of blood contact with synthetic materials. The work described here utilized human blood in a micro-perfusion circuit to experimentally examine the effects of intravenous and surface-bound heparin on cellular activation. Activation markers of coagulation and of the inflammatory response were examined using flow cytometry; specifically, markers of platelet, monocyte, polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN), and lymphocyte activation were quantified. The results indicate that surface-bound heparin reduces the inflammatory response whereas systemically administered heparin does not. This finding has important implications for blood-contacting devices, particularly within the context of recently elucidated connections between inflammation pathways and coagulation disorders. Data presented indicate that surface-bound heparin and intravenously administered heparin play distinct, but vital roles in rendering biomaterial surfaces compatible with blood.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Techniques for treating blood-contacting biomaterials with immobilized heparin are utilized in order to mitigate complications such as excessive coagulation, the systemic inflammatory response, platelet loss, contact activation and elevated neutrophil elastase release.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659113475834">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659113475834">2</xref></sup> This application can be considered a natural extension of the long-standing and widespread clinical use of heparin as an anticoagulant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659113475834">3</xref></sup> Though other approaches to rendering surfaces blood compatible have been devised, data demonstrate that the most effective blood compatible surface incorporates properly immobilized heparin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659113475834">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659113475834">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Heparin-based surface treatments bind heparin, a highly anionic polysaccharide, to a surface containing a high concentration of cationic groups. Ionically bound surfaces, such as the Duraflo II heparin coating (Baxter, Irvine, CA), ionically attach heparin to the surface via a quaternary ammonium carrier (alkylbenzyl dimethyl-ammonium chloride). Other surface treatments, such as the Carmeda Bioactive Surface (W.L. Gore, Flagstaff, AZ), are produced by first adsorbing a polyethyleneimine polymer layer onto the plastic surface and then covalently bonding nitrous acid degraded (NAD) end-point aldehyde functional heparin to the surface amines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659113475834">6</xref></sup> Ionically bound heparin surfaces are limited by heparin release from the surface, resulting in diminishing activity with time. Covalently attached heparin, likewise, can suffer reduced effectiveness due to limited activity or incomplete surface coverage. It is important to recognize that heparin-based surfaces created using different attachment techniques and biomolecule concentrations do not produce the same, or even similar, effects in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659113475834">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659113475834">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659113475834">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Heparin acts as an anticoagulant by binding anti-thrombin III (ATIII), a potent inhibitor of most activation and coagulation factors, and by specifically catalyzing the deactivation of thrombin in the blood. Effective immobilization of heparin on a surface requires an attachment strategy that allows the heparin molecules to retain this same catalytic activity. A naturally occurring example of this type of blood compatible interface is found in endothelial cell surfaces consisting of a phospholipid membrane and its associated glycocalyx. The glycocalyx structure is grown in place with a core protein anchored to the phospholipid membrane and heparan sulfate chains attached to this core protein. As a result, the glycocalyx is free to be hydrated by surrounding water and, thus, move and interact freely in space with incoming molecules. The molecules immobilized on the surface are not truly in solution, though they retain the ability to react with other molecules as if they were in solution. Similarly, the conformal integrity and charge balance of heparin immobilized on a treated biomaterial surface determines chemical activity and, thus, blood compatibility. The activity level is critically dependent, not only upon the method used to attach heparin, but also the effects of subsequent sterilization, dehydration, storage and re-hydration characteristics of the surface.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the chemical activity of heparin bound to a biomaterial surface can be measured in a relatively straightforward manner, using either thrombin inactivation or ATIII adsorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659113475834">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659113475834">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659113475834"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659113475834"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659113475834"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659113475834">12</xref></sup> This single measurement, representing the capacity of bound heparin to deactivate thrombin, provides a simple and reliable indication of the effectiveness of the attachment process, the surface concentration of active heparin molecules, the effect of sterilization and the effects of storage. The measurement also provides a useful means for the comparison of different surfaces, independent of the techniques used for surface production, sterilization and storage.</p>
<p>The ability to accurately measure heparin activities allows the investigation of clinically relevant levels of heparin, as well as the examination of the effects surface-bound heparin concentrations and systemic heparin levels have on surface blood compatibility. The work reported here proposes answers to these important questions based on the measurement of cellular activation levels in circulating human blood, with differing levels of systemic heparin placed in contact with heparin surfaces of different activity levels.</p>

<title>Surface preparation</title>
<p>Oxyphan double-layer, cross-wound, polypropylene, hollow-fiber membrane (HFM) (Celgard, Charlotte, NC) was treated using previously developed processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659113475834">13</xref></sup> Specifically, a siloxane layer was plasma deposited on the HFM and either oxygen activated or carboxyl functionalized. The surface was then aminated using polyethyleneimine (PEI) (Polymin SN, MW 500,000, BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany) followed by coupling of nitrous acid degraded (NAD) heparin (MW 8000, 80 USP units/mg, Celsus, Cincinnati, OH). The heparin was from a traceable lot, tested for biocompatibility and subsequently approved for and used in two human clinical trials. A series of five bioactivities, ranging from 0 (control) to 1.8 IU thrombin (IIa) deactivation/cm<sup>2</sup>, were prepared for testing in human blood, using methods previously described in detail.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659113475834">13</xref></sup> Evaluations of five discrete surface bioactivities and five systemic heparin levels resulted in 25 unique test conditions. Each test was repeated three times for a total of 75 perfusions, with four measurements of cellular activation performed during each test. (300 total measurements).</p>

<sec id="section4-0267659113475834">
<title>Bioactivity measurement</title>
<p>The heparinized surfaces were rinsed thoroughly in 0.5M NaCl to assure that no loose heparin remained adhered. The surfaces were then rinsed with de-ionized water and exposed to a solution of 1 IU/ml of ATIII (Chromogenix – DiaPharma Group Inc., Westchester, OH) for 15 minutes. These surfaces were then rinsed three times with 0.05M Tris buffer, pH=7.4, and de-wetted with a gentle air stream to assure no residual drops of loose liquid. The surfaces were then exposed to a solution of known thrombin concentration (Sigma Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis MO, P/N -6884) in a 0.05M Tris buffer at pH=8.3 for 10 minutes. The solution was collected and the surfaces rinsed with two successive rinses containing hexamethrine bromide (Polybrene® - Sigma Aldrich Corporation) that were added to the collect. The combined thrombin solution and collects were analyzed for active thrombin using chromogenic substrate S-2238 (Chromogenix - DiaPharma Group Inc.).</p>
<p>The resulting heparinized surface activities were: Sample 1 – 0.45 ± 0.02; Sample 2 – 0.80 ± 0.01; Sample 3 – 1.18 ± 0.02; Sample 4 – 1.82 ± 0.01; where all measurements are given in IU IIa deactivation/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<title>Human blood testing: chemicals and reagents</title>
<p>Sodium heparin was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Primary antibodies for CD11b, CD66b, CD3, CD25 and the fluorescently conjugated CD41-FITC and mouse IgG1-FITC were purchased from AbCam (Cambridge, MA). Primary antibody specific for CD14 was purchased from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Unconjugated isotypic controls for mouse and rat IgG were purchased from Beckman Coulter (Brea, CA). APC fluorescently conjugated antibody specific for CD62p and the appropriate isotypic control were purchased from Biolegend (San Diego, CA). All secondary antibodies (goat, anti-mouse IgG1 and IgG3; goat, anti-rat IgG) were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA).</p>

<title>Human blood preparation</title>
<p>Whole blood was drawn from healthy, non-smoking volunteers into 3.8% sodium citrate Vacutainer tubes, using a 19-gauge butterfly needle. 2.2 mL of whole blood was added to a 12 x 75 mm tube containing either no heparin, or sodium heparin (50 U/mL stock) in volumes of 12.5 µL, 25 µL, 37.5 µL or 50 µL, which corresponds to a final systemic heparin concentration of 0 U/mL, 0.25 U/mL, 0.5 U/mL, 0.75 U/mL or 1.0 U/mL, respectively. Following the blood/heparin mixture, 250 µL of calcium chloride (36 mM stock) was added to the tube in order to counteract citrate inhibition of coagulation and immediately added to the perfusion system described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0267659113475834">
<title>Cellular activation markers</title>
<p>Cellular activation markers were measured, using techniques that have been previously described in detail.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659113475834">13</xref></sup> Specifically, the tube containing the blood/heparin/calcium chloride mixture was gently inverted several times to thoroughly mix the solution and then added to the FCS2 microperfusion system (Bioptechs Inc, Butler, PA) containing a sample of the test material (fiber mat having a surface area of approximately 3.7 cm<sup>2</sup>). The microperfusion system is constructed from stainless steel, glass and silicon gaskets and tubing. The only other materials coming into contact with the blood are the polystyrene and polypropylene collection tubes used before and after perfusion, respectively. The handling and material contact surfaces and times are identical for all control and test articles. The prepared blood was perfused once across the test material at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min (shear rate of 132.9 s<sup>-1</sup>) and was collected in a 2.0 mL Eppendorf tube. For platelet activation analysis, 5 µL of the collected whole blood (not fixed with paraformaldehyde) was added to 1 µg of CD41-FITC and 1 µg of CD62p-APC and mixed with 90 µL of 1X phosphate buffered solution (PBS). This solution was incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature and diluted 1:50 with 1X PBS immediately prior to flow cytometry analysis. The remaining samples were fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde. The tubes were topped off with 1X PBS and centrifuged at 300 x g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet re- suspended in 100 µL of 1X PBS. Primary antibodies for monocytes (CD14 and CD11b), polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN; CD66b and CD11b) and lymphocytes (CD3 and CD25) were added and each tube incubated at room temperature for 1 hour (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267659113475834">Table 1</xref>). The tubes were topped off with 1X PBS and centrifuged at 300 x g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet re-suspended in 100 µL of 1X PBS. The corresponding secondary antibodies specific for the primary antibody were added to each sample and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 minutes. Each corresponding isotypic control antibody was used as a negative control. Samples were washed and centrifuged as previously described. Samples were re-suspended in 1 mL of BD FACSlyse solution (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes to lyse the red blood cells. Samples were centrifuged as previously described, re-suspended in 300 µL of 1X PBS and subjected to analysis by flow cytometry.</p>

<p>Flow cytometry data were collected using an Accuri C6 cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose CA). Approximately 20,000 events were collected for each sample. The isotypic control gates were set to 1% positive and that gate was applied to the corresponding samples.

<p>Activation of lymphocytes was measured, but not included in the regression analysis or Student’s t-test and confidence interval analysis. The purpose of lymphocyte activation measurement was to provide an indication of normalcy of the donor. Very little activation was expected as a result of the testing due to its short duration. Likewise, very little activation was expected prior to testing because the blood was from healthy donors. The control (no systemic heparin) showed an unexpected, significant increase in lymphocytes expressing the CD25 activation marker (not shown in the table or figures).

Therefore, the surface bioactivity that appeared to optimally minimize cellular activation (1.2 IU IIa deactivation/cm<sup>2</sup>) was selected as the treated surface, for comparison with the untreated surface, to illustrate the influence of systemic heparin. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659113475834">Figures 1</xref> through <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0267659113475834">3</xref> show direct comparisons of treated and untreated control surfaces at five systemic heparin levels.</p>
<p>Cellular activation was compared at all tested circulating heparin levels (0, 0.25, 0.50 0.75, and 1.00 U/ml) for, 1) all surface bioactivities combined, 2) the control surface (0 bioactivity) and 3) the optimal (1.2 IU IIa deactivation/cm<sup>2</sup>) surface bioactivity. Linear regression of measured cellular activation levels (platelets, monocytes and polymorphonucleocytes) versus systemic heparin levels clearly shows the only strong correlation between systemic heparin concentration and cellular activation is for platelets (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.72729). Further, this observed correlation only exists when there is no surface bioactivity (i.e., control, untreated surface). The inclusion of data from all bioactive surfaces combined yielded a very weak correlation between systemic heparin and platelet activation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.1854) and, in the specific case of the optimal bioactive surface (1.2 IU IIa deactivation/cm<sup>2</sup>), the correlation was essentially zero (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.01243). This demonstrates the effectiveness of bioactive, heparin-bonded surfaces in reducing platelet activation. All correlation coefficients between systemic heparin levels and the activation of monocytes and PMNs were very weak except for monocyte activation on the control (non-heparin bonded) surfaces (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.5921). This moderate correlation may be due to the propensity of platelet-monocyte aggregation described in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267659113475834">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cellular activation was, in general, strongly correlated with surface bioactivity; contrasting significantly with observations of the effects of systemic heparin. Each tested surface bioactivity (0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, and 1.8 IU IIa deactivation/cm<sup>2</sup>) was compared for, 1) all levels of systemic heparin combined, 2) 0 U/ml systemic heparin and 3) 1 U/ml of systemic heparin. The results clearly indicate a strong correlation of cellular activation to surface bioactivity in seven of the nine test conditions, with the remaining two conditions having a moderate correlation.</p>
<p>The activation of platelets was significantly reduced (p&lt;0.001) for surface bioactivities of 1.2 IU IIa deactivation/cm<sup>2</sup> and above, independent of the systemic heparin level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659113475834">Figure 1</xref>). Systemic heparin was seen to reduce platelet activation in a dose-dependent manner when heparinized blood was perfused over an untreated surface (p&lt;0.05). In addition, systemic heparin significantly reduced monocyte activation (p&lt;0.05), but, in contrast to platelet activation levels, the reduction did not appear to depend on systemic heparin concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267659113475834">Figure 2</xref>). The optimally treated surface (1.2 IU IIa deactivation/cm<sup>2</sup>) significantly reduced monocyte activation (p&lt;0.01) versus untreated controls, independent of the systemic heparin level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267659113475834">Figure 2</xref>). The untreated surface produced a very high level of PMN activation (&gt;400% of pre- perfusion values) regardless of the systemic heparin level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0267659113475834">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast, the optimal bioactive surface significantly decreased PMN activation compared to the control surface (p&lt;0.01). This effect, like observations of monocyte activation, appeared to be independent of systemic heparin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0267659113475834">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There is an increasing body of evidence suggesting extensive interactions between blood coagulation and inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267659113475834">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267659113475834">20</xref></sup> The complexities of the pathways associated with each individual host-defense system allows many possibilities for disturbances within one system to significantly affect the other.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267659113475834">21</xref></sup> It has even been suggested that coagulation and inflammation are part of the same system, with thrombosis (coagulation) simply constituting a subset, or “special case”, of inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267659113475834">22</xref></sup> This is particularly relevant when a foreign body, such as a medical device constructed from synthetic biomaterials, is placed in direct contact with blood. A biomaterial that meets even the most basic definition of blood compatibility will, by definition, exert only modest short-term effects, not merely upon the coagulation system, but also upon the host inflammatory response. However, long-term contact extending beyond a few hours compels a more subtle and specific concept of blood compatibility. One practical implication of this more nuanced view is that defining and assessing a material’s blood compatibility must include the examination of <italic>both</italic> coagulation and inflammation in an integrated and holistic approach.</p>
<p>The work reported here utilized such an integrated approach to in vitro blood compatibility evaluation in order to assess the effects, alone and in combination, of systemically administered circulating heparin and biologically active heparin immobilized on a blood-contacting surface. The most significant difference observed was that monocyte and PMN activation, essentially unaffected by systemic levels of heparin, were significantly reduced by immobilized heparin. Though systemic (i.e., circulating) heparin keeps thrombin levels low by catalyzing the activity of ATIII, it does not inhibit the activation of leukocytes. In contrast, immobilized heparin appears to significantly reduce the activation of monocytes and PMNs that come into contact with the heparin-bonded surface compared to the activation levels of the same cells in contact with untreated surfaces. This result is corroborated by clinical results linking increased activation of leukocytes and complement to non-coated circuits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267659113475834">22</xref></sup> The observed results are also consistent with prior published findings elucidating molecular and cellular activation in model systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0267659113475834">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0267659113475834">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0267659113475834">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>The significance of observed leukocyte activation levels is best understood within the context of the recently proposed cell-based theory of coagulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267659113475834">23</xref></sup> Traditional models of coagulation do not account for the observation that exposure of blood to cells expressing tissue factor (TF) is, “both necessary and sufficient to initiate coagulation in vivo”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267659113475834">24</xref></sup> The cell-based theory of coagulation accounts for this observation and conceptualizes coagulation as proceeding in three phases: 1) initiation by TF-bearing cells which produces the first activated factors (tenase complex), 2) amplification whereby platelets and FVIII come into contact with limited amounts of thrombin produced by TF-bearing cells and activated platelets and 3) propagation effected by the prothrombinase complex formed on the platelet surface to convert large amounts of prothrombin to thrombin, resulting in the cleavage of fibrinogen and the formation of fibrin which polymerizes to form the fibrin clot.</p>
<p>The specific roles of both the intrinsic (contact activation) and the extrinsic (tissue factor) pathways are clarified within the context of the cell-based theory. Specifically, the true physiological role of contact activation is not hemostasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267659113475834">23</xref></sup> Observations that patients deficient in FXII do not have bleeding disorders confirms the secondary role of contact activation in hemostasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267659113475834">25</xref></sup> This has led to a new understanding that contact activation is primarily involved in the induction of inflammatory reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0267659113475834">26</xref></sup> The most relevant and frequently quantified inflammatory markers are leukocyte and complement activation. The work reported here and a previous in vitro study clearly show that immobilized heparin surfaces reduce leukocyte and complement activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659113475834">13</xref></sup> However, a similar result, as shown here for leukocytes and in previous work for complement activation, is not achieved by simply adding systemic heparin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659113475834">13</xref></sup> These observations suggest potentially significant advantages to using immobilized heparin surfaces in all blood-contacting devices; particularly for longer-term devices placed in contact with blood for days or weeks or even longer. A clinical study in which complement activation was shown to be unaffected by systemic heparin levels lends further support to the need for surface-bound heparin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267659113475834">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Observations of prolonged activation of endothelial, coagulation and complement systems in ventricular assist device (VAD) recipients are consistent with the findings reported here. A study following 21 LVAD patients and seven control patients who underwent cardiac surgery without a VAD placement found elevated postoperative markers of thrombin generation and fibrinolysis in both groups. However, levels in the control group returned to near normal by post-implant Day 7 and remained elevated for the entire 6-month follow-up period in the LVAD group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0267659113475834">28</xref></sup> Another study of 30 VAD patients for two months post-implant showed a similar, prolonged inflammatory stimulus as indicated by elevated levels of complement and granulocyte-platelet conjugates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0267659113475834">29</xref></sup> Markers of cellular and complement activation quantified in both studies demonstrated prolonged elevations, suggesting ongoing activation of the extrinsic (tissue factor) coagulation pathway of thrombosis, resulting from blood contact with the biomaterial surface.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0267659113475834">Figure 4</xref> illustrates the mechanisms by which systemic and immobilized heparin influence the initiation of inflammation and coagulation. The top panel depicts blood interactions with an artificial surface in the absence of either systemic or surface-bound heparin. Adsorption of complement and coagulation proteins on the extracorporeal circuit surface leads to conformational changes that, in turn, activate mediators such as C3a, C5a, sC5b-9, FXI, bradykinin (BK), thrombin and tissue factor (TF).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0267659113475834">30</xref></sup> These activated mediators then initiate cell- and platelet-mediated inflammation and thrombosis.

<p>The administration of systemic heparin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0267659113475834">Figure 4</xref>, Center Panel) exerts anti-thrombotic effects via multiple pathways, including: (a) binding of anti-thrombin III (ATIII) and catalyzing its deactivation of thrombin, (b) induction of Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) synthesis and secretion by endothelial cells, which inhibits TF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0267659113475834">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0267659113475834">36</xref></sup> and (c) enhancement of the inhibitory effects of TFPI on FXa-TF-FVIIa complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0267659113475834">37</xref></sup>. Despite these effects, the data presented demonstrate that systemic heparin does not inhibit cell-mediated triggers of inflammation and coagulation to nearly the same extent as immobilized, biologically active heparin on the surface. Heparin-treated surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0267659113475834">Figure 4</xref>, Bottom Panel) mitigate cell-mediated inflammation and coagulation by reducing protein adsorption and rendering the artificial surface “more natural” by mimicking the endothelium’s glycocalyx surface, which naturally has heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) immobilized on its luminal surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0267659113475834">38</xref></sup> The HSPGs contain binding sites for antithrombin, which inactivates thrombin through mechanisms similar to that of biologically active heparin immobilized on an artificial surface.</p>
<p>Two frequently asked, or implied, questions are: 1) Can a heparin surface be developed so that surgery or long-term cardiopulmonary support can be performed without systemic heparin? and 2) Does a heparin-treated surface provide any benefit if systemic heparin is also required? Recent advances in our understanding of inflammation and coagulation, corroborated by the results presented here, suggest clear, concise and credible answers to both questions.</p>
<sec id="section12-0267659113475834">
<title>Can a heparin surface be developed so that surgery or long-term cardiopulmonary support can be performed without systemic heparin?</title>
<p>The answer to this question appears to be an unequivocal “no”. Blood-contacting surfaces with biologically active immobilized heparin limit thrombin production so that concentrations remain below the level necessary to initiate coagulation on the surface. In addition, as seen from the data presented herein, such a surface mitigates contact activation of leukocytes and the associated inflammatory response. What the surface cannot do is control the activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway resulting from surgical procedures, infections, other non-surgical medical interventions or underlying medical conditions. Though it is likely that a sufficiently bioactive surface could prevent actual coagulation on the surface, even in the presence of many of these external factors, high levels of thrombin in the circulating blood away from the surface, in the absence of a substantial systemic heparin dose, would very likely precipitate embolic events, with potentially dire consequences for the patient.</p>
<p>Although systemic heparin is essential for the safe execution of surgical and device-related cardiovascular treatments, it is also important to realize that “more” is not necessarily “better”. Higher than necessary systemic heparin levels not only needlessly increase the risk of bleeding, but can also increase leukocyte activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267659113475834">23</xref></sup> Paradoxically, circulating levels that are too high can exacerbate the very problem that heparin administration was initiated to solve. In studies where systemic heparin was reduced by 30 - 50%, or an ACT of 250 seconds versus 480 seconds was used, the reduction in granulocyte activation was significant, even in the non-treated circuits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267659113475834">27</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0267659113475834">
<title>Does a heparin-treated surface provide any benefit if systemic heparin is also required?</title>
<p>The answer to this question is an unequivocal “yes”. A bioactive heparin surface, in addition to keeping thrombin levels low near the surface, mitigates the contact activation of leukocytes and the ongoing inflammatory initiation and the amplification activity that results. Though systemically administered heparin keeps circulating thrombin levels low and prevents the initiation of coagulation, it does not significantly control inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267659113475834">24</xref></sup> The heparin-treated surface reduces both inflammation and activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway, not only helping the systemically administered, circulating heparin to fulfill its intended purpose, but also improving the overall blood compatibility of the surface itself. Systemically administered and surface-immobilized heparin appear, within the context of medical devices in contact with flowing blood, to accomplish different, but complementary objectives which are equally important to providing optimal and successful patient treatments using blood contacting surfaces.</p>
