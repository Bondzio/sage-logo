            <p>The influence of international governmental organisations (IGOs) on child welfare policy and practice in individual sovereign states is little explored. This article sets out the nature of these bodies’ main work with children. It then considers the mechanisms through which they seek to influence national child welfare policy and practice and the extent to which they can make nation states comply. ‘Soft’ mechanisms, such as awareness-raising, compiling statistical data and demonstration projects are contrasted with ‘hard’ mechanisms, such as making law and financial intervention. The article then reviews the effects of this activity and the factors explaining the varied pattern. It concludes that child welfare policy and practice are increasingly subject to supranational influence and that this has important implications for those seeking to influence this field.<sup>1</sup>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>The process of globalisation has been defined as one that ‘opens nation-states and societies to many influences that originate beyond their borders’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0308575913477072">Rizzini and Bush, 2002</xref>: 371). One such influence is transnational policy co-ordination by supranational institutions. These institutions proliferated during the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0308575913477072">Yeates, 2001</xref>). They include international governmental organisations (IGOs), defined as public or governmental organisations created by treaty or agreement between states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0308575913477072">Bernhardt, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0308575913477072">Townsend (1995: 102)</xref> argues that IGOs ‘do more than provide a context in which [national social] development takes place. They initiate, guide, influence and determine as well.’ However, their impact on child welfare policy and practice in individual countries has been little explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0308575913477072">Barker, 2007</xref>), despite a rapidly emerging literature on international social policy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0308575913477072">Yeates and Holden, 2009</xref>). This article gives a necessarily brief overview of the subject, with particular reference to the UK (for an extended discussion see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0308575913477072">Axford, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0308575913477072">2012</xref>).</p>

         <p>The main IGOs whose declarations and actions have some bearing on child welfare are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0308575913477072">Table 1</xref>. They fall into two groups. The first concerns those organisations with a fundamentally humanitarian brief. Chief among these are the ‘United Nations family’. For example, its Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) aims to tackle problems of poverty and development, while the Children's Fund (UNICEF) is concerned with children's health, education and early development. The other important humanitarian agency is the regional Council of Europe (CoE) which operates through the European Social Charter and the European Committee of Social Rights. Its social cohesion strategy focuses on social protection, employment, vocational training, workers’ rights, vulnerable citizens, equal opportunities, exclusion, discrimination and migration.

         <p>The second group of organisations comprises IGOs that are essentially concerned with the economy and trade but may have social objectives. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) seek to promote economic and social development in developing countries, while the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) aims to expand world trade among its member countries. The European Union (EU) is primarily an economic organisation but seeks to influence social areas, notably employment.</p>
         <p>Some IGOs are essentially global in scope, although ‘global’ does not necessarily mean worldwide. For example, the OECD has 30 member countries (mostly in the developed world) and active relations with another 70. Further, ‘global’ IGOs may be involved with some countries more than others. The UN, for instance, is orientated towards developing countries, many of which lack extensive legislation and guidance concerning child welfare.</p>
         <p>It is easy to overlook these organisations’ child welfare work. For example, policy or activity to protect children from sexual exploitation might be hidden in non-child-specific policy statements concerning discrimination, forced labour, slavery, tourism, prostitution or trafficking. The UN Family's work concerns children in various ways, the most obvious of which is via international law in the form of the Convention on the Rights of the Child 1991 (UNCRC). This covers children’s rights to decent living standards, protection from maltreatment and participation in decisions that affect them. UN organisations also provide direct services – including basic education (especially for girls), immunisation, HIV/AIDS care, nutrition and protection against violence and abuse – and seek to improve children's education through technical advice, standard-setting and innovative projects. The International Labour Organization (ILO), also a UN agency, has conventions that relate specifically to child labour. The Council of Europe, meanwhile, has made recommendations and promoted information exchanges on topics such as children's political and civic participation, nurseries, residential care, corporal punishment, education and youth justice. The EU’s policy on children is limited and haphazard, with children largely invisible in its legislation and policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0308575913477072">Hantrais, 2007</xref>). The 1997 Amsterdam Treaty contained the first explicit reference to children in EU treaties, and even then it focused narrowly on tackling offences against them (Article 29). A small fraction of the EU budget reaches children directly. The focus is on the ‘citizen-as-worker’ (including young people aged 15 and over), with an emphasis on vocational training, education and leaving care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0308575913477072">Pinkerton, 2006</xref>). Younger children are seen primarily as victims, dependants (or ‘family members’) and barriers to parents' employment and so are mostly indirect beneficiaries of other general actions.</p>
         <p>Some broad observations may be made regarding IGO activity and children. First, the extent to which IGOs focus on children and young people varies. Some focus explicitly on children, viewing them as citizens or social actors in their own right, while others see them as primarily the dependants of adults, especially regarding employment and childcare. Second, there is international social policy, albeit not necessarily coherent, relating to all aspects of children's lives: living environment; family and social relationships; social and anti-social behaviour; physical and psychological health; education; and employment and living standards. Some IGOs cover more of these than others. Third, international social policy for children has universal and targeted elements. In some cases an issue that affects all children is addressed but with particular attention to those with critical needs in this regard – for instance, the political and civic participation rights of unaccompanied migrant minors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0308575913477072">Sandbaek, 2008</xref>). Fourth, IGOs often work together on a particular topic. Examples of such collaboration include the Education For All initiative and the Millennium Development Goals for children.</p>

         <title>How IGOs seek to influence domestic child welfare policy and practice</title>
         <p>IGOs and international treaties and conventions influence national social policy via ‘soft’ forms of policy/knowledge transfer and the ‘hard’ transfer of policy tools and monitoring processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0308575913477072">Stone, 2004</xref>). Awareness-raising is a widely-used soft mechanism. Examples include UN-designated International Years (e.g. 1994 focused on the family), UN-appointed Special Representatives (e.g. in 2000 for the 13 million displaced children worldwide) and large meetings (e.g. the UN Special Session on children in New York in 2002). Then there is UN guidance on a range of issues, including juvenile justice (The Beijing Rules, 1985), discrimination against girls (The Beijing Declaration, 1995) and human trafficking (The Palermo Protocol, 2000).</p>
         <p>IGOs, and especially the UN, also shape policy debates by establishing common definitions of key terms and compiling orderly statistical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0308575913477072">Ward, 2004</xref>). Thus, the World Health Organization (2001) revised the 1980 International Classification of Impairment, Disability and Handicap to reflect a social as opposed to a medical model of disability. The rights discourse, promoted through the UNCRC, has refocused the debate on child poverty away from alleged failings of the poor and towards problems with macroeconomic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0308575913477072">Townsend, 2008</xref>). Meanwhile, UNICEF’s annual State of the World’s Children reports (1979–) chart trends in education, health, nutrition and child labour, while its more recent Progress of Nations series (1993–) monitors countries’ progress towards agreed goals.</p>
         <p>Cross-national research and demonstration projects, along with technical assistance, are sometimes sponsored by IGOs with the aim of fostering learning and sharing best practice. A good recent example is the development of a compendium of evidence-based family skills training programmes by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC, 2010).</p>
         <p>Treaties sponsored by IGOs can act as tools for campaigners to help set a global moral and political climate: the embarrassment of being seen to be deficient relative to certain other states or international standards is often a critical factor in domestic policy-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0308575913477072">Parker, 1983</xref>). Thus, NGOs are explicitly encouraged by the UN to monitor states’ progress in implementing the UNCRC. A connected mechanism is ‘external governance’, the process by which the EU attempts to transfer its rules and policies to non-member countries without offering full membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0308575913477072">Schimmelfennig and Sedelmeier, 2004</xref>). This enabled NGOs and civil society to pressurise governments in several Central and East European countries to improve human rights and social legislation, especially where there was a strong tradition of institutional provision.</p>
         <p>The ‘hard' mechanisms include a range of incentives and disincentives aimed at producing compliance by means of increasing accountability and applying ‘peer pressure’. For example, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child monitors signatory states’ implementation of the UNCRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0308575913477072">UNICEF, 1998</xref>). It can express concerns about national policies and even declare particular policies or legislation ‘incompatible' with the Convention. The African Union’s NEPAD (New Partnership for Africa’s Development) peer review system is less well known, but seeks to promote effective policies for poverty reduction, health and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0308575913477072">Commission for Africa, 2005</xref>). Other examples include the EU social indicators used to monitor states' efforts to implement National Action Plans on social inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0308575913477072">Atkinson, 2003</xref>) and the Council of Europe’s monitoring of member countries’ implementation of European and international children’s rights conventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0308575913477072">Sandbaek, 2008</xref>).</p>
         <p>Another important ‘hard’ mechanism is the power of the law. Treaties such as the UNCRC are binding on parties; upon signing an international instrument, the party agrees to bind itself to ensure that nothing is done that would defeat the object and purpose of the treaty, pending a decision on ratification. Ratification signals that a state will comply fully with the instrument. In some instances, international legislation leads to case law, which sets precedents in the implementation of treaties and conventions. Thus, the European Court of Human Rights has made some landmark court rulings, for instance that children's rights are infringed by corporal punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0308575913477072">Dale-Risk, 2001</xref>). The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) was integrated into UK law via the Human Rights Act 1998, so cases can now be brought to UK courts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0308575913477072">Lyon, 2007</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec4-0308575913477072">
         <title>The impact of IGOs on domestic child welfare and policy</title>
         <p>Perhaps the clearest manifestation of the impact of IGOs is national sub-legislation derived from international legislation. The UK Human Rights Act 1998, for example, incorporates the ECHR into national law, meaning that all new law must formally be declared ‘compatible' and existing law can be deemed ‘incompatible'. Although the primary child welfare legislation has remained largely intact, the ECHR created challenges that required changes, such as greater opportunities for children to give evidence in care proceedings and local authorities becoming liable for negligence in certain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0308575913477072">Hale, 2010</xref>). Similarly, many states parties to the UNCRC have acted to bring national laws into compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0308575913477072">Doek, 2009</xref>). Legislation introduced in the early-1990s in European states that signed the Convention emphasised the observance of children's needs and wishes. The UK government has since withdrawn its original reservations regarding refugee children (Article 22) and separating youth and adult prisoners (Article 37a) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0308575913477072">Payne, 2009</xref>). The Council of Europe (CoE) has been influential on the drafting or revision of juvenile justice legislation, especially in Central and Eastern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0308575913477072">van der Laan and Smit, 2005</xref>).</p>
         <p>An alternative marker of the influence of IGOs is the extent of organisational change. The UNCRC has prompted many countries to implement mechanisms for eliciting and responding to the views of children, especially of the most vulnerable. Norway appointed a children's rights ombudsman in 1994 to verify that national laws and their enactment agreed with international commitments, while the UK government has made a new provision for independent officers to represent children cared for away from home and to mount challenges under the Human Rights Act 1998 regarding the rights to a fair trial and family life (ECHR Articles 6 and 8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0308575913477072">Lyon, 2006</xref>).</p>
         <p>One product of IGO activity is some degree of convergence between nation states. This is reflected in ideology. Globally, there was a drift towards minimal welfare provision until about 2007, when it seemed that the tide may have started turning towards a more universal approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0308575913477072">Deacon, 2008</xref>). For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0308575913477072">Garrett (2009)</xref>, it is a case of the state being re-made in the image of US-style ‘service modernisation’ efforts, hence the policy drive in several developed countries to make children’s services more businesslike and ‘outcomes orientated’. Education in the UK, for example, arguably reflects the World Bank agenda of choice and public-private partnerships and UNESCO’s emphasis on inclusion and school improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0308575913477072">Hulme and Hulme, 2008</xref>). Reforms to children’s services have been attributed in part to a neo-liberal agenda, shaped largely by the World Bank and IMF, and evidenced in preoccupations with preventing anti-social behaviour, measuring performance, building electronic surveillance systems and saving public money (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0308575913477072">Garrett, 2009</xref>). All services are cognisant of the need to be seen to take children’s views seriously in the light of the UN’s child rights agenda.</p>
         <p>There is also convergence of objectives and standards. The EU has fostered common objectives to guide policy, so permitting the co-existence of different welfare regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0308575913477072">Geyer, 2000</xref>). In Central and Eastern Europe, CoE recommendations on youth justice policies have indicated how new national legislation and services may be aligned with those in Western Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0308575913477072">van der Laan and Smit, 2005</xref>). More widely, UN-sponsored meetings are acknowledged to have served a normative function in terms of setting international standards for national child welfare policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0308575913477072">Schechter, 2001</xref>).</p>
         <p>Of course, there is also evidence that the impact of IGOs is limited and variable. Standards do not necessarily translate into national legislation, and penalties for non-compliance are often weak. Countries with poor human rights records may be as or even more likely than countries with better records to ratify treaties but less likely to fulfil their commitments (Buck, 2008). Thus, an evaluation of the implementation of the UNCRC during its first 10 years identified gaps between vision and reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0308575913477072">Save the Children, 2001</xref>), and after 20 years there are still barriers preventing the implementation of legislative change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0308575913477072">Doek, 2009</xref>).</p>
         <p>In England and Wales there are attempts to reduce children’s privacy and participation in court proceedings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0308575913477072">Doughty, 2010</xref>), and the Children’s Commissioner feels that children’s right to have a say needs more prominence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0308575913477072">Morgan, 2010</xref>). The government is lukewarm about child impact statements, even though the UN Committee recommends them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0308575913477072">Payne, 2007</xref>). And recent reports by the UN Committee have expressed concern regarding the UK’s failure to enshrine the UNCRC in law, abolish the detention of asylum-seeking children, support trafficked children adequately, raise the age of criminal responsibility and provide more non-custodial options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0308575913477072">Payne, 2009</xref>).</p>
         <p>There are also more informal signs of ambivalence domestically about IGOs and international treaties. For example, independent children’s advocates have condemned the UK government’s reports to the UN Committee as being tardy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0308575913477072">Aynsley-Green et al, 2008</xref>). Further, under the Human Rights Act 1998 cases can be, but only rarely have been, brought to court regarding the ECHR, suggesting that NGOs and children’s advocates lack confidence in the approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0308575913477072">Lyon, 2007</xref>). Yet this avenue is recognised as potentially very useful, particularly for children leaving care, owing to provisions for protection from maltreatment (Article 3) and the right to a family life (Article 8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0308575913477072">Munro and Ward, 2008</xref>).</p>
         <p>It is also interesting to note that despite decades of EU social policy guidance there is no discernible EU welfare regime: some countries, for instance, exhibit social democratic ideals whereas others are more neo-liberal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0308575913477072">Alsasua, Bilbao-Ubillos and Olaskoaga, 2007</xref>). Member states also exhibit different models of family policy, childcare, education and training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0308575913477072">Hantrais, 2007</xref>), manifest in the varied use of residential care and different thresholds for intervention in cases of child abuse (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0308575913477072">Grietens, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0308575913477072">Grinde, 2007</xref>).</p>

         <title>Factors explaining the varied impact</title>
         <sec id="sec6-0308575913477072">
            <title>IGO factors</title>
            <p>One reason for the limited influence of IGOs is that they accord variable weight to children. Thus, the EU lacks a central directorate developing a coherent overall direction for child welfare policy. It makes limited reference to children in treaties, and its programmes, for example in vocational training, tend to be peripheral to education, social care, childcare and primary healthcare policies, which are decided at member state level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0308575913477072">John, 2003</xref>). Neither are there strong mechanisms for getting international standards into domestic policy or penalties for non-compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0308575913477072">Crewe, 2010</xref>).</p>
            <p>IGOs are also often internally or collectively incoherent: they sometimes speak with a forked tongue. The major faultline concerns the extent of state versus private sector provision in health, education and social services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0308575913477072">Deacon, 2008</xref>). As such, IGOs fit to a degree into the different types of welfare regime. But there are also disparate and shifting emphases within agencies and frameworks. For example, the World Bank and OECD, both associated with promoting a neo-liberal economic agenda, recognise the need to invest in early childhood education. Similarly, an international rights-based framework such as the ECHR faces a tension between vulnerable children’s right to a family life (Article 8) and their right not be maltreated (Article 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0308575913477072">Munro and Ward, 2008</xref>).</p>
            <p>Next, much international law is concerned not so much with setting binding norms that states must adhere to (‘hard law’) as it is with expressing aspirations, principles and international custom (‘soft law’). Thus, in the EU when social policy items are passed they tend to have the least-binding status (‘recommendations' rather than ‘directives'). Further, states can opt out of parts of some agreements or interpret directives to their advantage. For instance, governments have registered ‘reservations’ against certain articles of the UNCRC, often reflecting local religious, cultural, political and technical factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0308575913477072">Mapp, 2011</xref>).</p>
            <p>An apparent lack of impact can also be attributed to the gradualist approach to implementation encouraged by some IGOs. This can suggest that things are getting worse when in fact progress is being made. For example, under the UNCRC governments are expected to build on past achievements and strive to do more to promote children’s rights (Article 41). Thus, the number of recommendations in the UN Committee’s three UK reports has increased exponentially, from 36 to 78 to 124 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0308575913477072">Payne, 2009</xref>). This does not necessarily mean that children’s welfare has deteriorated in that period (1994–2007).</p>
            <p>Then there are the limited resources that constrain the reach of many supranational efforts. In 2005 the World Bank loaned $2.4 billion for social protection to countries worldwide; the UK government spent nearly 100 times as much nationally ($210 billion) on social protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0308575913477072">Townsend, 2008</xref>). This helps to explain why IGOs have arguably contributed less to reducing extreme poverty globally than is commonly assumed.</p>
            <p>Lastly, it has been argued that international assistance is often short-term, unfocused, unpredictable, subject to donor fads, tied to trade and not harmonised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0308575913477072">Commission for Africa, 2005</xref>). Further, a focus on results rather than rights in the Global South arguably ‘depoliticises development and diverts attention away from challenging inequalities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0308575913477072">Crewe, 2007</xref>: 60). UN-sponsored conferences have been condemned as a waste of money at best – more likely to produce texts than commitments to change – and regressive at worst – preventing radical action by co-opting NGOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0308575913477072">Schechter, 2001</xref>).</p>

         <sec id="sec7-0308575913477072">
            <title>National factors</title>
            <p>National policy-makers recognise that many problems affecting children’s health and well-being are global and that collaboration on such issues is expedient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0308575913477072">Barker, 2007</xref>). Further, the desire in capitalist economies for increased movement of people and capital between countries is aided by comparable standards of welfare and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0308575913477072">Alber and Standing, 2000</xref>). But other national factors explain the variable impact of IGOs.</p>
            <p>First, internationalism is not always politically expedient. Public disillusion with remote and seemingly irrelevant bureaucracies leaves many politicians scrabbling to re-assert national sovereignty. Second, domestic problems being addressed by IGOs are also often complex and resistant to change. For example, obstacles to meeting the needs of disabled children include local customs and beliefs as well as the negative attitudes and low expectations among policy-makers, teachers and parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0308575913477072">Mittler, 2002</xref>). Third, the characteristics of political and economic systems can hinder the smooth transfer of policies into different countries. There are important variations in terms of federal or unitary states and strong or weak trade unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0308575913477072">Parker, 1983</xref>). Many low-income countries lack the governance to provide security, services and a physical infrastructure. In the absence of an effective state, supranational policy and legislation may struggle to gain traction. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0308575913477072">Townsend (2008)</xref> argues that in such cases the welfare of severely deprived children is better served by IGOs working more closely with transnational corporations than with national policy-makers.</p>

            <title>Global factors</title>
            <p>Various global social, economic and demographic factors moderate the impact of IGOs on national child welfare policy and practice. The prevailing economic climate has arguably eroded government power through welfare state retrenchment and the rising power of multinational companies, and seen high rates of poverty in many countries impede efforts to secure rights to education and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0308575913477072">Twum-Danso, 2009</xref>). The shifting geopolitical climate is also relevant. During the Cold War, the policies of the UN and similar bodies were overshadowed by the battle between capitalist and communist ideologies. One view is that the end of this struggle created a policy vacuum that IGOs could fill, hence the proliferation of UN-sponsored world conferences in the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0308575913477072">Schechter, 2001</xref>). A counter view is that a hostile socio-political environment following the end of the Cold War, which saw numerous intrastate conflicts, caused governments to focus their attention on other matters besides the implementation of supranational commitments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0308575913477072">Twum-Danso, 2009</xref>). By the turn of the century IGOs with more progressive agendas seemed out of vogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0308575913477072">Coicaud and Heiskanen, 2001</xref>).</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>The IGOs discussed here all have social objectives and undertake work relating to child welfare. Despite being shaped often by the most powerful countries, they have independent lives and are not merely tools of intergovernmental politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0308575913477072">Deacon, Hulse and Stubbs, 1997</xref>). The initiatives that they develop, often in collaboration with NGOs and one another, frequently extend beyond individual states. IGOs shape national legislation and organisational change and, critically, help to create the climate in which these changes are possible, even necessary. Historically, they have arguably been concerned with more marginal areas of child welfare policy, or with poorer countries. While some such imbalances may still exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0308575913477072">Yeates, 2008</xref>) mainstream services in developed countries are increasingly subject to or at least aligned with supranational influences. It is therefore no longer sufficient to seek to understand patterns and trends in domestic social, labour, health or education policy by reference exclusively to national actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0308575913477072">Yeates, 2008</xref>).</p>
         <p>But the extensive activity of IGOs and the existence of widely-ratified treaties and conventions does not simply cause the child welfare policies of states to converge. Change appears to follow different paths at different speeds, even when states have signed up to the same set of goals. This variable impact of IGOs may not be undesirable. Some commentators argue that the notion of international ‘best practice’ is anachronistic and misplaced. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0308575913477072">Crewe (2010)</xref>, for instance, cites contrasting approaches in Mexico and Sierra Leone to reconcile children with their families after severe trauma and concludes that both are successful. Also, it has been argued that the more individualistic and therapeutic style of social work in the Global North is not necessarily well suited to problems in the Global South, where more activist methods predominate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0308575913477072">Midgley, 2001</xref>). Further, local circumstances can mean that the influence of IGOs is not necessarily benign. For example, concerns about the debt repayment obligations of some developing countries led the World Bank and IMF to encourage the development of tourism, which in practice encouraged sex tourism and the associated exploitation of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0308575913477072">Barker, 2007</xref>). Indeed, the anti-globalisation movement holds that international multilateral structures actually serve the Global North but under the guise of serving the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0308575913477072">Deacon, 2008</xref>).</p>
         <p>This has inevitably been a cursory overview of the issues, with uneven coverage of IGOs, subjects and countries. For example, there has been no mention of the Hague Convention on intercountry adoption (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0308575913477072">Selman, 2009</xref>). A more comprehensive overview is warranted. Moreover, in order for this field to advance, several different types of research are required. One task is to examine qualitatively the degree to which policy-makers and practitioners are aware of relevant IGOs and international treaties and conventions or seriously concerned about their correct implementation. Another is to develop credible evaluation systems for determining what progress is being made, drawing, for instance, on work to measure implementation of the UNCRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0308575913477072">UNICEF Law Reform, 2007</xref>). Since numerous factors besides international law appear to affect domestic child welfare policy a further significant challenge is to disentangle them. A cross-national comparative study that uses a common template to map systematically these complex interactions would be an obvious first step.</p>
