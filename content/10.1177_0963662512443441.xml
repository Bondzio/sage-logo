<p>Public debates regarding scientific research on living things are often fervent and highly polarized. Spurred by the activism and media campaigns of animal rights organizations, the general secrecy of scientists with regards to their research on animals, personal experiences with animals, and pet culture, the most highly-publicized controversies usually concern sentient animals, their rights, and our responsibilities regarding them. Other ethical, political, philosophical, cultural, and historical questions raised by research on diverse living things are obscured by the intensity of these debates. Harré’s <italic>Pavlov’s Dogs and Schrödinger’s Cat: Scenes from the Living Laboratory</italic> represents a departure from these dominant debates on animal rights, staying the ethical “quicksand” in favour of a descriptive and historical account of the participation of various living things in scientific discoveries.</p>
<p>The suspension of ethical questions enables contemplation of the ways in which their dominance in the consideration of living things in science occludes attending to other developments of the “living laboratory.” For example, Harré spends considerable time describing the use of plants in experiments, phenomena that demand more scholarly and public attention. He paints a picture of science teeming with diverse vital matter: animals, plants, bacteria, lichen, humans, and even “imaginary beings.” The implied thesis emphasizes research <italic>with</italic> life rather than <italic>on</italic> life, a perspective similarly advanced in actor-network theory and emerging theorizations of human–nonhuman relationships. That being said, the lives most animated by his descriptions are human ones: the scientists who have employed living things in pursuit of their work and who are interpreted as products of their times, interpersonal influences, and personalities. Thus, the book is primarily about scientists and their “laboratory lives,” rather than the lives of other nonhumans themselves.</p>
<p>What can be learned from the history of experimentation when the question of animal ethics is stayed? Harré scarcely answers the question, repeatedly reminding the reader that the work is primarily concerned with describing the various and integral roles living things have played as instruments or apparatuses in science. In fact, he devotes only four and a half pages to “sites for moral debates” at the end of the book. Though the academic reader, no doubt looking for insight into ethical, political, philosophical, and historical questions, might feel disappointment with such a descriptive book, accompanying Harré leads to useful contemplation about the diversity of vital matter that is engaged in scientific experimentation. In this way, this work may be best used as an introduction to moving beyond the paradigm of animal rights in exploring scientific research on living things.</p>
