<abstract>
<p>Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease that is now endemic in south eastern Iran. The most important factor associated with mortality is a platelet count of less than 50,000/mL. The purpose of this study is to compare treated cases with severe thrombocytopenia using ribavirin with high-dose methylprednisolone (HDMP) with patients receiving ribavirin without HDMP. A clinical trial was conducted for confirmed patients with CCHF and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 50,000/mL) admitted to Boo-Ali Hospital in Zahedan between January 2010 and October 2011. The intervention group was given oral ribavirin, supportive managements and HDMP and the controls were treated with ribavirin and supportive management. Following HDMP therapy in hospitalized patients with severe thrombocytopenia, the platelet count increased within 36 h and the leukocyte count within 48 h of the beginning of treatment. Fewer in the intervention group required a transfusion of blood products than in the controls (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). No one in the intervention group died. It seems that high-dose methylprednisolone is effective in the treatment of patients with CCHF. The increased platelet count and reduction of blood product requirement for severe CCHF patients after receiving HDMP are promising results. Further investigation is necessary in order to determine the efficacy of corticosteroid and its effect on outcome.</p>

<p>A clinical trial study was conducted at the Boo-Ali Hospital and Research Center for Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine in Zahedan (south eastern Iran, on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan) between January 2010 and October 2011. All probable CCHF patients with severe thrombocytopenia (less than 50,000/mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0049475513486642">3</xref></sup>) were included in the study. Informed consent was taken from the patients and/or their family members immediately after admission. All patients received oral ribavirin and supportive therapy (platelet, FFP and erythrocyte suspension, depending on the laboratory test results). When the patients fitted the inclusion criteria, according to day of admission, treatment was initiated (on even days the intervention group was treated with ribavirin, necessary blood products and HDMP 10mg/kg as single dose for 3 days in the morning and then 5mg/kg for 2 days or more; on odd days the control group were treated without HDMP). The control group received only ribavirin and supportive care. Platelet counts were checked daily after the beginning of treatment in both groups. Confirmation of the disease was made by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the Pasteur Institute of Iran that were reported to the centre 2–3 weeks later and 35 confirmed patients (13 cases and 22 controls) were entered into the final analysis. Confirmed cases were defined as probable cases with a positive serum RT-PCR test and/or positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) specific for CCHF by the ELISA method. Demographic and epidemiological data (age, sex, place of residence, tick bite and contact with animal products), clinical manifestations, the clinical course, the results of laboratory data, the amount of blood product requirement and the outcome were recorded for both cases and controls. Chi-squared, Fisher-exact and <italic>t</italic>-student tests were used for statistical analysis in order to compare qualitative and quantitative variables. A <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The ethics committees of the Zahedan University of Medical Sciences in Iran approved the study protocol.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0049475513486642" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Thirty-five patients with confirmed CCHF infection (28 men and 7 women within the age range 20–77 years) were evaluated. Thirteen of the intervention group were treated with ribavirin and HDMP and 22 controls with ribavirin without HDMP. All the patients were living in endemic areas for CCHF (Zahedan and Zabol, two large cities in the Sistan and Baluchestan provinces) and all had a history of animal contact. None had a history of tick bite within the previous 2 weeks. Thirty-three (94%) had fever, 29 (83%) headache, 23 (66%) myalgia and 22 (63%) complained of nausea and vomiting. Haemorrhagic complications, including epistaxis and subcutaneous haemorrhage – especially at the venepuncture sites – were observed in 13 (37%). There was no statistical significance between the two groups according to the demographic factors, clinical manifestations and outcome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0049475513486642">Table 1</xref>). Augmentation of at least 10,000 platelet/mL was observed within 36 h and increased white blood cells (WBC) of at least 500/mL after 48 h following HDMP therapy. Of those who did not receive HDMP, only seven had an increased platelet count within 36 h and eight had an increased leukocyte count after 48 h. Cutaneous and visceral bleedings also improved faster in patients receiving HDMP. Blood product requirement in patients on HDMP therapy was less than those who were not receiving HDMP (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0049475513486642">Table 2</xref>). No mortality was observed in the intervention group. Two of the patients in the control group died – they both had a platelet count of less than 10,000/mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0049475513486642">3</xref></sup> on admission time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0049475513486642">Table 1</xref>).

<p>CCHF is an acute, tick-borne viral disease that involves almost exclusively humans, often with severe haemorrhagic manifestations and a considerable mortality rate, especially when there is a known risk factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0049475513486642">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0049475513486642">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0049475513486642">16</xref></sup> The first human cases of infectious haemorrhagic fever in Iran were reported from the western part of the country. Since June 1999, endemic areas for CCHF have substantially increased in several provinces of Iran with a high fatality rate (30%) in the first years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0049475513486642">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049475513486642"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0049475513486642"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0049475513486642">4</xref></sup> Ribavirin is the only currently available promising therapeutic agent against CCHF. At the beginning of the epidemic in south eastern Iran we did not have enough information about the epidemiology of the disease in that area and ribavirin was not available for the treatment of CCHF patients. Therefore, the mortality rate was higher at that period. Using oral ribavirin immediately after the clinical diagnosis of patients had a significantly positive effect on patients’ survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0049475513486642">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049475513486642"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0049475513486642"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0049475513486642">4</xref></sup> Studies by Mardani (2003), Alavi-Naini and Metanat (2006) and Izadi (2009) revealed that the mortality rate was higher in untreated patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049475513486642">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0049475513486642">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0049475513486642">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0049475513486642">19</xref></sup> In the first study, between 1999–2004 in Sistan and Baluchestan, 165 confirmed cases were reported with a fatality rate of 22%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049475513486642">2</xref></sup> In our study in 2009, the mortality rate was approximately 3%. Our results showed that oral ribavirin, especially when given at the beginning of the illness, had significant positive effect on the survival rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0049475513486642">4</xref></sup> In spring 2010 we were confronting a high mortality rate among patients with severe thrombocytopenia, despite prompt treatment with ribavirin and supportive therapy. The results of a study in Turkey showed that high-dose methylprednisolone had a good effect on raising the platelet count in severe thrombocytopenia in children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0049475513486642">16</xref></sup> After treatment with HDMP, fever subsided and the platelet count increased in five children within 24 h. The leukocyte count also increased and visceral bleedings improved after starting methyl prednisolone. After starting HDMP, only one patient required blood products.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0049475513486642">16</xref></sup> In our study, after HDMP therapy in hospitalized patients with severe thrombocytopenia, platelet counts increased within 36 h. Cutaneous and visceral bleedings improved and leukocyte counts also began to increase within 48 h. Blood product requirement was significantly lower in patients receiving HDMP.</p>
<p>The pathogenesis of CCHF is not well understood. As in other viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF), CCHFV targets and impairs cells that begin the antiviral immune response. The pathogenesis of the disease could be a result of the direct injury of virus-infected tissues as well as the indirect effects of host immune responses such as cytokines. The correlation between viraemia levels and disease severity has not only been reported in patients with CCHF but also those with other VHFs such as dengue virus infection and in patients with haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0049475513486642">19</xref></sup> It is suggested that the presentations of CCHF could be a result of a delayed and down-regulated immune response caused by IL-10, which leads to an increased replication and spread of CCHFV throughout the body. The latter triggers increased production of gamma-interferon (IFN), alpha-tumour necrosis factors (TNF), cytokines mediating vascular dysfunction and disseminated intravascular coagulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0049475513486642">20</xref></sup> However, corticosteroids inhibit cytokine, chemokine and adhesion molecule production and antagonize the action of pro-inflammatory cytokines, a hypothesis that seems to be a reasonable explanation for the improvement of those of our patients who received HDMP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0049475513486642" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We suggest that HDMP, in addition to oral ribavirin and supportive management, may lead to clinical and laboratory improvements in CCHF patients with severe thrombocytopenia. Further double blind randomized clinical trials in different settings should be carried out in order to determine the timing and duration of HDMP treatment and its effect on outcome.</p>
