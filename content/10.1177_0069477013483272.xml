<title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
<p>A review of literature reports regarding herb-induced liver injury was performed to describe potential drawbacks associated with reporting assumed cases and elucidate steps for improving future reports. Reassessment of 69 published and spontaneous reports of primary greater celandine related hepatotoxicity using the scale of the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences revealed 4 cases with highly probable and 12 cases with probable causality. This reassessment indicated that only 23% of reports were correctly diagnosed on appropriate causality assessment. Potential confounding variables included poor documentation, case duplicates, unrelated causality, and concurrent hepatitis A-C infection. The quality of unregulated herbal products was identified as a potential barrier to assessing the causality of suspected herbal toxicity. General guidelines for high-quality reporting of cases were described and included incorporating patient characteristics, receipt of herbal products, clinical course, laboratory assessment, consideration of alternative diagnoses, and effect of reexposure if applicable. The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences scale was described as the preferred tool for causality over other scales due to validation in hepatotoxicity and consideration of liver-specific parameters. Additional herbal products demonstrating clear evidence for hepatotoxic properties via review included ayurvedic herbs, Chaparral, Chinese herbal mixture, germander, few Herbalife products, Ho Shou Wu, Jin Bu Huan, Kava, Ma Huang, mistletoe, senna, and Syo Saiko To. Causality could not be established for other herbal products including black cohosh and <italic>Pelargonium sidoides</italic>.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that causality assessment of herbal hepatotoxicity was hindered by poor herbal product quality and case data presentation as well as use of insufficient causality algorithms. The authors further concluded that reported cases should only be used as a signal of safety concern when accompanied by transparent data and a Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences causality rating of highly probably or probable causality.</p>

<title>Gynecomastia</title>
<p>A 67-year-old male patient developed new-onset gynecomastia and breast tenderness 18 days after sertraline was added to the patient’s medication regimen for treatment of major depression. Concurrent medications included duloxetine (60 mg at bedtime), alprazolam (0.25 mg twice daily as needed), amlodipine (10 mg/day), hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene (25 mg/37.5 mg/day), metformin (500 mg/day), and sitagliptin (100 mg/day). Pertinent labs included random blood glucose (145 mg/dL), potassium (3.4 mEq/L), A1C (7.3%), and total testosterone (318 ng/mL) with unbound testosterone (6.2 pg/mL). Mammography revealed bilateral gynecomastia without suspicious mass, cluster of calcification, or other abnormalities. Sertraline was tapered to discontinuation over 20 days to avoid withdrawal. As the sertraline total daily dose was reduced, gynecomastia and breast tenderness symptom severity rapidly decreased. Within 4 weeks of the last sertraline dose, the patient reported resolution of gynecomastia and breast tenderness.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that sertraline, when added to duloxetine and titrated to a higher dose, caused progressive gynecomastia. The combined use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors results in gynecomastia through decreased dopamine neurotransmission, with hyperprolactinemia or perturbations in sexual hormones.</p>

<title>Acute Pancreatitis</title>
<p>A 69-year-old male patient developed abdominal pain a day after starting nilotinib (300 mg twice daily for 6 days) for chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. Concurrent medications included enalapril, simvastatin, and aspirin. The abdominal pain was associated with nausea, radiation to the back, and loss of appetite. Abdominal examination showed epigastric tenderness, no peritoneal irritation, normal bowel sounds, and no organomegaly. Pertinent labs consistent with pancreatitis included white blood cells 33 370/uL, serum amylase 152 IU/L, serum lipase 308 IU/L, bilirubin 1.7 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase 308 IU/L, and triglycerides 121 mg/dL. An abdominal computed tomography scan demonstrated thickening of the pancreatic tail with infiltration of the surrounding fat. Nilotinib was immediately discontinued and intravenous fluids and analgesics were administered. Three days later, the patient was discharged in good clinical condition and pancreatic enzymes returned to normal limits 2 weeks later. Imatinib was started for chronic myelogenous leukemia and major cytogenetic response was achieved 3 months later without recurrence of adverse effects.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that nilotinib caused acute pancreatitis, which was demonstrated by clinical, radiologic, and laboratory studies before and after initiation of nilotinib. Inhibition of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-abl with high affinity might interfere with the molecular mechanisms regulating pancreatic cell death. In addition, nilotinib might disturb pancreatic exocrine function by inhibiting calcium release from the intracellular acinar stores and by promoting the accumulation of fatty acids inside pancreatic acinar cells.</p>

<title>Priapism (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477013483272">*</xref>)</title>
<p>A 49-year-old male patient developed a 5-day case of priapism after ingesting 1 capsule of Africa Black Ant, an herbal supplement for erectile dysfunction. Concurrent medications included an unknown amount of illicit methamphetamine and an antiviral regimen consisting of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), atazanavir (300 mg daily), and abacavir/lamivudine (600/300 mg daily). After 3 days of priapism, the patient was treated at an emergency department with cavernosal phenylephrine injections, which provided temporary relief. The patient revisited another emergency department 2 days later with a diffusely swollen penis and ecchymosis from the glans to the scrotum. Labs showed an undetectable viral load, a CD4+ count of 800 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, and there were no abnormal vital signs. Treatment included administration of 2000 µg of phenylephrine over 20 minutes followed by aspiration of approximately 10 mL of blood without submission. A bilateral T-shunt with tunneling of the corpora cavernosa was then performed. No recurrence of priapism was reported at 1 month after the procedure. The patient also conveyed partial ability to sustain an erection compared to baseline.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this was a first report of priapism likely induced by decreased clearance of the Africa Black Ant and methamphetamine, caused by the patient’s antiretroviral regimen. A sample of the ingested Africa Black Ant was analyzed using liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometer, resulting in confirmation of sildenafil (96 mg) and traces of vardenafil constituents. Drug–drug interactions were evaluated yielding contraindications between atazanavir and sildenafil and between ritonavir and sildenafil. Other moderate drug–drug interactions resulted, including a risk of increased sympathomimetic toxicity with ritonavir and methamphetamine.</p>

<title>Diabetes Insipidus</title>
<p>A 43-year-old male patient developed watery emesis and headache of 2 days duration during lithium therapy (300 mg) for approximately a year. He received lithium therapy for schizoaffective disorder from 1986 to 1997 and from 2011 until time of hospitalization. Concurrent medications included paliperidone (3 mg) and haloperidol (5 mg). The patient was hospitalized several times over the course of a few months with sodium levels as low as 117 mol/L. Additional symptoms included polydipsia and polyuria. Lithium, paliperidone, and haloperidol were discontinued and valproic acid (500 mg) and risperidone (1 mg) were started on discharge. No medication frequencies were reported. Resolution of patient’s adverse drug reaction is unknown.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that an extremely rare consequence of lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in which the patient has an overlying psychogenic polydipsia can lead to a paradoxical hyponatremia. Hyponatremia is typically not seen in patients with diabetes insipidus; hypernatremia is expected and can typically be corrected with osmoreceptor function driving thirst and should resolve as hypernatremia resolves.</p>

<title>Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477013483272">*</xref>)</title>
<p>A 49-year-old male patient presented with a 1-day history of severe upper abdominal pain and vomiting 3 weeks after starting vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Concurrent medications included metformin and glimepiride. Vital signs were significant for a heart rate of 110 beats/min and respiratory rate of 22 cycles/min. Abdominal examination revealed epigastric tenderness with guarding, liver dullness was not obliterated, and serum amylase level was elevated at 2215 U/L. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed features of interstitial pancreatitis, and a repeat contrast-enhanced computed tomography abdomen on the fifth day showed extensive pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis. A magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed necrotic debris compressing on the common bile duct and the patient underwent a laparascopic pancreatic necrosectomy with a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. On the ninth postoperative day, an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and stenting of the common bile duct was performed. The patient’s diabetes regimen was changed to insulin on hospital discharge 50 days after admission and remained asymptomatic on follow-up 9 months after discharge. This was the first case report of acute pancreatitis associated with the use of this drug in India.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that vildagliptin use is associated with increased risk of pancreatitis although the reason remains unclear. It is probably related to the higher rates of known risk factors for pancreatitis, such as gallbladder stones, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, age, and the use of medications potentially associated with pancreatitis.</p>

<title>Cholestatic Hepatitis</title>
<p>A 32-year-old female patient developed severe nausea, icterus, vomiting, and pruritus approximately 3 months after her venlafaxine dose was increased (75 mg to 300 mg daily) in the treatment of severe depression. The patient had been on the previous dose for 2.5 years. Approximately 10 years earlier, when venlafaxine was initiated, the patient experienced a transient episode of acute hepatitis. Venlafaxine was stopped and restarted at low dose (75 mg/day), which then resulted in a positive rechallenge. On hospital admit lab findings showed a typical pattern of acute liver failure with elevated aspartate aminotransferase (1033 U/L), elevated alanine aminotransferase (2063 U/L), elevated alkaline phosphatase (274 U/L), and elevated bilirubin (4.6 mg/dL). Liver biopsy showed cholestatic hepatitis. Venlafaxine administration was stopped on admission, and the patient was discharged from the hospital 10 days later in a clinically improved but not totally asymptomatic condition. Therapy was switched to methylprednisolone (50 mg/day) for 7 days 1 week after discharge, which resulted in a clinically asymptomatic condition.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this patient’s cholestatic hepatitis was venlafaxine induced. The mechanism of venlafaxine-related hepatitis remains unclear. The liver isoenzyme CYP2D6 that metabolizes venlafaxine is thought to be involved, and clearance of the drug is decreased in poor metabolizers because of a genetic CYP2D6 polymorphism.</p>

<title>Pancreatitis</title>
<p>A 71-year-old male patient developed acute pancreatitis in the absence of hypertriglyceridemia after receiving a propofol infusion for 6 days (total 8.8 g) to induce sedation. Approximately 5 days after the initiation of propofol, the patient experienced abdominal distension and epigastric tenderness. The patient had no prior history of cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, hypertriglyceridemia, or significant alcohol consumption. Laboratory tests showed elevated serum amylase (1062 IU/L) and lipase (1911 IU/L) levels and slightly raised aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. The patient’s serum triglyceride level remained within the normal range (102 mg/dL). Propofol was discontinued and dexmedetomidine was initiated for sedation. Two days later, the amylase and lipase levels decreased to 145 IU/L and 83 IU/L, respectively. Because of continuing uncontrolled hypertension and agitation, propofol was rechallenged 9 days after discontinuation, resulting in increased amylase and lipase (572 IU/L and 767 IU/L, respectively). However, triglycerides remained at a normal level (80 mg/dL). An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed edematous pancreatitis. Propofol was once again stopped, and there was a subsequent decrease in amylase (107 IU/L) and lipase (46 IU/L) within 2 days.</p>
<p>The authors of this case report concluded that the patient’s acute pancreatitis was related to propofol. They suggested that the mechanism of action may be due to an idiosyncratic hypersensitivity and that hypertriglyceridemia may not be the only contributing factor in propofol-induced acute pancreatitis.</p>

<title>Torsades de Pointes</title>
<p>A 49-year-old male patient developed a prolonged QTc interval and torsades de pointes following treatment with vorinostat (400 mg daily) for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Concurrent medications included hydrochlorothiazide, NPH and regular insulin, doxepin, and sertraline, as well as naproxen and oxycodone as needed. The patient was hospitalized after a 4-day history of hematemesis, hematochezia, and syncope. The last dose of vorinostat was taken on the day prior to admission. Once admitted, an electrocardiogram revealed a prolonged QTc interval (826 milliseconds) with T-wave inversions throughout both precordial and limb leads. A previous electrocardiogram, 48 months earlier, demonstrated a QTc interval of 400 milliseconds. The patient developed torsades de pointes and a code was called on the first day of hospitalization. After less than 1 minute of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm. At that time, magnesium and potassium replacements were given. The patient was transferred to a critical care unit where doxepin and sertraline were discontinued. A repeat electrocardiogram showed that the QTc interval had decreased to 514 milliseconds. On the fourth day of hospitalization, the QTc remained prolonged at 559 milliseconds.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the patient’s QTc interval prolongation was related to vorinostat. They propose that the mechanism related to the prolonged QTc interval was secondary to concurrent use of vorinostat with other QTc-prolonging medications in the setting of hypokalemia. A Naranjo probability score indicated that this reaction was rated as probable.</p>

<title>Visual Hallucinations</title>
<p>A 78-year-old male patient with Lewy body dementia experienced a worsening of visual hallucinations after discontinuing treatment with memantine (10 mg twice daily). Concurrent medications included donepezil (10 mg daily), flunisolide nasal spray (once daily), loratadine (10 mg daily), lisinopril (20 mg daily), and pravastatin (10 mg daily). The patient had been taking memantine for 3 years and donepezil for 4 years after receiving a diagnosis of Lewy body dementia, which was complicated by visual hallucinations. At the patient’s first geriatric psychiatry clinic visit, the hallucinations were reported to be mild and occurring only 1 to 2 times per week. Four months later during a follow-up examination, his wife reported no hallucinations since the last visit. The patient was tapered off the drug. On follow-up 2 months later, his wife reported a decline in function with daily hallucinations, incontinence, and incidences of not recognizing her. The only medication change at that time had been the discontinuation of memantine. One week later, reports of increasing severity of visual hallucinations were documented and memantine was restarted. Five days later, the patient was no longer hallucinating. Memantine was reinitiated and at follow-up clinic visits 2 and 4 months later, the patient’s visual hallucinations were reported as mild and occurring 1 to 2 times per month.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the patient’s worsening visual hallucinations were related to discontinuation of memantine. Memantine may display efficacy in the treatment of Lewy body dementia through the inhibition of <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, which reduces glutamate neurotransmitter activity.</p>

<title>Torsades de Pointes</title>
<p>A 42-year-old male patient experienced torsades de pointes after receiving 5 days of aripiprazole (2.5 mg daily) for schizophrenia. After admission to a medical intensive care unit for the treatment of sepsis, the patient began displaying symptoms possibly related to either schizophrenia or hypoactive delirium. The patient was restarted on quetiapine (400 mg at bedtime). After receiving 1 dose of quetiapine, an increase in the QTc interval (644 milliseconds) was noted via electrocardiogram. Approximately 1 week prior to admission, the QTc interval was 528 milliseconds. Quetiapine was discontinued, and the patient was started on aripiprazole 23 days later after sepsis had resolved and the QTc interval had decreased to 414 milliseconds. Five days after starting treatment, the patient experienced cardiac arrest secondary to torsades de pointes. The patient converted back to normal sinus rhythm after having received cardiopulmonary resuscitation for 30 seconds, magnesium sulfate (4 g), and 1 shock of 200 Joules. An electrocardiogram obtained minutes prior to the incident revealed a QTc interval of 624 milliseconds. The patient’s only concurrent medication was famotidine (20 mg intravenous daily). The patient had repeat electrocardiograms performed 1, 5, and 14 days after the cardiac arrest and subsequent discontinuation of aripiprazole at which time his QTc intervals were 537, 472, and 450 milliseconds, respectively.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that there is a probable correlation between aripiprazole and risk of torsades de pointes. It is proposed that medications, such as antipsychotics, exert varying degrees of QTc interval prolongation through inhibition of delayed rectifier potassium channels.</p>

<title>Acute Kidney Injury (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477013483272">*</xref>)</title>
<p>Sixteen cases of acute kidney injury associated with synthetic cannabinoid use were described. All cases involved males aged 15 to 33 years except one involving a 15-year-old female. No concurrent medications capable of inducing kidney injury were reported. Nausea and vomiting occurred in all but 1 case, and 12 cases reported abdominal, flank, or back pain. Laboratory analysis revealed elevations in serum creatinine ranging from 3.3 to 21.0 mg/dL and occurred 1 to 6 days after initial symptom onset. Urinalysis displayed variable results including proteinuria (8 patients), casts (5), white blood cells (9), and red blood cells (8). Renal ultrasonography was performed in 9 cases and revealed a nonspecific increase in renal cortical echogenicity. Renal biopsy demonstrated acute tubular injury in 6 cases and features of acute interstitial nephritis in 3 cases. Alternative causes of acute kidney injury including infectious, autoimmune, pharmacologic, or other toxin exposures were not identified. Treatment included hemodialysis in 5 cases and administration of corticosteroids in 5 cases. Recovery of kidney function occurred in all cases and was within 3 days following peak serum creatinine levels in most patients. No fatalities occurred.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this was the first report of acute kidney injury associated with synthetic cannabinoid use. The proposed mechanism was a toxic effect induced by the potent synthetic cannabinoid AM2201, which previously had been associated with human disease and death, although not acute kidney injury.</p>

<title>Upper Gastrointestinal Complications</title>
<p>A retrospective analysis was performed to evaluate the association between hospitalization due to upper gastrointestinal complications and common medications used in the pediatric population. A total of 486 children hospitalized for upper gastrointestinal complications and 1930 children hospitalized for neurological disorders were evaluated. The presence of chronic gastrointestinal disease was an independent risk factor for upper gastrointestinal complication manifestations (adjusted odds ratio = 2.3; 95% confidence interval = 1.1-4.9). A greater percentage of patients hospitalized for upper gastrointestinal complications had received at least 1 drug within the 3 weeks prior to hospitalization (74% vs 54%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), and the mean number of drugs received was greater (1.7 vs 1.1; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). An increased risk of upper gastrointestinal complication was associated with receipt of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (adjusted odds ratio = 2.9; 95% confidence interval = 2.1-4.0), paracetamol (adjusted odds ratio = 2.0; 95% confidence interval = 1.5-2.6), corticosteroids (adjusted odds ratio = 1.9; 95% confidence interval = 1.4-2.7), and antibiotics (adjusted odds ratio = 2.3; 95% confidence interval = 1.8-3.1). Duration of drug receipt was short and not significantly different between the 2 groups, including duration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug receipt (3 days vs 2 days; <italic>P</italic> = .41).</p>
<p>The authors concluded that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroid, and antibiotic use was associated with an increased risk of upper gastrointestinal complications in the pediatric population.</p>

<title>Pancreatitis</title>
<p>A 16-year-old girl developed pancreatitis 12 days after starting therapy with voriconazole for invasive <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>. Concurrent medications included 3 courses of cytarabine. The day following induction with daunorubin (60 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) for 3 days and cytarabine (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) for 7 days in lieu of intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia, the patient developed febrile neutropenia with nodule infiltrates in the lungs and mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinuses with mass in the nasal cavity. Cultures showed <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>–resistant to amphotericin B, intermediate to itraconazole, and highly sensitive to voriconazole. The patient was started on voriconazole (300 mg twice daily on day 1, then 200 mg twice daily) with reduction in facial edema and improved respiratory function within 48 hours. Twelve days after starting voriconazole, the patient developed severe epigastric pain with a serum amylase of 234 IU/mL. Computed tomography showed pancreatitis, and voriconazole was discontinued. The patient improved with normalization in amylase levels in 12 days after conservative management. Voriconazole (100 mg twice daily) was then reintroduced for prophylaxis with high-dose cytarabine for consolidation without problem. On day 15 of the second high-dose cytarabine course, the patient developed epigastric pain and vomiting. Serum amylase levels were elevated at 637 U/mL. On medication review, it was discovered that the patient was mistakenly given voriconazole (200 mg twice daily) for 1 week before developing symptoms consistent with pancreatitis again. Voriconazole was discontinued indefinitely and the third course of cytarabine completed uneventfully. The patient remained in remission with no recurrence of pancreatitis.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that voriconazole was likely the culprit in the causation of pancreatitis considering the temporal relationships throughout the patient’s treatment and uneventful last course of cytarabine. The mechanism of azole-induced pancreatitis is unknown; however, the occurrence may suggest dose dependence as this patient only experienced pancreatitis with higher doses of voriconazole. Conversely, the low incidence and poor predictability of this side effect may also suggest idiosyncrasy.</p>
