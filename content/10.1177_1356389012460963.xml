<abstract>
<p>This article draws on two recent traditions in evaluation methodology, one grounded in complexity theory and the other in a realist philosophy of science. Sometimes seen as incompatible, it is argued here that complexity theory and realist evaluation are ‘natural bedfellows’. Because of their similarities and differences, evaluators can usefully draw on both perspectives within the same evaluation. One way to do so is to draw on key concepts from each in the selection and use of substantive theory. The article introduces the concept of ‘complexity-consistent’ substantive theories and suggests that this is useful for the evaluation of policies and programs in complex adaptive systems. It demonstrates how substantive theories can be analysed in complexity terms, how multiple theories can be ‘layered’ to reflect multiple levels of systems, and how such theories can be used within evaluation design and analysis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Complexity theory and a realist philosophy of science are sometimes seen as competitors or as mutually incompatible even though these two traditions in fact share a common philosophical basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356389012460963">Callaghan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356389012460963">Reed and Harvey, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356389012460963">Sanderson, 2002</xref>). However, there are differences too and debate remains about the implications of those differences for evaluation.</p>
<p>The article starts from the position that there is sufficient commonality between a realist philosophy of science and complexity theory for evaluators to draw on both positions within the same evaluation and sufficient difference between them for it to be useful to do so.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1356389012460963">1</xref></sup> Noting that evaluators from both traditions have argued for greater use of substantive theory in evaluation, I argue that ‘complexity-consistent’ substantive theories are particularly useful for the evaluation of policies and programs in complex adaptive systems. (Use of the terms ‘complex’ and ‘complexity’ in this article follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1356389012460963">Glouberman and Zimmerman’s [2002]</xref> description of simple, complicated and complex problems, in which ‘complicated’ refers to having many parts but ‘complex’ to principles of complexity theory, including emergence and uncertainty.) It will demonstrate how theories might be analysed in complexity terms, how multiple theories might be layered to reflect multiple levels of systems, and briefly introduce how such theories can be used within evaluation. A further article will demonstrate the use of these methods within an evaluation project.</p>
<p>It is also important, however, to note what is not being attempted. First, it does not attempt a comprehensive comparison of realist philosophy (in any of its multiple forms) with complexity theory (in its multiple forms). I have a much more modest goal – to list some common features and then briefly compare the understandings of causation reflected in descriptions of complex adaptive systems with those outlined in realist evaluation, particularly as exemplified by Pawson and Tilley’s approach. The purpose of this is to demonstrate that substantive theories selected for ‘complexity consistency’ will be of use in realist (and perhaps other theory-based) evaluations. The second thing that will not be attempted is a comprehensive justification of the particular theories selected for the demonstration of ‘layering’ theory. As one reviewer of an earlier draft of this article rightly noted, the selection of particular theories will ‘fundamentally affect’ whether and how layered theories work together. The point here is not, however, to justify the choice of particular theories, or to argue the value of the particular theoretical framework that was constructed, but to demonstrate a method.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1356389012460963">
<title>The realist-complexity debate</title>
<p>The philosophical commonalities between complexity theory and realism have been cogently argued in relation to the broader social sciences (see for e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356389012460963">Byrne, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356389012460963">Reed and Harvey, 1992</xref>). Both complexity theory and a realist philosophy of science understand reality as comprising multiple, nested, open systems in which change is generative, context dependent and time irreversible. However, in the evaluation sector, complexity theory and realist philosophy tend to underpin different approaches and sometimes heated debates.</p>
<p>Realism understands causation as working through causal mechanisms that operate, or do not, according to context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356389012460963">Bhaskar, 1997 [1975]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356389012460963">Sayer, 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1356389012460963">Pawson and Tilley (1997)</xref> drew on this framework to provide their structure for realist program theory using CMOCs (context, mechanism, outcome configurations).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1356389012460963">2</xref></sup> Some have argued that a realist approach is particularly appropriate for evaluation in complex systems and demonstrated its use in complicated or complex programs (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1356389012460963">Byng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356389012460963">Marchal et al., 2010</xref>). However, others have criticized it as being too linear, arguing for greater recognition of multiple causation and non-linearity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356389012460963">Sanderson (2002</xref>: 10) has argued that it is ‘futile to seek to identify and trace individual causal processes and mechanisms in complex systems; emergent interaction effects defy such reductionist analysis’. Similarly, Barnes et al. have argued that ‘we need to draw from complexity theory to account for unpredictable consequences of change processes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356389012460963">2003</xref>: 274).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356389012460963">Byrne (1998)</xref> has noted (although not in the context of the evaluation debate):
<disp-quote>
<p>The issue is that in the social world . . . causation is complex. Outcomes are determined not by single causes but by multiple causes, and these causes may, and usually do, interact in a non-additive fashion. In other words the combined effect is not necessarily the sum of the separate effects. It may be greater or less, because factors can reinforce or cancel each other out in non-linear ways. It should be noted that interactions are not confined to the second order. We can have higher order interactions and interactions between interactions. (p. 20)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Realists and their sympathizers have responded by arguing that each evaluation should seek to investigate particular aspects of program theory rather than its totality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356389012460963">Pawson, 2006</xref>), by demonstrating ways that program logic models may be designed in order to take account of complicated or complex aspects of interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1356389012460963">Rogers, 2008</xref>), and by arguing that even complicated interventions boil down to simple mechanisms (Leeuw, 2008, personal communication).</p>
<p>Both complexity theorists and realists, however, have called for greater use of substantive theory to inform evaluation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356389012460963">Barnes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1356389012460963">Leeuw, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1356389012460963">Pawson and Tilley, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The position that underpins this article is that realism and complexity theory are natural bedfellows. Some elements are common across both philosophies; some elements overlap – that is, different constructs are used to understand the same phenomena; and some elements are different but complementary. Because of this combination of similarities and differences, evaluators can usefully draw on both perspectives. The article offers two practical strategies to do this. The first is to draw on key concepts from each tradition <italic>in the selection and use of substantive theory</italic> within evaluation design and within the interpretation of evaluation findings. The second is to ‘layer’ theories to reflect the levels of reality with which the evaluation must deal.</p>
<p>A number of contentions underpin these strategies:</p>
<list id="list1-1356389012460963" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>First, insofar as evaluators are interested in the attribution of outcomes to programs or policies, they must be interested in causation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Second, both realist approaches and complexity theory understand causation as involving processes at one level of a system that generate outcomes at different levels of a system.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Third, the characteristics of complex adaptive systems describe the ‘characteristic content’ of theories that will be useful for analysis of complex systems and thus for evaluations dealing with complex systems.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fourth, ‘layering’ theories of this kind reflects both emergence and the layering (or embeddedness) of systems in the real world, and that this assists in conceptualizing, and thus managing analysis of, multiple causation.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The following discussion considers these main contentions – although as the first, the importance of causation in attributing outcomes, is an old argument in evaluation methodology it will not be reprised here (for a summary of the argument, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356389012460963">Astbury and Leeuw, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Causation in realist philosophy and complexity theory</title>
<sec id="section4-1356389012460963">
<title>Mechanisms and local rules</title>
<p>There is an overlap in understandings of causation between realism and complexity theory. Beliefs about causation – what it is and how it works – constitute critical differences in philosophical positions that underpin evaluation approaches. Positivist science, which underpins some traditional research designs, is grounded in a ‘constant conjunction’ model of causation: if we see A and then we see B, we always see B after A, and without A we do not see B, then A causes B. It is linear and observable. Realism uses the language of mechanisms (causal forces or processes) to explain causation. Mechanisms exist at all levels of reality, a function of the natural ‘powers and liabilities’ of things and fire – or do not – according to context. Mechanisms are usually invisible, in part because they operate at a level higher or lower than the observed outcome. Complexity theory, on the other hand, argues that the interaction of local elements following ‘local rules’ at one level of a system generates complex patterns of outcomes at other system levels. In complex adaptive systems, the ‘local rules’ themselves can change in response to changes in the system or its environment, generating yet further change.</p>
<p>Both realism and complexity theory therefore understand causation as involving processes at one level of a system that generate outcomes at another level. Despite this similarity, the descriptions of causation in realism and complexity sound quite different (causal powers as compared to ‘elements following local rules’). Perhaps, however, that is more a matter of description than of substance. Much hinges on the nature of the ‘local rules’. They are not ‘laws’ in the sense that positivists use the term and they are not successionist in nature. The rules themselves are contingent, taking something of the form of: ‘in these circumstances, do “x”; in those, do “y”’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356389012460963">Cleveland (1994)</xref> provides an accessible summary. Complex adaptive systems are comprised of multiple autonomous agents, each making decisions in response to information in the local environment. However, agents:
<disp-quote>
<p>don’t act randomly. They share some common ‘rules’ about how to decide what to do next. At the level of matter, these common rules are the laws of nature (gravity, electromagnetism, etc.). At the level of conscious actors, these are decision-making rules (preferences, interests, desires, etc.)’ (p. 8)</p>
<p>As systems evolve and become more complex . . . local rules become more sophisticated and the systems are freed from the constraints of response to immediate physical forces. (p. 18)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Regardless of the sophistication of the system, the absolute range of options available to the ‘decision-maker’ is limited in part by its own nature and in part by the context. Of the total range of options available across all contexts, only some will be available in particular contexts. Some options may require greater or lesser effort on the part of the agent as a result of local circumstances making some decisions more likely than others. Translating this into realist terminology, local rules operate as mechanisms generating outcomes at the next level of the system.</p>
<p>How does this relate to the idea of ‘mechanism’ as used in realist evaluation? One connection is the idea of decision-making. Local rules have implications for ‘<italic>decision-making</italic>’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1356389012460963">3</xref></sup> because rather than prescribing a specific next action in a sequence, they operate contingently, depending on the context. Pawson and Tilley have argued that program outcomes depend critically on the choices made by different stakeholders along the implementation chain, including (critically) the eventual program targets or participants. The policy or program provides resources or opportunities. The reasoning of stakeholders at each step of the implementation process in response to those resources and opportunities constitute mechanisms. They underpin decisions that generate particular actions, which in turn enable or constrain options available at the next level of implementation and thereby constrain or enable the outcomes that can be generated. Each step in the implementation process will be undertaken at a particular level of a system that will have particular powers and liabilities and that will make those decisions according to particular local rules and taking account of local context. Identifying what those rules are therefore helps to understand how or why particular decisions are made.</p>
<p>It might be argued, however, that the term ‘mechanism’ as it is used in realist evaluation does not apply to single steps within processes. It applies either to an overall process that generates an outcome, or to the ‘key idea’ that is supposed to generate the outcome of interest for the eventual program target. However, this is simply a question of the degree of abstraction. Because complex adaptive systems are both open and nested, any process (including mechanisms) comprises multiple sub-processes at lower levels of the system. An outcome at one level of a system is a step in a process for another level. Processes can therefore be examined at higher or lower levels of the system and at higher or lower levels of abstraction. By the same argument, policy or program mechanisms can be examined in fine grained ways (particular individuals or particular decisions), or they can be examined as ‘middle range theories’ – abstractions about patterns of decision- making, relating to the ‘main ideas’ about how outcomes will be generated, that can be applied across programs and contexts. The level of abstraction that is appropriate depends on the analytic task at hand.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1356389012460963">
<title>The importance of context</title>
<p>A second similarity with regard to causation between complexity theory and realism is that both insist on the importance of context in understanding processes of change. Realists argue that mechanisms exist whether or not they are activated; the particular combination of mechanisms that will fire in a given situation is determined by the context. Complexity theorists argue that major system level change happens through <italic>bifurcation</italic>: a process where, at a point of change, a system oscillates between and then ‘chooses’ between two possible trajectories. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356389012460963">Byrne (1998)</xref> notes, the ‘choice’ of pathways is made ‘on the basis of very small differences in the values of controlling parameter(s) at the point of change’ (p. 22). A realist might say that the choice of pathways depends on very small variations in the key aspects of context.</p>
<p>The argument here is that the understandings of causation and context in realist philosophy and complexity theory are similar enough that evaluators can draw on both within the same analysis, and different enough to offer different conceptual tools. We will return to demonstrate this principle later.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section6-1356389012460963">
<title>Characteristics of complexity and substantive theory</title>
<p>The third contention of this article relates to the relationship between the nature of substantive theory and its value in evaluation in complex systems. Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1356389012460963">Sanderson (2000)</xref> in relation to ‘new institutionalist’ thought and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356389012460963">Callaghan (2008)</xref> in relation to Strauss’s concept of negotiated order have argued that the respective theories can be used alongside complexity theory to understand policy processes and outcomes. In both cases, the theoretical framework was seen to be ‘consistent with’ complexity theory.</p>
<p>Here we arrive at a critical issue. What is it about such theories that accounts for that consistency and explains their utility? The argument made here is that <italic>substantive theories that reflect key tenets of complexity theory are of particular value in understanding processes of change in complex adaptive systems</italic>. Those key tenets include the embeddedness of systems within larger systems; generative, contingent causation; emergence of system properties as a result of the local interaction of elements following ‘local rules’ at other levels of systems; non-linearity; feedback; and ‘tipping points’ (or bifurcation). Useful theories will address some or all of the following:</p>
<list id="list2-1356389012460963" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>the constituent elements of systems. This requires drawing conceptual boundaries around systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1356389012460963">Midgely, 2000</xref>). Such boundaries do not exist in the same clean, hard-edged way in reality – it is part of the definition of complex adaptive systems that they are open, and not neatly bounded – but the analyst must make decisions about what is to be included and excluded in each case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356389012460963">Cabrera et al., 2008</xref>);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the interactions between elements of a systems (that is, the theories will have a focus on relationships <italic>within</italic> systems);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the ‘local rules’ that govern the ways that those interactions occur and the properties that result, in other levels of the system, from those interactions;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the ways that various forms of feedback operate to constrain or support change, in intended or unintended directions;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the nature of initial conditions that significantly affect the operations of systems or of particular interactions within systems;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the controlling parameters that determine whether systems tip from one pattern to another;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the interactions between levels of systems.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>For want of a better term, I shall refer to such theories as ‘complexity-consistent theories’. Each of these features of complexity-consistent theory can provide a specific benefit to evaluators.</p>
<p>Drawing boundaries around systems and identifying their component elements provides the boundary within which an evaluator will work and identifies elements about which data might be collected. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356389012460963">Cilliers (1998</xref>: 9, quoted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356389012460963">Barnes et al., 2003</xref>) has argued, this involves a risk because it is not possible to know just how important the aspects excluded from the model of the system may have been in creating the outcomes. Nevertheless, it is not possible to track interactions forever: a boundary must, for practical reasons, be set somewhere. The argument here is that defining what falls inside and what outside a system for good theoretical reasons is better than drawing boundaries on an arbitrary basis.</p>
<p>Substantive theories that identify ‘which interactions matter’ for generating outcomes at other levels of the system can also guide data collection. That is, such theories specify which elements of the system are important for change processes: these are likely to be elements about which data should be collected. More importantly, it focuses attention on the nature of the interactions to be examined. This shifts attention from the structure of the system to the processes by which it works, and suggests collecting data about the nature and frequency of those interactions.</p>
<p>Attention to the ‘local rules’ that guide those interactions offers a number of advantages. First, understanding the rules allows greater understanding of the interactions and that understanding alone may, in some cases, be the point of an evaluation. Certainly, realist evaluations that seek to identify mechanisms will be interested in the interactions and the rules. Second, understanding the rules may underpin ideas about ways to <italic>change</italic> the rules, thereby changing the interactions and thus changing the outcomes of those interactions. Where evaluations seek to inform policy or program change, this could be important. Third, understanding the rules may improve prediction of patterns of outcomes – at least at the descriptive, if not at the statistical modelling, level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1356389012460963">1</xref></sup> This offers the possibility of predicting how those patterns may change if the rules are changed – and thus of testing the program theories that are built in to attempts to change the rule. Fourth, the ways that local rules operate differently in different contexts or in different sub-systems may help to explain differences in the nature or frequency of interactions in those contexts. Differences in the nature or frequency of interactions may in turn help to explain different patterns of outcomes in different contexts. Realist evaluators may recognize a pattern to this final logic. It is a description, in complexity-informed language, of Pawson and Tilley’s context-mechanism-outcome formula.</p>
<p>Theories that provide this information can be used in much the same way as a program logic model. Where the expected system elements are found to exist, the expected interactions occur and something like the expected pattern of outcomes are achieved, support for the theory is provided. Where the expected interactions do not occur, this may explain failure to achieve anticipated outcomes, either due to implementation failure or theory failure. Where outcomes data cannot reasonably be collected, collecting data about elements and interactions at earlier stages may enable the evaluator to assess whether emergent outcomes at the next level can still reasonably be expected.</p>
<p>Similar arguments can be mounted in relation to substantive theories that specify the initial conditions that are expected to affect the ways that systems operate, the nature and operation of feedback within systems, and the controlling parameters that determine whether systems tip from one pattern of behaviour to another. In realist terms, the initial conditions and controlling parameters are aspects of context, while feedback systems operate as mechanisms generating or constraining change. What complexity theory provides here is additional specification of ‘what to look for about context’. It frames questions to guide evaluation design (e.g. Which of the contextual features act as ‘controlling parameters’ and therefore warrant particular attention?; What kinds of feedback do we expect to be generated by initial actions and how will that affect what happens next?). The – undoubtedly provisional and hypothesized – answers to those questions then suggest data sets that will need to be collected.</p>
<p>Using substantive theory in this way, of course, also assists with the attribution of outcomes to the program. It has long been argued that theory-based evaluations assist with causal attribution (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1356389012460963">Weiss, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1356389012460963">Yin, 2003</xref>). Theories that provide detail about the elements of the system that interact, the nature of interactions and the rules that guide them, and the contextual features that affect them enable more finely grained predictions,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1356389012460963">4</xref></sup> greater tailoring of data collection, more sophisticated matching between predicted patterns and actual data, and therefore greater confidence in attributing change to the intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1356389012460963">
<title>Layering theory</title>
<p>The idea of emergent outcomes is built into both complexity theory and realist philosophy. Emergent outcomes, by definition, occur at a different level of a system than the level in which the original interaction occurred. Theories that describe generative processes may therefore suggest either systems in which to look for contributing causes or systems in which to look for emergent outcomes.</p>
<p>Thinking about systems at these other levels, however, may also suggest new theories to consider. By definition, those new systems will have different properties, different sub-systems and different internal interactions from the one previously considered. It is therefore entirely possible that different theories will be used to describe those systems. Evaluators can thus embed theories within one another in the same way as systems are embedded within each other. In simpler language, ‘layering’ theories to deal with the ‘layers’ of systems can help to capture this feature of reality.</p>
<p>As well as providing more comprehensive description of the systems under consideration, layered theories may also assist in understanding multiple causation. As complexity theorists have argued, all levels of a system constrain the others; causation operates both upwards and downwards. Multiple kinds of causes therefore contribute to patterns of outcomes. Layering theories provides a structure and conceptual framework to examine the ways that multiple mechanisms operate in multiple levels of systems to generate outcomes.</p>
<p>The next section of the article provides an example of how layered theories can be used. It is important to reiterate that the purpose of the example is not to support or disprove the particular theories that are used. Each of them represents an area of research and theory in its own right; each is contested; and there are alternate theories that could be used within each level of the model. Choosing different theories would of course change the nature of the discussion for that level of the model and the nature of the interactions between the levels of the model. The purpose of this example is simply to demonstrate how theories might be analysed for their ‘complexity consistency’, and how theories can be layered to assist in understanding causality in complex programs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1356389012460963">
<title>Complexity-consistent theory in early intervention programs</title>
<p>This example grows out of empirical work in the evaluation of early intervention programs for children in their early years. A number of evaluations have identified that some programs that ‘work’ for families at medium levels of disadvantage do not work for the most disadvantaged families (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356389012460963">Brooks-Gunn et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356389012460963">Browne, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356389012460963">Knitzer, 2000</xref>). In some cases, there is evidence that programs generated negative impacts for the most disadvantaged, including generating negative impacts on children’s cognitive and social-emotional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1356389012460963">Mathematica Policy Research, 2002</xref>). The theory map presented below represents the first step in a more comprehensive theory suggesting how and why such negative impacts may have been generated and why they might have been concentrated amongst the most disadvantaged families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1356389012460963">Westhorp, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The theory map places attachment theory as the bottom rung of a ‘theory ladder’. It posits that attachment style influences the nature of social judgements that an individual makes, which in turn influences the nature of relationships that they form, which in turn influences the extent and nature of social capital available to them, which in turn influences their life outcomes at the societal level (employment status, housing status and so on). That is, it posits attachment style as a mechanism generating differences in social judgements, which in turn act as a mechanism generating differences in social capital, which in turn act as a mechanism generating social inclusion and exclusion. It should be noted here that there is no claim that these are the sole mechanisms – or even, necessarily, the primary mechanisms – generating the outcomes at the next level. The claim is simply that these <italic>are</italic> mechanisms and that they therefore, in at least some contexts, contribute to those outcomes.</p>
<p>However, it should also be noted that the generative process operates downwards as well. That is, social and economic status and the social norms at play within particular groups influence the social capital available to members of those groups, which influences their experiences of seeking assistance through others, which influences both the nature of their relationship experiences and the nature of future social judgements they make, and their relationship experiences in turn have the potential to influence the modification of attachment style over the life course. This bi- directional influence is consistent with concepts of emergent order and downward causation in realist systems theory:
<disp-quote>
<p>The idea of downward causation is anti-reductionist and posits . . . that influences can be expected to occur in both directions – upward from subsystems and downward from the whole; every level constrains others. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356389012460963">Mark et al., 2000</xref>: 156)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>But can these ‘layered’ theories be analysed in complexity theory terms? Let us begin with attachment theory, the bottom layer of the ladder.</p>

<title>Attachment theory</title>
<p>Attachment theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356389012460963">Bowlby, 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356389012460963">1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356389012460963">1988</xref>) takes an ethological approach to understanding the parent-child bond and its implications for both development and relationships. It assumes an interaction of genetic predisposition and environmental influence to achieve a biological purpose – protection and survival of the infant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356389012460963">Bowlby, 1988</xref>: 60–1). This describes the first level of interaction built into the theory: an interaction between genes and environment that has evolved over millennia.</p>
<p>The theory describes the stages during the first three years of life in which initial attachments develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356389012460963">Bowlby, 1982</xref>: 265–8) and the behavioural systems of both parent and child that achieve or frustrate this goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356389012460963">1982</xref>: 235–64). The interactions between infants and their primary caregivers constitute the second explicit level of interaction in the theory. This is an example of drawing a conceptual boundary around a system for good theoretical reasons – the theoretical reason being that the infant-primary caregiver relationship has the greatest impact on the development of the attachment system. Sensitive and responsive parenting is associated with the development of secure attachment; insensitive, intrusive, hostile, or neglectful parenting with insecure or disorganized attachment (Ainsworth et al., 1978, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356389012460963">Bowlby, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1356389012460963">Jacobsen et al., 2000</xref>). This is an example of the nature of interactions between elements of a system generating different patterns of outcomes.</p>

<p>These early experiences of the child lead to the construction of ‘internal working models’ of both the self and the attachment figures. These models then shape:
<disp-quote>
<p>the way he or she sees himself or herself, others, and close relationships more generally. As such, attachment security works as a kind of an internal guidance system, filtering and appraising experiences in the world, especially social experiences, and thereby guiding behaviour. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356389012460963">Belsky, 2002</xref>: 166)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here we see the ways that early behaviours in the material world (interactions between children and parents) have emergent outcomes at another level of the system (the child’s beliefs about self and others).</p>
<p>Attachment theory also predicted the neurological structures involved and the ways in which bonding shapes the neurological structure of the child. This prompted significant research into the neurobiology and neurochemistry of attachment, which implicated ‘an inefficient corticolimbic control system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1356389012460963">Schore, 1999</xref>) in attachment ‘pathologies’. Shaping of infants’ neurological structures is another emergent outcome of the infant-caregiver interactions.</p>
<p>Other research has investigated ramifications of attachment status in both children and adults. Secure attachment has been associated with<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1356389012460963">5</xref></sup> increased sociability, social skill and popularity, increased task persistence and enthusiasm, increased capacity to predict others’ emotions, language development, improved attention span, better cognitive performance, higher self-confidence and more positive perceptions of social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356389012460963">McLeister Anan and Barnett, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356389012460963">Pasco Fearon and Belsky, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356389012460963">Repacholi and Trapolini, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1356389012460963">Van IJzendoorn et al., 1995</xref>). Conversely, insecure attachment has been associated with lower social skills and popularity and increased behaviour problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1356389012460963">Karen, 1998</xref>: 180–96). Disorganized attachment has been associated with poorer performance in deductive reasoning, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and aggression; self-harm, borderline personality disorder, crime and violence; psychopathology; eating disorders in women; and certain kinds of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356389012460963">Feeney, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356389012460963">Fonagy, n.d</xref>.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356389012460963">Hayslett-McCall and Bernard, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1356389012460963">Jacobsen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1356389012460963">Lyons-Ruth, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356389012460963">Maunder and Hunter, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1356389012460963">Troisi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1356389012460963">Ward et al., 2006</xref>, for reviews.)</p>
<p>These, then, are examples of emergent outcomes at multiple levels, in multiple systems, manifesting over history and thus demonstrating the complexity principle of historicity. Local rules relating to interaction between members of a system (here, the parent-child system) generate changes to neurological structures (neural pathways and the cortico-limbic control system) and in psychological structures (internal working models of self and others). These in turn generate complex patterns of outcomes in social, cognitive and emotional skills and capacities, and in relationships, psychological wellbeing and behaviours over the life span. Attachment theory is thus a prime example of the sorts of theories that encapsulate and reflect complexity theory, and that – it is argued here – are of use in understanding the operations of complex systems.</p>
<p>However, parenting style is not the sole determinant of attachment classification any more than attachment classification is the sole determinant of any of its ramifications. Maternal depression, socio-economic status, domestic violence, social support and single parenthood (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356389012460963">Huth-Bocks et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1356389012460963">Raikes and Thompson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1356389012460963">Vondra and Barnett, 1999</xref>) – have also demonstrated associations with attachment status. That is, in keeping with predictions of multiple causality, other forces are also at work, which can be represented by other levels of theory. In this particular case, social judgements theory and social capital theory were used as the next levels of the ladder.</p>
<p>Whereas the ‘attachment’ example began from the bottom level of a ‘layered’ theory ladder, the following example of social inclusion and exclusion starts from the top level of the theory ladder.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1356389012460963">
<title>Social exclusion</title>
<p>Social inclusion and exclusion are contested concepts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356389012460963">Levitas (2003)</xref> has identified three discourses in relation to social exclusion: a redistributive discourse, which sees social exclusion as both a cause and a consequence of poverty; a social integration discourse, in which labour force attachment is seen as the key element; and a moral underclass discourse that ‘emphasises moral and cultural causes of poverty and . . . tends to focus on the consequences of social exclusion for social order’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356389012460963">2003</xref>: 2–3). Within the redistributive discourse:
<disp-quote>
<p>social exclusion is understood to . . . [be] complexity-consistent, processual, multi-dimensional and relational; . . . it allows space for the understanding that discriminatory and exclusionary practices may be the causes of poverty. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356389012460963">Levitas, 2003</xref>: 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Meanwhile, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356389012460963">Byrne (2005)</xref> has provided an analysis of social exclusion that explicitly draws on complexity theory and realism. It seeks to understand the dynamics of exclusion and the ‘complex and recursive relationship among all of the social levels of macro, meso and micro’ (p. 65). He argues that social exclusion is:
<disp-quote>
<p>an emergent phenomenon that is constituted by the interaction among the life courses of individuals and households who for varying periods of time occupy a separated part of the condition space describing possible life courses, which is in part defined by categorically worse conditions as measured on a multi-dimensional basis. (p. 81)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The argument advanced here is that social exclusion, once generated, can be conceptualized in both realist and complexity terms, as follows:</p>
<list id="list3-1356389012460963" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The term ‘social exclusion’ refers both to a state (the state of being excluded) and a process (the process of excluding or of being excluded) (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356389012460963">Fairclough, 2000</xref>). The state of exclusion is relational, in that it necessarily involves a comparison with others (the ‘included’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1356389012460963">Sen, 2000</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It is multi-faceted, incorporating differential levels of access to, participation in, and benefit from social, economic, cultural and political processes, states and opportunities. In complexity theory terms, this statement begins the process of setting boundaries – albeit broad ones – around the system under consideration.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It is dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356389012460963">Byrne, 2005</xref>), and in a sense ‘self-generating’. Elements of inclusion or exclusion in one realm (e.g. the economic realm) may generate inclusion or exclusion in other realms (e.g. the political realm).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1356389012460963">6</xref></sup> That is, different sub-systems interact. Further, small changes may produce random effects of unpredictable size in that or other parts of the system, reflecting the complexity theory principle of non-linearity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It is both socially and individually structured. It is socially structured in that some people are more ‘at risk’ of exclusion than others, as a direct consequence of their social, economic, and cultural positions. It is individually structured in that certain behaviours act as mechanisms generating inclusion or exclusion. Behaving in conformity with social norms generates inclusion within the group adhering to those norms. Behaviours outside of social norms (e.g. severe drug or alcohol abuse or criminal behaviours) tend to generate responses from both individuals and systems that operate to exclude the person exhibiting the behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356389012460963">Friedman et al., 2004</xref>: 179). In complexity theory terms, this latter is an example of the role of feedback in generating, sustaining or changing the next state or process.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It is ‘real’, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356389012460963">Bhaskar’s (1997 [1975])</xref> sense of having real impacts – that is, it may operate as a mechanism generating specific outcomes. It may, for example, operate as a psychological mechanism within individuals, generating responses that affect their behaviours and create changed outcomes. It may also operate as a social mechanism; affecting relations between groups or between individuals or groups and the society. In complexity theory terms, here we see mechanisms at one level of a system generating outcomes at another.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When operating through individuals, it manifests as expressions or behaviours of acceptance or rejection (this links to literature on social ostracism, see, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356389012460963">Baumeister et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356389012460963">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1356389012460963">Williams, 2001</xref>). When operating through systems and structures, it manifests as rules, policies, procedures, or laws that enable or inhibit access, participation, or benefit and that act as ‘local rules’ governing the interactions between members of systems.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It can operate both as a mechanism of social control and as a mechanism of empowerment. Inclusion empowers by providing access to resources and a psychological sense of wellbeing, and acts as a form of social control by reinforcing norms and rewards. Exclusion disempowers by reducing access to resources and generating a sense of rejection – and acts as a form of social control by removing or reducing power and influence. On a wide enough scale, processes of empowerment and disempowerment contribute to regeneration and/or system change.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Individuals may change their positions within systems without necessarily changing the structure of the system as a whole, but wide scale change in distributions of populations represents changes in the nature of the system as a whole. Changes in the system as a whole also influence the range of states that are available to be occupied by individuals and groups within that system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356389012460963">Byrne, 2005</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>These, then, are two of the four key theories represented in the theory map, described in complexity theory and realist terms. It is worth noting that each of the four theories deals with a different system or pair of systems. Attachment theory deals with individuals as complex systems in their own right and with parent-child dyad systems. Social judgements theory deals with inter-personal systems; social capital theory with social networks and community systems; social inclusion and exclusion with broad social, economic and political systems. However, those systems are nested within each other and the theories have been layered to address that nesting; and to examine processes of causation up and down the levels of the system.</p>

<title>Using complexity-consistent theory in evaluation research</title>
<p>This article has argued that complexity-consistent theories offer specific benefits for evaluation. These benefits included drawing boundaries around the system to be considered, identifying complexity-informed data and analysis requirements, identifying interactions within and between levels of systems, and improving the chances of causal attribution.</p>
<p>The previous section demonstrated that existing theories can be analysed in complexity- consistent terms and argued that they can be layered to reflect the causal interactions between different levels of systems. It is another thing entirely to demonstrate that such layered theory itself can be useful in the day-to-day world of evaluation. This will be the subject of a subsequent article, but it is perhaps worth noting, in brief, the uses to which the layered model described above was put (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1356389012460963">Westhorp, 2008</xref>).</p>
<list id="list4-1356389012460963" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>First, it formed the basis for a series of more detailed charts and theory maps. These provided the basis for developing an initial set of realist hypotheses about how early years programs may work differentially for different sub-groups and to explain the social structuring of outcomes – a question that is potentially important for many programs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Second, those hypotheses were used to inform data collection, suggesting items for participant questionnaires and interviews with participants and service providers. The theory framework was also used to inform a trial realist synthesis of previous research and evaluation literature, which in turn led to much more detailed hypotheses about the ways in which early intervention programs might generate both positive and negative outcomes for different sub-groups of participants. Such hypotheses have the potential to guide future investigations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Finally, the theory was both used in, and refined through, analysis of the quantitative and qualitative data arising through the evaluation. It provided a basis for interpreting empirical findings and for moving between findings from the empirical work and the literature synthesis. The overall findings have subsequently been used in advocacy for improved research into and evaluation of early intervention family support programs, both in Australia and overseas.</p></list-item>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Attributing program outcomes to programs is far from straightforward, particularly when the programs themselves, the systems in which programs are conducted, and the participants in programs need to be understood as complex adaptive systems. Theory of different types (philosophical, substantive theory, program theory and evaluation theory) can assist evaluators with the task in different ways. This article has argued that some substantive theories can be analysed in terms of key tenets of complexity theory; and that these kinds of theories are likely to be particularly useful in evaluations of complex systems.</p>
<p>The use of complexity-consistent theory may also generate changes in understanding. As Glouberman and Zimmerman note, ‘much learning is typically complex and non-linear’ (2004: 48), and one of the purposes of evaluation is to support learning. Just as a small change in a control parameter can lead to a ‘phase shift’ in a system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356389012460963">Byrne, 1998</xref>: 18), so a small breakthrough in understanding a program system might contribute to a phase shift in understanding the program overall. This might, for example, inform a small refinement to a program which, in true non-linear fashion, might produce markedly different outcomes. Perhaps similarly a small shift in understanding of the characteristics of theory in complex systems may also bear fruit for those engaged in their evaluation.</p>

<p>A note about the difference between the nature of the evidence and the nature of the analysis to which that evidence is subjected is in order. This information was drawn from a small-scale realist synthesis. Realist synthesis can draw on evidence from any research method, grounded in any research philosophy, and then use realist methods to analyse and synthesize it. Thus, the literature discussed here was not itself necessarily either realist or complexity informed (it often, for example, relies on correlations of variables). It is the analysis of that evidence – or here, more particularly, of the theories to which the evidence relates – that seeks to draw on the principles of complexity theory and realism.</p>
