<abstract>
<p>The first successful stage I palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) in a four-day-old female in the Philippines is reported, along with a discussion of the particular dynamics and challenges of performing this kind of surgery in a developing nation. Challenges met were not limited to the preoperative and perioperative period but involved the interstage period as well. In the face of such challenges, our experience, reported here, is the cause for cautious optimism.</p>

<title>Clinical Summary</title>
<p>A newborn female, prenatally diagnosed with HLHS, was born to a healthy 23-year-old primigravid woman at 39 weeks of gestation by vaginal delivery. Birth weight was 3,060 g. There were no known maternal comorbidities. Echocardiography performed on the first day of life confirmed the diagnosis of HLHS; specifically, the variant with mitral stenosis/aortic stenosis. Additional findings included small patent foramen ovale, large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and minimal antegrade flow through left-sided cardiac structures.</p>
<p>A management protocol for HLHS was instituted: close monitoring of vital signs and oxygen saturation and avoidance of maneuvers that may promote ductal constriction. Parenteral nutrition was instituted. Due to limited availability, prostaglandin was not administered. As such, close vigilance to monitor ductal patency was necessary. The plan was to perform a first stage palliative procedure as soon as pulmonary vascular resistance was deemed acceptably low. However, if there was a suggestion of impending ductal closure, then the patient would be taken immediately to the catheterization laboratory. It was further decided that a hybrid stage I palliation would be performed, as opposed to a conventional first stage Norwood procedure. The patient was able to maintain satisfactory respiration through the natural airway without ventilatory support prior to surgery.</p>
<p>On the fourth day of life, the hybrid palliative procedure was performed in the catheterization laboratory. The surgical approach was through a median sternotomy incision. The branch pulmonary arteries were individually banded to achieve final systemic oxygen saturation in the range of 75% to 85% and P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> at 40 to 50 mm Hg, while maintaining adequate systemic perfusion. A sheath was inserted into the main pulmonary artery and a 7 × 18 mm balloon expandable stent was deployed in the PDA. Due to the incomplete coverage of the entire length of the duct, a second 7 × 15 mm stent was deployed. Finally, balloon atrial septotomy was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135111424295">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and maintained on mechanical ventilatory support. Dopamine, milrinone, and nitroglycerin infusions were administered and red blood cell transfusion was administered as needed to maintain hematocrit in the range of 40% to 50%. Other than a period of oliguria on the second postoperative day (POD), the course was relatively uneventful. The endotracheal was removed on the fourth POD. On the tenth POD, the patient was discharged home. The parents had received detailed instruction regarding nutritional support, interstage surveillance, and home environment requirements.</p>
<p>Interstage care included weekly weight and oxygen saturation checks. Transthoracic echocardiogram was performed monthly. The patient remained stable and is maintained on aspirin, enalapril, and ranitidine. The recent echocardiogram shows good ventricular function, unobstructed flow across the atrial septum, restrictive bilateral pulmonary artery flow, and an unobstructed stented PDA. Preparations are now being made for the Comprehensive Stage II operation, which we plan to perform before the sixth month of life.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is characterized by the underdevelopment of the left heart structures, with atresia/stenosis of aortic and/or mitral orifices and arch hypoplasia, resulting in the obstruction of systemic cardiac output.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111424295">1</xref></sup> In Philippines, there have been multiple attempts at stage I palliation but with no previous survivors. This article reports the country’s first instance of survival and the first successful hybrid cardiac operation. We felt it would be useful to review the major challenges and to discuss some of the elements of our logistics and schemes of management.</p>
<p>Prostaglandin is not readily available in many developing countries. In our situation, prostaglandin was not administered. The PDA did begin to narrow by the fourth day of life but by that time surgery was already planned. A plan for close monitoring and immediate intervention is necessary because of this limitation. It is likely that the operation cannot be predictably delayed more than four to five days but that may be enough time to allow postnatal lowering of pulmonary vascular resistance. Other centers in the region with limited resources face similar issues. Making arrangements for the availability of prostaglandin should be prioritized as many lives may be saved in instances of ductal dependence of either systemic or pulmonary blood flow. Availability of prostaglandin would markedly reduce the need for emergent surgical intervention. The optimal scenario in our setting would be close monitoring with immediate prostaglandin infusion if there were signs of PDA closure. If this could be achieved, it would ensure the most judicious use of an important therapeutic tool with limited availability.</p>
<p>Regrettably, it is easier to procure supplies and equipment with adult applications (eg, stents) as compared to those that are mainly used in pediatrics. Also, because these drugs and supplies are not locally produced, importation adds another factor to cost. Nevertheless, striving to achieve the ideal setting is paramount to success and should be made the goal of every program wishing to develop a neonatal cardiac surgery program. Because of the initial efforts, now Philippines once again has a limited supply of prostaglandin.</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia, notably Thailand, Norwood stage I surgery has been performed with encouraging results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111424295">2</xref></sup> While our country is now already seeing marked improvements in the results of other neonatal cardiac operations, we have not been so fortunate in treating HLHS, until now. Limitations include lack of experience with neonatal cardiopulmonary bypass and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest; no extracorporeal life support program, limited availability of supplies/drugs, limited experience in peri-/postoperative care, and financial constraints. These challenges, however, are not insurmountable and as shown here success can be realized. We have adopted strategies aimed at increasing the chance of success. These include comprehensive discussions of anesthestic and postoperative care with the whole team including members with international training experience, review of the surgical technique by the lead surgeon and the assistant surgeons, and review of protocols utilized at institutions with successful neonatal cardiac surgery programs.</p>
<p>In our setting, the hybrid stage I procedure appears to be a practical choice for initial management of patients with HLHS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111424295">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111424295"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111424295">5</xref></sup>: deep hypothermia and cardiopulmonary bypass is altogether avoided, a relatively more stable postoperative course is anticipated, and the operating environment necessary for hybrid cardiac surgery is already available in our catheterization laboratory. Additionally, this allows us not to have to undergo the learning curve of both hypoplastic left heart syndrome and neonatal cardiopulmonary bypass at the same time.</p>
<p>Careful and precise selection of stents, sheaths, catheters, and surgical supplies is of paramount importance in our setting due to cost limitations. Patent ductus arteriosus measurements were performed preoperatively using transthoracic echocardiography and were again performed in the catheterization laboratory prior to stent deployment. Avoiding errors, which might inadvertently result in the selection of a suboptimal stent or sheath size, is important. Without cost control, it may prove unfeasible to perform such procedures in a large number of patients.</p>
<p>As in most developing countries, close follow-up may be challenging due to large distances between patients' homes and a clinic or hospital; as well as limited availability of a neonatal weight scale and oxygen saturation monitor. Despite these challenges, the home monitoring program protocols described by Ghanayem and associates were implemented as closely as possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111424295">6</xref></sup> Our policy is minimum weekly clinic visits. Families are instructed to observe carefully for signs of a problem, and we advise prompt hospital admission for evaluation of any suspicious episodes or findings.</p>
<p>We are aware of the fact that the anticipated second stage of reconstructive surgery, the Comprehensive Stage II operation, is a complex and challenging undertaking. Preparations for the Comprehensive Stage II operation include careful review of the surgical technique between the lead surgeon and the rest of the members of the team, adoption of cardiopulmonary bypass and hypothermia protocols from a large North American center where one of us (K.G.R.) got trained, and careful review of anesthetic and postoperative intensive care principles by all members of the team. While telemedicine and/or proctoring by internationally recognized and trained colleagues would be ideal, this may not be achievable due to cost limitations.</p>
<p>Previously discouraging results have made local cardiologists reluctant to adopt an aggressive approach to management of neonates with HLHS. A shift toward encouragement and enablement is in order. Furthermore, awareness and early detection of congenital heart defects must be emphasized in order to create an early and thorough plan of care.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In our setting, the hybrid stage I palliative procedure is a logical alternative to traditional Norwood or Sano operations for neonates with HLHS. Limited experience with cardiopulmonary bypass and circulatory arrest in neonates, coupled with high cost, has made achieving good outcomes difficult and unpredictable with traditional approaches. A strategy which reserves the complex operation for later in infancy may produce better early outcomes. This encouraging initial success can be emulated elsewhere. Several learning points are described, which may prove useful for cardiac centers in other developing nations where similar challenges are faced.</p>
