<abstract>
<p>The Family Management Style Framework (FMSF) was used as a conceptual basis for secondary data analysis of 55 previously conducted interviews with mothers and fathers of children with a lethal congenital condition from two surgical treatment eras. The directed content analysis was guided by a coding structure developed from family management dimensions identified in prior research of family response to childhood chronic conditions. Results indicated that application of the FMSF was helpful in differentiating families and their processes of family management at the onset of their infant’s illness through to surviving the first surgery and going home. The dimensions of Illness View and Child Identity were central to the parents’ capacity to manage their baby’s illness demands within their family context. Applying a robust family framework to a complex neonatal condition at illness onset provides compelling direction for clinical interventions and their rigorous evaluation.</p>

<p>With an increasing number of children surviving what were once life-limiting conditions and living with persistent health challenges, clinicians and researchers are focusing on delineating the relationship between child and parent outcomes within the family context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1074840711427143">Mah, Thannhauser, Kolski, &amp; Dewey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1074840711427143">Mussatto &amp; Tweddell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1074840711427143">Rempel, 2004</xref>). Family assessment frameworks and measures provide direction for nursing interventions to be implemented with and for families that contribute to the health of all family members including children with health challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1074840711427143">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The Family Management Style Framework (FMSF) was developed through a large study that identified family responses based on a noncategorical sample of children with chronic illness and/or disability (Knafl, Breitmayer, Gallo, &amp; Zoeller, 1992, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1074840711427143">1996</xref>). Integrative reviews of the literature on family response to childhood chronic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840711427143">Knafl &amp; Deatrick, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074840711427143">2003</xref>) also informed the development of the FMSF. This framework includes the broad concept of the views and response patterns of family members as the family manages a child’s chronic illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840711427143">Knafl, Deatrick, &amp; Gallo, 2008</xref>). This is in contrast to parenting, the work of raising a child, and parenting plus the extra work required to raise a child with a chronic illness or disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1074840711427143">Ray, 2002</xref>), which relate to the individual relationship between the parents and the child. The FMSF has provided direction for family management assessment strategies in clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074840711427143">Deatrick et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1074840711427143">Nelson, Deatrick, Knafl, Alderfer, &amp; Ogle, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840711427143">Ogle, 2006</xref>) and research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1074840711427143">Edwards-Beckett &amp; Cedargren, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074840711427143">Knafl &amp; Deatrick, 2003</xref>). Recent work has involved the development and use of a Family Management Measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1074840711427143">Knafl et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The FMSF consists of three major conceptual components; the family’s Definition of the Situation, their Management Behaviors related to their child’s illness, and their perceptions of the consequences of their child’s illness within the family (Perceived Consequences; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074840711427143">Knafl &amp; Deatrick, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840711427143">Knafl et al., 2008</xref>). Each of the conceptual components that include several underlying dimensions and family management styles reflects patterns of response based on configurations of how the dimensions are manifested in the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840711427143">Knafl et al., 2008</xref>). To date five family management styles have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1074840711427143">Knafl et al., 1996</xref>). Thriving families are characterized by a sense of normalcy and a facilitative belief that life goes on. Normalcy is also a hallmark of the Accommodating family management style but this type of family tends to view their situation more negatively than a Thriving family. Difficulty characterizes Enduring families who focus on the tremendous effort required to deal with the illness situation in their family. Parental conflict over how best to manage their child’s illness is present in Struggling families. Finally, confusion characterizes the Floundering families as they struggle to manage their child’s illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1074840711427143">Knafl et al., 1996</xref>). Family assessment to determine and understand management styles assists health care professionals to support, interact, and intervene with families coping with serious illness of one of its members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074840711427143">Deatrick et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1074840711427143">Wiegand, Deatrick, &amp; Knafl, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The FMSF was originally developed for childhood chronic illnesses including juvenile diabetes and end-stage renal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1074840711427143">Gallo, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1074840711427143">Obrecht, Gallo, &amp; Knafl, 1992</xref>). The FMSF has been used extensively over the past two decades in pediatric oncology where families are faced with their child’s life-threatening cancer and survivorship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074840711427143">Deatrick et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840711427143">Grey, Knafl, &amp; McCorkle, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840711427143">Ogle, 2006</xref>). Most recently, FMS research has focused on family management of genetic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1074840711427143">Knafl, Knafl, Gallo, &amp; Angst, 2007</xref>), a health care experience that is characterized by uncertainty and complex decision-making issues that influence family management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1074840711427143">Gallo, Hadley, Angst, Knafl, &amp; Smith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1074840711427143">Knafl et al., 2007</xref>). To our knowledge, application of the FMSF for families of children with life-threatening congenital conditions such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) has not occurred. This is despite its relevance to families whose trajectory begins with a diagnosis of a potentially lethal condition that, even when successfully treated, involves parents coming to terms with uncertain short- and long-term outcomes for their affected child.</p>
<p>Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) remains the leading cause of death in babies with congenital heart disease (CHD) during the first month of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074840711427143">Barron et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840711427143">Dhillon &amp; Redington, 2002</xref>). The diminutive left ventricle is incompatible with life and if left untreated, HLHS is usually fatal within the first days or weeks of life.</p>
<p>When a child is diagnosed with HLHS and parents decide to proceed with treatment, there are two life-saving treatments available. One option is neonatal heart transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074840711427143">Barron et al., 2009</xref>). Another option is surgical palliation, which involves three-staged surgeries, the first one being the Norwood or Sano operation performed within the first days or week of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1074840711427143">Andrews et al., 2001</xref>), the second stage, the Glenn operation, occurring at 3 to 6 months of age, and the third stage, the Fontan procedure performed at 3 to 5 years of age. This staged surgical approach is termed palliative rather than curative because even after these intricate and invasive procedures, the child still does not have a structurally normal heart.</p>
<p>Improved survival rates for surgically palliated HLHS have been demonstrated in many centers worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1074840711427143">Jacobs et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1074840711427143">Rasiah et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1074840711427143">Sano et al., 2004</xref>). A Canadian center reports on two consecutive surgical eras; the Norwood surgical approach was performed from 1996 to 2005, and the Sano approach from 2005 to present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1074840711427143">Atallah et al., 2008</xref>). The surgical approach in the Sano era resulted in increased 2-year survival rates to 81% from 48% in the Norwood era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1074840711427143">Atallah et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to apply the dimensions of the FMSF and a typology of Family Management Styles identified in a prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1074840711427143">Knafl et al., 1996</xref>) to a new family management context. Previously, the family response to a child’s chronic, noncategorical, non-life-threatening condition that was diagnosed for at least 1 year was studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1074840711427143">Knafl et al., 1996</xref>). We anticipated that further understanding of patterns of family management in the context of a categorical sample of newborns with newly diagnosed, life-threatening HLHS would provide direction for nursing interventions that fit each parent’s unique context and perceptions. In addition, the access to data from two surgical eras with different mortality outcomes provided an opportunity to explore the interplay of treatment approach and family management.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This research project, a secondary thematic content analysis of interview data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074840711427143">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1984</xref>), was undertaken within a program of qualitative research focused on delineating a theory of parenting young children with life-threatening CHD. The specific style of secondary analysis was analytic expansion in which the researchers used their own database to expand to a new level of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1074840711427143">Thorne, 1994</xref>) and to find answers to a research question that differed from the question asked in the original or primary study(ies) (Lobo, 1986; McArt &amp; McDougal, 1985). A major advantage of secondary analysis particularly pertinent to the study of parents of young children is the inherent sensitivity to respondent burden, as data can be maximally used without adding stress to participants’ lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1074840711427143">Szabo &amp; Strang, 1997</xref>).</p>

<p>Characteristic of the grounded theory approach is the capacity of this method to facilitate generation of data that demonstrate change over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1074840711427143">Richards &amp; Morse, 2007</xref>). We purposively sampled parents whose children with HLHS ranged from 6 months to 6 years of age to include families at different stages of the staged surgical trajectory. An early Norwood study interview with a parent whose baby was only 2 months old and still in hospital after the first surgery confirmed our intention to interview families after the second surgery. When asked about parenting, this mother stated that she did not yet feel like a parent. The intensity of caregiving between the first and second surgery was the other factor that prompted us to interview parents at later points in their experience.</p>
<p>To elicit meaningful reflections on the parents’ early experiences with their child with HLHS, each interview in both studies began with the question “Can you start by thinking back to when you first found out that [child’s name] might have something wrong with his or her heart? Tell me what that time was like for you.” The interviewer used probes to facilitate parent narration of the events following diagnosis including decision making regarding treatment, the surgery, hospitalization, and discharge home.</p>
<p>The interviews were conducted with each parent individually in person or over the phone. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim and pseudonyms were assigned. In the original studies, interviews were inductively analyzed and coded resulting in the delineation of parenting processes used in these two cohorts of mothers and fathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1074840711427143">Rempel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1074840711427143">Rempel &amp; Harrison, 2007</xref>).

<p>Characteristic of the deductive analytical approach, directed content analysis, the second author applied a predetermined coding structure consisting of the eight dimensions of the FMSF to code each interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074840711427143">Hsieh &amp; Shannon, 2005</xref>). Each node of coded data (e.g., all data coded as Illness View) was further analyzed by time period as coded in the original two studies. This cross-referencing of dimension by time period showed that family management was dynamic with distinct family management patterns characterizing three identified time periods—diagnosis to surgery, surgery to going home, and the period of time when they were settling into caring for their child at home following the first surgery. As the original studies focused on identifying processes of parenting, not family management, we did not have sufficient data to classify each participating family as to particular family management styles. As a composite of 24 families however, we demonstrated family management characteristics and changing patterns or family management styles over time for each of the two treatment cohorts.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>The process of family management that emerged in this study began with the diagnosis of the baby’s HLHS, included the baby’s survival of the first surgery, and continued until going home with baby. Each of these time periods was characterized by one family management style more than the others and differences between the early era (Norwood) and late era (Sano) cohorts were evident when particular dimensions of the family management styles were considered.</p>
<sec id="section6-1074840711427143">
<title>Diagnosis—Floundering Family Management Style: “What Does It All Mean?”</title>
<p>All parents in both the early treatment era and later treatment era cohorts displayed characteristics of floundering families at the time their child was diagnosed with HLHS. They were overwhelmed by their child’s diagnosis and confused about how to cope with the apparently ominous nature of their child’s illness. The uncertain nature of the condition in terms of the child’s survival contributed to parents’ confusion about their future and the best course of action. Parents grasped how serious the condition was and in many cases, the parents were given little hope. One mother’s recollection was as follows:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The gentleman said, “Your baby has a hypoplastic left heart” and the first thing that came to my mind was “How do you fix it?” And he just bluntly said “You know what? These kids die. They don’t live.” (Sano mother)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>All families were counseled as to the life-threatening nature of HLHS. In a conversation with a health care professional and through the use of models, posters, and at times even a simple diagram on a paper towel parents learned the condition of their infant’s heart. While this information was intended to assist parents to decide how to proceed with their child’s care, many remained overwhelmed by the situation and confused by what it meant for their child and for their family. “By the end of that I was in tears . . . the graveness of it . . . understanding what the left side of the heart does and if it hasn’t developed—we got a huge problem.” Parents described their efforts to consider the ominous diagnosis (Illness View) in relation to what surviving HLHS through neonatal heart transplantation or a three-staged surgical approach would mean for their child (Child Identity), their family (Family Focus and Future Expectations), and their capacity as parents to handle such a serious condition (Management Mindset). Considering life-saving treatment options alongside the option of pregnancy termination in the cases of antenatal diagnosis or compassionate care after the birth of the baby involved thoughtful consideration of their beliefs and values including those that would guide their eventual management of a complex health condition within their family (Parenting Philosophy). One father of a postnatally diagnosed child explained the treatment choices in a blunt fashion: “So you’re waiting for a heart for that [heart transplantation option] and then there’s also the three procedures or let her die.” (Norwood father)</p>
<p>At the time of diagnosis, parents in both the early and later treatment era cohorts viewed their child as deserving a “chance for life” despite the lethal nature of the cardiac malformation. Family beliefs and values guided the parent choices as to whether to proceed with life-saving surgery for their child, versus the choices of abortion or compassionate care. Characteristics of Struggling and Enduring family management styles were evident in their accounts of clarifying their values.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>He said, “We do recommend termination of the pregnancy . . . you’d be fully supported by the health region.” He mentioned that about three or four times and we had finally piped up and said that we were Catholic and that was not going to be an option. (Sano mother)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Further evidence of a shift away from floundering were the data that reflected parents’ shared beliefs regarding treatment options (Parent Mutuality). One mother, expecting twins, one with HLHS that was diagnosed antenatally, described how she and her husband moved toward choosing the staged surgical approach:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We knew right off the bat that we’d opt for surgery . . . I talked with my husband and neither of us . . . could even come to terms with the idea of selective reduction or just simply letting her pass away after birth because I think we thought that would be just so much harder for us. (Norwood mother)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sorting out the ease or difficulty of HLHS in relation to their child’s future life dominated the parents’ minds as they set out to make a treatment decision on behalf of the child. Most of the focus at this stage was on saving the baby and then addressing how to implement this decision within the family context (Family Focus).</p>
<p>Following the decision to proceed with surgery, uncertainty concerning their baby’s survival and outcomes had a pervasive influence on the parents’ Illness View and perception of their Child’s Identity. Parents of the Norwood cohort were especially focused on the child’s illness and the chances that their child would not survive. For example, one mother initially did not prepare anything for her baby at home saying, “We didn’t set up our nursery or anything. We said we’ll set it up if we bring him home.”</p>
<p>While the Norwood parents prepared themselves to mourn the loss of a child, Sano parents recognized that their child would likely survive but with challenging health impairments. Consequently, the Sano parents’ view of their child was shaped by their mourning the loss of a healthy child. Parents often described their shift from expecting a normal child and to accepting the reality of having a child with HLHS.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Because we found out before he was born, I think we got to a point where we were prepared and we accepted it before he was born—knowing that he was going to need the extra care. I mean we never had any doubt that he was going to need extra attention. Or that he wouldn’t be like a normal baby. (Sano mother)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A mother of an antenatally diagnosed child explained the emotional process she underwent as she and her husband prepared for the birth of their child:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I think we grieved the loss of a healthy child in July and August and from then on it was, you know, nope, we’re going to have a baby. What do we need to do to prepare? What do we need to do to get ready for this and to make the best of it? (Sano mother)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Following the baby’s birth, or following a postnatal diagnosis of HLHS, in both cohorts, an ominous Illness View was inevitable as they observed their seemingly healthy baby undergo aggressive intervention including mechanical ventilation to ensure the critically ill baby’s survival until treatment decisions were made and enacted. When parents chose to proceed with the three-stage procedure, they were faced with the sobering Illness View that their child “could die” when undergoing the first surgery. However, while Norwood families were trying to determine if there was a chance for survival, Sano families chose surgery with confidence that it was the chance for survival. Having jointly decided to proceed with surgery, patterns of response were less in line with a Floundering FMS and more reflective of an Enduring or Accommodating FMS. Parents in both cohorts shifted from an ominous view of HLHS to a hopeful view of their child’s identity of a survivor “so far” although not within the same time period.</p>

<title>First Surgery—Enduring/Accommodating Family Management Style: “We Still Didn’t Know If He Was Going to Live or Not”</title>
<p>Characteristics of the family management styles of Enduring and Accommodating best illuminated the similarities and differences between the early and late treatment era parent cohorts in this study. Enduring families necessarily focus on the tremendous effort required to deal with their child’s situation. The overriding theme of immense difficulty was evident in all of the parents’ (Norwood and Sano) accounts of proceeding with lifesaving surgery for their hospitalized, critically ill baby. Many were a long distance from home and other family members including their young children. They put the rest of their lives on hold, including work, home, and family responsibilities while constantly considering the possible outcomes for their baby, themselves as parents and for their family as a whole. Illness View, however, differentiated the Norwood parents from the Sano parents. As parents moved from the stage of diagnosis onto the initial surgery, while the Sano parents were aware of the risks associated with the surgery, they recounted situations and thoughts that contributed to a more positive outlook than the Norwood parents.</p>
<p>For the majority of the Norwood parents at this stage the Illness View and consequently the Management Mindset was that of preparing for the “worst-case scenario” because “at that point we still didn’t know if he was going to live or not” and “my family was beginning to prepare for a funeral rather than her simply going in for surgery.” To manage their baby’s illness situation, the Norwood parents in the Enduring Style entered into conversations about “What if she dies? Do we donate her organs? Where is she going to get buried?” This father went on to say “You don’t want to even talk about it. But I don’t know, I just feel like I have to be prepared in case, in the event that does happen.” Accounts of infant baptisms were provided by over half of the parent participants with parents recalling that they had their baby “baptized with the whole family” present in the hospital. While hospital staff made efforts to prepare parents for the time following surgery in the pediatric intensive care unit, one parent remembered thinking, “Why are you taking me here?” as she was convinced that her child was “not ever coming here.”</p>
<p>In contrast to the Norwood parents’ perception or view that the first surgery and potential for death were closely related, the Sano parents related not doing the surgery with the death of their baby: “You do the surgery or your kid doesn’t live, right?” In this way the Sano families had a more “normal” view—that lifesaving surgery would indeed save their child’s life and thus were perhaps more Accommodating in their family management style as in this style families view their situation as potentially more normal, despite difficulty. Sano parents understood the seriousness of the surgery and their child’s condition but “believed that everything was going to be okay and I trusted the people that were . . . doing the surgery” and thus were intent to “hope for the best.”</p>
<p>In addition to Illness View, the dimension of Child Identity helped reveal what was at issue for these parents whose baby’s survival was in jeopardy. Norwood and Sano parents alike were hesitant at this stage to become attached to their child related to uncertain future expectations regarding survival and prognosis. A simple yet poignant statement by one mother was as follows: “Actually I was scared to get attached to her.” One father described his thought process:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I guess in the back of my mind, I felt that, if she was going to die, then probably the sooner the better because I just knew with time we’d get more and more attached to her. (Norwood father)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even after their baby survived the first surgery, parents remained guarded against becoming attached to their child whose long recovery in the hospital deterred parents from taking on their role as parents. With nurses taking care of almost all the child’s needs, one mother described her feelings that the child was not hers to parent:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We’re still taking shifts and we still don’t get to do a lot of her daily care and she hasn’t been awake and aware long enough yet for us to get to know her enough. (Norwood mother)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While Norwood parents leaned toward not getting attached to their child in an effort to protect themselves, Sano parents focused on overcoming the barriers they faced in getting to know their child and embracing their parenting role.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>She was kept very low stimulation . . . a little blind on her eyes and plugs in her ears and we were trying to [touch her]. Some of the nurses were discouraging it but I just did what I wanted to do. It’s hard enough not being able to hold your baby. (Sano mother)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Amidst of all the medical equipment and sounds a Sano father recalled seeing his infant son after surgery:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>You can still hear the machine with the bips from his heartbeat. He made it out okay. His tree [IV pole] was full of meds and we didn’t even notice that stuff ’cause we were just more concerned that he’s still there, he’s still operational, he’s still going . . . to be around him again was probably the best part and it didn’t really matter about the other stuff. (Sano father)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Regarding the dimension of Family Focus, parents within both Norwood and Sano groups who had other children, while extremely focused on their sick baby, made conscious decisions that affected siblings. Some parents described being able to “only focus on one child” and since a child “has no place in the hospital” decided to leave the sibling with “gramma and grampa,” “the neighbors,” or parents “took turns” with each child. Conversely, other parents described the siblings coming to the hospital “a lot” and “keeping herself busy” with the child life specialist.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1074840711427143">
<title>Going Home With Baby—Enduring/ Accommodating/Thriving Family Management Style: “We Feel Like We’re Professionals”</title>
<p>In all families except two, parents were able to take their baby home for a period of time between the first and second surgeries. One baby in the Norwood cohort and one baby in the Sano cohort remained in hospital until after the second surgery was completed. From the time of diagnosis through the first surgery and recovery in hospital, parents were repeatedly reminded of the seriousness of their child’s illness, and yet were expected to unquestioningly take their baby home with strict monitoring, feeding, and medication instructions and schedules. Going home with their baby with HLHS propelled parents into a demanding caregiving realm (Management Approach) as they were required to provide specialized nursing care and monitoring to safeguard their child’s survival. Norwood parents devised ways to ensure they knew what their baby’s weight and oxygenation saturation was on at least a weekly basis. Sano parents were provided with medical equipment to assess these parameters on a daily basis: “We had a scale because they wanted us to keep track of his weight to make sure that he was gaining at least thirty to fifty grams a day and we had an oximeter” (Sano mother).</p>
<p>At this stage, there was more variation in both cohorts with regard to management style, with differences more determined by individual family circumstances. In both cohorts, mothers’ and fathers’ accounts of providing care for their baby during the initial period of being at home resonated with a Thriving management style. Their positive view of “life goes on” was fueled by their baby’s identity as a survivor. Parents were grateful that “she is still with us” and repeatedly expressed how “delighted” they were with their baby, and how thrilled they were to be back together as a family. When focused only on the child’s identity as a survivor, parents projected confidence and optimism despite all that they had been through as a family: “It’s really stressful, but you try to downplay that, so that life is normal. I think that’s a part of raising them to be healthy, even with the issues that they have.” (Sano mother)</p>
<p>There was however an undertone of acknowledgment that their child’s condition was profoundly affecting family life, which reflected more of an Accommodating or Enduring family management style but seemed to be difficult to articulate given their incalculable gratitude that their child had survived a potentially lethal neonatal congenital condition. As parents spoke about their uncertainty related to their child’s development and life expectancy, it was evident that negative aspects of Illness View/Child Identity related to Future Expectations and Management Mindset were difficult for them to address openly. It seemed as if they desired or perhaps even felt obligated to project a Thriving management style but provided data that situated their families in other management styles as well. Several factors influenced the change or shift in management style. There was evidence of parents’ growing confidence managing their baby’s care regimen and changing perceptions of their child’s survival, child complications, and potential. For example, a Sano mother stated,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It was a little scary at first. I checked him numerous times a day. I felt very comfortable ’cause I had all the equipment I needed at home and the more he stayed at home, the more we got to know him. . . . Being home is different ’cause you don’t have a nurse that you can just run to. . . I kind of became his nurse while I’m his mom and actually got more comfortable [as each] week went by. (Sano mother)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One point of differentiation between the Norwood and Sano parents at this stage of going home with baby was their perceptions of their child. Parents of children in the Norwood cohort described their child as being happy, healthy, and heroic even. “He’s smiley, for all he’s gone through, he’s usually a good baby . . . he’s very happy and healthy. We just think he’s our six million dollar baby.” The baby’s identity as a survivor was prominent and thus situated Norwood families more in the Accommodating FMS. While Sano parents similarly focused on their child being happy and healthy, they also described their child as “normal” and thus tended toward the Thriving FMS as reflected in the following reflection: “It’s almost to the point of being hard to believe that she’s sick ’cause she’s so good and her recoveries have been so good and her health seems so good. She really does seem a normal baby.” While Sano parents highlighted the normalcy of their child, they also alluded to their watchfulness for their child’s development. Parents in this cohort, more than in the Norwood cohort, were aware of the likelihood of their child experiencing developmental delays and were alert for signs.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>She’s kind of hitting the normal milestones when she should hit them and she doesn’t seem to have any major developmental delays. This is something we’re watching for but she seems to be good so far. (Sano mother)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, although parents were elated that their child had survived the first surgery and was home with the family, thoughts about the future (Future Expectations) remained in the back of their minds. “We don’t know if she’s going to be here for ten years, five years, a day, or till she’s 100.” For some families, these thoughts spurred them to seek the positive aspects of the unknown. “So you learn to take one day at a time with her and enjoy all the little quirks that she does.”</p>
<p>Parents in both cohorts described learning quickly and feeling like professionals in their child’s specific care. Despite the demands on them as parents, they consistently provided a positive spin on their all-consuming caregiving responsibilities as illustrated by this mother who had a health care background:</p>

<p>You just feel like you have a job. I mean your job is very important, even as just a parent of a normal healthy child but it’s not as stressful. You don’t have to worry about did they get their medicine? Are they going to be okay today? Are they going to stop breathing and turn blue? . . . I’ve got to worry about this NG [nasogastric] tube. Is he going to throw it up today? Is he going to pull it out today? You just have more concerns and we’re very fortunate. [Baby with HLHS] is a very easy baby to look after most days. He’s just really laid back but I don’t feel like I’ve been on maternity leave. I feel like I have never left my job from what I did before. (Sano mother)</p>

<p>The parents’ positive Management Approach was especially striking considering the repeated accounts of parents making judgments and decisions that had a crucial influence on their child’s health, even survival. This mother’s expert management approach was critical to his care.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We took him to the hospital and I said “We need some help.” I gave them the history. The nurse has the nerve to say to me “Well what are we supposed to do with him?” . . . I talked to the doctor. “He needs an IV and he needs to be airlifted back to [city of tertiary pediatric centre]. He’s sick.” I’ve never seen somebody struggle so much for air in my life. (Sano mother)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The degree to which parents had shared beliefs about their situation and approach to condition management (Parental Mutuality) also influenced family management at this time. Parents were aware of the added strain on their spousal/partner relationship: “I can totally see how some couples could end, unfortunately fifty percent of people nowadays don’t last and they have normal children.” Parents relayed accounts of working together to provide the required care for their child during the initial period of being at home and thus outside the safety of the hospital. Most accounts of caregiving involved the pronoun “we” as reflected here:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The first couple weeks, getting her medications ready ’cause it was all new to me. [My wife] showed me how to do everything. . . . It was pretty straightforward. We got everything on charts and when to give her everything and what times so we just follow the chart. (Norwood father)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another father acknowledged “the ups and downs” he and his wife had experienced and that having a sick child “might be harder on the relationship” and emphasized the importance of being on the same page (Parent Mutuality) right from the time of decision making regarding treatment choices: “If you both agree that you want to keep the baby and you know, if you have the same goals in general, I don’t think it’s that hard on the relationship.”</p>
<p>Families thrived as parents jointly developed routines and schedules and successfully incorporated HLHS into their family life while endeavoring to establish a family focus beyond their sick baby. The gravity of their accomplishments, however, did not elude them. Parents recounted vivid feelings when they talked about their caregiving responsibilities, their sense of being on their own, and their fears about the next surgery. Before leaving hospital one mother anticipated the challenges:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In the back of our minds we’re all a little afraid . . . just because we’re three hours from [large city] and leaving the security of here is going to be a really big step. Up until now we’ve always known that if we leave at night or if anything ever happens, that she’s in the best place possible. And bringing her home, we’re all a little afraid of anything that could happen. (Norwood mother)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Once home this same mom described the emotional tension:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I guess it was a big sigh of relief but it was extremely scary. For months we were on our own to do things. It was extremely scary and especially going to a rural community and leaving the comforts of where people know. (Norwood mother)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even as parents settled into caregiving routines, many parents described their dread in relation to the future surgeries their child would undergo, as exemplified by this father, saying, “It’s going to be so hard to go back into the hospital . . . to deal with that all again. It’s going to be like a flashback I guess.” (Sano father)</p>
<p>Although parents were realistic about the challenges that lay ahead of their child with HLHS and their family, their ability to remain positive was evident as many parents compared their situation to the situation of other families. “I think we’re really lucky because some of the other families have the feeding tubes, and the huge physical or cognitive delays that can happen.” (Norwood mother)</p>
<p>Parents in this study, regardless of the surgical era in which their baby received lifesaving treatment for their lethal cardiac condition, faced similar family management issues related to the juxtaposed realities of miraculous survival and profound persistent uncertainty concerning ongoing survival and quality of survival. Despite these challenges, parents’ account of their experiences with their infant from diagnosis to going home after the first surgery in the neonatal period provided evidence of positive movement from a Floundering to an Accommodating and even Thriving family management style, a process that was primarily influenced by the FMSF concept of Illness View and Child Identity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to determine the utility of family management dimensions in delineating similar and different family management processes in parent accounts of the diagnosis of and lifesaving treatment for their infant’s lethal congenital condition. Our specific goals were to compare parent data from two treatment eras through the lens of family management while determining the potential practice and research implications of the FMSF in families at the outset of their child’s life-threatening illness. The FMSF has been effectively applied and used to direct assessment and intervention in families whose member has a chronic pediatric health condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1074840711427143">Deatrick &amp; Knafl, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1074840711427143">Gallo, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840711427143">Knafl &amp; Deatrick, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074840711427143">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1074840711427143">Knafl et al., 1996</xref>) and/or life-threatening pediatric and adult condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074840711427143">Deatrick et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1074840711427143">Obrecht et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840711427143">Ogle, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1074840711427143">Wiegand et al., 2008</xref>). This study adds to the FMSF body of knowledge by extending its application to families who are navigating a life-threatening neonatal illness that requires immediate lifesaving treatment if the baby is to survive. Thus the goal of directed content analysis to validate or extend a theoretical framework or theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074840711427143">Hsieh &amp; Shannon, 2005</xref>) was realized.</p>
<p>The key finding of this study was that parents demonstrated an intense, dynamic, and transforming process of family management from the diagnosis stage through to the baby surviving the first of three surgeries and going home. The parents whose babies were treated in the era that had improved survival rates had a more positive view of their child’s illness and therefore showed more thriving family characteristics than the parents whose babies were in the early treatment era.</p>
<p>Theory to guide clinical practice developed within our research program to date has focused on processes of parenting. Our grounded theory studies have provided a theoretical basis from which to develop parent-focused interventions for implementation in clinical settings. A parenting process of safeguarding precarious survival of their child, themselves as care providers, and their couple relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1074840711427143">Rempel &amp; Harrison, 2007</xref>) has alerted health care providers that parents’ focus on survival may keep them from safeguarding their child’s development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1074840711427143">Rempel et al., 2009</xref>) that has the potential to significantly influence the child’s quality of survival. However, application of the FMSF through secondary analysis of our data has been instrumental in extending our understanding of family processes beyond parenting.</p>
<p>The processes of family management, as identified in this study through the application of FMSF and styles identified through a prior study of family management of childhood chronic conditions, have provided the basis for modeling processes to inform the development, implementation, and evaluation of interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1074840711427143">Craig et al., 2008</xref>). Not only does the robust family management theory distinguish Thriving families from Accommodating, Enduring, Struggling, and Floundering families at one point in time but also it demonstrates change in family management style over time with evolving contexts, treatments, and illness trajectories. In addition, family management processes that incorporate parents’ perceptions of their child, their child’s illness, their ability to manage their child’s illness within the context of the family, and the degree to which parents have shared views about their child’s situation and condition management provide numerous foci for a clinical assessment interview and subsequent intervention. For example, when parents find out about HLHS during pregnancy or soon after birth, health professionals play a key role in supporting parents as they make treatment decisions. An in-depth understanding of parents’ view of HLHS can inform intervention. The ease or difficulty of managing the condition and the implications of the condition on the child’s and family’s future all affect family decision making regarding treatment. Assisting parents to reflect on how their values influence their individual and joint perceptions of each treatment option at each stage of their child’s treatment will influence family management of HLHS. Providing a family-level intervention that addresses how to manage situations when family members develop divergent views of managing the child’s condition (Management Mindset) benefits the child, parents, and family unit. If parents do not agree on the initial treatment option, they are at risk for manifesting a Struggling management style as they encounter inevitable HLHS-related setbacks and complications. Moreover, administration of the Family Management Measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1074840711427143">Knafl et al., 2011</xref>), which is based on the FMSF, can expedite the assessment process and provide a means for evaluating response to intervention for clinical and research purposes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, comparison of the two surgical treatment eras has provided insight as to how parental knowledge and perception of the child’s illness and related identity can influence other dimensions of family management and the family management style. A parent and family’s illness view can indicate the degree to which the child’s illness dominates the family landscape. Necessarily, families with a baby with a life-threatening illness initially are completely absorbed in their ill child to the exclusion of their other children, and family, home, and work responsibilities. The Norwood parents had profound uncertainty about their child’s future survival and yet also had immense joy at their child’s current survival and perceived normalcy. Sano parents grieved the loss of a normal child and focused on the potential for developmental challenges. For both cohorts, the FMSF assisted in exploring the interactional nature of the dimensions of family management and indicates the vital importance of providing cognitive, behavioral, and affective interventions at the family level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1074840711427143">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>), not only at the parent level. Most research concerning the influence of serious congenital conditions within families focuses on child and/or parent outcomes. Less often is a family functioning measure the primary predictor or outcome variable. Based on the FMSF, the Family Management Measure (FaMM) was developed to assess key aspects of family management and, when used in conjunction with the statistical technique of cluster analysis, can be used to identify patterns of family management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1074840711427143">Knafl et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, the FMSF concepts and their interplay when applied to the data were vital to teasing out the tensions in the parents’ view of their child’s HLHS. Parents vacillated between celebrating their child’s survival and acknowledging the profound effect their child’s illness had on their family life. Persistent uncertainty had parents bracing themselves for what could go wrong next, including the death of their child. The destabilizing effect of prolonged uncertainty has been studied in families dealing with life-threatening conditions. In research with families dealing with neurodegenerative life-threatening illness, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1074840711427143">Steele (2000)</xref> determined that an overall family goal was to maintain periods of stability. Similarly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1074840711427143">O’Brien’s (2001)</xref> research with technology-dependent children being cared for at home emphasized the need to attain stability within unpredictable situation. The FMSF could assist in defining how this stability presents and where the threats to stability originate. Our findings raise the possibility that parents are motivated to focus on the positive aspects of their child’s survival and thus project thriving family management characteristics as a stabilizing influence on themselves and their family. Health care professionals can determine the role that positive parent perspectives play in their family management processes. They can then intervene and be sensitive to their cues regarding the timing and delivery of information about projected outcomes for HLHS, for example, that may be negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1074840711427143">Morse, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>A final point for discussion relates to the fact that there was minimal evidence of the Struggling management style in the data provided by either the Norwood or Sano parents. Caring for a child with complex medical needs represents a tremendous challenge for parents as individuals, as spouses, and as family members. Parents in Struggling families experience conflict over how best to manage their situation and it is possible that the life-threatening nature of HLHS contributed to parents maintaining a unified focus throughout the child’s diagnosis, initial surgery, and going home. The influence of Parent Mutuality on family management style may also account for the limited evidence of struggling families in this study. Perhaps the presence of a life-threatening condition forced parents to work together, at least for the short term. Potential study limitations also offer explanation.</p>
<p>There may also be another “face” of enduring in which the extreme difficulty associated with critical illness management is partially counterbalanced by a sense of optimism that their child will survive and positively influence their family life. This extended conceptualization situates the “new-face-of-enduring” FMS somewhere between Enduring and Struggling. We offer the term <italic>Safeguarding</italic> based on our previous research that indicates that parents fully appreciate the life-threatening nature of their child’s potentially lethal condition and yet manage to positively appraise their situation and provide the complex care their child requires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1074840711427143">Lee &amp; Rempel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1074840711427143">Rempel &amp; Harrison, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1074840711427143">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Conducting secondary analysis precludes any opportunity to focus the data collection on the new research question. Concerning the lack of evidence regarding Struggling families, is it possible that interview questions and prompts in the original study did not elicit responses that would highlight conflict parents were experiencing. This study was also limited by being unable to return to participants at subsequent interviews with further, more specific questions. As with any study where participation is voluntary, the sample is self-selected with the potential result, for example, that Struggling families do not respond to calls for research participants. This sample only included families whose children were undergoing and had survived the initial surgical approach to treating HLHS. Families who chose pregnancy termination or compassionate care were not part of our study population as this study was based out of a referral center for HLHS surgery. Families whose babies had died during the neonatal period also were not included in this study.</p>
<p>Regarding our application of the typology of family management styles, we did not use the typology to identify styles of FM over time for each individual family. The FMS has generally been applied to individual families. Our research therefore extends application of the typology of FM styles to characterize cohorts of families.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1074840711427143">
<title>Implications for Further Research</title>
<p>The next step within our research program regarding family management of HLHS is to administer the FaMM to samples of parents whose children are at different stages of their treatment for life-threatening CHD (i.e., infancy/toddler, preschool, and school age) to determine variability. Our goal is to determine the potential of the FaMM to delineate a range of family management. Application of the dimensions of family management that demonstrate changes in family management over time indicates that it would be an appropriate measure of intervention effectiveness. Employing a mixed methods design, we plan to administer the FaMM during the first phase of the research and then theoretically sample parents for participation in the qualitative portion of the study based on their FaMM scores, ensuring a maximally diverse sample.</p>
<p>Our study has revealed the potential utility of the FMSF and a prior typology of family management styles in research and clinical practice. Application in pediatric oncology has revealed that family management styles change over time and are dependent on the phase of diagnosis and treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840711427143">Ogle, 2006</xref>). Assessing families at different stages of their family member’s illness trajectory from diagnosis to going home and beyond will help pinpoint areas where families are potentially Floundering, Struggling, and Enduring and require intervention to optimize child, parent, and family outcomes.</p>
