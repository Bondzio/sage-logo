<abstract>
<p>Major shifts in gender roles were among the transformations that came to American Indian cultures with colonialism and American domination. Although a great number of scholars have explored these changes, explanations have typically been sought in mimetic performances of Western gender relationships among native communities and hegemonic restructuring of attitudes by outside agents. Material objects, however, were perhaps as powerful as human agents in driving these ideological shifts because they are capable of representing layers of cultural values even when actors are absent. By examining material objects as active social actors during focused social interactions, this article describes one of the many avenues by which new Euro-American attitudes were slowly introduced to the rhythms of Pawnee life.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The extremely rich ethnographic record of North America is often used as a source for models of prehistoric Native American life. Recognizing that European colonialism radically transformed the conditions of social life, archaeologists must reconcile the ethnographic record with both archaeology and oral traditions. Much research deals with the effects of colonialism on Native American life, and scholars have described substantial mechanisms involved in the transformations of the colonial period that facilitated such changes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359183512473559">Kehoe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359183512473559">Scheper-Hughes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359183512473559">Wishart, 1995</xref>). Many native communities adopted new corporate identities and social structures mimicking those of the Western nations with whom they were interacting, either as a strategy for negotiating new power structures or in compliance with the demands of Euro-American governments (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359183512473559">Foster, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359183512473559">Fowler, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359183512473559">2002</xref>). This article examines the semiotic capacity of ceramic artifacts as one mechanism that facilitated these changes within the context of early historic Pawnee society. In particular, it examines the traditional role of ceramic vessels in facilitating female participation in politics and the impact on female social status as a result of technological changes.</p>
<p>Although it is tempting to explain social transformation simply in terms of influences from economically and militarily dominant cultures, such massive ideological shifts do not become standardized immediately or without input from all cultures involved. Instead, such changes enter a recursive relationship with the existing culture and must be facilitated by internal mechanisms and cultural logic. A transformed culture emerges as the product of repeated practice and iterations of daily activities engaging with these post-contact structures. Over time, gradual changes compound to produce substantial transformation (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359183512473559">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359183512473559">Hudson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359183512473559">Voss, 2008</xref>). This is why the impact of European colonization was unique in each indigenous context, because local interpretations of colonial actions and materials combined with the actions themselves to produce unique historical trajectories. Therefore, it is useful to understand the mechanics of this process, and particularly the role of enduring material objects such as those that constitute the data sets of archaeological investigations.</p>
<p>Even simple transformations in the material culture repertoire of a society can have profound effects on fundamental ideas because material objects – particularly their indexical properties representing relationships between groups of individuals – are active agents in social interactions. Understanding the role of objects in facilitating broad social transformations adds a practical layer of depth to archaeological theories of social change.</p>
<p>Keeping these critiques in mind, I use an example from the US Central Plains to work toward a more complete picture of changes to native gender roles during the colonial period. By investigating the social semiotics of material culture and the practical impacts of material changes consequent to European contact, I demonstrate a specific mechanism by which fundamental ideas about gender roles were reshaped in a cultural context, ultimately facilitating the sort of broad-scale change that has been described elsewhere.</p>

<title>Gender and power on the Plains</title>
<p>Anthropologists interested in issues of gender and gender roles have made several attempts to correct biases in their traditional understandings of native society. Historic descriptions of gender relations in Native America, particularly on the Great Plains, often paint a picture of significant inequality, with men dominating social life and women toiling away as domestic drudges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359183512473559">Duke, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359183512473559">Weist, 1980</xref>). As bison hides became valuable in trade with Euro-American men, Plains Indian women increasingly became occupied with production of hides as commodities while men assumed roles as traders and managers of wealth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359183512473559">Duke, 1996</xref>). This introduction of a capitalist model to traditional family structures undoubtedly had an impact (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359183512473559">Duke, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359183512473559">Klein, 1983</xref>), but there is some disagreement as to the exact nature of that impact. Other anthropologists argue that Western understandings of power that assume inequality should be exchanged for models of gender complementarity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359183512473559">Ackerman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359183512473559">Sharp, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Others have argued that the appearance of male dominance is a misinterpretation based on observer bias among the predominantly male journalists recording native traditions from the perspective of their male-dominated cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359183512473559">Kehoe, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359183512473559">Weist, 1980</xref>: 256–257; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359183512473559">Wishart, 1995</xref>). In addition to the potential partiality of reporters, other scholars (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359183512473559">Friedl, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359183512473559">Jacobs, 1995</xref>) note that the contexts under examination may also introduce bias, i.e. that searching for status exclusively in the public performance of major rituals blinds us to important arenas of power negotiations that happen off-stage. As intriguing as they are, these explanations of historic era gender transformations still tend to privilege economic processes and Western capitalism almost entirely for changing local indigenous systems.</p>
<p>Turning to commodity economy as the source for Plains gender inequality raises the question of how it could have changed the social logic of gender relations so quickly and so radically. A more nuanced view can be seen in Loretta Fowler’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359183512473559">1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359183512473559">2002</xref>) analyses of Arapahoe and Cheyenne politics. Fowler moves away from traditional narratives that cast native communities in passive roles, receiving Western social norms and quickly capitulating to new standards. She suggests, rather, that the Arapahoe, Cheyenne and other groups maintained traditional standards of interaction and social performance to adapt to a changing world on their own terms, often going further to exert power in relationships with the dominant government (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359183512473559">Foster, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359183512473559">Voss, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Even accepting these nuances, we are left with a historic record in which there are apparent contradictions between ideals and practices. At least some of these contradictions accurately reflect ongoing transformations in patterns of interaction. Other factors, such as the material elements of interaction, should also be considered to understand the fine mechanics of social transformation.</p>
<p>The early historic organization of the Pawnee tribe in particular presents an apparent contradiction. Pawnee was traditionally a matrilineal and matrilocal society in which women owned much of the means of economic production as well as a good portion of the ritual means of production, including rights to magic, sacred bundles and other sacra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359183512473559">Blaine, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359183512473559">Hyde, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359183512473559">O’Shea, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359183512473559">Weltfish, 1977</xref>). The earliest white travelers to the Central Plains, however, noted that only Pawnee men participated in the political realm by giving oratory, hosting banquets, smoking pipes and maneuvering through the flexible but very real status hierarchy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359183512473559">Dunbar and Allis, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359183512473559">Jensen, 2010</xref>). How do we reconcile the apparent structural position of women in this society with the apparent lack of direct access to the political economy reported by these early white travelers?</p>
<p>To be clear, this interpretation of women as lacking access to political power stems from their physical absence in formal venues of politicking during the early historic period. That requirement for physical presence is often taken for granted but seldom interrogated. One of the central arguments in this article, that physical presence is not necessary for agency in social arenas, calls that interpretation into question (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359183512473559">Weist, 1980</xref>). In the absence of physical presence, however, some other avenue for female agency is still needed.</p>
<p>Similar questions about contradictions in apparent versus actual power have been raised elsewhere by authors such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359183512473559">Friedl (1967)</xref> who argued that domestic space and female influence on familial political and economic power are equally important as male performance in Greece. Regarding Plains women, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359183512473559">Weist (1980</xref>: 261) comments that ‘although women appear to have had little direct influence in public spheres, their opinions and goals might still have been known and acted on.’ Both of these studies highlight the need to look for the locus of power outside of a single individual involved in public performance.</p>

<title>Pawnee social organization</title>
<p>The historic Pawnee tribe was less a tribe in the conventional sense than a regional integration of very large semi-autonomous villages, nested in a set of overlapping social units. Before being removed to Oklahoma, Pawnee people lived in large earth lodges in which three to four families constituted a household that was the basic political and economic unit of village life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359183512473559">Hyde, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359183512473559">Weltfish, 1977</xref>). The vast majority of Pawnee archaeology represents excavations of such village settings. The majority of Pawnee life, however, was spent away from the village, opening up serious questions about the completeness of our current, archaeologically informed models. Pawnee life followed an annual cycle that included two periods of long-distance bison hunting during which the social organization of the tribe was altered dramatically.</p>
<p>This time away from the village was structured around the much-storied Great Plains long-distance bison hunting expeditions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359183512473559">Holder, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359183512473559">Weltfish, 1977</xref>). Unlike many other Plains tribes, the Pawnee village remained together while on the hunt, traveling as a mobile village making temporary camps of up to 3000 people in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359183512473559">Hyde, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359183512473559">Weltfish, 1977</xref>). This mass of people (representing all demographics of age, status and health) as well as their dogs, no doubt presented some major logistical and social problems. It also created extreme dynamism in the spatial construction of Pawnee life. Each stop presented new potentials for interacting with the landscape; each new campsite restricted and enabled different types of organization; each new camp was set up freshly, allowing for subtle reinvention of the relationships between people in both physical and social terms. Indeed, the fundamental organization of Pawnee society, the household, was quite different during hunts than in the villages from which we have gathered almost all of the data we use to understand the society.</p>
<p>Although the entire village remained together during the hunt, the large earth lodge households broke down into nuclear family groups, each with its own tipi and each operating as an independent social, political and economic unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359183512473559">Weltfish, 1977</xref>). Historic accounts of hunting parties suggest that this was a critical time in the political and ritual cycle, as nuclear families politicked heavily and negotiated the social hierarchies of their communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359183512473559">Blaine, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359183512473559">Weltfish, 1977</xref>). In other words, geographic, residential and social mobility seem to have shared a season and worked together in a mimetic relationship of mutual construction.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this hunting phase of the Pawnee annual cycle is almost entirely absent from our current archaeological record. Intriguingly, Donna Roper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359183512473559">1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359183512473559">1994</xref>) has identified two Lower Loup (protohistoric Pawnee) sites in Nebraska as hunting camps. In her analyses of the collections, Roper noted that the ceramic assemblages are unique in comparison with known collections from village contexts.</p>
<p>One of the biggest surprises in Roper’s analysis was an observation that the ceramics disposed at these apparent hunting camps were thinner-walled and showed a higher incidence of decoration than those associated with contemporaneous villages. Roper has suggested that the increased decoration reflects an attempt to symbol ownership in order to facilitate identification amid the potential chaos of traveling by dog travois. Another explanation for this may lie in the role of those ceramics in the unique social context of the hunting camp. In particular, the symbolizing of ownership that Roper suggests may be significant to the banqueting context where, by virtue of indexicality, the vessels, and particularly the decorative elements on them, bring women into the context of politics and social interaction.</p>

<title>Ritual cycle of the hunt</title>
<p>As alluded to above, hunting camps were scenes of much social jockeying, and the important political activities that took place there went far beyond killing and butchering bison. When hunters began returning to the camps with bison meat, status-conscious families sponsored banquets for important men from throughout the hunting party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359183512473559">Weltfish, 1977</xref>: 190–195). Women prepared large quantities of food according to traditional standards (e.g. the first bison meat of a season should be eaten raw), and attendees followed elaborate routines of etiquette and speech performance. Weltfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359183512473559">1977</xref>: 194) notes that the wife of the hosting household sometimes attended the banquet and that she could be addressed in speeches to the sponsoring men or to the deities. There were, however, never any other women present, and the host’s wife did not offer speeches or prayers herself.</p>
<p>Viewed in terms of public performance alone, this was almost a purely male activity. The banquet was clearly an important arena for family status negotiation, but where were the women’s voices? If women really held positions of significant socio-political stature in early Pawnee society, then either the historic accounts are incomplete or they reference a period in which major transformations had begun to change this. Undoubtedly, both of these are responsible for the apparent discrepancy to some extent. Although discovering missing information from the early reservation period would be an excellent way to consider this question, for now it is simpler to reconsider the archaeological and ethnographic data sets that are known. In particular, the hunting sites that Roper has identified provide us with a largely untapped data set. Because of the historic link between ceramic production and female activity, Roper’s observations on the distinctiveness of ceramics from hunting contexts provide a way to consider the relationship between technological change and social transformation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1359183512473559">
<title>Gender and technology</title>
<p>Archaeologists interested in gender and performative power have generally approached such questions by focusing on agents immediately involved in politicking and social maneuvering. Analyses have sought to understand the various actions that are taken by these actors in arenas such as ritual, group hunting or decision making where structures of social power are in the foreground and available for negotiating. To expand this understanding of agency beyond the immediate performative context and bring in less obvious players, Marcia-Anne <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359183512473559">Dobres (1999)</xref> explores the limitations of ‘technology’ as commonly defined. She focuses on technology in hunting as an example of an arena that is often considered to be exclusively male because of the limited anthropological gaze that privileges the acts of stalking and killing within the rubric of ‘hunting’.</p>
<p>Similar to anthropologists seeking to identify loci of power outside of these public performances (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359183512473559">Ackerman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359183512473559">Friedl, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359183512473559">Jacobs 1995</xref>), Dobres suggests that the significant acts in hunting are not just the killing and quartering of animals, but the processes involved in transforming the wild (quarry) into the cultural (food). Since women are commonly the processors of meat and the performers of significant hunting magic, this implicates them to a much greater degree in hunting practices. Feminine hunting magic can be as necessary to a successful hunt as a well-fletched and fired arrow, and in many traditional contexts a hunter might no sooner set off on the chase without adequate ritual preparations than he would without a quiver.</p>
<p>Under this framework, the technology of the Pawnee hunt discussed above includes much more than simply tracking, killing and processing bison. Dobres’s concept of technology would encompass the distribution of meat and its use in banqueting, the tasks of women maintaining tipi camps, the formation and dissolution of alliances throughout the hunting season, the planning of future hunts and coinciding rituals, and even the ‘gearing up’ done in the permanent village prior to departure. Following this approach to technology, archaeologists must consider many more classes of material culture to be involved in the technology of hunting than has been common. In particular for the Pawnee case analyzed below, this perspective draws ceramic technology, generally considered a feminine and domestic craft with only incidental connection to hunting, squarely within the domain of hunting technology.</p>
<p>Thus, through embedded technology, Pawnee women are identified as players in the hunt, performing necessary and significant tasks. This focus on performance, however, still limits female participation to the moments when they are carrying out these activities. In other words, this perspective expands the performance of the hunt to include a partially feminine phase within the village, but it still leaves the period during which the people are away from the village as an almost exclusively male period in the hunting process. Women are certainly still involved in butchering and other maintenance tasks during the traveling phase of the hunt, but they are not involved in many of the other important events that take place on the hunt.</p>
<p>Notably, women’s influence remains absent during the performative parts of status questing in Pawnee banquets and their role maintains a custodial quality. Through an examination of the materiality of their performance, however, it is possible to identify an important enduring presence of women in nearly every aspect of the Pawnee hunt, including the banquet. A focus on material culture allows the Pawnee annual cycle to be understood as a process in which both men and women negotiate power structures in various ways throughout the entire year.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1359183512473559">
<title>Limitations and semiotics</title>
<p>As Dobres expands our view of technology along axes of time and space, Charles Sanders Peirce offers us ways to expand our views of participation on another axis. Peircean semiotic theory focuses on the active role of signs in the social world, and archaeologists have recently begun to apply this body of theory broadly (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359183512473559">Knappett, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359183512473559">Miller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359183512473559">Preucel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359183512473559">Preucel and Bauer, 2001</xref>). In this perspective, a sign can be nearly anything that carries social meaning, from a speech act to the register in which it is spoken to the ritual significance of tobacco that is smoked. Most importantly for archaeologists, material objects are important sign vehicles, and the material accoutrements of a ritual performance can be seen as potentially active participants. Preucel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359183512473559">2010</xref>: 89) notes that ‘signs function not simply to represent social reality, but also to create it and effect changes in that reality.’ This then allows us to expand our perspective on politicking to include enduring material culture and technological performance by searching for social agency beyond the humans physically present.</p>
<p>Peircean semiotic theory also allows for a very complex understanding of individual signs or sign vehicles. Since each sign operates at multiple levels simultaneously, and indeterminacy is inherent in signs due to their differential interpretation by people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359183512473559">Peirce, 1997</xref>: 1.171), they are actively negotiated and renegotiated in social action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359183512473559">Peirce, 1997</xref>: 2.272–273, 2.411). The physical parts of social life then provide myriad avenues for human influence in politicking without the prerequisite of physical presence (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359183512473559">Appadurai, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359183512473559">Keane, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359183512473559">Knappett, 2005</xref>). Indexicality in particular allows material objects to carry people who are not present into social action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359183512473559">Keane, 1997</xref>: 142), and thus anthropologists may ask questions about agency that have no immediately apparent answers from the performative perspective alone.</p>
<p>Indexical, or second order, signs gain meaning by referencing what Peirce calls a ‘natural relationship’ between referents, such that a cloud <italic>means</italic> rain and vultures <italic>mean</italic> death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359183512473559">Peirce, 1997</xref>: 4.531). Similarly, when signs reference people, indexicality allows material objects to invoke people with whom they share a natural relation but who may not be physically present at the moment of interaction. In this way, a weapon invokes a hunter, shoes a shoemaker and a crest a king, even when none of these people is physically present. This invocation can also vary in its specificity; for example, shoes imply some shoemaker, a royal crest or presidential seal calls up a particular position of authority, and an artist’s signature signals individuality and authenticity. Thus, through indexicality, objects may enter the social field as replacements or proxies for people, groups of people, or, more commonly, for particular characteristics of people (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359183512473559">Strathern, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Keane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359183512473559">1997</xref>: 78–81) argues that gender is particularly well indexed through its existential relationship with certain types of objects that are associated with gendered activities in local contexts, such as the association of hoes with femininity or bows with masculinity in historic Plains Indian cultures. Normative models of social posturing have typically privileged individuals who are co-present and interacting directly, but this approach allows us to identify the agency of women and other parties not physically present or in the center of focus. By coupling such indexical gender references with Dobres’s expanded view of technology, this model can bring many more actors into apparently simple acts such as hunting and banqueting.</p>

<p>Some semiotic anthropologists have also found the work of Irving Goffman (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359183512473559">1973</xref>) useful in understanding broader social implications of particularly intense interactions. Webb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359183512473559">Keane (1997)</xref> focuses on sociality in the psychic realm and takes a perspective that includes language, material objects and other representations as signs that work together to constitute a social arena. This holistic approach to social maneuvering is especially beneficial to archaeologists and others interested in material culture because it rejects the separation of physical and linguistic signs from performance, which is also viewed as a system of discursively interacting signs. Rather, all of these forms of signs are seen as working in concert with the actions of people to create and recreate sociality.</p>
<p>The recognition of so many active non-human elements at play in social maneuvering is important because it situates a given interaction within a much broader world of implied human actors. It also brings a richness of nuance and significance to each particular event that can dramatically change its meaning compared to otherwise similar events. In particular, material and linguistic signs constitute a culturally and historically relevant universe of social meaning that is contingent on local traditions and individual histories. In other words, the context in which social action takes place is particular to the action that is happening. Each actor’s unique understanding of the situation also draws on her or his particular experiences; this is after all the source of the sign’s characteristic indeterminacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359183512473559">Peirce, 1997</xref>: 1.171). Thus, the scene of interaction is understood differently by each actor in terms of her or his own ambitions and pasts in articulation with social forces outside themselves. This overcomes shortcomings that have been identified in Goffman’s own theories of interaction such as atemporality, staticness and universality of interpretation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359183512473559">Goffman, 1973</xref>). It also begins to answer the question of why similar colonial processes led to such different ends, even in geographically close communities.</p>
<p>Like Goffman’s ‘focused interaction’, Keane centers much of his discussion on ‘scenes of encounter’, or formalized social interactions where two or more parties perform defined roles to negotiate social organization by manipulating signs such as language, objects and performance itself. Following Goffman, these scenes of encounter are viewed as arenas where social ties are identified and maintained. Keane’s view, however, is significantly more dynamic than Goffman’s because it recognizes that relationships are discursive and therefore ‘always in the process of shifting, growing, or diminishing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359183512473559">Keane, 1997</xref>: 142).</p>
<p>Due to the inherent indeterminacy of the sign, the physical properties of objects involved in social transactions are significant to the outcomes of those transactions. Each hoe represents an archetypal hoe, but the idiosyncrasies of each instance of hoe allow it to present a unique constellation of sign values. Further, the sign only gains meaning through individual interpretation, and thus individual life experiences add another dimension of potential meanings in each instance. This broad universe of potential meanings is not infinite, as cultural conventions and physical realities constrain the sign. Physical properties therefore both symbolically load the object and also limit the object’s pragmatic possibilities during performance (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359183512473559">Brown, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359183512473559">Schieffelin, 1998</xref>). This perspective allows the material world to be understood as a very active participant in scenes of encounter because it acknowledges that the material world has agency in directing social interaction, but it is also restricted by historic and cultural patterns of understanding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1359183512473559">
<title>Agency and risk</title>
<p>A key element in Keane’s scenes of encounter is the formal separation of voice and agency at work in allowing sign objects to represent human actors and also in allowing human actors to act as signs representing other individuals or groups of people. The individuals participating directly in a scene of encounter are not necessarily the only, or even the most important, ones involved in the interaction. The immediate participants often constitute something of a voice representing other non-present parties who share agency in decision-making and authority. The modern example that Keane offers to illustrate this point is the separation between press secretary as voice and presidential cabinet as agency in the American political arena. Although the president is seldom present for press briefings, the press secretary is understood to represent his voice and stand as a direct proxy. This is accomplished through the secretary’s ‘existential relationship’ with the president, and the secretary can be understood as a second order, or indexical, sign. Indexicality thus overcomes Goffman’s requirement of co-presence for effectiveness in social action and also allows the location of agency at the group level.</p>
<p>This focus on indexicality as a tool for separating voice and agency frees us from the restrictions of performative theories that require co-presence of human agents. Through etiquette and other local pragmatic requirements of social interaction, social norms contribute to interaction as much as individual will does. The separation of voice and agency through sign vehicles also implicates material culture much more heavily in interaction than many performance theories, and therefore makes them much more useful for archaeologists.</p>
<p>The forms of political action described as scenes of encounter in this perspective ‘permit principals to remain offstage but implicitly and authoritatively present’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359183512473559">Keane, 1997</xref>: 142), thus expanding the spatial and temporal significance of interaction. Beyond this, though, ‘they implicate the participants in a scale of action beyond that of everyday sociability, involving an agency that transcends that of individual persons.’ Through performance of complementary roles, parties display recognition of the other’s agency as well as the agency of those not physically present. This recognition validates the historical and cultural continuity of knowledge and mores that are agentive itself insofar as all participants are obliged to respect them. In other words, social action is backgrounded by an implicit threat of sanction driving regimentation of interaction. All social roles are open for negotiation in these interactions, and the perspective developed here suggests that indexically present actors, of which gender groups are common types, are especially in play.</p>
<p>All of this opportunity for negotiation and innovation offered by indeterminacy comes along with a correlate risk of failure. The performance of social roles in this type of interaction requires people to take for granted historical and cultural knowledge about the proper structuring of performances. This knowledge includes the proper roles of performers and memories of the outcomes of previous performances. One product of successful performance is the reinforcement and naturalization of these givens, but as practice events this relies on many factors, including shared understandings about the knowledge that is assumed to be shared. Slippage in notions of propriety or disagreements about the significance of historic events open up avenues for unexpected or socially destructive outcomes of focused interaction.</p>
<p>Failure to meet a desired social goal through interaction is also a possibility that springs from the active role of the material world. Because of the indeterminacy of the sign, every interlocutor will have a slightly different understanding of a given performance, particularly the material parts of it. Thus, significant material parts of interactions can potentially be misinterpreted or have unintended impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359183512473559">Schieffelin, 1998</xref>). Failure in a scene of encounter has the immediate effect of calling into question exactly the elements of the system that were taken for granted by calling attention to them as a point of disagreement, so it can result in significant reorganizations of prior relationships and patterns of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359183512473559">Brown, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359183512473559">Keane, 1997</xref>: 143–144).</p>
<p>This imbues moments of risk-laden interactions with metapragmatic opportunity – failure opens up the possibilities for transforming the value, meaning and form of given interactions or elements of them (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359183512473559">Preucel, 2010</xref>: 64). Key among the elements of interaction that are imbued with risk in social interaction are the relative structural positions of interlocutors. The roles of individuals or groups implicated in social action through indexical elements of material culture are particularly prone to slippage or disagreement due to their physical distance. This possibility for failure to create novelty is the most significant divergence of Keane’s perspective from Goffman’s static ‘situated activity scenarios’ in that it breaks free of the constraints of static universality.</p>

<title>Pawnee banqueting as scene of encounter</title>
<p>The approach described above acknowledges the power of the material world to bring physically distant people into social interaction. By doing so it provides an enlightening frame for understanding the material culture of Pawnee hunting camps. The process of traveling and hunting can still be seen as a long, focused technology in which several smaller and overlapping interactions are embedded and which provides arenas for social group identification, maintenance and social jockeying (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359183512473559">Dobres, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359183512473559">Foster, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359183512473559">Goffman, 1973</xref>). Through this lens, however, we focus more closely on the material world in which these social actions take place, and particularly on the representational practices involved there.</p>
<p>The banquets that ambitious Pawnee families held were formalized scenes of encounter involving social exchange between individuals representing nuclear family-level political units. Sometimes these scenes of encounter involved exchange between larger socio-political groupings such as villages, divisions and bands. Other abstract groups and notions such as gender roles and family politics were also implicated in the pragmatic background, even if these were not directly spoken. With social relations and organizing principles in play, the scene of a banquet was one in which these broader notions as well as local social alliances could be both confirmed and challenged. Due to the primacy of the material world in this kind of negotiation, the vicissitudes of history, performance and the material world all affected the outcomes. Complications in any one of those areas could call into question the integrity of the entire performance and thus the relations of the various communities implicated in participation. Among the many possible outcomes for a Pawnee banquet were shifts in individual and family status, but also larger structural conditions, such as the role of banqueting in the status system itself and the affirmation of gender roles.</p>
<p>This characterization relies on information from the historic period, but it likely describes the dynamics of Pawnee hunting banquets during the protohistoric and late prehistoric periods (prior to 1850) If we must include an earliest date, I would say 1500 would be early enough. as well. Unfortunately, very little is known about Pawnee hunting before the historic period (after 1850). Although these sites were previously thought to be quite uncommon and difficult to identify, particularly from periods before the introduction of the horse, Donna <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359183512473559">Roper’s (1994)</xref> investigations demonstrate that these sites are not only identifiable, but they can be quite substantial. Her report on the site recorded as 24LP8 also identifies discrete activity areas at the site. Taken with the fact that traditional Pawnee hunting territory was in areas that are still largely undeveloped, it is entirely possible that detailed investigations of hunting camps and a focus on banqueting activity may be possible in the future. As discussed above, Roper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359183512473559">1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359183512473559">1994</xref>) has suggested that existing collections may in fact represent hunting camps.</p>
<p>Her finding that ceramics from these possible hunting camps tend to be somewhat thinner and more frequently decorated than those from contemporary village contexts, while preliminary, is quite intriguing. It suggests, first, that ceramics taken on the hunt were different, at least quantitatively, than those used in the sedentary villages. In other words, the particular vessels taken on hunting trips were specifically created as part of the gear for hunting and their construction in the gearing-up phase should be considered part of the extended technology of hunting (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359183512473559">Dobres, 1999</xref>). In particular, extra attention paid to the construction and decoration of vessels might imply that they served an important role in some sort of interactions that took place during the hunt. Through the mechanisms described in previous sections, this could serve as a means for implicating women in scenes of political encounter. Following that, the successful negotiation of a Pawnee banquet would traditionally have served to reify and maintain the role of women in Pawnee social life among a wide range of other social negotiations that took place. If this model of politicking in prehistoric and protohistoric Pawnee hunting banquets is accurate even in the broadest outline, it provides implications for historical transformations of technology and their significance for social transformations.</p>

<sec id="section10-1359183512473559">
<title>Historical transformations</title>
<p>Along with the many changes to Pawnee life that came with European and American contact was the introduction of metal implements replacing traditional tools. Perhaps most visibly, rifles and steel knives and hoes replaced bows and tools of stone or bone. Also with the colonial period came metal kettles to replace the cooking and serving vessels that had been central to ritual banqueting in Pawnee communities. The semiotic loading of an iron or brass kettle was surely different from that of a locally produced clay pot. Among the significant differences would be the durability that may have made metal replacements so attractive. These new kettles remained the same enduring tool, at least physically, from context to context rather than alternating form between village and hunting wares, as clay pots apparently had.</p>
<p>In addition to being monotonized, these standardized vessels of exotic manufacture restricted the avenues through which female agency could be invoked in banquets. Visible female production became limited to the contents of the pot rather than the vessel itself, and the visual presentation at the center of the banquet’s scene of encounter was largely a reflection of the efforts of an unknown factory somewhere in white America or beyond. This meant that indexical sign vehicles transporting the agency of women as a group or as individuals into banquets were greatly reduced and likely became less frequently understood. Even if there was no intention to signal new messages about social organization, participants would have had fewer opportunities to receive messages that had traditionally served to maintain a central role of women in politicking.</p>
<p>Following any practice or iterative approach to culture, such changes in the meaning of standard practices are only significant in their cumulative effects on larger belief sets underlying culture – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359183512473559">Giddens’s (1984)</xref> structuring structures. Thus, if this new reality for the transmission of messages through serving vessels in banqueting contexts can be seen as a sort of semiotic failure in the scene of encounter at the center of a banquet, then we can also understand it as an opportunity for substantial cultural innovation. As this pattern of banqueting focused around kettles with little feminine loading repeated itself and became the norm in the early historic period, the coincident cultural innovation included a reconception of the role of women in this central arena of Pawnee social maneuvering. Thus, the same technological experience (<italic>sensu</italic> Dobres) of preparing and executing a ritual banquet excluded a major source of input for women. Altered material conditions necessarily changed the outcome of every subsequent scene of encounter influenced by them, and as the iterations compounded the new normal shifted political influence toward male actors.</p>
<p>If the scene of encounter in traditional Pawnee life is to be seen as an arena for the family and other groups to negotiate status with the risk of failure, this new historic-era scene of encounter was one in which the playing field had been tilted away from women. By removing a vehicle for their participation in the scene of encounter, the potential for failure of women in asserting influence at these moments was ratcheted up to a virtual certainty. Thus, in the context of sweeping changes throughout Pawnee society, banqueting had become a scene of exclusion and transformed into a truly male-dominated activity. Over many iterations of this scene where men continued to negotiate family and individual status within the larger tribe and women’s ability to do the same through the semiotic loading of their wares was thwarted, the social logic of Pawnee gender and family organization was reworked to more closely match that of mainstream American culture. Similar processes were occurring simultaneously throughout Pawnee culture, all ultimately driven by the colonial encounter.</p>
<p>Over a generational span, this was one of many local processes that had the global effect of forging a new cultural logic of gender relations, bringing them to the point where this article began and where studies of Pawnee society often begin – the early reservation period when women were located in the role of passive supporter for the legitimate node of masculine power in the family.</p>

<ack><p>I would like to thank many people who have helped develop the ideas in this paper and who have critiqued various versions of it. The editors at the <italic>Journal of Material Culture</italic> have been very helpful and patient, and the two reviewers moved this paper forward by light years through their constructive comments. Donna Roper cannot receive enough thanks for her endless efforts to help me understand Plains ethnography and to direct me to useful resources as well as taking time to help me understand her work. Likewise Nancy and Jerry Carlson have been wonderful friends and colleagues as I try to understand the complex ethnohistory of the Pawnee people. Carla Sinopoli, Kenny Sims, Liz Bridges, Daphne Gallagher and Sudha Shah helped to develop the ideas and critiqued the very first draft. Lars Fogellin and Sev Fowles listened to my ramblings and guided me back on track when I veered too far. John Thiels, Frank Cody, Laura Brown and Bruce Mannheim were indispensible in introducing me to semiotics and pragmatics and in discussing the many ways that linguistic and archaeological anthropologies coincide. Zoe Crossland, Robert Preucel and Alex Bauer helped out when these ideas were first presented publicly and they offered very helpful insights. My new colleagues Celia Emmelhainz, Darya Bukhtoyorova and Ulan Bigozhin have offered yet another final perspective as I worked through the reviewers’ comments. And finally I could never express enough gratitude to Christina Pugh who has read every draft of this paper, listened to every thought on this topic and patiently worked to clarify my sometimes opaque writing style. Of course, any and all errors are solely attributable to me.</p></ack>
