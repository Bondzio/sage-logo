<p>Breastfeeding, especially exclusive breastfeeding, is central to achieving the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goal 4 for child survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412446690">1</xref></sup> The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) is a World Health Organization/United Nations Children’s Fund (WHO/UNICEF) global program that was launched in 1991 and revised and updated in 2006. Its goal is to ensure the best start in life for all infants by making maternity wards protect, promote, and support breastfeeding. It recognizes that the practices around birth and early life have a major impact on establishing breastfeeding and thus improving child health and survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334412446690">2</xref></sup> Protecting, promoting, and supporting infant and young child feeding is essential for the healthy growth and development of children.</p>
<sec id="section1-0890334412446690">
<title>The WHO/UNICEF Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412446690">3</xref></sup></title>
<p>The Strategy was developed in 2002. It is a guide for action and provides the overarching framework of actions that are necessary to protect, promote, and support infant and young child feeding. It identifies interventions with a proven impact and explicitly defines the obligations and responsibilities of governments, international organizations, and other concerned parties.</p>
<p>The Global Strategy defines 9 operational targets and core activities that governments and partners should implement in order to ensure adequate feeding, nutrition, health, and development outcomes of children worldwide. The targets build on each other and should be taken as a whole to make a positive and visible difference in the area of infant and young child feeding.</p>
<p>The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) is 1 of the 9 operational targets of the Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding. It calls for concerted action to make all hospitals (private and public) with maternity wards apply the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding on which the BFHI is based. The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative has also been 1 of the targets put out by the Innocenti Declaration on the protection, promotion, and support of breastfeeding.</p>
<p>The operational targets among the 9 mentioned above referring to BFHI are:</p>

<list-item><p>Strengthening community-based support for infant and young child feeding</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Step 10 of the BFHI Ten Steps is “Foster the establishment of mother support group and refer mothers to them.” It is the step at which efforts move beyond the hospital doors and out to the community. Families and communities are indispensable resources in the support of infant and young child feeding. Evidence has shown that mother-to-mother support groups, lay or peer counselors, and community-based workers can be very effective in helping mothers to initiate breastfeeding; exclusively breastfeed for 6 months (180 days), after which adequate, appropriate, and safe complementary food needs to be introduced; and sustain breastfeeding up to 2 years or beyond. Building their capacity should therefore be an essential element of efforts to improve infant and young child feeding. It is a direct response to achieving Step 10 of the BFHI.</p>
<p>In January 2011 <italic>The US Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Support Breastfeeding</italic> was a milestone and drew attention to the importance of removing the barriers that prevent women from reaching their breastfeeding goals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334412446690">4</xref></sup> <italic>The Call to Action</italic> served as an important voice to encourage all participants in the US health care system to promote breastfeeding. Time was right for all relevant partners to come together to seize the opportunity to assist health care providers in facilitating breastfeeding. The BFHI was underscored as a valuable and important resource for the Surgeon General and the US Department of Health and Human Services’ efforts.</p>

<sec id="section2-0890334412446690">
<title>Progress</title>
<p>Since the WHO/UNICEF BFHI was launched in 1991, more than 22 000 hospitals in 157 countries have been designated as Baby-Friendly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334412446690">5</xref></sup> Designation occurs through an external certification process that assesses the degree to which a hospital has achieved 10 measurable criteria, The Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding. Most countries have breastfeeding or infant and young child feeding authorities or BFHI coordinating groups and have assessed hospitals and designated at least 1 facility as Baby-Friendly.</p>
<p>The BFHI has led to increased rates of exclusive breastfeeding, which are reflected in improved health and survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334412446690">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334412446690">7</xref></sup> The BFHI has had great impact on breastfeeding practices among both healthy and sick infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334412446690">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334412446690">9</xref></sup> A recent systematic review of the evidence by Renfrew et al found that BFHI with its skin-to-skin contact, peer support, simultaneous breast milk pumping, multidisciplinary staff training, and Baby-Friendly accreditation of the associated maternity hospital are all effective in promoting breastfeeding or feeding with breast milk for infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334412446690">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Based on increasing evidence and progress, the Initiative was streamlined according to the experience of the countries, and materials were revised. The new package announced in 2009 consolidated all WHO and UNICEF materials into 1 package, reflected new research and experience, revisited the criteria used for the BFHI in light of HIV/AIDS, introduced a revised list for the “Acceptable medical reasons for use of breast-milk substitutes,” reinforced the International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes, provided modules for mother-friendly care, and gave more guidance for monitoring and reassessment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0890334412446690">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334412446690">11</xref></sup></p>

<title>What Have We Learned?</title>
<p>The BFHI’s overarching goal was to increase breastfeeding rates. The Ten Steps originally cited in the Joint Statement on maternity services are a series of best practice standards aimed at describing a standard of care in which commonly found practices harmful to breastfeeding are replaced with evidence-based practices proven to increase breastfeeding outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0890334412446690">12</xref></sup>Twenty years after the launch of the Initiative, we have gained some insight and can reflect on issues enabling us to accelerate the BFHI implementation and sustain progress. These issues can be summarized as follows:</p>
<list id="list3-0890334412446690" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Breastfeeding saves lives, which is especially important is the neonatal period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334412446690">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0890334412446690">14</xref></sup> Breast milk is vital during the neonatal period with short- and long-term health benefits, yet not all health workers are aware of these facts; rates of breast milk feeding in neonatal units are still very low with wrong practices as separation of mothers and infants and inadequate training of staff.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334412446690">15</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ensuring early and effective breastfeeding can have long-term effects on breastfeeding duration and can have an impact on health, such as obesity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative is one way to ensure the recommended and crucial practice of exclusive breastfeeding.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative benefits and health outcomes are applicable worldwide, and positive impact is seen in different settings.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative has workable and achievable targets.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Countries need to adhere to the “Global Criteria” and not minimize or soften the criteria.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative works best when it is fully endorsed and supported by the national authorities and operates under its auspices.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative policy needs to be adapted to the setting and hospital itself. Adding HIV, for example, when it is prevalent, is crucial. If a pediatric floor is attached to or affiliated with the maternity hospital, adding steps to cover this area of service would be important.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative is most sustainable when continuously monitored by facilities themselves. Identifying “slippage” or gaps when they occur and working to correct the non-adherence to the BFHI Global Criteria in a timely manner is a key element for sustainability. The use of the BFHI Monitoring Tool, which is included in the BFHI package (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0890334412446690">Figure 1</xref>), itself proved to be very helpful in monitoring and sustaining progress.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative is most successful when regarded as part of continuum of care within hospitals and clinics and is built as part of the hospital accreditation system.</p></list-item>

<sec id="section4-0890334412446690">
<title>The Way Forward</title>
<p>The above mentioned facts enable health workers and policy makers working in this area to highlight steps to steadily move forward. The proposed actions might need to be adapted to national levels, depending on the status of the BFHI commitment and progress in the country. These proposed actions are in line with WHO’s urgent request to member states to put BFHI high on their health agenda. It urges countries “to strengthen and expedite the sustainable implementation of the global strategy for infant and young child feeding, including emphasis on giving effect to the aim and principles of the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes, and the implementation of the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334412446690">16</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section5-0890334412446690">
<title>Some Action Steps</title>
<list id="list4-0890334412446690" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Sustain progress made, and ensure that BFHI is adhering to “Global Criteria” without any slippage or dilution of the steps. Ensure that all countries are fully informed and aware of the revised BFHI package and materials.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Emphasize the importance of antenatal education, and inform mothers of all information needed before hospital admission, as hospital stays are becoming shorter and shorter, sometimes averaging 6 hours.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Target private hospitals in addition to the public ones, as experience has shown that they are more reluctant and hesitant to change practices.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Continue to ensure that the International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes is fully implemented within Baby-Friendly Hospitals and raise awareness among administrators and staff about the role they have to play in abiding by the Code.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Build BFHI within the hospital accreditation authorities to ensure continuity and standard of care.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Continue to document successes and share data and research results of BFHI effect and health impacts.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Encourage formation of networks between BFHI coordinators (as the BFHI coordinators’ network for industrialized countries), as it has proven to be an effective forum to share successes as well as discuss constraints and how to solve them.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Bring as many partners on board as possible, including policy makers, decision makers, national NGOs working in this area, pediatric and OB/GYN associations, dietetic associations, and of course, nurses and midwifery groups. Lactation consultant groups have a special role to play here, as they can play a pivotal role antenatally and post-hospital discharge.</p></list-item></list>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>The BFHI provides a framework for addressing the major factors that have contributed to the erosion of breastfeeding, that is, maternity care practices that interfere with breastfeeding. Until practices improve, attempts to promote breastfeeding outside the health service will be impeded. Although inappropriate maternity care cannot be held solely responsible for low exclusive breastfeeding rates and short breastfeeding duration, appropriate care may be a prerequisite for raising them.</p>
<p>In many industrialized countries, BFHI activities were slow to start. Over the past 10 years and as the evidence was becoming increasingly solid and the commitment of health workers and decision makers has become stronger, considerable efforts are being made in most industrialized countries to implement the BFHI. However, coordinators of the BFHI in industrialized countries face obstacles to successful implementation that appear unique to these countries. Problems reported include opposition from the health care establishment, lack of support from national authorities, and lack of awareness or acceptance of the need for the initiative among government departments, the health care system, and parents. It is worth highlighting these facts to enable the BFHI coordinators in these countries to make well-designed and targeted plans with achievable objectives.</p>
<p>Strengthening and scaling up the BFHI is an undisputed way to reduce infant mortality and improve quality of care for mothers and children. The BFHI has had great impact on breastfeeding practices. Reflecting new infant feeding research findings and recommendations, the tools and courses used to change hospital practices in line with Baby-Friendly criteria are available and ready to be used and implemented.</p>
<p>Governments should ensure that all personnel who are involved in health, nutrition, child survival, or maternal health are fully informed and energized to take advantage of an environment that is conducive to revitalizing the BFHI; incorporate the basic competencies for protection, promotion, and support of optimal infant and young child feeding, including the BFHI, into all health-worker curricula, whether facility- or community-based health workers; and recognize that the BFHI has a major role to play in child survival and more so in the context of HIV/AIDS. The World Health Organization and UNICEF strongly recommend using this new set of materials to ensure solid and full implementation of the BFHI global criteria and sustain progress already made. It is one way of improving child health and survival, and it is moving ahead to put the Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding in place, thus moving steadily to achieving the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
