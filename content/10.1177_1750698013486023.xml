<p>This special issue was first conceived of over dinner in a New Zealand café in London, on a warm summer night in July 2010. During that evening, it emerged that we’d both already been thinking about the issues we raise here for some time. Rosanne, a US citizen, and now Australian citizen, who has lived and worked in Australia since the 1990s, had co-edited a book on <italic>World Memory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750698013486023">Bennett and Kennedy, 2003</xref>). Susannah, at that point a UK citizen working in the United Kingdom and with a fellowship in Australia, was in the midst of running a project on memory in national contexts and had recently spoken on what she sees as the thorny politics driving both memory’s mobility and theories of transnational memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750698013486023">Radstone, 2011</xref>). Later that evening, we were joined by another contributor to this issue, Felicity Collins, who arrived hot foot from a symposium in Dublin on disputed memory in Australia and Ireland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750698013486023">Holmes and Ward, 2011</xref>). Looking back, it’s hard not to notice how our coming together – even in the choice of a New Zealand café in London – condensed many of the issues that pulse through this special issue. We knew that our connections were through memory research and through Australia. But knowing that didn’t reveal what, if anything, might be denoted by the coupling of Australia <italic>with</italic> both memory and memory studies. There in London, in the context of theories of the transnational as they were bearing in on memory studies and as they were present – embodied, even – around our table, this special issue had its genesis.</p>
<p>That evening, we began to make plans for a symposium,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1750698013486023">1</xref></sup> bringing together leading memory researchers from across Australia, and it was during that event that we made plans for this volume. The title of our special issue – <italic>Memory Studies in Australia</italic> – describes its contents more or less accurately, but aims to provoke, too. Our starting point – self-evidently – is our belief that there’s something significant to be learnt from bringing together this carefully commissioned collection of memory studies research in Australia. But what might that be? After all, general questions of the pertinence of the national notwithstanding, isn’t Australia generally regarded – as one of our contributors pithily put it – as just a ‘small’ country, situated beyond anywhere that matters? And isn’t it just plain retrograde, anachronistic or even overly nationalistic to talk about memory studies in Australia when memory studies <italic>and</italic> its subject – the dynamics of remembering – are both quite obviously transnational fields? This special issue appears at a time when scholarly discourses across the humanities, and particularly within memory studies, have laid stress on memory’s transnational or even global travels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750698013486023">Assmann and Conrad, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750698013486023">Bennett and Kennedy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750698013486023">Crownshaw, 2011</xref>). Taking up that approach, several of the essays included here trace the dynamics of transnational remembering as it bears in upon themes, issues and histories that matter in Australia (Kennedy, Lo, Morris, Nugent, Tumarkin and Twomey). The associative flows traced in these essays beg a series of questions about the power relations that play into the <italic>direction</italic> in which mnemonic symbols travel, the interests served by the sometimes incorporative thrust of transnational remembering and the apparently location-specific or even resistant aspects of those elements that remain outside the transnational field. In their tracing of these dynamics, these essays cannot help but provoke the question of what it might <italic>mean</italic> – or whether it is even legitimate – to consider a memory <italic>or an approach to memory research</italic> ‘Australian’ once the transnational status of mediated scholarship and culture is taken seriously. Alongside contributions focused on transnational remembering, we therefore open this issue with a series of essays that respond to this question by focusing on the dynamics of memory within Australia (Collins, Gibson, Healy, Radstone and Schlunke).</p>
<sec id="section1-1750698013486023">
<title>Politics/theory</title>
<p>There are, of course, other ways that this issue could have been organized. For notwithstanding their inter- or intra-national orientation, there are common themes that run deeply through the majority of these essays – themes that arise from Australia’s singular incarnation of the history of settler-colonialism, the history of immigration and the politics of decolonizing identity. Most particularly, and as demonstrated by Darian-Smith and Hamilton’s concluding review essay as well as this special issue as a whole, much memory research in Australia seeks to acknowledge and do justice to a past shadowed by a history of violence committed against indigenous communities. It is this particular past – remembered, dis-remembered, forgotten and repressed – that many of these essays address. Moreover, it is in the service of a future better reconciled with that past – however haltingly, incompletely and contestedly – that they strive. So as they discuss how settler violence against indigenous communities has been, or might be remembered (Collins and Radstone) and trace memories of indigenous freedom struggles (Kennedy and Nugent) and indigenous land-use (Gibson) and Australia’s colonial and indigenous entanglement with World Wars (Lo and Twomey), or engage with the darkly comedic matter of Captain Cook memorials (Schlunke), these essays respond to the <italic>specific</italic> and <italic>particular</italic> pressures exerted by the ongoing and troubling presence of Australia’s unique settler-colonial past, revealing the extent to which a politics of colonization – itself part of the longer <italic>durée</italic> of travel – plays across the politics of both memory and memory studies. But if it’s the complexity and difficulty of this still pulsing past that ripples through many of these essays, it ripples through the politics of research too.</p>
<p>The unfinished history of Australia’s settler-colonialism meshes the exercise of settler power within Australia with the exercise of colonial power from its centre upon its far-flung (ex-)colony. It is this latter <italic>dispositif</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750698013486023">Foucault, [1977] 1980</xref>) that continues to shadow the production, circulation and reception of Australian scholarship on Australian themes, with scholars encouraged to turn any Australian-focused research into a case study or point of comparison within a more abstractly themed project more likely to be of interest to an international (for which read largely UK and US) readership. This special issue is <italic>not</italic> a case study. Even – perhaps especially – where its focus is transnational, the research we showcase here demands to be read on its own terms, and for its own sake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698013486023">Craps, 2013</xref>), as work speaking from a specific, albeit complexly layered, conjuncture and location.</p>
<p>There’s more to be said here about theory and about location. For distance can liberate, as well as tyrannize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750698013486023">Blainey, [1967] 1971</xref>), allowing, perhaps, for a more eclectic and even unorthodox bricolaging of theory – the essence of real research, one might have thought – as well as some talking back <italic>to</italic> the old centre. So, in what looks like an aside to her fascinating study of the Asian–Australian transnationalism of the action-adventure genre, Morris bats away what is often taken as <italic>the</italic> dominant account of the ‘new’ age of connectivity by rendering it part of a much longer story; in her study of her own family memories, Collins draws us away from canonical trauma theory and instead introduces us to as yet under-explored aspects of Ricoeur, and in his study of Australian TV travel series, Healy casually suggests that at least with reference to that medium, the term ‘companion memory’ might be far more apposite than the popular concept of ‘prosthetic memory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750698013486023">Landsberg, 2004</xref>). If there’s plenty here that will be of interest <italic>to</italic> an international readership, it’s vital to remember, in the face of the marginalizing potential of some locations, the location of this – and <italic>all</italic> – research, even if it is by means of its claims to ‘unlocatedness’ and universal reach that research from the centre has sought to establish its pre-eminence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750698013486023">Radstone, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>This volume is ordered according to what could be described, loosely, as a logic of place – of Australia within its own borders, and Australia in specific transnational contexts. The essays move from an analysis of a specific tract of land (Gibson), to one about ‘big’ and ‘little’ things in the Australian landscape (Schlunke), to a number of essays that elaborate Australia’s transnational entanglements, particularly with its Asian neighbours, but also with the United States and Ireland (Kennedy, Lo, Morris and Nugent). Roughly half of the essays are concerned with sites and practices of memory within Australia, and their meanings and significance for what memory is and how it might be conceptualized. None of the essays collected here are concerned with ‘monumental’ sites of national memory, such as the Australian War Memorial or Gallipoli, and the work such sites do in producing an imagined unitary nation and identity – for which Nora’s analysis of <italic>lieux de mémoire</italic>/sites of memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750698013486023">Nora, 1996–1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750698013486023">2001–2010)</xref> has been heavily criticized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750698013486023">Anderson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750698013486023">Frow, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1750698013486023">Schwarz, 2010</xref>). Rather, it is through their focus on marginal or off-centre places and sites that the ‘critical’ perspective of these essays emerges. These studies demonstrate that taking the specificity of a place as a methodological starting point is neither narrow nor parochial. Rather, raking over the past by reading place in detail – paying attention to the minute particulars of a piece of land, a body of water, a seedy hotel room, a cinema in a country town and an Aboriginal settlement – evidences the imbrication of geology, history and culture in the dynamics of memory production. Reading place in detail also produces innovative approaches and expands the temporal and spatial horizon of memory studies by, for instance, drawing attention to the deep geological roots of memory (Gibson) or to the materiality of memory as manifested in objects (Schlunke).</p>

<title>The locations of memory</title>
<p>The dominance of place in this collection demands further thought. Is the significance of place, and how much it matters, related to accumulated understandings of ‘country’ in Australia? In Indigenous cultures in Australia, ‘country’, and the dreaming stories associated with particular places and clans, have unparalleled significance both for collective and cultural identity. Deborah Bird Rose, an anthropologist working in collaboration with women of the Mak Mak clan in the Northern Territory, observes that:<disp-quote>
<p>… there is the accumulation of history and memory in place. Place becomes complex in its specific gravity: it is and refers to itself, and it holds and refers to all that has happened there. Its very being, while wondrously dense, is also immensely vulnerable, because the ongoing life of the place happens through the actions and memories of ephemeral living beings. (Rose in collaboration with D’Amico, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750698013486023">2002</xref>: 162)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ross Gibson’s reading of a specific site – ‘eel country in South Eastern Victoria’ – exemplifies something of the significance of place that Rose and the Mak Mak women describe. Gibson illustrates the productivity of an ecological approach, bringing together ‘deep’ or ‘geological’ memory – the memory that is embedded in the layers of the earth, as it has sedimented over tens of thousands of years – with cultural memory, that is, with how people work the land for purposes of survival and culture. His observations on how nature and culture work together to produce memory lead him to a broader conclusion: ‘the land itself is a memory system … a tangible, inhabitable example of how memory can work in individuals and communities through human history’. Gibson’s approach signals the fertile possibilities that an Australian location offers for extending or re-orienting memory studies in what has been called the ‘era of the anthropocene’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750698013486023">Chakrabarty, 2009</xref>) – a geological concept that describes an era in which humans, through their own activity, are predicted to leave a footprint in the geological record.</p>
<p>Place is also important in Australia because ownership of land and of civic space has been at the very centre of disputes in a settler-colonial nation in which the courts declared the country ‘terra nullius’. Shameful acts of claiming or stealing land and dispersing Indigenous owners have resulted in forgetting rather than remembrance. As Morris points out, ‘For transient white settler families like ours the past was just something you didn’t want to “rake over”’. However, as Radstone observes, rake over the past is precisely what Australian author Kate Grenville does in her trilogy of novels – <italic>The Lieutenant, The Secret River</italic> and <italic>Sarah Thornhill</italic>. Read through Winnicott, the land that gets raked over, here, emerges not only as geological, ecological and cultural memory, but as transitional space – a merging of inner and outer reality; fantasy and the real.</p>
<p>For Maria Nugent, it’s the perspective provided by Aboriginal remembrances that produces new and confronting understandings of the everyday lived experience of familiar places such as the cinema. Nugent is interested in ‘the ways in which assorted acts of remembering about and through a collection of “sites” – constituting a landscape of memory – rework and remake histories and spaces of race relations’. Discussing Aboriginal memories of cinema as a space of desegregation, she observes that in these remembrances:<disp-quote>
<p>Memory and space merge … What is remembered are the spatial dimensions of those relations – the ways in which, for instance, the front section of the local cinema was demarcated by a rope or a low wall within which Aboriginal people’s presence was contained.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section3-1750698013486023">
<title>Critical locations</title>
<p>Place refers not only to the actual geographical site but also to the embodied location of the investigator – the location, physical or geographical, felt through the senses, imagined or remembered – from which the critic writes. The literature on the dominant disciplinary locations of memory studies centres these in the northern hemisphere, identifying the British tradition emerging from Birmingham cultural studies, the European tradition heavily influenced by the work of French and German scholars and American approaches to cultural memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750698013486023">Radstone, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750698013486023">2012</xref>). This is perhaps not surprising given that the theoretical roots of collective, and more recently, cultural memory studies are typically traced to the works of Europeans such as Halbwachs, Warburg, Benjamin and, more recently, Nora. Surveys of the theoretical and methodological approaches of the field of collective and cultural memory almost exclusively feature work by North American and European (French, German and British) critics, with occasional mention of the significance of Jewish memory for this scholarship (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750698013486023">Olick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750698013486023">Rossington and Whitehead, 2007</xref>). Australia is not identified with a reverential relationship with any particular tradition or approach; rather, Australian memory studies is characterized by bricolage, eclecticism, innovation and originality and by its testing of the claims of accepted approaches.</p>
<p>The question of the location(s) of memory research, as well as memory, inevitably has implications for methodologies and approaches. All of these essays, written in the first person, are sensitive to and demonstrate the significance of the critic’s location – and the histories, politics and memories that he or she brings to the task of remembering and analysing memory. In this way, they demonstrate that ‘remembering is a personal, embodied experience’ (Gibson). For Collins, for instance, place is a rural station in Bega dairy country, in southern New South Wales, the scene of the infanticide of an Aboriginal baby born to the white daughter of a privileged family – the father most likely a station-hand of mixed descent. Collins is concerned with how we forge our identities in response to uncomfortable or unwelcome truths about members of our family in a context of settler-colonialism. Who are ‘we’ Australians living in this place where we both belong and do not belong? Her approach to this issue draws attention to the significance of intimate communities of memory as formative of personal <italic>and</italic> national memory.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1750698013486023">
<title>The locations of transnationalism</title>
<p>In many of the essays in this issue, the transnational provides a fruitful analytic frame. However, it also gives rise to questions about the <italic>directions</italic> of transnational flow, and the conditions under which transnational commemorations and remembrances reinforce international power structures, and conceptions of centre and periphery. The potential meanings of memory – and new meanings of familiar memories – become visible or comprehensible through travel, and particularly through displacement. Displacement from one’s ‘home’, or one’s origins, provokes new insights. In these processes, however, location and locatedness remain paramount. For instance, although Maria Tumarkin’s essay is not ostensibly concerned with place, her move to Australia in the 1990s, and her access to books about the history of her native Ukraine, enabled her to come to a new understanding of her childhood memory of her grandmother’s habit of eating the crumbs that fell from Tumarkin’s sandwich. Her sense-making of her grandmother’s behaviour is consistent with Bergson’s concept of ‘habit memory’, which recognized the role of the body in modes of remembering. ‘Habit memory’ describes the ways in which ‘memory accumulates in the body through certain forms of repetitive behaviour, so that the past comes to be relived or re-enacted in the present’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750698013486023">Whitehead, 2009</xref>: 133).For Tumarkin, embodied memory leads to a consideration of memory traces that exceed frames of representation and cognition.</p>
<p>Perhaps what is distinctive about an Australian approach to cosmopolitan and transnational memory, as illustrated in several of the essays included here, is the way that cosmopolitan memory is shown to foster lateral connections across diverse memory communities. Twomey and Kennedy consider how ‘cosmopolitan memory’, as manifested in discourses, images and cultural formations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750698013486023">Levy and Sznaider, 2002</xref>) enables ‘horizontal’ connections between smaller memory communities, both within Australia and in other national contexts. For instance, Twomey argues that the emergence of a cosmopolitan trauma discourse from the 1980s has shaped memories both of Australian prisoners of war (POWs) interned in Japanese camps, and of members of the Stolen Generations. Trauma discourse, used by each group to give meaning to their experiences, promotes a shared understanding of suffering between these memory communities, rather than a competition for public visibility. Focusing on an Indigenous film, <italic>The Sapphires</italic> (Blair, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1750698013486023">2012</xref>, Australia), Kennedy analyses how American images and rhetorics of civil rights and black power, and African-American soul music – today figured as ‘global’ rather than specifically American – are used to tell an Aboriginal story that has both national and transnational resonances.Her essay questions the directionality of the ‘trans’ in transnational: is this a case of Australian transnationalism or American transnationalism? Does the Australian film only become ‘transnational’ when it crosses national borders, circulating outside the nation and finding a transnational audience? Lo, analysing the Israeli commemoration of an Aboriginal activist, William Cooper, who organized an Aboriginal protest against Kristallnacht, demonstrates how ‘minor’ transnational gestures that connect far-flung communities are liable to be recuperated by national interests. In such cases, the cosmopolitan does not – as it is sometimes claimed – provide the basis for a shared universal morality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750698013486023">Levy and Sznaider, 2002</xref>); rather, cosmopolitan gestures may inadvertently feed into and support nationalistic memory projects and claims. These essays suggest that there is scope to distinguish the workings of transnational memory, both as it connects communities within the nation, and as Australian memory practices and cultural forms cross national borders. They also point to the significance of the <italic>locations</italic> of transnational memory: as transnational memories cross borders, they carry traces of their local and national origins, and they take root in new local and national contexts.</p>
<p>The final essay in this volume (Morris) is on popular modernism in Australia and North East Asia in the mid-twentieth century, as manifested in ‘action-adventure’ genres. Here, Morris reflects on the effects of her own transnational move from Australia to Hong Kong on her thinking about the Australian popular writer Ernestine Hill. Morris’ re-appraisal of her project was enabled, in part, by her own encounter with Inter-Asian Cultural Studies, which follows a method of writing ‘from local environments and experiences’ – a method in which the specificity of place is paramount. Up until her own move, Morris explains, she had ‘placed’ Hill within the contexts of Australian history and culture. But it was her own embodied border-crossing, she explains, that enabled her to re-articulate her project by placing Hill in ‘the wave of popular modernism that swept around the Asia-Pacific, including Australia, after the Pacific War’. The term re-articulation does more here, however, than describe what border-crossing did to Morris’ ‘old’ project. In Morris’ analysis, it emerges also as a pivotal concept in the analysis of the memory-work – the production of continuity through re-articulation – performed by new media as well as by cross-cultural ‘translator figures’, including Hill, ‘who crop up in many places in times of great change to grapple with the relations between old cultural traditions and new cultural constituencies’.</p>
<p>For Morris, the task of memory-work is associated with the translation, or re-articulation, of old cultural traditions for new constituencies ‘often in the context of nationally formative struggles over social as well as cultural institutions’ – a task Morris aligns with cultural and media practices. However, in Morris’ essay, it is her own analysis too that emerges <italic>as</italic> translation, re-translating Hill – and so much more – from a particular location and for particular times. If memory studies in Australia is concerned with border-crossings, with the significance of place in the production and circulation of memory and with the legacies of particular and specific pasts, its concerns serve the task of a critical re-articulation of the past in the present – a task that resonates through the entirety of this collection, as well as through memory studies in Australia and beyond.</p>
