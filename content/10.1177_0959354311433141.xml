<p>Richard House’s new book should be of keen interest to many theoretical psychologists and thinking practitioners. The book is a collection of essays and reviews articles written by the author and published over the past 15 years, with some brief additional commentary on a number of them. The main theme of this book is a critique of “the prevailing paradigm of ‘modernity’” and explorations of a possibly emerging “radical trans- or postmodernity” and what it might have to offer in the way of healing, health, and spiritual deepening for the mental health field and our culture at large. No stone is left unturned as the author critiques the deadening institutional professionalization, “credentialism” (p. 11), careerism, “surveillance and audit culture obsession with ‘evidence-based practice,’” denigration of the “subtle and mysterious” in human life, depersonalizing and silencing the voice of psychotherapy clients, professional training in one or another “therapeutic technology that becomes a means for controlling and manipulating subjectivity rather than one that is enabling of human and spiritual development” (p. 8), and a “pathologizing mentality” that neatly serves these other pernicious trends flowing from the modern “regime of truth” (p. 20).</p>
<p>House then explores what Donald Schön (whom he quotes) terms an “epistemology of practice implicit in the artistic, intuitive processes which some practitioners do bring to situations of uncertainty, instability, uniqueness, and value conflict” (p. 7). It seems to us of the utmost importance to raise all of these issues of paradoxical modern cultural and intellectual trends that aim at advancing human welfare and accountability, but do so mainly through seeking bureaucratic and technological control over human behavior and social life in ways that end up undermining rather than enhancing human freedom, responsibility, and creativity. Of special interest to readers of this journal will be House’s restatement in essays and reviews of key ideas and arguments from a quite wide range of philosophers, social theorists, and cultural critics, which he fits into his broad discussion of moving from modern to trans-modern paradigms. It is refreshing and stimulating to be reminded of the perspectives of Jung, Rudolf Steiner, Robert Sardello, George Groddeck, Krishnamurti, Stanislav Grof, and others who have something to offer even if one has not thought about them for a while. Also, it will be quite helpful to many American theoretical psychologists to read reviews and discussion of a number of books by British and other European authors with which they may not be familiar, such as <italic>Deconstructing Psychopathology</italic> by Ian Parker and others and <italic>Trauma</italic> by Patrick Bracken, to mention just two that caught our eye. The book is a treasure trove of interesting material.</p>
<p>House relies on prominent postmodern and deconstructionist theorists, like Foucault and Derrida, as well as philosophical psychologists of a deconstructionist bent, like Parker, to execute his critique of modernity. It is an illuminating critique. But we feel that his approach shares in some of the more questionable features of postmodern thought. For example, it tends to (pardon the expression) “totalize” the modern paradigm as a dominating, ill-motivated way of being that threatens us on all sides. We feel this view is overly reactive and itself one-sided. Most of us endorse and find thoroughly convincing, in some form, modern ethical ideals of human rights and dignity, the moral worth of every person, liberal democracy, and the rule of law. A more moderate view would be that modern individualism’s ethical outlook centered on individual rights and personal liberty enshrines worthy ideals but represents an insufficient and somewhat self-defeating approach to well-being, purchasing individual autonomy at the price of social fragmentation, emotional isolation, and anomie.</p>
<p>We hasten to add that House indicates in several places that he acknowledges the “thorny problem of relativism in postmodernist and social constructionist approaches” (p. 109). Moreover, he astutely notes that a “widely and uncritically embraced duality of modernism/postmodernism” is not only “overly simplistic” but “ironically replicates the very world-view which postmodern thinking at its best has pretensions to transcending” (p. 109). These are wise words, but House spends much more time and energy rhetorically assaulting the flaws of the modern paradigm than clarifying how a “transmodern” view might actually transcend this polarized duality. Also, we don’t get much of a sense of how his view emerges from the struggles of dealing wisely and coherently with actual therapy patients, a domain he wants to preserve.</p>
<p>We respectfully suggest that a capable thinker like House might find helpful perspectives and arguments drawn from certain schools of thought he consults only minimally. For example, the famous “critique of instrumental reason” proposed by the Frankfurt School and Jürgen Habermas offers a powerful analysis of the one-sided instrumentalism and new forms of domination it produces in modern society, built on a damaging confusion and inversion of the priority of praxis (meaningful cultural activity valued for its own sake) and <italic>techne</italic> (technical capacity to produce desired outcomes or results). This analysis elucidates how an overweening stress on instrumental control can produce the stultifying effects that House rightly views as having taken over a great deal of the psychotherapy enterprise just as well as, or better than, Foucauldian thought and deconstruction, and does so without undermining the possibility that a genuine ethical praxis might be restored. Hermeneutic philosophers like Gadamer and Charles Taylor add to this picture by clarifying how such a praxis need not run afoul of (quite legitimate) modern and postmodern concerns about dogmatism and arbitrary authority. They suggest that humans inescapably embrace self-defining commitments and identifications concerning what they take to be a decent or good way of life. Some ideals of character or community that go beyond individual autonomy and a merely “negative liberty” are involved. But rightly understood, such notions of the good are always colored and limited by the particular cultural contexts in which they make sense and are never final or certain. They require searching dialogue with “difference” and the “other,” be it the cultural past, other people, or other traditions than one’s own to draw out and clarify their meaning in the face of unforeseen circumstances and novel challenges.</p>
<p>There is more work to be done in sketching a credible alternative to modern individualism and postmodern relativism. But this book makes a solid contribution to that effort. Also, it is easy to doubt that psychotherapy and other healing practices can do much more than put emotional band-aids on a few individuals or have much effect on wider cultural quandaries. But we left reading this book more encouraged that a wiser and more humane psychotherapy could help forge better insights and a new spirit that would radiate outwards.</p>
