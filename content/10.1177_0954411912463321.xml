<abstract>
<p>The aseptic loosening of total elbow replacements is a serious complication resulting in significant patient morbidity. It is thought to occur secondary to stress shielding of the distal humeral cortex by the stiff stem of the implant. Some total elbow prostheses incorporate an anterior flange intended to improve implant stability and peri-articular load transfer in an attempt to reduce this effect. However, few studies have directly assessed the changes in cortical strains following total elbow arthroplasty or the biomechanical advantage of the anterior flange design. A regular and a long flange Coonrad–Morrey total elbow prosthesis were implanted into six Sawbone synthetic humeri. The constructs were subjected to physiological loads in axial compression (500 N), antero-posterior bending (50 N) and antero-posterior compression with condylar supports (300 N). Digital image correlation was used to measure the distal antero-lateral cortical strains and the results compared with those of whole Sawbones that had been tested in the same way. Significant stress shielding was demonstrated over the distal humeral cortex following prosthesis implantation during axial compression. In contrast, cortical strains increased following prosthesis implantation during antero-posterior compression with condylar supports. The increase in cortical strains following total elbow arthroplasty may help to maintain the integrity of the anterior cortex offering additional stability for implants with an anterior flange. These results are important for the development of future total elbow prosthesis designs and indicate that simulating the action of the forearm muscles is essential when evaluating changes in strain about the distal humerus in vitro.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the 1970s, the total elbow replacement has become an important treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, fracture non-union and peri-articular tumours. However, one serious complication is aseptic loosening, which is thought to result from stress shielding of the distal humeral cortex by the stiff humeral stem. In order to prevent this process, some total elbow prostheses incorporate an anterior flange designed to improve peri-articular load transfer. In 1998, Gill and Morrey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912463321">1</xref></sup> published their 10- to 15-year follow-up results for patients treated with a Coonrad–Morrey total elbow arthroplasty that includes this design feature. Their patient outcomes appeared much superior to those with older generation designs with more than 92% 10-year survival. However, it is unknown if this improvement is due to the superior biomechanics offered by the anterior flange or reflects improvements in patient selection, operative techniques or the introduction of additional design features such as the semi-constrained hinge.</p>
<p>Few studies have attempted to evaluate the biomechanical advantage of the anterior flange, and the methods used have omitted the forces generated by the forearm muscles on the distal humerus. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to measure changes in cortical strains about the distal humerus before and after implantation of a Coonrad–Morrey total elbow prosthesis, noting the effect of engaging the anterior flange and simulating forearm muscle forces.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0954411912463321" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>All mechanical tests were performed at the Cardiff School of Engineering, United Kingdom.</p>
<sec id="section3-0954411912463321">
<title>Specimens and loading apparatus</title>
<p>Six large left, fourth-generation synthetic composite Sawbone humeri (Sawbones Europe, Pacific Research Laboratories, Malmö, Sweden) were obtained and prepared for use with the digital image correlation (DIC) equipment by coating with white paint and a black speckled pattern. These synthetic humeri have been shown to exhibit biomechanical properties similar to cadaveric specimens but with a lesser degree of inter-specimen variation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912463321">2</xref></sup> In addition, two Coonrad–Morrey total elbow replacements with a regular-size and long-size anterior flange were obtained from Zimmer UK Ltd, Swindon, United Kingdom. Both options have an identical 6-in Tivanium<sup>®</sup> (Zimmer Inc, Warsaw, Indiana 46580, USA) (Ti–6Al–4V Alloy) humeral stem.</p>
<p>All Sawbones and Sawbone-prosthesis constructs were tested in the same way. The first tests were performed on the whole Sawbones to provide control baseline data (n = 6). Following these tests, each Sawbone was prepared, and either a regular flange prostheses (n = 3) or long flange prosthesis (n = 3) was implanted using vacuum mixed Palacos<sup>®</sup> low viscosity polymethyl-methacrylate cement (Heraeus Medical, Hanau, Germany) for fixation as per the manufacturer guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912463321">3</xref></sup> The tests were performed on these constructs both with and without engaging the anterior flange. To engage the flange, a solid rigid polyurethane foam block (30 pcf; Sawbones Europe) was firmly wedged beneath the anterior flange. A Losenhausen hydraulic compression machine (Losenhausen Maschinenbau AG, Dusseldorf, Germany) with a 5-kN interface load cell was used for all loading tests. The loads were ramped up over 15 s and held for 3 s before the strain measurements were taken. The Flex Test<sup>™</sup> GT Station Manager software (Version 3.5c; MTS Systems Corporation) (Eden Prairie, Minnesota 55344, USA) was used to control the load applied.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0954411912463321">
<title>Loading methods and physiological forces</title>
<p>Three methods of loading were used to investigate the cortical strains of the composite humeri both before and after implantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912463321">Figure 1</xref>). First, a 500-N axial load was applied to the trochlea/prosthesis hinge, in line with the long axis of the humerus. The humerus may be loaded in this way when the elbow is fully extended.</p>
<fig id="fig1-0954411912463321" position="float">
<label>Figure 1.</label>
<caption>
<p>The three methods of loading: (a) axial compression (500 N), (b) antero-posterior bending (50 N) and (c) condylar support loading (300 N).</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954411912463321-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In the second position, the humerus was secured in a clamp 15 cm proximal to the tip of the implanted humeral stem, and an antero-posterior (AP) bending load of 50 N was applied to the trochlea/hinge. The position of the clamp approximates to the insertion points of the shoulder girdle musculature (pectoralis major, teres major and latissimus dorsi).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912463321">4</xref></sup> This loading method simulates posteriorly directed external forces applied to the elbow joint. Although used in previous studies investigating the role of the anterior flange, this method of loading neglects the activity of muscles that function to stabilise the wrist and therefore may not be a significant mechanism of joint loading in vivo.</p>
<p>In the third position, a custom polyester mould was created to support the posterior aspect of the humeral condyles while an AP load of 300 N was applied to the trochlea/hinge. This novel method of loading attempts to replicate forearm muscle activity at their points of insertion on the condyles of the distal humerus, shown to provide a significant contribution towards normal joint reaction forces in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912463321">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912463321">6</xref></sup> The 300-N AP force during the condylar support tests would be equivalent to the joint force encountered while lifting a load of approximately 3 kg at the hand or extending against a 10-kg load.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0954411912463321">
<title>Strain measurement and analysis</title>
<p>The cortical strains were measured using three-dimensional DIC. This non-contact method for measuring surface strains tracks the position of surface points in three dimensions and calculates surface strains using undeformed specimen surface point positions as a reference.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912463321">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912463321">8</xref></sup> The main advantages of this technique over contact methods, such as strain gauge measurements, include reducing the time for specimen preparation, increasing the area over which the strain can be measured, and the ability to calculate the principal strains.</p>
<p>Two digital DCD2.0 cameras (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Limess.com">Limess.com</ext-link>, Pforzheim, Germany) with 1624 × 1234 pixel resolution, each with a Schneider–Kreuznach Xenoplan 2.0/28-0901 lens, were used to capture images of the humeral cortex from two different angles. Correcting for the specimen image area, each pixel represented approximately 0.074 mm<sup>2</sup> resulting in an approximate displacement sensitivity of 0.74 µm. The cameras were positioned to obtain data from the antero-lateral aspect of the distal humerus. The camera lens aperture was set to f/12 with a frame speed of between 26.0 and 46.0 ms. Both image capture and system calibration were achieved with Vic-Snap Image Acquisition software (v3.0D; Correlated Solutions Inc, Columbia, South Carolina 29063, USA), using camera calibration plates to ensure strain measurement accuracy.</p>
<p>Five different cortical zones were selected for strain analysis. The zones A–D were chosen based on their proximity to the flange to enable comparisons with existing research (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912463321">Figure 2</xref>). The zone E was chosen in an area less likely to be influenced by the flange as a contrast. The size and location of these zones were identical for each test analysed. The principal tensile and compressive strains within each of these areas were calculated by processing image information obtained from both cameras using Vic-3D Digital Image Correlation Software (Version 2006.1.0; Correlated Solutions Inc.).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954411912463321-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The average principal strains in zones A–E were compared using control data from the unimplanted Sawbones. The statistical significance of differences in mean strain measurements was calculated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests. The null hypothesis was that within each zone, the mean principal strains were the same for whole Sawbone, free flange and engaged flange constructs. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. The Student’s t-tests were then performed where appropriate to identify between which groups this difference lay. Again, a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the analysis for strains in zone C could only be performed with the results from whole Sawbones and regular-sized flange implant–Sawbone constructs as the long flange design blocked this region of the cortex from the view of the DIC cameras. Therefore, the results for this region are based on a sample size of three.</p>

<title>Regular versus long flange constructs</title>
<p>There were no significant differences identified between the mean principal strains in zones A, B, D and E when comparing regular (n = 3) and long flange constructs (n = 3). However, due to the small sample groups size, the study may be underpowered to identify any true differences here.</p>
<p>In order to compare whole Sawbones with implanted constructs with and without engaging the flange, the regular and long flange design results have been combined to increase the sample group numbers (n = 6). Because the stems of these implants are the same, all free flange tests are essentially identical constructs. However, when grouping the engaged flange constructs, it is assumed that the mechanism by which the flange alters the load transfer is same for both designs.</p>

<title>Axial compression</title>
<p>Following implantation of the Coonrad–Morrey prosthesis, tensile and compressive strains in zones A and E were significantly reduced. These results agree with those of Goel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912463321">9</xref></sup> who showed that the cortical strains were reduced by 10% following prosthesis implantation during axial loading indicating that the stress shielding occurs during this method of loading.</p>
<p>When engaging the anterior flange, there is a statistically significant further reduction in compressive principal strains in zone A with a load of 500 N. One possible explanation is that the axial loading may cause some torsion of the construct, with medial cortical loading from the flange and associated off-loading of the lateral cortex. Nonetheless, there is no clear evidence for an advantage offered by the anterior flange during axial loading. These results are supported by Quenneville et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912463321">10</xref></sup> who investigated the role of the anterior flange using a cadaveric model. They too were unable to identify any significant differences in cortical strains following engaging the anterior flange with a 500-N axial load.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0954411912463321">
<title>AP bending</title>
<p>During the AP bending tests, the magnitudes of the tensile strains were much greater than the compressive strains. However, following implantation of the prostheses there were no statistically significant differences from the control whole Sawbones. In contrast to this, Goel et al. demonstrated a 10% reduction in cortical strains following prosthesis implantation during this mechanism of loading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912463321">9</xref></sup> However, it is important to recognise that their finite element analysis study is limited by its virtual nature and includes assumptions of perfect material properties and conditions. In addition, the AP loading methods used in previous investigations have failed to account for the insertion of forearm muscles to the distal humerus, and therefore, their results may not be as clinically relevant as those derived from the condylar support tests used in this study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912463321">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912463321"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912463321"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912463321">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>There were no significant changes after engaging the anterior flange, which is consistent with the results presented by Quenneville et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912463321">10</xref></sup> for this method of loading.</p>

<p>Studies have shown that the elbow joint reaction forces are largely generated by the forearm muscles that are inserted into the medial and lateral condyles of the humerus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912463321">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912463321">6</xref></sup> Amis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912463321">5</xref></sup> hypothesise that the AP compression force generated by these muscles may be responsible for the posterior migration of the distal humeral component together with anterior migration of the proximal tip following total elbow arthroplasty. It is important to note that this AP compression force is also associated with an anteriorly directed force applied to the cortex of the medial and lateral condyles of the humerus at the insertion of the forearm muscles and collateral ligaments. Therefore, in order to simulate these opposing forces in this study, a custom polyester mould was created to support the posterior lateral aspect of the condyles, while an AP compression force was applied to the trochlea and capitellum.</p>
<p>In contrast to the axial compression tests, there is a significant increase in compressive cortical strains following prosthesis implantation indicating that the reaction force from the condylar supports is causing cortical compression in this region. However, there was no significant difference between the free and engaged flange constructs.</p>
<p>In vivo, the loading of total elbow replacements is likely to equate to a combination of these loading mechanisms at any one time, and therefore, the results of these findings must be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that only the axial compression tests demonstrated a significant reduction in cortical strains following prosthesis implantation, as might be expected if stress shielding was taking place. However, during condylar loading, the cortical strains were actually increased. This finding may actually contradict the hypothesis that aseptic loosening of total elbow replacements occurs secondary to cortical bone atrophy as a result of stress shielding. It has been shown that bone remodelling is affected not only by the magnitude of loading forces but also by the nature of that load, be it compressive or tensile.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912463321">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912463321">14</xref></sup> Skedros et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912463321">14</xref></sup> have shown that cortices in compression have a greater osteon population density and more oblique to transversely orientated collagen fibres than those in tension. The results in this study suggest that it may be bone remodelling rather than simple bone atrophy that results in prosthesis loosening. The anterior flange may therefore function more to secure the prosthesis to at least one cortex while this process of skeletal remodelling takes place. Indeed, the distal anterior cortex would provide an ideal strut for prosthesis stability if it thickens in response to increased compressive strains.</p>
<p>Figgie et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411912463321">15</xref></sup> have investigated distal humeral bone remodelling following total elbow arthroplasty by measuring the average cortical thickness on post-operative radiographs. They concluded that distal humeral atrophy occurs following prosthesis implantation. However, their results would be unable to distinguish between anterior and posterior cortical changes. Subsequently, it is possible that any hypertrophy of the anterior cortex in their sample group would be offset by destruction of the posterior cortex. Post-mortem histological studies or radiological studies focussing on the anterior humeral cortex may be helpful to further evaluate this hypothesis.</p>

<title>Study limitations</title>
<p>An important limitation of this study is the small sample group sizes. For comparisons between implant designs and measuring changes in strain in zone C, the sample size is only 3. As a result, although we are unable to demonstrate any significant differences here, this may be a consequence of limited study power rather than the absence of true differences. However, assuming that the mechanism by which both flange designs transfer load to the cortex, combining the results provides an opportunity to identify significant changes in cortical strains even though the efficacy of this load transfer may be different between the flange options.</p>
<p>An additional limitation of this study includes the omission of loading in torsion. Amis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411912463321">16</xref></sup> showed that internal rotation of the forearm could generate torques of as much as 66 Nm at the elbow. In addition, Goel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912463321">9</xref></sup> demonstrated that the stresses in the cement and cancellous bone increased more than fourfold following implantation of a constrained Coonrad I prosthesis, especially near both the hinge and the tip of the prosthesis. However, since the introduction of semi-constrained total elbow prosthesis designs, which aim to dissipate forces that subject the implant to torsion, long-term success rates have improved. O’Driscoll et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912463321">17</xref></sup> showed that although the degree of varus and valgus laxity increased following prosthesis implantation, this was less than the limits of the semi-constrained hinge. Therefore, under physiological loads semi-constrained total elbow prostheses seem to be protected from torsional loads by the soft tissue envelope of the joint and dynamic muscle stabilisation. As a result, torsion may have less of a role to play during aseptic loosening of well-positioned implants.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to consider the use of synthetic Sawbone humeri rather than cadaveric specimens. Although these Sawbones have been shown to exhibit similar biomechanical properties and reduced inter-specimen variability to cadaveric specimens, they are likely to exhibit properties that differ from some patients managed with total elbow arthroplasty, particularly those who suffer from rheumatoid arthritis where bone quality may be particularly poor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912463321">2</xref></sup> In addition, the regions analysed in this study lie outside the previously validated zones. However, although we cannot draw conclusions regarding the magnitude of changes in cortical strains from this study, the pattern of results and the subsequent effect on cortical remodelling are still likely to be significant.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Digital image correlation has been used for the first time to investigate the cortical strains over the distal antero-lateral surface of synthetic humeri, both with and without an implanted Coonrad–Morrey total elbow prosthesis. The magnitudes of the forces used in this study are representative of normal physiological loads, as predicted by existing research.</p>
<p>Following implantation of a Coonrad–Morrey prosthesis, both compressive and tensile strains over the distal humerus are reduced during axial loading. This is likely to represent stress shielding of the cortex as the load is carried by the stiffer implant. However, the cortical strains are increased over the distal antero-lateral humeral cortex with AP loads in the presence of condylar supports. This increase in cortical strains may play an important role in the process of bone remodelling that occurs following prosthesis implantation. This new finding indicates that the anterior distal humeral cortex may undergo a process of bone hypertrophy rather than atrophy as previously thought and contribute to the stability of implants incorporating an anterior flange.</p>
