In particular, the authors examine how the students use the <italic>topos of unknowability</italic> and the <italic>topos of implicature</italic> to suppress or confront, respectively, the relationship between past racial injustice and present-day inequalities, and the questions of responsibility and redress it raises.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Demographic trends and opinion polling suggest that today’s US youth are both racially and ethnically more diverse, and more tolerant of such diversity, than were previous generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0957926512469389">Pew Research Center, 2010</xref>). Such trends have been cited as indicators that the USA is entering a post-racial era in which racism has been overcome and racial equality has been achieved. According to this argument, the election of President Barack Obama as the nation’s first black president, an election in large part secured by the youth vote, provides further evidence that racism is a ‘thing of the past’ in the USA.</p>
<p>Despite such assertions, stark racial inequalities persist. In addition, research in sociology and discourse analysis documents the rise of a new, colorblind racism among white Americans. This ‘new racism’ is characterized by the simultaneous eschewal of overt expressions of white superiority and defense of continued white privilege on the grounds of policy disagreements, concerns about ‘reverse discrimination,’ and cultural rather than biological explanations of inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957926512469389">Bonilla-Silva, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0957926512469389">Meyers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0957926512469389">Zamudio and Rios, 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0957926512469389">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recent sociological and socio-linguistic studies in the USA document the pervasiveness of the ‘new’ racism among white American youth. White youth in the USA reject affirmative action policies intended to address racial inequality on the grounds that such policies undermine the ‘American’ values of individualism and meritocracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957926512469389">Bonilla-Silva and Forman, 2000</xref>). Such justifications enable white youth to construct a positive self-presentation as non-racists even while they employ negative stereotypes of blacks and Latinos as intellectually inferior. This colorblind discourse is further characterized by white youth’s use of racial reversals to position people of color who call attention to racial inequality as racists and whites as their victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957926512469389">Bucholtz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0957926512469389">Foster, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Fewer studies have examined the race talk of US youth of color. Those that have document the processes of accommodation and resistance that youth of color engage in to navigate the competing pressures of assimilation and exclusion that the new racism imposes. Sociological studies of the new racism at majority white US universities, for example, find that white youth simultaneously demand that youth of color act as stereotypical representatives of their race and condemn the youth for embracing their racial identities as an act of separatism. Youth of color respond by variously internalizing negative ‘meta-stereotypes’ of their intellectual inferiority, asserting themselves as race representatives to dispel such stereotypes, and limiting their interactions with white youths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0957926512469389">Lewis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0957926512469389">Torres and Charles, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent sociolinguistic studies further specify the discursive practices that youth of color use in response to the new racism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957926512469389">Buttny and Williams’ (2000)</xref> analyses of interviews with Latino and black youth reveal how these youth use reported speech to articulate the racist subtext of negative interactions with whites and to establish their definitional power over troublesome events. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0957926512469389">Reyes’ (2011)</xref> ethnographic study of a Korean American high school documents how Korean American boys employ the comedic genre of ‘crying racist’ circulating in American popular culture to challenge colorblindness. ‘Crying racist’ incorporates the social types of the nervous yet innocent white liberal and the angry yet imprecise person of color to make visible the white anxiety that underlies colorblindness, and that acknowledges the continued relevance of race. As they engage in ‘crying racist’ talk, the Korean American boys both comment on and insert themselves into the black–white binary that structures US race relations and that renders them largely invisible.</p>
<p>The present study builds on this research. In it, we employ a discourse historical analysis (DHA) approach to analyze a discussion about contemporary issues of race and racism that a multi-racial group of US youth held in their high school classroom. Though the new racism positions racism as ‘a thing of the past,’ our analysis reveals how US youth’s present day race talk is bound up in the politics of the past. It suggests that a full understanding of the contemporary race talk of US youth requires locating such talk as part of the ongoing construction and contestation of the cultural memory of race and racism in the USA.</p>
<p>In the following section, we delineate the key elements of DHA and briefly examine the historical context of race talk in the USA. We then present our analysis of the discussion transcript. We find that the youth employed two major discursive strategies: the strategy of ignorance and the strategy of implicature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0957926512469389">2</xref></sup> Though, at times, students of different races took up each of these strategies, white students most often employed the former, while black students employed the latter. As they did so, the youth variously grappled with and suppressed the relationship between past racial injustices and present racial inequalities, and the questions of guilt, responsibility, and redress which that relationship raises.</p>

<title>Discourse historical analysis of contemporary discourses of racism</title>
<p>DHA, as developed most prominently by Ruth Wodak and colleagues, is a variant of critical discourse analysis, distinguished by its efforts to integrate historical, political, and socio-cognitive dimensions into the analysis and interpretation of discursive events. It assumes a multi-layered notion of context that includes: (1) the content and linguistic features of discourse; (2) the intertextual and interdiscursive relationships between utterances, texts, genres, and discourses; (3) the extra-linguistic, sociological variables and institutional frames of a specific discursive event; and (4) the broader socio-political and historical contexts in which discursive practices are embedded. DHA is fundamentally interdisciplinary as it draws on historical and political research, cultural studies, and discourse analysis to examine the relationship among these different contextual layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0957926512469389">Reisigl and Wodak, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies of contemporary discourses of anti-Semitism and racism, primarily in Western Europe, have been central to the development of DHA. Following the approach’s emphasis on the principle of triangulation, these studies examine diverse texts, including research interviews, media reports, museum exhibits, political speeches, and formal policy documents, to trace the movement of discursive practices across fields of action and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957926512469389">Baker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0957926512469389">KhosraviNik, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0957926512469389">Wodak and De Cillia, 2007</xref>). Many DHA studies delineate the discursive strategies dominant groups use to construct in- and out-groups and to justify discrimination against ‘others’ while maintaining positive self-presentations. These studies emphasize five types of discursive strategies that are particularly salient to the construction of positive self- and negative other-presentations: referential, predictional, argumentation, perspectival, and intensifying/mitigating strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0957926512469389">Tekin, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0957926512469389">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0957926512469389">Wodak, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>DHA studies have also illuminated the relationship between contemporary discourses of race, national identity, and efforts to grapple with acts of past injustice in democratic, pluralistic societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0957926512469389">Menz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0957926512469389">Reisigl and Wodak, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0957926512469389">Wodak et al., 2009</xref>). These traumatic experiences, such as wars, revolutions, torture, mass rape, and genocide, raise difficult questions of guilt, responsibility, and redress. As such, taboos often surround talk about these events in public spheres. The official narratives of such events that circulate through texts such as political documents, school curricula, and popular films tend to mitigate, deny, or mystify the participation of dominant groups in these traumas. DHA analyses examine how these official narratives move across and interact with narratives circulating in the private spheres of families and across generations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0957926512469389">Wodak (2006)</xref> traces the argumentation strategies, across official and individual narratives, that are used to exculpate Austrians enlisted in the German Wehrmacht of war crimes during World War II. Wodak’s analysis of interviews with Austrian men of three different generations, conducted after each had visited an exhibit that documented these war crimes, identifies the different justification strategies the men use to trivialize and relativize the crimes. The men variously employ the topoi of ‘all wars are the same,’ ‘not knowing,’ and ‘doing one’s duty,’ to mitigate and deny Austrians’ responsibility for the crimes. Wodak’s analysis highlights how discursive strategies get recontextualized across official and individual narratives, as well as across generations, to construct and defend an image of Austrian innocence, even in the face of powerful evidence of the nation’s Nazi past as presented by the exhibit.</p>
<p>DHA provides a set of analytic tools to examine the discursive strategies US youth use as they talk about contemporary issues of race and racism. It is particularly relevant to the analysis of race talk in schools. Public school classrooms are not only sites on which US youth negotiate contemporary meanings of race and racism with each other, as current interview and ethnographic studies document (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0957926512469389">Pollock, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0957926512469389">Schultz et al., 2005</xref>). They are also sites through which US youth engage with the narratives of race and racism that circulate in the school curriculum. These narratives are intimately bound up with ‘official’ narratives of national identity that embed particular versions of the nation’s past as well as its present. Though DHA emphasizes the role the school curriculum plays in disseminating these ‘official’ narratives, drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957926512469389">Bakhtin (1981)</xref> we conceive of the school curriculum as a site of heteroglossia. Official narratives sanctioned by dominant social groups co-exist, intersect, and compete with the unofficial narratives of subordinated social groups. As they engage with and through the school curriculum, then, students’ race talk variously takes up, adapts, inflects, and resists these competing narratives of race, racism, national identity, and cultural memory.</p>

<title>Racist and anti-racist discourse in the USA</title>
<p>While many DHA analyses have focused primarily on the discursive strategies of the racial elite, some have also examined the race talk of racially subordinated groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0957926512469389">Krzyzanowski and Wodak, 2007</xref>). These analyses find that racially subordinated groups use graphic experiential accounts to document the racial discrimination and prejudice they encounter, even as they also re-contextualize racist discourses circulating in official narratives and media texts to reinforce existing racial stereotypes and justify racial discrimination against other out-groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0957926512469389">Krzyzanowski and Wodak, 2009</xref>). Though these analyses retain a focus on racist discourse, they do point to the dialogic nature of racist and anti-racist talk. From a dialogic perspective, racist and anti-racist discourses represent ‘dueling discourses’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0957926512469389">Fozdar, 2008</xref>); they draw on common forms of argument and themes recognizable across groups. Anti-racist arguments thus contain traces of the arguments against which they are constructed (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957926512469389">Every and Augoustinos, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies of the rhetoric of black American anti-racist resistance document the historical relationship between anti-racist and racist discourse in the USA.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0957926512469389">3</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957926512469389">Bacon (1999)</xref> examines the speeches and writings of black American abolitionists to reveal how they used the rhetoric of the Declaration of Independence and the American Revolution to include black Americans in the American democratic project and to justify the use of armed resistance and war to dismantle slavery. Black American abolitionists re-defined ‘freedom,’ ‘liberty,’ and ‘equality’ as the ‘inalienable’ rights of black as well as white Americans and exposed the hypocrisy of white Americans’ defense of slavery through the use of paradox, irony, and signifying. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0957926512469389">Howard-Pitney (2005)</xref> similarly traces the emergence and recontextualization of a black American jeremiad from the Antebellum to the Civil Rights eras. This rhetorical form shares a moral discourse of declension, repentance, and redemption with the Anglo-American jeremiad, but uses this discourse to hold white Americans accountable for recognizing and redressing racial injustice as the defining ‘sin’ against the American democratic project.</p>
<p>These studies also highlight the dialogic relationship between white and black rhetorics of racism in the USA. Howard-Pitney, for example, documents the co-existence of two variants of the black American jeremiad: a progressive jeremiad directed at holding white Americans accountable for recognizing their role in racial inequality and their responsibility for redressing it, and a conservative jeremiad directed at the moral betterment and racial uplift of the black community. Progressive jeremiads gain force when white progressivism is ascendant, while conservative jeremiads gain force when whites retreat from democratic movements and focus on private self-interests.</p>
<p>Importantly, white American rhetoric has also responded to and been shaped by black American rhetoric. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957926512469389">Condit and Lucaites (1993a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957926512469389">1993b)</xref> document the efforts black Americans have made since colonial times to expand the meaning of ‘equality’ to apply to ‘all’ people and to include social and material equality, a conception of citizenship based on the historical fact of being in America rather than on racial determinants, and an activist role for government in promoting and defending equality across all these dimensions. White progressives have historically taken up these black linguistic innovations to craft, enact, and justify policies premised on this expansive notion of equality. Conversely, the new racism among white Americans can be viewed as a response to the success of the Civil Rights movement and the multiculturalism it has sparked. These movements have exposed racial inequality and injustice and fundamentally challenged the political, social, and moral grounding of white privilege. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0957926512469389">Gresson (1995)</xref> views the new racism as a rhetoric of recovery through which white Americans seek to re-establish their moral superiority and deny their continued racial privilege through characterizing themselves as the victims of black Americans who ‘play the race card’ to obtain undeserved advantages.</p>
<p>Though anti-racist discourse in the USA has historically reflected on and responded to racist discourse, it also draws on discursive practices developed by subordinated groups over the course of their particular historical experiences. In their study of the public rhetorics of black Civil Rights leaders Martin Luther King, Jr and Malcolm X, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0957926512469389">Lucaites and Condit (1990)</xref> document a counter-cultural black rhetoric that introduces new narratives, characterizations, and conceptualizations into the dominant cultural repertoire. In contrast to King, who employed a culturetypal rhetoric that incorporated the dominant conceptualization of equality as the recognition of sameness, Malcolm X re-conceptualized equality as the separation of blacks and whites into socio-politically autonomous communities. This separatist conceptualization depended on the inversion of the dominant characterization of white superiority and black inferiority. Throughout his speeches, Malcolm X positively (re)characterized black Americans by emphasizing their African heritage and linking them to a global ‘black majority.’ Conversely, he drew on African narratives and black American folk traditions to characterize whites as devils, oppressors, snakes, and self-interested hypocrites. Condit and Lucaites argue that the co-existence of culturetypal and counter-cultural rhetoric was essential to the success of the Civil Rights movement and contributed to a uniquely black American rhetoric that praises equality as a sacred term in the dominant public vocabulary, while simultaneously denouncing the contradictions and inconsistencies in the social and political practices associated with it.</p>
<p>Studies of anti-racist discourse extend DHA in several ways. They emphasize the dialogic nature of race talk. The contemporary discourses of racism that DHA documents not only reflect the interests of dominant groups; they also respond to contemporary discourses of anti-racism. Indeed, the eschewal of overt racist language and biological explanations of racial inequality that characterize the new racism are responses to anti-racist discourses and movements that have resulted in a liberalization of racial attitudes noted in most Western societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0957926512469389">Goodman and Burke, 2010</xref>). This dialogic relationship is particularly salient to interactional analyses. Acknowledging it helps identify the ways in which dominant discourses of racism incorporate, refract, and resist anti-racist discourse. The studies also point to the need to take into account distinctive anti-racist discursive practices that reflect, in part, the unique discursive practices developed by subordinated groups.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>In this article, we analyze the discursive strategies that a multi-racial group of US youths employed as they talked about contemporary race and racism during a discussion they held in their high school English classroom. This data is drawn from a larger study, conducted by the first author, that examines the English curriculum as the site for the construction of cultural memory of race and racism in the USA. Specifically, that study examines the conversations about race and racism in the USA sparked by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0957926512469389">Harper Lee’s (1960)</xref> novel <italic>To Kill a Mockingbird</italic> (<italic>TKAM</italic>) by examining how the novel is talked and written about in national newspapers and journals, teachers’ journals and curricular guides, and finally, in classrooms in nine schools across the USA. <italic>TKAM</italic> holds a unique place in the nation’s cultural imagination. It is a key text in the construction and contestation of the nation’s cultural memory of race and racism. Since its publication in 1960, it has become one of the most widely read novels in US middle and high schools. The novel explores the coming of age of two white children, Scout and Jem Finch, in the 1930s Jim Crow South. Scout and Jem learn about racial injustice as they observe their father, attorney Atticus Finch, defend Tom Robinson, a black man falsely accused of, imprisoned, and ultimately killed for raping a white woman. <italic>TKAM</italic> has been heralded as an anti-racist text and Atticus Finch has become an iconic white American anti-racist hero.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0957926512469389">4</xref></sup> In 2010, the novel’s 50th anniversary was commemorated in the national and international press. While the overwhelming majority of commemoratory texts praised the book’s anti-racist stance, some commentators questioned the heroism of Atticus Finch’s incrementalist approach to ending racism and challenged Lee’s trivialization of lynching and the Ku Klux Klan. These criticisms echoed those made in 1960 by black American educators who condemned the novel’s portrayal of black Americans as passive victims. Indeed, Tom Robinson, the physically crippled black American man at the novel’s center, typifies what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0957926512469389">Toni Morrison (1992)</xref> calls the Africanist presence in American literature. Tom’s oppression and victimization highlight Atticus’ heroic agency and Jem and Scout’s moral development.</p>
<sec id="section5-0957926512469389">
<title>Data collection and analysis</title>
<p>During the 2009–2010 school year, the first author spent one to two weeks in each of nine case study classrooms, constructing narrative observations of all classroom discussions and activities about <italic>TKAM</italic>, interviewing teachers and students, and collecting copies of curricular materials and students’ written work. The total data collected included 70 student interviews, 9 teacher interviews, and approximately 50 hours of classroom observation.</p>
<p>This article draws on interview and observational data<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0957926512469389">5</xref></sup> the first author collected in a ninth grade classroom led by Ms Quincy, in Bordertown High,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0957926512469389">6</xref></sup> a school in a predominantly white suburb bordering a majority black city. In 2010, 72% of Bordertown’s students were white, 26% were black, and 2% were Latino, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian. The racial demographics of Ms Qunicy’s classroom reflected these school-wide demographics. Importantly, Bordertown High had been part of larger metropolitan racial integration efforts for several decades. Like several other suburban districts, Bordertown was part of a racial desegregation decree during the 1980s and 1990s. After the decree was lifted, Bordertown continued to participate, during the 2000s, in a voluntary transfer program that brought black students from the city to the school.</p>
<p>The present article focuses on the student-led discussion of what Ms Quincy called ‘the progress of race relations in the US.’ After students completed reading and writing about <italic>TKAM</italic>, Ms Quincy assigned three journalistic texts about events that garnered national attention in 2009 and 2010. We describe these texts below. Ms Quincy asked students to read the texts in light of two questions: (1) ‘How does the mistreatment of some of us affect all of us?’ and (2) ‘How much has our society moved beyond the racial issues in Maycomb (<italic>TKAM’s</italic> setting) and how many still remain in our world today?’ Prior to assigning these texts, Ms Quincy also showed and provided students with a transcript of then-presidential candidate Barack Obama’s 2008 ‘Towards a More Perfect Union’ speech, in which he explicitly addressed issues of race and racism in the USA. Though students focused the class discussion on the news texts, they also recontextualized Obama’s speech in the discussion. These recontextualizations shaped the discussion in important ways.</p>
<p>Following DHA, we jointly coded the transcript of the class discussion for the following discursive strategies: referential, definitional, framing, mitigation/intensification, and <italic>topoi</italic>. Topoi, as used in DHA, are recurrent argumentation schemes that belong to ‘the obligatory premises’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0957926512469389">Reisigl and Wodak, 2001</xref>). They connect the argument with the conclusion and are intended to make an audience draw a particular inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0957926512469389">Wodak, 2006</xref>). Topoi have been central to DHA analysis of racist discourse because they provide warrants for the fallacious arguments widely adopted in prejudiced discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0957926512469389">Krzyzanowski and Wodak, 2009</xref>). Given our interest in examining the interaction of racist and anti-racist talk, we paid particular attention to how topoi provide the grounds for legitimizing some perspectives and dismissing and delegitimizing others. After coding the discussion transcript, we jointly coded interview transcripts to identify the same types of discursive strategies.</p>
<p>As we jointly coded the transcripts, we continually tested our interpretations through engaging with and resolving disagreements that arose between us. The joint coding also allowed us to identify disconfirming evidence and to check the strength of our interpretations against it. The triangulation of interview and observation data further enabled us to check the trustworthiness of our interpretations and to identify how different speech events (interviews versus classroom talk) shaped students’ discursive strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0957926512469389">Glesne, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0957926512469389">Merriam, 2002</xref>). As a white American woman and two black American women, reading the classroom and interview transcripts together raised continual questions about race and racism for us. Our ongoing conversations about these questions helped us to identify the different student discourse strategies and their social and historical references, and to question and enrich our interpretations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0957926512469389">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>Analysis and discussion</title>
<p>Before presenting our analysis of the classroom discussion, we briefly describe the content and discursive strategies in the three articles that Ms Quincy asked students to read prior to the discussion. Each text described an event that had stirred national debate about contemporary racism in 2009 and 2010. The texts thus provide a window into the discourses of race and racism circulating in American contemporary culture at the historical moment in which the students’ discussion occurred.</p>
<sec id="section7-0957926512469389">
<title>Race and racism in news texts</title>
<p>Prior to the discussion we examine, Ms Quincy asked students either to find an article that addressed issues of race and racism in contemporary America or to read one of three articles she made available to them. All students chose to read the latter. The first article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0957926512469389">Fantz, 2009</xref>), taken from the Cable News Network (CNN) website, reported reactions to a <italic>New York Post</italic> editorial cartoon in which two white policemen shoot a chimpanzee while stating ‘They’ll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill.’ The article’s opening sentence establishes its intent to report on ‘varied’ reactions to the cartoon. After explaining that the cartoonist employed a ‘typical editorial cartoon trope’ of merging two current news stories – the police shooting of a chimpanzee after it mauled its owner and President Obama’s signing of the stimulus bill – the article reports the reactions of several ‘black opinion makers’ who ‘blast’ the cartoon as ‘an attack’ on President Obama and black Americans. These ‘black opinion makers’ denounce the association of the chimpanzee with President Obama as overtly racist by evoking the historical use of such images by white Americans to degrade black Americans. The black leaders characterize knowledge of this historical reference as ‘common sense.’ Jelani Cobb, a history professor at Spelman College – an historically black college – is quoted as asserting that ‘anyone with an iota of sense’ is aware of this racist association. The remainder of the article cites cartoonists and news editors, whose professional identities are emphasized while their racial identities are excluded. These individuals criticize the cartoonist and editor for their ‘clumsy handling’ of current events. The only reference to race or racism comes in the form of a quote from the <italic>New York Post</italic> editor, who characterizes one of the black American ‘opinion makers’ quoted in the beginning of the article as ‘nothing more than a publicity opportunist.’</p>
<p>Though the text gives some prominence, in terms of location, to claims by black Americans that the editorial cartoon was racist, subsequent references to the cartoon as containing a ‘typical editorial cartoon trope’ and to the cartoonist and editor’s ‘clumsy handling’ of the events mitigate the cartoon’s racist imagery. In addition, references to the black Americans cited in the article as ‘blast(ing)’ the cartoon as ‘an attack’ and referring to people who don’t see the cartoon as racist as lacking ‘sense,’ evoke racial stereotypes of angry and aggressive blacks. Taken together with the professionalization strategies used to exclude the racial identities of the cartoonists and editor who defend the cartoon, these mitigation and perspectival strategies cast doubt on initial assertions that the cartoon was racist. The article thus embeds an argumentation structure of ‘It might be racist, but …’. As we show below, this argumentation structure appears to be one that gets recontextualized in the students’ race talk in Ms Qunicy’s class.</p>
<p>The second article was a <italic>New York Times</italic> column about the arrest of Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr, a black American, for ‘disorderly conduct’ after he was falsely accused by a neighbor of breaking into his own house (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957926512469389">Goodnough, 2009</xref>). The article is framed by assertions from Gates’ colleagues that define the incident as an act of racism. The first five paragraphs of the article report these assertions. Five paragraphs in the middle of the article present quotes from the police officer’s report of the incident. The article then ends with one of Gates’ colleagues, a Harvard medical professor, questioning ‘whether this kind of egregious act would have happened had Professor Gates been a white professor.’</p>
<p>Though the article is framed by statements that define the incident as racist, the referential and perspectival strategies used in the article undercut this definition. While Professor Gates is described as ‘Harvard’s most prominent scholar of Black American history’ in the opening sentence, his racial identity is never directly stated. Instead, it is revealed through a quote drawn from the police report in which Gates questions the officer’s investigation of him by asking: ‘Why, because I’m a black man in America?’ The racial identity of the arresting officer, who was identified in other reports as white, is also excluded in this article. He is referred to only by his occupational role, as ‘Sergeant Crowley.’ Significantly, neither Gates nor Crowley is directly quoted in the article; Gates’ colleagues speak for him and Gates’ and Crowley’s statements appear only in the form of quotes taken from the latter’s written police report. The professionalization references and use of indirect rather than direct speech mitigates the racial subtext of the conflict. The racial subtext is further suppressed in the title: ‘Harvard professor jailed; officer is accused of bias.’ The article thus contains both racialization and deracialization references that simultaneously recognize and suppress the incident’s racial dimensions.</p>
<p>The third article Ms Quincy made available to her students was a <italic>New York Times</italic> op-ed column by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957926512469389">Maureen Dowd (2009)</xref>, a white journalist, about Senator Joe Wilson, a white senator from South Carolina, yelling ‘You lie’ at President Barack Obama, the first black US president, during the latter’s first State of the Union speech. Dowd employs a topos of history to argue that Wilson’s statement was racially motivated and that she heard an ‘unspoken’ ‘boy’ at the end of the outburst, a reference to the racist practice of referring to black men as ‘boys.’ Dowd substantiates her interpretation of Wilson’s outburst through a series of historical references to the nation’s and Wilson’s racist past. In contrast to the other texts, Dowd racializes the white individuals involved. The column opens with a description of President Obama and Nancy Pelosi, the first female Speaker of the House of Representatives, ‘surrounded by middle-aged white guys,’ which Dowd refers to as ‘a sepia snapshot of the days when such pols ran Washington like their own men’s club.’ Dowd then goes on to reference Wilson’s membership in the Sons of Confederate Veterans and his advocacy for flying the Confederate flag over South Carolina’s state capital. Dowd’s several references to the Civil War and South Carolina’s role in it highlight the racial subtext of Wilson’s outburst. These references link the past to the present and the collective white guilt for past racial injustices with present day individual guilt for persistent racial prejudice. At the same time, the repeated references to the Confederacy and to the South, and to the ‘others’, the Southern whites, constructs them as the racist whites from which Dowd, a white woman, implicitly distances herself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957926512469389">Benwell, 2012</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section8-0957926512469389">
<title>Students’ classroom race talk</title>
<p>Though Ms Quincy framed the discussion around the topic of ‘the progress of race relations,’ students focused their discussion on determining whether the contemporary incidents described in the three articles constituted acts of racism. The students began the discussion by considering whether the editorial cartoon was racist. They then moved on to the editorial about Senator Wilson’s outburst during President Obama’s speech before discussing the article about the arrest of Harvard Professor Gates Jr. After the students had discussed each article, Ms Quincy explicitly returned to her initial framing question and asked the students to consider whether ‘race relations’ had changed in the USA since the Jim Crow era (<italic>TKAM</italic>’s setting).</p>
<p>The students in Ms Quincy’s class employed several discursive strategies in their discussion of the incidents described in the news texts. White students used many of the strategies associated with the new racism, such as racial reversals, trivializations, and defensive strategies, to deny that the incidents involved racism. Rather than explore those strategies here, we focus on the white students’ use of the topos of unknowability. This was a recurrent argumentative scheme that white students employed throughout the discussion to counter claims, made mostly by their black peers, that the incidents in the news texts involved racism. We then explore the topos of implicature that black students in Ms Quincy’s class employed to counter the topos of unknowability and the new racism strategies associated with it. We then explore how students employed and negotiated these topoi and referential and mitigation strategies to variously suppress and grapple with the history of racial injustice in the USA, its present day legacy, and questions of guilt, responsibility, and redress.</p>
<sec id="section9-0957926512469389">
<title>The topos of unknowability: ‘you don’t really know’</title>
<p>Throughout the discussion, several white youths in Ms Quincy’s classroom used a topos of unknowability to argue that the incidents depicted in the news texts were not racist because it was impossible to ever definitively ‘know’ another person’s intentions at any particular moment. Individual actions and speech could not, therefore, be deemed racist. The following exchange illustrates white students’ use of the topos of unknowability. In it, students argued over the meaning of the image of the monkey in the editorial cartoon. Some students argued that the image was racist because of the historical use of such images by white Americans to denigrate black Americans. While a black student, Tanya, was the first to make this claim, some white students took up this claim as well. Other students, all white, challenged the claim on the grounds that no one could discern the cartoonist’s intentions.</p>
<p><graphic id="img1-0957926512469389" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_0957926512469389-img1.tif"/></p>
<p>Tanya opens the discussion about the editorial cartoon by recontextualizing the assertions made by the black Americans as cited in the news text that the cartoon image was racist because it echoed the historical use of ape imagery by white Americans to stereotype and degrade black Americans. Nate counters Tanya’s assertion by associating the cartoon image with the previous, white, US president, George W Bush, to define the image as a political trope. Bush and Obama are political figures; it is their office, not their race, that matters (lines 3–5). This politicization de-racializes the cartoon’s imagery and denies its racial history. Keith responds by introducing the topos of unknowability into the discussion. After establishing a middle ground (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0957926512469389">Fozdar, 2008</xref>) – ‘it could go either way,’ between Tanya and Nate’s assertions – he shifts the grounds of the argument onto questions of individual intentions. Though he concludes by asserting that the image ‘could definitely come across as racist’ (lines 7–8), his repeated use of mental verbs (‘know,’ ‘think,’ ‘intended to’) and frequent self-correction inflect his conclusion with considerable ambiguity that contradicts its definitiveness. Because he does not know what the cartoonist actually intended with the image, Keith cannot ‘definitely’ assert that the cartoon is actually racist (lines 6–8).</p>
<p>In the final comment, Sarah fully articulates the topos of unknowability that Keith introduces. Sarah repeatedly uses mental verbs – such as ‘thinking,’ ‘know,’ and ‘mean’ – and hedges – that is ‘might be,’ ‘seems,’ ‘could be,’ ‘depends’ – to emphasize the impossibility of knowing the cartoonist’s mental processes and intentions and, therefore, of interpreting the image as racist. Sarah does recognize Tanya’s initial assertion that the cartoon was racist because of the historical use of ape imagery by white Americans to denigrate black Americans, in lines 15 and 16. She does so, however, to invalidate and dismiss it. Sarah’s use of and stress on ‘could’ (line 15) questions the historical accuracy of Tanya’s assertion, while the alternative interpretation of the cartoon that she offers both de-racializes and de-historicizes its imagery.</p>
<p>The topos of unknowability employed by white students in Ms Quincy’s classroom is thus a type of knowledge management strategy. In her study of the denial of Austrian anti-Semitic war crimes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0957926512469389">Wodak (2006)</xref> found that Austrians of the World War II generation repeatedly use mental verbs, particularly ‘knowing,’ to mitigate their collective responsibility for these war crimes on the grounds that, since they did not have first-hand experience of these actions they could not know whether those actions constituted war crimes, and they could not be held collectively or individually responsible for them. The white students in Ms Quincy’s class also used the topos of unknowability to mitigate the racist actions described in the news texts. The topos of unknowability does not, however, rest on claims that the students could not determine if the actions being discussed were racist because the students did not personally observe them, but on the fact that no one can ever discern another person’s individual intentions. The topos of unknowability thus intensifies the topos of not knowing that Wodak identifies, by denying the very possibility of knowing itself. The topos of unknowability thus renders judgment and the attribution of guilt for racist actions, both past and present, impossible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0957926512469389">
<title>The topos of implicature: ‘you still got people who are not over those historical wounds’</title>
<p>Black students in Ms Quincy’s class employed a topos of implicature to counter the topos of unknowability and the broader new racism discourse employed by their white peers. We draw the term implicature from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0957926512469389">McPhail (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957926512469389">Bacon’s (2003)</xref> analyses of the rhetoric of racism in the USA. Implicature, according to McPhail and Bacon, emphasizes the interrelatedness of the black and white American experience and of the past and present. It is grounded on the premise that present day racial prejudices and inequalities have their roots in past racial injustices, particularly in the cultural trauma of slavery and the betrayal of Reconstruction with the imposition of Jim Crow segregationist laws and white supremacist ideology. Importantly, the topos of implicature implicates white Americans in perpetuating and benefitting from their racial power and privilege over and in relation to black Americans.</p>
<p>The recurrent debates about slavery reparations indicate that questions about responsibility for and redress of past racial injustice, particularly slavery, remain unresolved in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957926512469389">Bacon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0957926512469389">Hatch, 2008</xref>). Though the USA is an increasingly racially and ethnically diverse society, these questions remain central to race relations, race talk, and racial justice in the USA. Questions of responsibility for slavery and its relationship to present day racial inequality became the focal point of the discussion among Ms Quincy’s students after the teacher attempted to direct the discussion onto her original questions about whether the nation had made racial progress. After the students had discussed the third news text, Ms Quincy asked them to consider the extent to which the racial inequality depicted in the novel, <italic>TKAM</italic>, persisted in the contemporary USA. Nate, a white student, dismissed her question as irrelevant:</p>
<p><graphic id="img2-0957926512469389" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_0957926512469389-img2.tif"/></p>
<p>Nate’s comments trivialize claims of racial prejudice by characterizing them as ‘too touchy.’ In addition, he evokes a discontinuous conception of history in which the past should be separated from the present. Racism is something that the nation has overcome and that we should ‘move on’ from. Efforts to recognize its persistence are the problem, not the actual racism itself. Overcoming racial prejudice and racism thus relies on individuals not letting ‘it get to’ them. Nate’s comment thus incorporates several elements of the new racism.</p>
<p>Jasmine, a black student, counters Nate’s comment by asserting a continuous conception of history.</p>
<p><graphic id="img3-0957926512469389" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_0957926512469389-img3.tif"/></p>
<p>While Nate focused on the response by the targets of racism, Jasmine expands the focus to include the perpetrators. She uses relationalization to refer to black people as victims of white oppressors. This contrasts sharply with Nate’s exclusion of any group or racial markers. Jasmine also asserts a continuous version of history that links past and present and black and white Americans in a dynamic of oppression and privilege established 400 years ago by the trauma of slavery. Both black and white Americans bear the ‘historical wounds’ of this trauma, a reference to Obama’s use of the term in his ‘Towards a More Perfect Union’ speech. Here, Jasmine recontextualizes the term in the form of the topos of implicature that is grounded in the assumption that past racial injustice – here, slavery – continues to shape the lives and psyches of both black and white Americans.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0957926512469389">
<title>Negotiating questions of guilt and responsibility</title>
<p>The topos of implicature makes explicit the questions of guilt, responsibility, and redress for past and present racial injustice, questions that the topos of unknowability suppresses. As they engaged these questions, the white students in Ms Quincy’s class employed several mitigation strategies both to deny collective and individual responsibility and to manage their self-presentations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957926512469389">Benwell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957926512469389">Every and Augoustinos, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0957926512469389">Van Dijk, 1992</xref>). Black students also had to manage their self-presentations. Talking about race and racism in the public sphere of the classroom presents difficult social challenges for both white and black students. Black students struggle to press their claims and to hold their white peers accountable for at least recognizing the present day legacies of past racial injustices without appearing as the stereotypical angry black of the new racism. As we show below, the black students use mitigation strategies to soften the accusations of racism that they are making.</p>
<sec id="section12-0957926512469389">
<title>Mitigation, relativization, and reversals</title>
<p>Several white students in Ms Quincy’s class employed mitigation and relativization strategies to shift responsibility for the trauma of slavery and its legacy in contemporary racism onto Africans and black Americans.</p>
<p><graphic id="img4-0957926512469389" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_0957926512469389-img4.tif"/></p>
<p>In this exchange, Tim equates the trans-Atlantic slave trade with African slavery (lines 1–2). This relativization mitigates white Americans’ responsibility for the horrors of slavery by implicating African ‘kings’ in it. Tim thus inflects the topos of implicature to mitigate rather than acknowledge white collective guilt for slavery; slavery is ‘not entirely’ white Americans’ fault (line 5), but also the fault of Africans.</p>
<p>The students’ use of pronouns in this exchange is central to their negotiation of questions of guilt and responsibility for slavery and its present day legacy. Through it, the youths construct and navigate opposing collective racial identities of ‘us’ and ‘them,’ here ‘we’ and ‘you,’ and the relationship between these collective racial identities and their individual identities. Prior to this point in the discussion, students had used a generalized ‘you’ that evoked a universalized, de-racialized individual. Jasmine’s comment about the historical wounds of slavery exemplifies this usage (Excerpt 3). In Excerpt 4, however, the students use ‘we’ and ‘you’ to evoke their collective racial identities and impose these identities on each other. Tim uses ‘we’ and ‘you’ to make explicit Jasmine’s and his own racial identities and to tie not only white and black Americans to slavery, but also to implicate both Jasmine and himself personally in it.</p>
<p>Significantly, Jasmine takes up Tim’s personalization by using ‘we’ to refer to black people. She does not, however, use ‘you’ to associate Tim with whites. Instead, she uses the abstraction, ‘white people,’ but does not apply it explicitly to Tim; she does not impose a white collective identity on Tim. Jasmine’s use of this abstraction strategy mitigates her initial assertion of white guilt. She argues here that she is ‘not blaming’ Tim or his ancestors, but white people ‘as a race’ for the trauma of slavery. The abstraction helps her navigate the social challenges of making accusations of racism and attributions of responsibility. Jasmine’s repeated use of ‘I’m not saying’ and ‘just’ (lines 6–7) are self-corrections that further soften her accusations and attributions.</p>
<p>At the same time, Jasmine does not fully alleviate white Americans of guilt and responsibility for slavery and its legacy of racial inequality. She maintains that ‘people’ will be ‘stuck’ on the legacy of slavery because ‘white people had control over black people’ for hundreds of years (lines 6–10). The effects of that trauma persist, even if white people like Tim (note Jasmine’s use of ‘you’ rather than ‘white people’ in the last sentence) acknowledge it or not. Importantly, as she moves between abstraction and personalization, Jasmine incorporates and inflects the topos of unknowability. She asserts that ‘whether or not you (white Americans, including Tim) know it,’ the legacy of slavery continues to shape contemporary racial relations. In this way, Jasmine uses the topos of unknowability not to establish the impossibility of knowing if an action or image is racist, but to establish the impossibility of forgetting the trauma of slavery.</p>
<p>Tessia, a white student, picks up on questions of guilt in her response to Jasmine. Amplifying Tim’s relativization strategy, she employs a racial reversal that positions whites as the victims of black racism. The last exchange of the discussion follows Tessia’s statement:</p>
<p><graphic id="img5-0957926512469389" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_0957926512469389-img5.tif"/></p>
<p>Throughout this exchange, Tessia, Sarah, and Tim, white students, attempt to deflect guilt and responsibility for racial injustice and inequality away from white Americans as a group. Tessia employs a racial reversal which positions whites as victims of black racism. Sarah takes up Jasmine’s reference, made prior to this exchange, to ‘four hundred years’ of slavery and the ‘head start’ or advantage it gave white Americans over black Americans, to trivialize it. Her repeated use of ‘just’ shifts the focus away from issues of racial power, privilege, and oppression and onto internal motivations in the ‘minds’ of individuals who are ‘just concerned about themselves.’</p>
<p>Jasmine employs several strategies that are also reversals in that they incorporate traces of Tessia and Sarah’s arguments to effectively up-end them. In her response to Tessia (lines 5–12), Jasmine takes up her peer’s use of ‘just’ to establish a form of weak agreement. She agrees that racism is ‘a two-way street,’ but does so to locate racism in its historical context and to rename what Tessia called ‘black racism’ as ‘resentment.’ Similarly, in lines 17–20, Jasmine, like Sarah, uses mental verbs to re-establish her own initial association of racism with racial power and with the institution of slavery in the USA (Excerpt 3), both of which Sarah dismisses in lines 13–16. She asserts that ‘people’s mentality is what created the four hundred year advancement.’</p>
<p>Tim’s statement ends the discussion. It represents the final attempt by a white student to justify slavery and mitigate its horrors and immorality. Tim employs a referential strategy of primitivation (the repeated references to ‘little tribes’) and a topos of culture to justify white enslavement of black Africans as the result of the former’s cultural superiority and the latter’s inferiority. Tim’s repeated use of the term ‘stuff’ denigrates African culture and society, while the collocation of ‘blacks’ with ‘stuff’ objectifies black Africans as ‘things’ to be taken and traded by whites.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The purpose of our analysis was to identify the discursive properties of US youths’ contemporary race talk. In particular, we sought to identify the discursive strategies used by both white youth and youth of color as they talked together about issues of race and racism. Focusing in particular on the argumentation strategies the youths employed, we identified two prominent topoi: the topos of unknowability and the topos of implicature. By tracing how students employed and negotiated each other’s use of these topoi, our analysis shows how the youths’ race talk was bound up in the ongoing contestation of the cultural memory of race and racism in the USA.</p>
<p>Our analysis contributes to the growing body of research by both sociologists and discourse analysts on the new racism, as it operates in the USA and in Europe, South and North America, and New Zealand and Australia. Like these studies, we found that white students in Ms Quincy’s high school class employed several strategies associated with the new racism, including racial reversals, mitigation, and trivialization. In addition, we identified the topos of unknowability. This topos is particularly relevant to understanding race talk that occurs in multi-racial contexts. The topos of unknowability radically de-contextualizes speech and action from their social, political, and historical contexts. Such de-contextualization denies the creation of a common ground upon which to construct meaning or on which to engage in dialogue. If the meaning of speech and action reside only in the subjective inner thoughts and emotions of individuals, thoughts and emotions that can never be known by others, dialogue cannot occur, judgment cannot be rendered, and responsibility cannot be determined or taken. Further analyses of race talk can explore moments when the topos of unknowability is employed in different situational contexts, in order to identify when it is used to shut down cross-race dialogue and how it can be countered to sustain or open such dialogue.</p>
<p>Our analysis also illuminates the historical roots of the ‘new racism,’ particularly its US variant. Though the new racism rests on a discontinuous conception of history that separates the present from the past and, as such, is a strategy of forgetting, the new racism itself has historical roots. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957926512469389">Eyerman (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957926512469389">Blight’s (2001)</xref> analyses of the construction of the cultural memory of slavery among white and black Americans after the Civil War document the historical use by white Americans of racial reversals to cast themselves as the innocent victims of black aggression. Paternalistic representations of slavery depicted white imposed slavery as civilizing savage and intellectually inferior blacks. During Reconstruction, the image of blacks as violent savages intent on destroying white southern civilization justified the imposition of Jim Crow laws that excluded blacks in all domains of public life, denying them civil and economic rights and opportunities. Importantly, whites imposed Jim Crow laws through unparalleled violence, including lynchings and the burning of entire black communities. The claims of victimhood that white students in Ms Qunicy’s class assert, and the relativization strategies they use to equate African and American slavery and to characterize efforts to expose white racism as ‘total lie(s),’ thus recontextualize the historical rhetoric of white innocence and black aggression. Our analysis thus points to the importance of examining the ways in which national historical contexts shape and inflect new racist discourse.</p>
<p>The strategy of implicature also has historical roots in black American race talk. Since the 1800s, black Americans have sought to expand the American political vocabulary of equality, freedom, and liberty to include blacks and to expose the hypocrisy of whites who espoused this vocabulary while defending and/or practicing slavery. The assertion of the interrelatedness of the black and white American experience has been an important component of this rhetoric. Throughout the discussion in Ms Quincy’s class, black students asserted the existence of shared symbols and the effects of the historical wounds of slavery on both black and white Americans’ psyches to highlight the persistence of racial inequality and injustice. As they did so, they evoked a uniquely black American rhetoric that simultaneously embraces an American public vocabulary of equality and freedom and exposes the inconsistencies between this vocabulary and American social, political, and economic practices in regards to race.</p>
<p>Our examination of the strategy of implicature extends current understandings of the anti-racist discourses of racially subordinated groups. While in the US context this strategy has historical roots in black American anti-racist rhetoric, its emphasis on the interrelatedness of past and present is likely to be an essential component of anti-racist discourse of subordinated groups in other national contexts. This is particularly true in those contexts in which particular racial and ethnic groups have suffered historical marginalization. The strategy of implicature is a strategy of remembering through which such groups advocate both for their inclusion into the moral, social, civil, and economic orders and for redress of past injustices and their present day legacies. By identifying its properties, our analysis can be useful to analyses of the anti-racist discourses of other racially marginalized groups.</p>

<p>We do not use the term implicature in the pragmatic sense as implied meaning.

<p>These studies are particularly relevant to our analysis. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957926512469389">Collins (2003)</xref> notes, issues of race and racism in the USA are fundamentally shaped by and understood through a black–white binary in which black and white Americans are constructed as essentially separate and opposing groups. Other racial and ethnic groups position themselves and are positioned in relation to this binary.</p>

<p>The first author collected all the data during 2009–2010. As a white, middle-aged, professional woman, her social identities undoubtedly shaped students’ responses, particularly in interviews. Students were likely to respond in ways that they felt aligned with the researcher’s own racial views. She addressed this by developing rapport with students initially through discussing their views of <italic>TKAM</italic> and its characters. In addition, she brought opinions from students she had talked to in other schools that expressed varied views about race and racism. This enabled students to voice their opinions in response to other young people’s opinions rather than to the views they ascribed to the researcher.</p>
