<p>At 5pm on Sunday 27 January Kal’s life-supporting ventilator was removed, as there had been no vital signs for the previous 12 hours. The recent poorly publicised listeria outbreak had claimed its third life. He had been in excellent health and was in such good physical condition that he looked far younger than his 68 years. A few weeks prior to this he developed episodic unsteadiness and slurring of speech. His balance deteriorated so rapidly over the next few days that he had to be taken to St George Hospital Kogarah by ambulance on 10 February 2013.</p>
<p>A CT scan revealed numerous areas of intracranial bleeding, and in the absence of fever and signs of inflammation a provisional diagnosis of secondary malignancy in his brain was made which changed a week later when he became febrile and his condition began to deteriorate rapidly. His blood was cultured and the diagnosis of listeria meningoencephalitis was made 9 days after his admission. As his level of consciousness had taken a turn for the worse he was to be intubated later that day in preparation for an urgent craniotomy. The first of two craniotomies was performed the next morning, with the second being done a week later in the night before he died.</p>
<p>The infective agent was later confirmed to have come from a particular brand of cheese that had already caused two deaths, and there were a number of known cases since the end of December but at the time he was hospitalised there had been no precautionary warnings issued by the Department of Health to hospitals or the medical profession. His death was a tragic loss to his family and his numerous friends and patients.</p>
<p>As was his nature, he was calm and courageous when he knew from the day of his admission that he could lose consciousness at any time. He left no stone unturned in preparing his wife and family over the next week that he remained conscious for the eventuality that he may not survive. Only a few of his closest friends were allowed by him to be informed of his condition, in that he did not want people, including his many patients, to be concerned about him even though his outlook for survival was not looking good.</p>
<p>He made his wishes clear that in the event of his passing there should be an open invitation to a party for all who knew him, including his patients, to celebrate the memory of his life. The invitation was to be issued with the funeral notice. His funeral was held on the morning of Saturday 2 February 2013 at St Patrick’s Church Kogarah, and was packed with mourners, such was his popularity. His wake followed at the Georges River Sailing Club overlooking the river he loved and resided by for most of his 36 years worked in Kogarah.</p>
<p>He achieved greatness from humble beginnings in the state of Kerala in India, where he gained his medical degree at the medical school in the city of Kottayam and where he grew up with three brothers and two sisters. After attaining his DPM in 1972 he was awarded an MD for research into the efficacy and effectiveness of rauwolfia alkaloids in the treatment of schizophrenia at the prestigious All India Institute for Medical Sciences in Bangalore in 1974.</p>
<p>In 1975 he immigrated to Australia with his wife and two very young daughters to join the Victorian Government Mental Health Service, where he first worked in Ararat Hospital in country Victoria. In October he came to Sydney to sit for his membership examination for the Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, which he obtained easily. The family moved to Mont Park in Melbourne, and in December 1977 he accepted my invitation and joined me in private practice in Kogarah.</p>
<p>He had planned to move to Sydney the following year to embark on a career in psychiatric research because he had been offered a position at the Neuropsychiatric Institute. Once in private practice he developed a keen interest in the psychotherapies, and commenced the Master of Medicine program in psychotherapy at the University of NSW, and while he learned a lot about the behaviour therapies at that time he developed a strong interest in psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy. He studied privately and completed a Jungian analysis before he specialised in the Kohutian self-psychological approach.</p>
<p>He was an astute investor, a keen sportsman. As a deeply committed family man, he and his wife successfully raised two wonderful daughters. He also leaves four wonderful and talented grandchildren. He was humble about his many achievements and would never speak openly of them as such, but only of the pleasure he gained from the way he achieved his goals.</p>
<p>All who knew him felt that he understood them and cared for them. He respected all people who had self-respect, and for those who had not developed self-respect he gave help and encouragement in finding their self-worth. He believed in self-determination and to quote him, “We make our own good luck.” He valued truthfulness but never to the point of being offensive, as he had a way of saying what was needed in a firm yet caring way that did not give vent to his own feelings of frustration, anger or despair on the rare occasions that such feelings might be present.</p>
<p>Apart from his loving kindness and generosity I found him, as I know others did, to be one of the wisest persons one could hope to know. His presence was always steadfast and measured, and he had the great capacity to rise above his personal situation in showing his care and regard for the other. He was a thorough gentleman. As disciplined and controlled as he would be when the situation required such containment, he retained a boyish sense of fun and relished clowning with his most intimate friends and confidants.</p>
<p>He gave much of himself to his family and friends in India, and had long been a source of strength and support for them. He also gave much to his adopted nation and to his local community as an Honorary Psychiatrist and later a Visiting Medical officer at the St George Hospital and Area Health Service, where he provided many years of virtually free service that included patient care, the training of registrars in psychiatry and the teaching of medical students. He gave up some of his precious spare time to serve in his local Rotary Club, where he did much for his community.</p>
<p>He was passionate about sports, both as a fine athlete since his boyhood and in continuing to maintain his fitness even after having knee surgery a few years back. He was just beginning to reduce his very busy workload and was looking forward to retiring in a few years and relocating to Adelaide, where three of his four grandchildren reside. When a close friend and colleague recently asked him, “What will you do when you retire?” he said, “I will have no trouble. I have my family, my friends and my sport, and I will be able to watch sport for as long as I want.” He had made a great adjustment to the Australian way of life in the country which he and his family regard as home.</p>
