         <p>Over 160 delegates attended BAAF’s last annual Health Group conference in central Birmingham, UK, on 25 June 2012. It was a highly stimulating and informative day, the main presentations and discussion of which are summarised below.</p>

         <title>Infant sensory experiences: reframing and truth-telling</title>
         <p>Helen Oakwater, professional neuro-linguistic programming coach, trainer, adoptive parent and author<italic>,</italic> began the meeting with a quote from Maya Angelou: ‘I’ve learnt that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.’ She gave a powerful description of how early childhood sensory experiences and trauma impact on later behaviour, and encouraged us to think about how the absence of food, water, love or eye contact might be <italic>felt</italic> by the baby or child, by inviting us to put ourselves in the place of nine-month-old ‘Tim’, left alone for hours, hungry and dirty in his cold and dark room while hearing verbal and physical abuse downstairs. Children will store sensory memories of trauma and neglect, deeply embedded like pieces of shrapnel, and metaphorically enclose themselves in bubble-wrap for protection, while presenting a false picture of good emotional health to the outside world. However, specific sensory stimuli, such as a particular smell, touch or taste, can trigger these memories and cause apparently inexplicable negative reactions, perhaps many years later, resulting in conflict with adoptive parents who don’t have sufficient knowledge of the child’s background or understanding of their behaviours.</p>
         <p>In order for children to make sense of their experiences these need to be reframed to enable healing to take place; children must know the full truth of what has happened to be able to do this and also to keep themselves safe. Clearly, truth must be imparted in an age-appropriate manner: Ms Oakwater used the concept of a Jigsaw of Truth and linking this to sensory triggers as the child moves down the time-line, to describe how knowledge can be built up incrementally over the years, from a simple four-piece puzzle for a young child to a complex 1000-piece one by adulthood. Reframing is often life-long.</p>

         <title>Contact and truth</title>
         <p>Dr Lorne Loxterkamp, consultant child and adolescent psychotherapist, urged us to challenge the commonly held assumption that post-adoption contact between children and their birth families is in the child’s best interests, even when the contact is apparently beneficial. Proponents of contact argue that it is essential for a child’s sense of identity, that it ameliorates painful feelings of loss and rejection associated with adoption, that it helps promote secure attachments to the adoptive family by reducing feelings of longing for the birth family, and that it prevents later shocks (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0308575913478781">Loxtercamp, 2009</xref>). Dr Loxtercamp dismissed these arguments as misleading, explaining that a healthy identity derives from acceptance of what one believes to be good but also from rejection of the negative. To paint too positive a picture of neglectful and abusive birth parents, with sanitised explanations excusing their behaviour, is deceptive, confusing and denies children the truth, ultimately risking the child’s ability to form a secure attachment with the adoptive family. He reiterated the previous speaker’s advocacy of age-appropriate, step-by-step truth-telling, in which children are given the facts in greater detail as they mature, thereby avoiding potential acute distress in later life when the real truth emerges. For contact to have value, it must be meaningful, the birth parents must acknowledge their abusive behaviour and take responsibility for harming the child, and it should aim at the truth.</p>

         <title>Genetics and neurobiology</title>
         <p>Dr Eamon McCrory, consultant psychologist in the Developmental Risk and Resilience Unit at University College London, took us through recent developments in the neurobiology and genetics of childhood maltreatment. We already know about the association between maltreatment and atypical development of the hypothalamic-pituitary Adrenal axis stress response, which may predispose to psychiatric vulnerability in adulthood. There is now a growing body of research showing evidence for structural and functional brain differences associated with maltreatment and an increasing interest in the genetics of resilience and vulnerability. Although there are no specific genes for psychiatric disorders associated with maltreatment, there are many genetic variants, each adding a small increment of vulnerability to, or protection from, such a disorder. For example, differences in the serotonin transporter gene are associated with both structural and functional brain differences: carriers of the SS genotype have been shown to have smaller cingulate and amygdale volumes and to show an increased brain response to adverse facial expressions. It is postulated that in evolutionary terms, in a normal rearing environment this genotype may be an adaptive advantage by conferring greater sensitivity to the feelings of others, but in an abusive setting the gene–environment interaction results in increased susceptibility to depression. However, it has also been shown that positive environmental influences, such as regular contact with a trusted adult and good caregiving, can ameliorate genetic and environmental risk. Epigenetics refers to the environmental regulation of gene expression, which occurs without changes to the underlying DNA sequence whereby differential DNA methylation suppresses gene activity. This is a relatively new area of research in childhood maltreatment, but aims to increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which gene expression is influenced by exposure to adverse and protective factors and may provide an explanation for the different outcomes in identical twins.</p>
         <p>In 2001, Pollak et al used event-related brain potentials (ERPs), which measure surface brain electrical activity, to demonstrate how physically abused children had greater responses to angry faces when compared with controls, suggesting that physical maltreatment increases a child’s sensitivity to social cues associated with threat in the environment. Dr McCrory reported on his own recent study, the first in children using fMRI to investigate the effect of maltreatment at home on brain function, which showed increased right amygdala and bilateral anterior insula reactivity to threat in child victims of family violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0308575913478781">McCrory et al, 2011</xref>). He suggests that this altered responsiveness can act as a latent neural risk factor for later psychopathology. Thus, children’s exposure to physical abuse alters the way in which the brain processes emotion, and may result in greater hypervigilance and sensitivity to angry faces. While this can confer protective advantage in an abusive home environment, it will also have a negative effect on behaviour and performance outside the home, for example in school.</p>
         <p>Exposure to childhood maltreatment can also alter the structure of key areas in the brain. There is good evidence for reduced corpus callosum volume and more recent evidence for greater amygdala volume in late-adopted, previously institutionalised children when compared with an early adopted group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0308575913478781">Mehta et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0308575913478781">Tottenham et al, 2010</xref>). Hippocampal volume appears to be normal in abused children and findings in childhood are mixed for the pre-frontal cortex (PFC), but there is a consistent finding of reduced hippocampal and PFC volume in adults with histories of abuse. Variations in developmental timing and age of measurement may partly account for these observed differences and it is suggested that different brain regions are likely to have their own unique sensitive periods to the effects of early stress.</p>
         <p>Crucially, we don’t have evidence that these structural and functional changes in the brain are fixed. Dr McCrory concluded by reminding us of the role of the frontal lobes in higher order cognitive skills such as emotional regulation, empathy and perspective-taking, and of the marked neurobiological changes which occur in the frontal lobes during adolescence. This period of brain plasticity may be highly significant in allowing new learning and healing to take place.</p>

         <title>Putting the evidence into practice</title>
         <p>David Trickey, consultant clinical psychologist from the child bereavement and trauma service, CHUMS (www.chums.uk.com), followed on with a discussion of how to put these research findings into practice. He stressed the importance of a quality assessment for accurate diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder, conduct disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and reactive attachment disorder, and reiterated the need to differentiate inattentiveness and hyperactivity from hypervigilance/hyperarousal because the interventions required are different. Therapy can be difficult in children who are constantly scanning their environment for perceived threats, for example, by misinterpreting the therapist’s facial expressions, but the therapeutic relationship may also be important to scaffold emotional regulation and enable trauma-focused work. Therapy involves bringing to mind the adverse experiences, formulation of a truthful narrative and making useful meaning of it (cognitive restructuring). Many children are unable to bring to mind their most traumatic memories, which remain ‘wrapped up’ like little parcels in the brain. Mr Trickey gave an example of one young person who described his bad memories as scrunched up pieces of paper in a waste-basket, which would be taken out one by one during therapy, read and then neatly replaced. This allowed ‘space’ in his brain for school work and everyday life, although the pieces of paper sometimes inadvertently ‘fell out’ out when least expected. Careful preparation, including the use of relaxation techniques, is required prior to trauma therapy because the child must be calm before therapy and be able to calm him or herself afterwards. This cannot take place if the child remains in an abusive situation or an unstable placement and does not feel safe. It is also very difficult to dissociate sensory experiences related to past events if the child is still having contact with abusive parents and therefore exposed to those sensations. Mr Trickey finished on the positive note of recent research on brain plasticity and the potential for reversal of the adverse effects of abuse by good caregiving and therapy.</p>

         <title>Neglect: A social and cultural construct?</title>
         <p>The afternoon began with a session aimed at identifying the difficulties we all face in deciding a threshold for professional intervention in cases of neglect. Entitled ‘Is neglect socially/culturally constructed?’, Craig Wilkinson, social worker and trainer consultant from BAAF Cymru, began with a discussion on the meaning of the term ‘neglect’ for lay people and how public understanding does not mirror professional definitions. He stressed the importance of making child-centred decisions and having clear standards and referral thresholds. However, he wondered whether our services might be too process or resource led, and by taking us through a series of common dilemmas, questioned the degree to which cultural, social class and regional values and attitudes influence our judgement in setting thresholds.</p>

         <title>The role of the Family Drug and Alcohol Court</title>
         <p>Dr Mike Shaw, consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist at the Tavistock Clinic, gave a brief overview of the work of the Family Drug and Alcohol Court (FDAC), a multi-agency team of professionals from the Tavistock Clinic, Coram and the Inner London Family Proceedings Court. FDAC designs a ‘trial for change’ to test whether parents can overcome their drug and alcohol problems and meet their children’s needs in the child’s timeframe. A multi-agency plan is agreed, with court authority, which has clear expectations of parents to abstain from street drugs and alcohol, address their substance misuse difficulties and create a child-centred lifestyle. Parents are given intensive support, including practical and therapeutic intervention. Video interaction guidance involves the parent and therapist watching and discussing clips of positive interaction between the parent and child. It is used to strengthen parent–child relationships, with the aim of promoting communication, sensitivity and attunement to the child and ultimately to form a secure parent–child attachment. Because most families using this service remain within the community, it provides better evidence for future prognosis than a residential setting.</p>

         <title>Children and young people with sexually harmful behaviour</title>
         <p>The final session was led by Christine McCarlie, an independent social work consultant, who described a pathway approach to the management of children and young people with sexually harmful behaviours. This is a heterogeneous group ranging from children with inappropriate behaviour requiring only limited intervention, to those with reactive (non-abusive and not secretive) behaviours, who may have been sexually abused or exposed to inappropriate sexual material, through to abusive behaviours in adolescents who may have witnessed high levels of domestic violence or bullying by others and who have extensive feelings of anger which they release by deliberate abusive behaviour on those more vulnerable. A fourth group of children who have suffered chronic neglect and witnessed high levels of sexual behaviour engage in sexual activity because it makes them feel safe and loved; this latter group has normalised it and will discuss it openly whereas children with reactive or abusive behaviours tend to feel anxious and ashamed. Finding the child’s pathway to sexualised behaviour and the level of functioning at the time of the behaviour is key. Ms McCarlie emphasised the importance of a holistic and systemic approach to risk management and risk reduction, with a planned programme of work involving all the appropriate adults around the young person in the treatment team. The interventions need to be based on the young person’s strengths and the involvement of parents and carers is vital to their success. An individual safety plan is developed to help young people identify and understand their triggers and develop strategies to manage these, at the same time building self-esteem, improving social relationships and enhancing emotional maturity. Using such an approach, Ms McCarlie has found that young people are generally very receptive to therapy and that the prognosis is good.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>This excellent conference covered some very interesting and topical issues relevant to current adoption and fostering practice. The controversies surrounding birth family contact for previously abused children and the importance of truth-telling in life-story work were highlighted through the use of powerful case histories of children at different stages of their lives. Increasing evidence for structural and functional brain differences in maltreated individuals, together with exciting new research into epigenetics and the genetics of vulnerability and resilience, is beginning to provide us with a better understanding of the neurobiological and genetic basis of behaviours in traumatised children and will help to explain the variability of long-term outcomes. The dissemination of important new research findings to all disciplines working with looked after children is essential to help us identify effective interventions, translate evidence into practice and improve long-term outcomes.</p>
