<abstract>
<p>Research on family violence has overwhelmingly focused on a patriarchal model, which inaccurately depicts men as exclusively perpetrators and women as exclusively victims of abusive family acts. In addition, empirical research on sibling abuse in families has been significantly absent from the professional literature. This exploratory study used a survey instrument based on an altered version of the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) to investigate the question of whether significant gender differences exist in the experience of sibling abuse as a child, either as perpetrator or victim. MANOVAs (multivariate analyses of variance) indicate that there are no gender differences related to surviving sibling abuse or perpetrating emotional and physical abuse, whereas it was found that women had a significantly higher rate of perpetration related to sibling sexual abuse. Specific results related to the gender variance of perpetrators are explored. Limitations as well as implications of these findings on treatment, counselor education, and future research are discussed.</p>

<p>For the past four decades issues related to domestic violence have been researched heavily in the mental health field. Bringing the realities of abuse into the public eye has changed perception of family violence from being a private issue to be handled exclusively within the family, to a public issue that affects the entire community at multiple levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512468324">Ammerman &amp; Hersen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512468324">Bess &amp; Janssen, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512468324">Kiselica &amp; Morrill-Richards, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512468324">Phillips-Green, 2002</xref>). There is no doubt great advances have been made in prevention, treatment, and education in regard to family violence; however, the vast majority of research related to this issue has been based on a patriarchal model that purports male figures are overwhelmingly the perpetrators and rarely victims of abuse within the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512468324">Hamel, 2009</xref>). In addition, family violence research has largely ignored the sibling relationship, in spite of the fact that studies have shown experiencing abuse during childhood is the biggest indicator of future abuse for both men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512468324">Caspi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512468324">Morrill-Richards &amp; Leierer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512468324">Phillips-Green, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512468324">Rudd &amp; Herzberger, 1999</xref>). The limited research that has been conducted related to sibling abuse has yet to directly confront the role gender plays in this abusive dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512468324">Caffaro &amp; Conn-Caffaro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512468324">Caspi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512468324">Kiselica &amp; Morrill-Richards, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512468324">Morrill-Richards &amp; Leierer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512468324">Wiehe, 1998</xref>). As such, examining gender as it directly relates to sibling abuse offers a starting point for confronting patriarchal models of abuse while expanding research on an understudied population. This study attempts to build on previous research and address a gap in the literature by using an empirical study to consider the gender differences in cases where sibling abuse has occurred.</p>
<p>In order to begin to understand the role gender plays in cases of sibling abuse, it is first necessary to consider some of the myths regarding gender and abuse. The traditional feminist perspective related to family violence tends to attribute this aggression to social structures that favor men and have historically supported men to use violence against women to maintain control (Dobash &amp; Dobash, 1979; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512468324">Gilfus, Trabold, O’Brien, &amp; Fleck-Henderson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In spite of this well-accepted belief, studies have supported that conceptualizing family violence in this way is inaccurate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512468324">Hamel (2009)</xref> found the patriarchal model most commonly used to frame domestic violence incorrectly assumes that men perpetrate the vast majority of abuse that is considered severe. Results of a study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512468324">Robertson and Murachver (2007)</xref> support that there are few differences between men and women who abuse in regard to frequency, severity, and injury. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512468324">Straus and Gelles (1990)</xref> found that mothers, not fathers, were more often the perpetrators of physical abuse within the family. Recently, research has been conducted that contends when all available data are evaluated, abuse is perpetuated at a relatively equal rate between men and women with women slightly more likely to engage in severe violent acts than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512468324">Gilfus et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512468324">Hamel, 2009</xref>). Accounting for the fact that men are not the only perpetrators of family violence is a crucial step forward in family violence research.</p>
<p>Another misconception surrounding family violence is that men are not abused. In 2009, Cho and Wilke used data from National Crime Victimization Surveys from 1987 to 2003 to examine gender differences in victims of abuse. This study found that men were more likely to experience a higher level of violence considered to be severe than were women, in spite of reporting incidents of abuse less frequently. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512468324">Hamel (2009)</xref> established that men sustain one third of all physical injuries related to family violence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512468324">Bowman and Morgan (1998)</xref> used self-report of college students and outcomes from the 1994 Bureau of Justice National Conference on Domestic Violence to find that 2 million men are battered each year. A groundbreaking study of family violence conducted by Straus and Gelles in 1986 uncovered a trend that while male-on-female violence decreased during the period of 1975-1985, female-on-male violence increased during that same period of time. Bearing in mind that men are often the recipients of abuse is another crucial piece to consider when studying issues of family violence.</p>
<p>In addition to understanding what the commonly held beliefs are related to gender and abuse in general, it is necessary to consider some of the components of sibling abuse specifically. Although sibling abuse has only recently begun to be researched in the family violence field, it has been suggested by numerous studies that it is the most serious and common form of abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512468324">Caffaro &amp; Conn-Caffaro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512468324">Caspi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512468324">Duncan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512468324">Freeman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512468324">Kiselica &amp; Morrill-Richards, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512468324">Morrill-Richards &amp; Leierer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512468324">Wiehe, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512468324">Straus, Gelles, and Steinmetz (1980)</xref> found that as much as 40% of American children engage in physical aggression against siblings and as much as 85% engage in verbal aggression against siblings on a regular basis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512468324">Wiehe (1998)</xref> estimated that as many as 53 out of every 100 children are perpetrators of sibling abuse. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512468324">Goodwin and Roscoe (1990)</xref> used the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512468324">Straus, 1979</xref>) to measure the frequency of abuse in families among 272 high school students, and they found that 60% of the participants reported being either a victim or perpetrator of sibling abuse. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512468324">Straus and Gelles (1990)</xref> conducted a national survey of 8,145 families with a final report reflecting that 80% of children in the age range of 3 to 17 commit some form of violence against a sibling. Data regarding homicide in the United States indicates that siblings perpetrated 6.1% of all murders committed by family members in 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512468324">Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>One reason for the widespread occurrence of sibling abuse is that sibling relationships are unique in their longevity and are one of the most influential relationships in one’s life. In spite of this reality, the significance of sibling relationships is typically minimized by family members and American society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512468324">Caffaro &amp; Conn-Caffaro, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512468324">Newman, 1994</xref>). Even with little research, there are data suggesting sibling abuse is common and has consequences lasting into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512468324">Garey, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512468324">Simonelli, Mullis, Elliott, &amp; Pierce, 2002</xref>). Studies conducted on sibling abuse have found that, as children transition into adulthood, both survivors and perpetrators of sibling abuse are at higher risk of developmental delays, depression, hopelessness, drug abuse, low self-esteem, isolation, and dating violence than those who have not survived or perpetrated sibling abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512468324">Johnston &amp; Freeman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512468324">Phillips-Green, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260512468324">Snyder, Bank, &amp; Burraston, 2005</xref>). The propensity of sibling abuse clearly warrants an exploration of how gender may be influencing perpetration and long-term consequences for those involved.</p>
<sec id="section1-0886260512468324">
<title>Sibling abuse</title>
<p>There are three facets to consider when defining sibling abuse: perception, intent, and severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512468324">Morrill-Richards &amp; Leierer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512468324">Wiehe, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512468324">2000</xref>). Perception refers to how each sibling frames the interaction. For example, if one sibling involved in the sibling dyad views the behavior as abusive, regardless of his or her role as survivor or perpetrator, a dynamic beyond the scope of “normal” sibling rivalry is likely present. The second facet, intent, refers to what a sibling hoped to accomplish through an action or behavior. When sibling abuse is present, the intent of the perpetrating brother or sister is primarily to cause harm rather than to gain access to limited family resources such as space, time, and affection, as is normally the case in healthy rivalry. Severity is related to the duration and intensity of the sibling behavior. As severity increases there is greater probability that the sibling relationship is abusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512468324">Caffaro &amp; Conn-Caffaro, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512468324">Morrill-Richards &amp; Leierer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512468324">Wiehe, 2000</xref>). Perception, intent, and severity exist within three primary categories of sibling abuse: psychological, physical, and sexual.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0886260512468324">
<title>Psychological sibling abuse</title>
<p>Psychological abuse is the most difficult category of abuse to define in the sibling relationship. This form of abuse between siblings is typically not recognized by parents and is often dismissed as normal sibling rivalry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512468324">Wiehe, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512468324">Wiehe (2000)</xref> studied 150 adult survivors of sibling abuse, in which 78% of the participants had experienced psychological abuse, which included belittling, intimidation, provocation, destroying possessions, and torturing and killing pets. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260512468324">Whipple and Finton (1995)</xref> describe psychological abuse as distinct from “normal” behavior based on consistency and intensity. Examples would include words and actions expressing degradation and contempt that have an impact on the sense of well-being (insecurity, lack of self-esteem) of a sibling, such as daily harassing statements like, “No one in this family cares about you and we would all be happier if you were dead,” and, “If you don’t do my chores this week I am going to hurt your pet mouse” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260512468324">Whipple &amp; Finton, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512468324">Wiehe, 1997</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0886260512468324">
<title>Physical abuse</title>
<p>Physical abuse by a sibling is defined as one member of a sibling pair deliberately causing physical harm to the other sibling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512468324">Wiehe, 1997</xref>). In the case of sibling abuse, the intent is to hurt the other sibling for no other motive than to cause physical pain, which often allows the perpetrating sibling to obtain a sense of power in the sibling dyad. Sibling physical abuse is not inclusive of isolated incidents or one-time events of mild physical aggression acted out to obtain access to limited family resources. Physical sibling abuse must include the intent to harm for the sake of injury, the perception by one or more siblings that the action is abusive in nature, and the severity of a repeated pattern of behavior rather than an isolated incident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512468324">Wiehe, 2000</xref>). The harm may be inflicted by shoving, hitting, slapping, kicking, biting, pinching, scratching, and hair pulling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512468324">Caffaro &amp; Conn-Caffaro, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512468324">Wiehe, 2000</xref>). More severe forms of physical abuse by siblings include the use of coat hangers, hairbrushes, belts, sticks, knives, guns and rifles, broken glass, razor blades, and scissors to inflict injury and pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512468324">Wiehe, 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0886260512468324">
<title>Sexual abuse</title>
<p>Sexual abuse and incest among siblings occurs more frequently than any other form of sexual abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512468324">Rudd &amp; Herzberger, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512468324">Wiehe, 1998</xref>). Sibling incest is defined as sexual behavior between siblings that is not age appropriate, not transitory, and not motivated by developmentally appropriate curiosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512468324">Caffaro &amp; Conn-Caffaro, 1998</xref>). Some examples of this behavior include inappropriate fondling, touching, sexual contact, indecent exposure, exposure to pornography, oral sex, anal sex, digital penetration, and intercourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512468324">Phillips-Green, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512468324">Whelan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260512468324">Wiehe, 1990</xref>).</p>

<title>Primary Goal and Hypothesis</title>
<p>The primary goal of this study is to better understand the role of gender in abusive sibling relationships. The research in this study addresses the gap in the literature related specifically to the study of gender and sibling abuse. In order to bring attention to and cultivate knowledge regarding the impact of gender on sibling abuse, this study proposes two hypotheses based on the idea men and women would not fall into traditional roles of perpetrator and victim, respectively:</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants in this study consisted of both undergraduate and graduate college students enrolled at a public urban university in the mid-South of the United States. The sample was one of convenience in that surveys were distributed by the primary investigator to classes across a variety of academic disciplines within the college of arts and sciences and the college of education for which permission had been granted by the instructor. The age of students ranged from 15 to 59, with a median age of 20 and a mean age of 23. Women comprised 67.1% of the sample, men comprised 32.6% of the sample, students identifying as transgendered comprised 0% of the sample, and students identifying as something other than female, male, or transgendered comprised 0.3% of the sample. Students identifying as African American/Black represented 32.3% of the sample, students identifying as Asian represented 1.7% of the sample, students identifying as Caucasian/White represented 55.5% of the sample, students identifying as Hispanic/Latino represented 1.7% of the sample, and students identifying as Other represented 3.9% of the sample. It is important to consider the limitations of age, gender, and ethnic/cultural identity demonstrated with this sample.</p>
<p>An a priori power analysis was conducted to aid in estimation of accurate sample size. The analysis found the minimum acceptable sample size for this study to be 207, given an anticipated effect size of .15 a desired statistical power of .80, and an alpha of .10. In conjunction with the power analysis, sample sizes used in related studies were considered. Most research related to this topic had a final sample size between 85 and 650 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512468324">Caffaro &amp; Conn-Caffaro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512468324">Caspi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512468324">Goodwin &amp; Roscoe, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512468324">Liem &amp; Boudewyn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512468324">Simonelli et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512468324">Wiehe, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512468324">2000</xref>). Therefore, after considering both the results of power analysis and related research, a target sample size of 300 was used in this study. It was estimated the return rate would be 75% after those who did not respond and those who returned incomplete surveys (three or more questions unanswered), and those who did not have siblings (having at least one sibling was a requirement for inclusion) were accounted for, leaving a final estimate of the acceptable sample size to be 225 participants for this analysis. The actual study exceeded the minimal sample criteria with 362 surveys administered, and 27 cases were excluded for missing or incomplete data, leaving a final sample of 335 and a return rate of 94.1%.</p>

<p>Sample of question related to being a perpetrator of sexual abuse:</p>
<p>I showed a sibling pornographic material   0 1 2 3 4 5</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>These questions not only measure recollection of presence and severity of sibling abuse but also provide information regarding the type of experience with sibling abuse, as either the survivor or perpetrator.</p>
<p>After the survey was tested for clarity and time completion with a small test group of undergraduate and graduate students, the primary investigator administered the survey packets to individual classes across the university campus. The primary investigator reviewed informed consent and explained that this study is voluntary and anonymous and that participants will not be asked to report any specific identifying information. In addition to the primary investigator explaining informed consent verbally, participants had a detachable sheet on the front page of the packet containing an explanation of informed consent, contact information for questions regarding the survey, and the phone number for the psychological counseling center on campus. Ensuring participants have information to connect to support services was important, given the topic this project is attempting to explore.</p>
<p>This project used a one-way MANOVA to explore each of the two hypotheses above. As this investigation is an exploratory study, an alpha of .1 is an acceptable level for significance. Allowing a more liberal significance level in this research does not place participants in danger but rather serves to draw attention to an understudied area of violence. In this case reducing Type 2 error and allowing more room for Type 1 error reduce the likelihood of dismissing the potentially meaningful social phenomenon being researched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512468324">Hays, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512468324">Huck, 2007</xref>). In addition, sibling abuse experience has been consistently underreported; thus, allowing a more liberal level of significance offsets some of the secrecy and minimization that accompany the issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512468324">Phillips-Green, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512468324">Simonelli et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Prior to running the analysis to test the two primary research hypotheses, diagnostic tests were run to check for potential problems with missing data, out-of-range data, intercorrelation, multicollinearity, and outliers. Frequencies were run on each survey question to determine whether participants had answered questions within the set range as well as to uncover possible errors in data entry. In total, 27 cases were excluded from the final analysis in this study because of missing or inaccurate data, leaving a final sample size of 335.</p>
<p>Intercorrelation was tested by examining the reliability of each scale used in the survey. The sibling abuse scales were developed using an altered version of the CTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512468324">Straus, 1979</xref>). The total psychological sibling abuse scale reflected a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of .85, with the subscale of Perpetrating Sibling Psychological Abuse reflecting a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of .705 and the subscale of surviving sibling psychological abuse reflecting a Cronbach’s alpha of .893. The Total Physical Sibling Abuse scale reflected a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of .924, with the subscale of Perpetrating Sibling Physical Abuse reflecting a Cronbach’s alpha of .849 and the subscale of Surviving Sibling Physical Abuse reflecting a Cronbach’s alpha of .847. The Total Sexual Sibling Abuse scale reflected a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of .723, with the subscale of Perpetrating Sibling Sexual abuse reflecting a Cronbach’s alpha of .643, and the subscale of Surviving Sibling Sexual Abuse reflecting a Cronbach’s alpha of .625.</p>
<p>To determine gender differences among the dimensions of sibling abuse perpetration, a one-way MANOVA was computed for each of the hypothesis to compare genders for the linear combination of three dimensions (factors) of surviving sibling abuse (emotional, sexual, and psychological) and perpetration of sibling abuse (emotional, sexual, and psychological). As noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512468324">Table 1</xref>, the MANOVA results indicated no significant gender effect for the linear combination of the three factors used to analyze surviving sibling abuse (Treatment 1: “A sibling emotionally abused me”; Treatment 2: “A sibling sexually abused me”; Treatment 3: “A sibling physically abused me”). These results support the hypothesis that there would be no significant gender differences for those who have survived sibling abuse, thus indicating that both men and women are victims of this type of familial abuse.</p>

<title>Implications of Results</title>
<sec id="section12-0886260512468324">
<title>Hypothesis 1</title>
<p>The first hypothesis addressed in this study (There is no difference between men and women in propensity and severity of perpetration of psychological, physical, and sexual sibling abuse) was found to be true in terms of psychological and physical perpetration; however, women were actually found to demonstrate a higher level of propensity and severity in perpetration of sexual sibling abuse. These results support the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512468324">Hamel (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512468324">Robertson and Murachver (2007)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512468324">Straus and Gelles (1990)</xref>, all of which purported that men have been inaccurately depicted as the overwhelming perpetrators of abuse. The results are interesting to consider, though obviously caution is warranted as this is one exploratory study and does not purport anything beyond the scope of the population surveyed. Although this study does not suggest men do not perpetrate violence, it does support the possibility that men have been misrepresented in terms of propensity and severity of perpetration in relation to their female counterparts. In addition, the results related to this hypothesis add to the research on sibling abuse and suggest that, although sibling abuse in general needs to be taken more seriously with greater interventions explored at earlier ages, the phenomena of girls abusing siblings cannot be ignored in future research, treatment interventions, family education, and prevention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0886260512468324">
<title>Hypothesis 2</title>
<p>The second hypothesis addressed in this study (There is no difference between men and women in propensity of being a victim of psychological, physical, and sexual sibling abuse) was found to be true. Although it is important not to place too much weight on the results of this one study, these findings are critical to consider as the idea that both men and women are victims of abuse at comparable rates is not widely accepted, in spite of data and studies suggesting otherwise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512468324">Bowman &amp; Morgan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512468324">Cho &amp; Wilke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512468324">Hamel, 2009</xref>). These results support the idea that young boys are just as likely to be abused by a sibling as young girls, and given the alarming regularity with which sibling abuse occurs, it is essential that reports of abuse by boys are taken seriously and conceptualization and intervention as well as research is reconsidered to provide the support this group needs. Future studies that build on this model may want to consider a way to account for this phenomenon.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0886260512468324">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This survey was self-report, which presents a limitation to this study. In spite of the reality that the survey was anonymous and voluntary, the force of social desirability could have influenced how students chose to respond. It was assumed that students were reporting in a truthful manner; however, there was not an accurate and accessible means for which to test the validity of student responses in this study. Therefore, it is possible that responses that were included in the analyses were not reflective of some students’ reality.</p>
<p>There is a limitation related to the research design of this study. As family violence is typically a systemic problem, it is likely that the experience of sibling abuse does not occur in isolation of other forms of abuse. This study did not consider the effect possible interaction of experiencing other forms of abuse in addition to sibling abuse may have on the outcome. Future research modeling this study can modify the survey to include questions addressing other abusive family experiences. The challenge to this will be to maintain a primary focus on sibling abuse and not designate the sibling abuse experience as secondary to other forms of family violence.</p>
<p>An additional limitation to the study involves the sample. Students included in the study were obtained through a convenience sample for which permission was granted by the instructor for the primary investigator to directly administer the survey in his or her classroom. Although access to several classes in the hard sciences and school of business were attempted, permission to administer the survey to these classes was not obtained. As a result, only classes for fields in the school of education and the school of arts and sciences were included in this study. The sample also represents students from only one university, and it is possible the outcome of the study would not be the same were it replicated at a different college or university.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0886260512468324">
<title>Implications for treatment</title>
<p>Traditional treatment has overwhelmingly ignored the implications of sibling abuse, let alone the intervention required to effectively work with abusive female siblings and male siblings who have survived sibling abuse. Therapists must expand their theoretical foundations to go beyond widely accepted traditional views of family and feminist theories and develop prevention programs, outreach programs, and treatment programs, to serve this population.</p>
<p>Although this research does not suggest that women are the only abusers in a sibling dyad, it seems that therapeutic interventions could benefit from modification to adequately serve the experience one has with sibling abuse. Prevention programs need to be developed to help families understand the dynamics of sibling abuse and respond with equality to reports of this abuse made by both sons and daughters. Outreach programs need to work toward breaking down myths widely held in the community associated with perpetration and victimization of sibling abuse. Finally, treatment should include individual therapy, family therapy, as well as separate group therapy sessions, for the victim and perpetrator of the abuse.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0886260512468324">
<title>Implications for counselor education</title>
<p>This study highlights gaps that need to be addressed in counselor education. For example, it is essential that textbooks, lectures, and experiential activities do not perpetuate the minimization of abusive sibling relationships or the fact that women are not the only victims of abuse. Furthermore, core classes that tackle family and gender issues should include role-plays, case scenarios, and literature that expose future counselors to the concept that not only is sibling abuse a pandemic issue but that it is possible female siblings are perpetuating as much, if not more, of the abuse that occurs within these relationships.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0886260512468324">
<title>Implications for research</title>
<p>Based on the results of this study, it seems clear that there is great need for further empirical research exploring gender disparities related to perpetration and victimization of sibling abuse. In particular, the finding that supports women are more likely to sexually abuse their siblings than men opens the door to the possibility that other types of abuse perpetrated by women are being underreported. In addition, developing studies that take into consideration the interplay of pressure to conform to gender roles and reporting abusive sibling relationships could provide essential information needed to gain a deeper understanding of the issue.</p>
<p>The absence of empirical research on sibling abuse stands in stark contrast to studies conducted on virtually every other form of abuse. There is a dearth of research that speaks to the intricacies and unique circumstances related to sibling abuse and the consequences that linger into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512468324">Ammerman &amp; Hersen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512468324">Kiselica &amp; Morrill-Richards, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512468324">Phillips-Green, 2002</xref>). This study marks an effort to promote and expand much-needed critical research on this topic. Ongoing similar research to this study will help identify possible variables influencing the results as well as provide insight into the development of an instrument to assess experience with this phenomenon in a meaningful way.</p>
