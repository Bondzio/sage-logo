<abstract>
<p>A simple method for screening indoor emission sources of carbonyl compounds developed previously by the authors was used for this study. The new device, which is called “emission cell for simultaneous multisampling” (ECSMS), was used for flux sampling of volatile carbonyl compounds from surfaces of building and furnishing materials in situ. Indoor carbonyl concentrations in various rooms at a school and residential building in Shizuoka, Japan, were investigated in 2006 using the developed techniques. In several rooms, formaldehyde concentrations exceeded the air quality guideline value (100 µg m<sup>−3</sup>) set by the World Health Organization. The formaldehyde emission rates from the various surfaces in those rooms were determined using the ECSMS units. The furniture was found to be the major emission source of formaldehyde emission in many of the rooms; emissions from the furniture accounted for 42–79% of each room’s total emissions. On the basis of the results, a strategy to reduce the indoor formaldehyde concentrations in each room is proposed by this paper. This study confirmed that the ECSMS can be used for on-site screening of primary emission sources of formaldehyde that could cause indoor air pollution.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11412631"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years, buildings have been made more airtight in an effort to decrease energy consumption. As a result, indoor concentrations of chemicals have increased in many buildings and there is a need to develop procedures for assessment of these pollutants and their impacts on indoor environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11412631">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11412631">3</xref>]. Indoor air pollution is a serious problem and could cause many health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11412631">4</xref>]—including multiple chemical sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11412631">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11412631">7</xref>], sick building syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11412631">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11412631">10</xref>] and allergic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11412631">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11412631">11</xref>]—may be related to indoor hazardous chemicals. Because of the emission problem, some installation methods have been proposed to reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and formaldehyde in the indoor environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11412631">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11412631">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Volatile organic compounds make up a large subset of typical hazardous indoor compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11412631">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X11412631">17</xref>]. For example, formaldehyde is widely used as an adhesive in the manufacture of building materials, furniture and other wood-based household products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1420326X11412631">18</xref>]. Chamber and desiccator methods have been used for the evaluation of chemical emissions from wood-based materials, such as plywood, particleboard and medium-density fibreboard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X11412631">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1420326X11412631">24</xref>]. For the investigation of indoor air pollution by VOCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1420326X11412631">25</xref>], indoor concentrations of the chemical substances are usually measured with active or passive sampling methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1420326X11412631">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1420326X11412631">28</xref>].</p>
<p>The assessment of the indoor air pollution due to emissions will require on-site estimation of the chemicals emitted, and if the investigation can involve direct <italic>in situ</italic> measurement that does not damage indoor materials, this would then provide more meaningful information regarding the sources of the emissions in indoor air. For this purpose, field and laboratory emission cells can be used for active measurement of the emission flux of VOCs from source materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1420326X11412631">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1420326X11412631">32</xref>], and a passive flux sampler can be used for passive measurement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1420326X11412631">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1420326X11412631">34</xref>]. However, the numerous sources of VOCs in the indoor environments have made the investigation difficult to determine the main parameters influencing the indoor air pollution simply and inexpensively with these devices. Therefore, the emission cell for simultaneous multisampling (ECSMS) for <italic>in situ</italic> testing of emission sources of carbonyl compounds has been previously developed. In our previous study, the applicability of ECSMS for determining indoor air concentrations for carbonyl compounds was examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1420326X11412631">35</xref>]. The indoor carbonyls concentrations were calculated by emission flux determined by ECSMS, surface areas of emission sources (m<sup>2</sup>), actual measured air exchange rate (ACH) and background concentrations of carbonyls. The results showed that the concentrations determined by ECSMS agreed with the actually measured concentrations by active sampling. This means that emission flux determined by ECSMS was reliable. In this study, outdoor concentrations of carbonyls were very low and were negligible. Therefore, ACH can be predicted by means of emission flux determined by ECSMS, surface areas and actual indoor air concentrations for carbonyls. ECSMS unit is small, lightweight, inexpensive and easy to handle. So several ECSMS units can simultaneously be used to determine the pollution emitted from each of the building materials or furniture. The objective of this project was to further evaluate the applicability of the method for determining the location of emission sources in a school and in a residential building in Shizuoka, Japan. This new method was used to investigate emission sources of six low-molecular-weight carbonyl compounds (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, <italic>n</italic>-hexanal and benzaldehyde) in the various rooms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1420326X11412631" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>The indoor concentrations of carbonyl compounds were initially investigated in a school and in a residential building by air sampling with passive samplers. Then rooms in which air pollution by carbonyl compounds were observed were further investigated for the sources with the ECSMS screening devices.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1420326X11412631"><title>Air Sampling</title>
<p>A passive sampler (Passive Gas Tubes 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) silica gel for aldehydes and ketones, Sibata Scientific Technology Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) was used for determination of carbonyls’ air concentrations. The sampling period was 24 h. An active sampler (Presep-C 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine cartridge, (Short), Wako Pure Chemical Industries Co., Osaka, Japan) connected to a miniature pump (MP-Σ30, Sibata Scientific Technology Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a mass flow controller was used at the rate of 200 mL·min<sup>−1</sup> to determine the sampling rates of the carbonyl compounds collected by the passive sampler (see the subsection “Determination of the Sampling Rates of the Passive Sampler”). Both types of samplers (passive and active) were kept in aluminium bags before the sampling and the used cartridges were sealed in the same aluminium bags and kept refrigerated at about –45°C until analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1420326X11412631"><title>Extraction and Analysis</title>
<p>Reagents for extraction of carbonyl compounds from samplers (passive and active) were as follows:</p>
<p>The acetonitrile, Wakosil DNPH Eluent A and Wakosil DNPH Eluent B were high-performance liquid chromatography grade (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Co., Osaka, Japan), and the water was double-distilled and filtered through a Milli-Q Gradient A10 system (Millipore Co., Massachusetts, USA).</p>
<p>Sampled material (DNPH coated silica gel) was transferred from a passive or an active sampler tube to a 10-mL glass test tube and eluted with 2 mL of 30% acetonitrile aqueous solution. The eluted sample was then stirred for 1 min and filtered through a filter (DISMIC-13 HP, pore size: 0.45 µm; Toyo Roshi Kaisha Ltd, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
<p>The extracted carbonyls were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A calibration standard containing DNPH derivatives of 16 carbonyl compounds (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, acrolein, acetone, <italic>i</italic>-butyraldehyde, <italic>n</italic>-butyraldehyde, crotonaldehyde, <italic>i</italic>-valeraldehyde, <italic>n</italic>-valeraldehyde, benzaldehyde, <italic>n</italic>-hexanal, <italic>o</italic>-tolualdehyde, <italic>m</italic>-tolualdehyde, <italic>p</italic>-tolualdehyde and 2,5-dimethylbenzaldehyde; 10 µg mL<sup>−1</sup> acetonitrile solution) was used. This is of the highest purity available (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Co., Osaka, Japan). The target carbonyl compounds were analyzed using an HPLC system consisting of a PU-2089 Plus pump, an AS-2059 Plus autosampler and a UV-2077 Plus ultraviolet–visible detector (360 nm; Jasco Co., Tokyo, Japan). A Wakosil-DNPH-II column (4.6 mm inner diameter × 250 mm length; Wako Pure Chemical Industries Co., Osaka, Japan) was used to separate the carbonyl compounds. The column temperature was 35°C, and the flow rate of the mobile phase was 1.0 mL min<sup>−1</sup>. The calibration range for the carbonyl compounds was 1–100 ng per injection. Details regarding the elution conditions and detection limits have already been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1420326X11412631">35</xref>]. The coefficients of variance for the concentrations ranged from 0.42% to 2.83%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1420326X11412631"><title>Determination of the Sampling Rates of the Passive Sampler</title>
<p>Because passive sampling is based on molecular diffusion of chemicals, the technique does not require a power supply and would not produce noise. However, this method requires prior determination of the sampler’s sampling rates for each target chemical in order to determine the indoor concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1420326X11412631">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1420326X11412631">37</xref>]. In our study, the sampling rates were determined by means of chamber tests for the six carbonyl compounds (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, <italic>n</italic>-hexanal and benzaldehyde).</p>
<p>For the determination of the sampling rates of the passive sampler, a mixture of the standard gas of the six target carbonyl compounds was prepared in a 5-L gas bag (Flek-sampler, Omi Odor-air Service Co., Shiga, Japan). The standard gas was introduced into a large chamber (capacity: 4.25 m<sup>3</sup>, interior material: stainless steel 304) with a 500-mL glass syringe from the bag, and the gas was stirred in the test chamber with a mechanical fan for about 1 min. Then after 30 min, the sampling was conducted by collecting the carbonyls simultaneously with both types of samplers (active and passive). The samplers were kept in aluminium bags before the tests and the used cartridges were sealed in the same aluminium bags and kept refrigerated at about –45°C until analysis. The concentrations of the carbonyl compounds in the test chamber ranged from 19 to 416 µg m<sup>−3</sup>. Passive and active sampling were conducted simultaneously for both 4 and 24 h. Active sampling was conducted (while a passive sampler was exposed) at the rate of 200 mL min<sup>−1</sup> with a miniature pump (MP-Σ30, Sibata Scientific Technology Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a mass flow controller. Both samplers were placed 1200 mm above the floor, in the centre of the chamber. There was no airflow and hardly any ventilation in the chamber during the tests. Temperature and relative humidity in the chamber were not controlled but were measured every 10 min with a Thermo Recorder RTR-53 (T&amp;#38;D Co., Nagano, Japan). The mean temperature was 20.8°C (max. 22.2°C, min. 18.8°C) and the mean relative humidity was 47% (max. 59%, min. 41%) in the chamber tests.</p>
<p>The uptake rate (<italic>R</italic><sub>U</sub>, µg ppbv<sup>–1</sup> h<sup>–1</sup>) of the passive sampler for a carbonyl compound was calculated using Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1420326X11412631">1</xref>):

where <italic>S</italic> (µg) is the amount of a carbonyl compound collected by the passive sampler, <italic>C</italic><sub>a</sub> (ppmv) is the concentration of a carbonyl compound determined by active sampling and <italic>h</italic> (h) is the sampling period. And <italic>C</italic><sub>a</sub> (at 20°C, 101.3 kPa) was calculated using Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1420326X11412631">2</xref>):
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-1420326X11412631"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11412631-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>MW</italic> (g mol<sup>−1</sup>) is the molecular weight of a carbonyl compound and <italic>C</italic><sub>a</sub>′ (µg m<sup>−3</sup>) is the concentration of a carbonyl compound.</p>
<p><italic>R</italic><sub>U</sub> values were calculated from plots of <italic>S</italic> versus <italic>C</italic><sub>a</sub><italic>h</italic>.</p>
<p>The uptake rate (at 20°C) can also be determined by Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-1420326X11412631">3</xref>):
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-1420326X11412631"><label>(3)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11412631-eq3.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>R</italic><sub>S</sub> (mL min<sup>–1</sup>) is the passive sampling rate.</p>
<p>The passive sampling rates of the six carbonyl compounds were then calculated. The principle of VOC collection by a passive sampler is based on molecular diffusion. So, an uptake rate of a passive sampler would depend on ambient temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity. However, in a previous study, it has been reported that their effects on collection amounts of VOCs were slight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1420326X11412631">38</xref>]. In our study, to minimise the influence of the wind, windows of the rooms were closed during the investigations. Therefore, temperature and relative humidity in the chamber (there was no wind) were not controlled but were measured every 10 min with a Thermo Recorder RTR-53 (T&amp;#38;D Co., Nagano, Japan).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1420326X11412631"><title>Test Sites</title>
<p>Carbonyl concentrations were investigated by passive sampling and the emission sources were determined using ECSMS devices in various rooms of a school and a residential building in Shizuoka, Japan, in the summer and the autumn of 2006.</p>
<p>In the school (reinforced concrete construction, built in 1969), passive samplers were placed in the music room, the computer room, the library and the general classroom. Those rooms had not been refurbished recently. Integrated air samples were collected indoors and outdoors simultaneously for a 24-h period on July 26 and 27, 2006. The rooms in which high concentrations of carbonyl compounds were detected were further investigated with ECSMS units on August 29, 2006, to determine the emission sources.</p>
<p>In the residential building (wooden construction, built in 2002), passive samplers were placed in the first- and second-floor living/dining rooms, first- and third-floor bedrooms, nursery and storage room. Those rooms had not been refurbished recently. Integrated air samples were collected indoors and outdoors simultaneously for a 24-h period on September 13 and 14, 2006. The rooms in which high concentrations of carbonyl compounds were detected were further investigated using ECSMS units on October 11, 2006, to determine the emission sources.</p>
<p>There were not any types of air fresheners or air cleaners used in those rooms. Temperature and relative humidity were measured every 10 min with a Thermo Recorder RTR-53 (T &amp;#38; D Co., Nagano, Japan). Especially, the details for the rooms to have been investigated with ECSMS units were described in the section “Results and discussion.”</p>

<sec id="sec8-1420326X11412631"><title>Screening for Emission Sources</title>
<p>The ECSMS screening devices were used specifically for screening indoor emission sources of carbonyl compounds. The ECSMS units, which is composed of a stainless steel cell (area of opening, 94.6; depth, 3.8 cm; volume of inner space, 300 cm<sup>3</sup>) with a polyethylene seal, a passive sampler, a metal fitting to support a passive sampler and magnet to affix a passive sampler, supported by a metal fitting, to the inside face of the stainless steel cell, were fixed simultaneously on the surfaces of various indoor materials. Details regarding the structure of the ECSMS have already been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1420326X11412631">35</xref>]. Emission flux for the measurement surfaces were determined from the ECSMS collection amounts, and then emission rates were calculated by multiplying these rates by the surface area of each material. The materials from which a remarkably high amount of carbonyl compounds was collected were determined to evaluate the potential of these compounds to cause indoor air pollution. The carbonyl compounds were collected for 6 h with the passive sampler housed in each ECSMS cell. The indoor and outdoor concentrations of the carbonyl compounds were also measured simultaneously by passive samplers of the same type. The passive samplers were kept in aluminium bags before the tests and the used cartridges were sealed in the same aluminium bags and kept refrigerated at about –45°C until analysis. To minimise the influence of the wind, the windows of the rooms were closed during the investigations. Temperature and relative humidity were measured every 10 min with a Thermo Recorder RTR-53 (T &amp;#38; D Co., Nagano, Japan).</p>

<sec id="sec14-1420326X11412631"><title>Formaldehyde Emission Rates from Sources in the General Classroom</title>
<p>In the second round of testing (in August), the general classroom’s indoor formaldehyde concentration was 140 µg m<sup>−3</sup>. The mean temperature was 33.2°C, and the mean relative humidity was 50%. The distribution of the surface areas of the materials in the room is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11412631">Figure 3(a)</xref>, and the distribution of formaldehyde emission rates from these materials is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11412631">Figure 3(b)</xref>. The emission rate from locker A was the highest among all the measured amounts (33% of the total). Despite its small surface area (12% of the total), locker A was the primary source of formaldehyde. The ceiling and floor were also the major sources of formaldehyde in this indoor environment. When the sources were classified into two categories – building materials and furniture – 58% of the total formaldehyde came from the building materials, and 42% came from the furniture. If locker A was changed to a low-formaldehyde model, the formaldehyde concentration in the classroom would decrease to 67% of the present concentration. In addition, if the technique of covering the source materials is used, this could also reduce emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1420326X11412631">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1420326X11412631">41</xref>], and if applied to the wall and the ceiling, the formaldehyde concentration would decrease to 72% of the present concentration. Furthermore, if both of these measures (replacement of the locker with a low-formaldehyde version and covering the walls and ceiling) were applied, the formaldehyde concentration would decrease to 39% of the present concentration. Total emission rates for the other five carbonyls in the classroom were much lower than that for formaldehyde (9990 µg h<sup>−1</sup> for formaldehyde, 638 µg h<sup>−1</sup> for acetaldehyde, 50.8 µg h<sup>−1</sup> for propionaldehyde, 75.4 µg h<sup>−1</sup> for butyraldehyde, 95.4 µg h<sup>−1</sup> for <italic>n</italic>-hexanal, 82.2 µg h<sup>−1</sup> for benzaldehyde). Major emissions of the five carbonyls were observed from the building materials. Distributions for total emission rates from them (floor, ceiling and wall) were as follows: 77% for acetaldehyde, 55% for propionaldehyde, 82% for butyraldehyde, 77% for <italic>n</italic>-hexanal and 81% for benzaldehyde.

</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1420326X11412631"><title>Air Exchange Rate in the General Classroom</title>
<p>Another technique for reducing indoor formaldehyde concentrations was to increase the ACH by means of a mechanical fan. The estimated ACH in the general classroom was 0.26 h<sup>−1</sup>, with all windows and doors closed during the investigation. If the ACH rate was increased to 0.50 h<sup>−1</sup>, the indoor concentration would decrease by about half.</p>

<p>The indoor and outdoor concentrations of ambient carbonyl compounds in the residential building in September were determined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1420326X11412631">Table 3</xref>). The formaldehyde concentrations exceeded the guideline value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1420326X11412631">39</xref>] for formaldehyde in three rooms: the nursery (113 µg m<sup>−3</sup> indoor formaldehyde concentration), storeroom (143 µg m<sup>−3</sup>) and third-floor bedroom (108 µg m<sup>−3</sup>). The mean temperature was 26.7°C, and the mean relative humidity was 58%. Detail of the nursery was as follows: length: 4.59 m, width: 2.54  m and height: 2.39 m; flooring: tatami mat; wall: plasterboard coated with resin films; ceiling: plasterboard coated with resin films and door: plywood laminated resin films (flush door). The furniture were as follows: desk A (laminated wood coated with clear varnish), desk B (laminated wood coated with clear varnish) and bookshelf A (particleboard laminated with paper sheets). Detail of the storage room was as follows: length: 2.48 m, width: 2.37 m and height: 2.39 m; flooring: plywood laminated with a sliced-cut veneer; wall: plasterboard coated with resin films; ceiling: plasterboard coated with resin films and door: plywood laminated resin films (flush door). The furniture were as follows: bookshelf B (particleboard laminated paper sheets) and shelf (laminated wood, the lower surface was laminated with resin films). Detail of the third-floor bedroom was as follows: length: 5.30 m, width: 4.35 m and height: 2.39 m; flooring: tatami mat; wall: plasterboard coated with resin films; ceiling: plasterboard coated with resin films and door: plywood laminated paper sheets (flush door). The furniture in the room were as follows: bookshelf C (particleboard laminated paper sheets), bookshelf D (particleboard laminated paper sheets) and television stand (particleboard laminated paper sheets). These three rooms were further investigated with ECSMS units to determine the emission sources of the carbonyl compounds.

<p>In the second round of testing (in October), the nursery’s indoor formaldehyde concentration was 35.6 µg m<sup>−3</sup>, which was substantially lower than the concentration measured in September. If the second test had been conducted under the same conditions as those of the first test, the concentration would have been over 100 µg m<sup>−3</sup>. This concentration difference might be due to a difference in the ACH resulting from the opening and shutting of the door by the residents. The mean temperature was 26.0°C, and the mean relative humidity was 50%. The distribution of the surface areas of the materials in the nursery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11412631">Figure 4(a)</xref>) and the distribution of the formaldehyde emission rates from these materials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11412631">Figure 4(b)</xref>) were determined. Bookshelf A showed the highest formaldehyde emission rate of all the measured points (66% of the total). The building materials accounted for 34% of the total amount of formaldehyde, and the furniture accounted for 66%. Bookshelf A was the primary source of formaldehyde even though its surface area was only 12% of the room’s total. If this bookshelf was changed to a low-formaldehyde model, the formaldehyde concentration in the nursery would decrease to 34% of the present concentration. Total emission rates for the other five carbonyls in the nursery were much lower than that for formaldehyde (956 µg h<sup>−1</sup> for formaldehyde, 92.6 µg h<sup>−1</sup> for acetaldehyde, 5.53 µg h<sup>−1</sup> for propionaldehyde, 8.89 µg h<sup>−1</sup> for butyraldehyde, 30.9 µg h<sup>−1</sup> for <italic>n</italic>-hexanal, 16.5 µg h<sup>−1</sup> for benzaldehyde). Major emissions of the five carbonyls were observed from the building materials. Distributions for the total emission rate from the floor, ceiling and wall were as follows: 76% for acetaldehyde, 97% for propionaldehyde, 79% for butyraldehyde, 73% for <italic>n</italic>-hexanal and 75% for benzaldehyde.

<p>In the second round of testing (in October), the storage room’s indoor formaldehyde concentration was 47.1 µg m<sup>−3</sup>.

The shelf showed the highest formaldehyde emission rate of the measured surfaces (46% of the total). The amount emitted from the shelf’s upper surface was much higher (41%) than that emitted from its lower surface (5.1%) because the lower surface was covered with resin films. Bookshelf B was the second-highest source of emissions (33%). The shelf and bookshelf B were the primary sources of formaldehyde even though their surface areas accounted for only 27% of the total surface area of the room. The building materials emitted 21% of the total formaldehyde, and the furniture emitted 79%. If the shelf and the bookshelf were changed to low-formaldehyde models, the formaldehyde concentration in the storage room would decrease to 21% of the present concentration. Total emission rates for the other five carbonyls in the storage room were much lower than that for formaldehyde (1210 µg h<sup>−1</sup> for formaldehyde, 52.7 µg h<sup>−1</sup> for acetaldehyde, 4.22 µg h<sup>−1</sup> for propionaldehyde, 5.03 µg h<sup>−1</sup> for butyraldehyde, 16.9 µg h<sup>−1</sup>, for <italic>n</italic>-hexanal, 11.2 µg h<sup>−1</sup> for benzaldehyde). Major emissions of the five carbonyls were observed from the building materials and the shelf.

<p>The estimated ACHs were 0.95 h<sup>−1</sup> for the nursery, 0.60 h<sup>−1</sup> for the storage room and 0.25 h<sup>−1</sup> for the bedroom. The windows were all closed during the investigation. However, the doors of both the nursery and the storage room may have been opened several times by residents. Formaldehyde concentration in the bedroom would have been about 50 µg m<sup>−3</sup> if a mechanical fan had been used at the rate of 0.5 h<sup>−1</sup> in the investigation on July 26 and 27, 2006. In any case, whether the fan is air-supply type or exhaust one, the air exchange should stay at the necessary minimum level. Otherwise, interior condensations would occur by supplying excess outdoor air. Or emissions of hazardous chemicals might be promoted from interior materials by negative pressure being caused by exhausting superabundant indoor air. So the estimation for ACH with ECSMS devices is an effective way of monitoring indoor pollution control.</p>

<p>The investigation had allowed proposal to remediate the indoor formaldehyde concentration of these rooms in the school and in the residential home. If these measures were taken, the formaldehyde concentration in the rooms would decrease to 21%–72% of the present concentrations. This study has demonstrated the applicability of the ECSMS testing method that would contribute to the identification of the principal sources of the compounds and thus enable strategy to reduce the indoor air pollution easily and inexpensively.</p>
