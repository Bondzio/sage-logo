<abstract>
<p><bold>Objective</bold>: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of head movement frequency and predictive compensation on (a) latency produced in a monocular see-through helmet-mounted display (HMD) test bed and (b) simulator sickness experienced by users wearing the HMD.</p>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: There is conflicting research regarding latency as a significant factor in the onset of simulator sickness. Predictive compensation has been shown to mitigate the magnitude of latency, but little is known about the extent of its effect on simulator sickness.</p>
<p><bold>Method</bold>: A video camera recorded HMD and simulator imagery to accurately measure apparent latency produced at three head movement frequencies. Predictive compensation strategies were manipulated to measure the difference in apparent latency produced by the test bed in various conditions. Similar methodology was employed with human participants to measure simulator sickness experienced by users of this test bed.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: In Experiment 1, apparent latency increased significantly as head movement frequency increased. Predictive compensation strategies significantly reduced apparent latency present in the test bed. In Experiment 2, predictive compensation significantly reduced the magnitude of simulator sickness.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Predictive compensation can be effectively implemented to reduce apparent latency, resulting in a lower magnitude of simulator sickness.</p>
<p><bold>Application</bold>: Potential applications include HMD use in which head position is tracked and visual imagery is linked to head or body movement, such as in virtual and augmented reality systems, and is thus critical to functionality and performance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent technological advances in computer processing and optics have led to increased use of helmet-mounted (“head-mounted”) displays (HMDs) in several applications, such as aviation (both civilian and military), medicine (surgery), and entertainment (gaming) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018720811428734">Rash, Russo, Letowski, &amp; Schmeisser, 2009</xref>). HMDs provide information on displays located in front of the eyes of the user and keep this information in direct view during head movement. Although HMDs offer advantages compared with heads-down and heads-up displays, such as mobility, there are several drawbacks, such as latency, which is a fixed time delay, or lag, because of processing and transmit speed limitations of the HMD and simulator system. As the HMD is moved, this fixed lag then becomes a variable phase lag, or apparent latency, and is characterized by a lag between the actual user head position and the visual updating of HMD imagery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720811428734">Draper, Viirre, Furness, &amp; Gawron, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720811428734">Keller &amp; Colucci, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Apparent latency increases as head movement frequency increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018720811428734">Vincenzi, Deaton, Buker, Blickensderfer, Pray, &amp; Williams, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018720811428734">Vincenzi, Blickensderfer, Deaton, Buker, &amp; Pray, 2009</xref>), which may affect performance because of degraded sense of presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720811428734">Ellis, Bréant, Menges, Jacoby, &amp; Adelstein, 1997</xref>) and the user adopting a “move-and-wait” strategy by slowing head movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720811428734">Draper et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018720811428734">Sheridan &amp; Ferrell, 1963</xref>). Latency may also contribute to simulator sickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720811428734">Cobb, Nichols, Ramsey, &amp; Wilson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720811428734">DiZio &amp; Lackner, 1997</xref>), but some research suggests otherwise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720811428734">Draper et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720811428734">Moss &amp; Muth, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018720811428734">Nelson, Roe, Bolia, &amp; Morley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018720811428734">Regan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018720811428734">So, 1994</xref>). One method to reduce latency is predictive compensation, whereby future head position is predicted through the use of head tracker information and mathematical algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018720811428734">Jung, Adelstein, &amp; Ellis, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Variations in HMDs exist, including field of view, resolution, color, and transparency, to name a few. In terms of transparency, an occluded HMD does not allow view of the outside world, presenting sensor- or computer-generated imagery to the HMD, resulting in virtual reality. A see-through HMD creates an augmented reality by projecting imagery on the HMD display, which overlays the external environment or out-the-window (OTW) simulator display, as seen from the perspective of the user (for a thorough review of HMDs, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018720811428734">Rash et al., 2009</xref>). Although HMD use in training and simulation has many advantages, physiological symptoms known as simulator sickness may arise. Simulator sickness may hinder operational use, distract the user from the task at hand, and result in poor performance and user acceptance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720811428734">DiZio et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720811428734">Kennedy, Lilienthal, Berbaum, Baltzley, &amp; McCauley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018720811428734">Pausch, Crea, &amp; Conway, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018720811428734">Regan &amp; Price, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018720811428734">Stanney &amp; Kennedy, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Perhaps the most accepted theory of simulator sickness is the sensory conflict theory, or sensory rearrangement theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018720811428734">Reason, 1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018720811428734">1978</xref>), which posits that simulator sickness is caused by mismatches between the visual system, vestibular system, and nonvestibular proprioceptors. Input is sent to the brain from these sensory systems, where it is stored in neural sensory patterns and compared with previous sensory information in a neural store (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720811428734">Johnson, 2005</xref>). Mismatches occur between the current input of information and stored sensory information, causing internal conflict that cannot be resolved and producing simulator sickness. For example, when a high-speed roll maneuver with the horizon and terrain in view is performed in a simulator, environmental cues perceived by the visual system signal the brain that the user is rolling, yet the vestibular system does not perceive this because of the lack of changes in gravitational forces.</p>
<p>According to the postural instability theory, developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018720811428734">Riccio and Stoffregen (1991)</xref>, the primary behavioral goal in humans is to maintain postural stability, and when it cannot be maintained, simulator sickness may result. The poison theory attempts to explain simulator sickness from an evolutionary perspective, whereby adverse stimulation could be interpreted by the body as ingestion of poison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720811428734">LaViola, 2000</xref>). Although research is inconclusive on the cause of simulator sickness, much research has focused on its measurement.</p>
<p>There are several methods to measure simulator sickness. Physiological measures from pre- to postexposure include skin potential, skin temperature, heart rate, and respiration rate, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720811428734">Bertin, Collet, Espié, &amp; Graf, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720811428734">Cobb et al., 1999</xref>); however, the magnitude and sign of change are inconsistent. Postural equilibrium tests (PETs) provide a measure of ataxia, which is the inability to coordinate voluntary muscular movements, but do not account for all symptoms that may arise. A much less used measure is direct observation, but not all symptoms can be observed.</p>
<p>The most widely used measurement of simulator sickness is the subjective self-report, which allows the user to rate severity of symptoms. In selecting a measure for this study, there needed to be an appropriate breadth and uniqueness of symptoms, applicability to our study, and ease of implementation and completion. The Virtual Reality Symptom Questionnaire (VRSQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720811428734">Amenós, Knox, Baker, &amp; Burgess, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720811428734">Ames, Wolffsohn, &amp; McBrien, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018720811428734">Kozulin, Ames, &amp; McBrien, 2009</xref>) met these requirements. For breadth and uniqueness of symptoms, the VRSQ was developed as a compilation and refinement of several questionnaires: the Pensacola Motion Sickness Questionnaire, developed by the Navy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018720811428734">Kellog, Kennedy, &amp; Graybiel, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720811428734">Kennedy, Tolhurst, &amp; Graybiel, 1965</xref>); the International Standard for Visual Display Units, developed by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720811428734">International Organization for Standardization (1992)</xref>; and Simulator Sickness Questionnaire, developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720811428734">Kennedy, Lane, Berbaum, and Lilienthal (1993)</xref>. These three questionnaires, individually, did not fully encompass the breadth of all possible ocular and nonocular symptoms that could occur with HMD use, and thus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720811428734">Ames et al. (2005)</xref> merged them to create an initial questionnaire.</p>
<p>The VRSQ was tailored to HMD use, the second requirement, having been developed in a study with human participants using an HMD while seated in a chair, similar to our study, unlike other questionnaires, which were not specifically designed for evaluating HMD-related simulator sickness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720811428734">Ames et al. (2005)</xref> performed statistical analyses of duration of symptoms, frequency of endorsement, and homogeneity of symptoms to refine the questionnaire to 13 unique body and eye-related symptoms. Third, implementation and completion of this questionnaire requires approximately 1 min, which allows symptoms to be rated easily and quickly before dissipation of severity. Although not yet validated or widely used, the VRSQ holds promise as an HMD-specific simulator sickness evaluation tool, with the necessary breadth and uniqueness of symptoms, applicability to HMD use, and quick and easy implementation and completion.</p>
<p>Several studies have suggested the following as contributing to simulator sickness: age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018720811428734">Reason &amp; Brand, 1975</xref>), gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720811428734">Hein, 1993</xref>), prior history of simulator sickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720811428734">Braithwaite &amp; Braithwaite, 1990</xref>), head movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018720811428734">Moss, Scisco, &amp; Muth, 2008</xref>), body movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720811428734">Bouyer &amp; Watt, 1996</xref>), image scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720811428734">Draper et al., 2001</xref>), and latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720811428734">DiZio &amp; Lackner, 1997</xref>), which is the focus of this article. From a physiological perspective, latency with HMDs is the time from user input (head motion) to corresponding feedback (visual perception) of the updated HMD imagery and results in apparent latency that is visually perceived by the user. From a technological perspective, the overall system latency is “the time for internal processing by input sensors, data transfer from the sensors to the host computer, update of the physical simulation output by applications in response to user input, and image rendering and display” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018720811428734">Wu &amp; Ouhyoung, 2000</xref>, p. 79). The inability to eliminate system latency and corresponding apparent latency through improvement in computer processing has led to predictive mathematical modeling known as predictive compensation.</p>
<p>In this study, the approach to reduce latency was to implement simultaneous use of two predictive compensation methods: neural network and extrapolated frame correction (EFC), both developed by RPA Electronic Solutions. Neural network performs prediction in each axis of head motion—<italic>x, y</italic>, and <italic>z</italic> (yaw, pitch, and roll)—independently, with neural networks performing two levels of prediction on each axis. The first level is a prediction forward in time to the extent of latency anticipated in the image generation system, with a neural network set to this same forward state, measured in video frames. The second level predicts a single state forward (one video frame), with recorded trials confirming it is of much higher accuracy than the first level. The neural network consists of input, hidden, and output layer nodes. The software allows the depth (number of layers) and width (number of sequential input nodes that store axis past history) of the network to be defined by variables. For the purpose of these experiments, the depth was set to 3 and the width to 64.</p>
<p>Between layers of nodes, a full interconnect is provided such that every node in each layer connects to every node in the preceding layer, with a programmable weighting factor assigned to each node input. Determination of the weight factors was performed with the use of a back propagation technique. To provide data to develop and refine the neural network, recording of head motion typical of expected pilot movement was performed with the use of a programmable motion platform and did not result in any issues, such as the algorithm being overlearned.</p>
<p>At the onset of network training, each nodal weighting factor was set to a random value. The recorded data set was input to each axis network, and nodal values varied to generate the least square error at the network output. Training was performed until the entire data set and each nodal weighting factor converged to a solution. For final image presentation to the HMD user, EFC was implemented to correct predictions made by the neural network. EFC involves a sophisticated video processing circuit board (“Warper Board”) that uses real-time head tracker data to render both static and dynamic display distortion correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018720811428734">Pray &amp; Hyttinen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018720811428734">Vincenzi et al., 2009</xref>). Using the EFC technique, one measures the difference between the long forward prediction and the single frame forward prediction value of the neural network to develop a two-dimensional correction in yaw, pitch, and roll to the image before presentation.</p>
<p>Perception of latency in virtual and augmented reality environments has been investigated in several studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720811428734">Ellis, Young, Adelstein, and Ehrlich (1999a)</xref> used an occluded HMD and instructed users to rock back and forth and indicate whether two sequentially viewed scenes of a virtual ball were different. It was observed that users were more readily able to detect a change in the virtual ball as the difference in added latency became larger. There were no significant differences for base latencies of 27 ms, 97 ms, or 196 ms, indicating that actual added latency is used for discrimination, not the percentage of additional latency to the base latency. With a similar setup, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720811428734">Ellis, Young, Adelstein, and Ehrlich (1999b)</xref> observed that users could definitely discriminate changes in latencies less than 33 ms and probably less than 16.7 ms and concluded that perceptibility of latency is dependent on the sinusoidal frequency of head motion.</p>
<p>Similar studies have measured the perception of latency, with the following thresholds observed: 15 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018720811428734">Regan, Miller, Rubin, &amp; Kogelnik, 1999</xref>), 200 ms at 22.5° per second and 60 ms at 90° per second of head movement frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811428734">Allison, Harris, Jenkin, Jasiobedzka, &amp; Zacher, 2001</xref>), 17 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720811428734">Adelstein, Lee, &amp; Ellis, 2003</xref>), and 9.1 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018720811428734">Mania, Adelstein, Ellis, &amp; Hill, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018720811428734">Moss, Muth, Tyrell, and Stephens (2010)</xref> observed perceptible latency to be approximately 148 ms, with 25th and 75th percentiles of 84.17 ms and 206.25 ms, respectively. Reported thresholds vary within a particular testing group in a study, indicating inconsistent task performance, such as head movement frequency and direction, as well as physiological differences in perceiving latency. Because of this variation, it was imperative to maintain consistent apparent latency in each testing group to minimize possible confounding variables.</p>
<p>Conflicting research exists regarding the effect of latency on simulator sickness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720811428734">DiZio &amp; Lackner (1997)</xref> observed that as latency increased, sickness increased monotonically up to 200 ms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720811428734">Cobb et al. (1999)</xref> observed that higher levels of disorientation were experienced when using a slower processor (greater latency). A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018720811428734">Moss et al. (2008)</xref> observed that peak sickness was significantly higher when using an HMD and concluded that latency may have been the characteristic that elicited simulator sickness; however, no effort was made to isolate latency as the independent variable, and thus other characteristics may have contributed.</p>
<p>In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018720811428734">So (1994)</xref> employed slow and continuous (sinusoidal) head movements and found that 280 ms of latency did not have a significant effect on feelings of nausea. Several studies have also investigated the effect of latency on simulator sickness: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018720811428734">Regan (1995)</xref> reported that feelings of malaise did not increase significantly with increased latency; latency of 46 ms, 96 ms, or 146 ms with a see-through HMD did not have an effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018720811428734">Nelson et al., 2000</xref>); 150 ms and 250 ms of added latency did not have an effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720811428734">Draper et al., 2001</xref>); and 40 ms (0 ms added) and 240 ms (40 ms baseline with 200 ms added) did not have a significant effect on simulator sickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720811428734">Moss &amp; Muth, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have involved applied tasks with little to no control on movement, resulting in inconsistent apparent latency and limiting the ability to precisely evaluate the effect of apparent latency on simulator sickness. Such studies may not maintain head movement frequency and direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720811428734">Draper et al., 2001</xref>), involve the use of a metronome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720811428734">Adelstein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811428734">Allison et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720811428734">Ellis et al., 1999b</xref>), or include audible cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018720811428734">Moss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720811428734">Moss &amp; Muth, 2011</xref>). We used a visual method for the participants to accurately maintain head movement frequency and direction, and thus the apparent latency seen by participants in each particular testing condition is the same. In addition, many studies have involved occluded HMDs or see-through HMDs with different HMD imagery, usually an aiming reticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018720811428734">Nelson et al., 2000</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811428734">Allison et al. (2001)</xref>, latency is more perceptible in see-through HMDs because humans are much more sensitive to relative than to absolute motion. Because of this sensitivity, it was thought that apparent latency, or separation of the same HMD and OTW imagery, would be more perceptible through a see-through HMD than with an occluded HMD or a see-through HMD with different HMD and OTW imagery.</p>
<p>To evaluate the effectiveness of predictive compensation in simulation-based training, it must be systematically tested in studies that quantify latency as seen from the perspective of the user. By maintaining consistent head movement frequency and direction, the evaluation of the effect and magnitude that apparent latency has on simulator sickness will be more accurate, reliable, and retestable for future studies. The objectives of this study were twofold: (a) systematic analyses of apparent latency in a training test bed that employed a see-through HMD and multiple independent image generation (IG) channels and (b) evaluation of the effect of this apparent latency with respect to the onset of simulator sickness in human participants.</p>

<title>Experiment 1</title>
<p>A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018720811428734">Vincenzi et al. (2011)</xref> served as preliminary work to this experiment. The predictive compensation strategy chosen for Experiments 1 and 2 was simultaneous use of neural network and EFC for their ability to significantly reduce apparent latency and to minimize overshoot and “swimming.” Overshoot is a phenomenon that occurs when head movement stops and the HMD image moves ahead of the OTW image in the direction of last known motion. Swimming can occur as the HMD is stopped whereby the HMD imagery moves around trying to “find” the correct position at which to rest.</p>
<p>This experiment examined the effect of head movement frequency and predictor state on apparent latency produced by the HMD and simulator system. It was crucial to gather tangible, quantifiable data on apparent latency from the perspective of the user rather than gathering it from head tracker position data.</p>

<p>No participants were used in Experiment 1. Trials were performed with a camera mounted inside a rigid plastic head. The experiment was conducted at the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) in Orlando, Florida.</p>

<title>Stimuli and apparatus</title>
<p>To gather data on latency, a Sony HDR-CX7/CX7K camera was mounted inside a rigid plastic head at the location of the right eye. The head was mounted to a Directed Precision™ Model PTU-D46 pan-tilt motion platform. The camera “looked” through the HMD to the OTW dome simulator display. Seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720811428734">Figure 1</xref>, the HMD used was a Rockwell Collins SIM EYE SXL50 STM HMD, 1,280 × 1,024 SXGA AMLCD monochrome green display, with only the right display turned on for testing. The display field of view was 40° horizontal by 30° vertical. The midpoint of the camera lens was 3.2 m from the OTW simulator display and 1.3 m from the floor, resulting in an OTW simulator display field of view of 200° horizontal by 50° vertical.</p>

</fig>
<p>Both the HMD and OTW imagery were identical, except for color, consisting of a uniform grid of several vertical and horizontal lines separated by 10° of visual angle with dots marking the 5° midpoint. The HMD imagery was green lines and the OTW imagery was white lines on a black background. A Polhemus SCOµT electromagnetic head tracker was used to detect position of the HMD. This information was relayed to the computer for image generation. The OTW imagery was driven by Pregasis Vega Prime 2.2 on three Dell XPS Model 720 Intel Core E6850 (4 MB cache, 3.0 GHz, 1333 FSB) computers with Nvidia 8800 GTX graphics cards. A 3D Perceptions™ Box merged the images to create a smooth and seamless transition between images. Finally, three JVC D-ILA 1,920 × 1,080 projectors, each covering one third of the screen, projected the images onto the simulator display. A simplified view of the setup can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720811428734">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Design</title>
<p>A 3 × 2 experimental design was used, with independent variables of head movement frequency (5°, 25°, and 45° per second) and predictor state (off, baseline; and on, neural network and EFC used simultaneously). The dependent variable was apparent latency, measured in degrees. This measure was converted to milliseconds by solving for time and multiplying by 1,000: Velocity = Distance / Time, which is also Head Movement Frequency = Apparent Latency / Time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0018720811428734">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>All lights were turned off except for the computer monitors that faced away from the simulator display. The HMD was boresighted, aligned, with the OTW simulator display, and the motion platform was programmed to the correct frequency. The HMD rotated from −60° to +60° from center with video recorded. Each of the six conditions was performed three times. The videos were analyzed with Adobe Premiere Elements 7.0 software. Apparent latency was found by measuring the distance between the vertical lines of the HMD and OTW imagery, using the 10° and 5° markings as a guide. In ideal conditions, these two images would overlay each other; however, with latency present during head movement, the images become separated in the direction of motion with the HMD “lagging” behind the OTW simulator image.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section8-0018720811428734">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A 3 × 2 ANOVA was conducted to analyze the effect of head movement frequency and predictor state on apparent latency. An alpha level of .05 was used for all statistical tests. Because of our approach in viewing latency from the perspective of the user, as a visual separation between HMD and OTW imagery, it was imperative to first measure apparent latency in degrees of visual angle (refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018720811428734">Table 1</xref> for system latency in milliseconds). By using this measure, we were able to discriminate between apparent latency at different head movement frequencies. As will be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018720811428734">Table 1</xref>, there may actually be lower system latency in milliseconds at higher head movement frequency, but the system latency translates into larger apparent latency.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of Experiment 1 was not simply to determine whether apparent latency increases as head movement frequency increases. Rather, the purpose was to measure the magnitude of apparent latency from a nontheoretical, tangible manner from the perspective of the user, taking into account all of the variables associated with the simulator and HMD that contribute to latency. Moreover, the extent to which the predictive compensation reduces apparent latency, as compared with baseline, needed to be quantified in a hands-on manner instead of calculated with head tracker data.</p>
<p>The results of this experiment clearly illustrate the effect of head movement frequency on apparent latency. As frequency increased, apparent latency also increased. Collapsed across frequency conditions, the predictor-on condition produced significantly less apparent latency than did the predictor-off condition. This experiment yielded an interesting observation: The apparent latencies for the predictor-on conditions at 25° per second and 45° per second were relatively equal. It was concluded that the predictor strategy used in Experiment 1, simultaneous use of neural network and EFC, act to reduce apparent latency at a greater percentage at higher head movement frequencies.</p>
<p>The reason for the larger compensation at higher frequencies is difficult to quantify mathematically, given that the neural network does not follow a defined algorithm, which is why visual measurement was used. The reason may be that the neural network algorithms always work with the long prediction in concert with the single frame prediction and adjust to the perspective of the single frame prediction with EFC. Because the algorithm is always adjusting to the shorter interval prediction, one can generally expect a greater two-dimensional compensation to be performed. In the future, researchers will need to explore higher frequencies to understand why larger compensation occurs at higher frequencies.</p>
<p>Predicting where a user will move his or her head in multiaxis and multifrequency motion is difficult and involves knowledge of the task and operating environment, physical capabilities of the user, and technological limitations of the HMD and simulator. Because of this difficulty, and the conflicting results of previous research, it was logical to analyze predictive strategies for a simple task: side-to-side sinusoidal head movement. This consistent head movement frequency and direction cannot be directly applied to an operational or training scenario; however, it is this simple and basic task that allows for latency to be measured accurately, reliably, and consistently. In contrast, the results from applied tasks can be generalized only to training scenarios employing that specific task, because unique confounding variables, such as inconsistent head movement frequency and direction, are introduced that directly vary latency.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were from the University of Central Florida and received course credit. Of the 52 undergraduate and graduate students who completed testing, 4 participants’ data were not used because of self-reported extremely dry eye contacts from not blinking enough, an HMD that rotated downward so the imagery was out of view, and software issues that stopped the imagery from updating. This last software issue was resolved and no other problems were reported. A sample size of 48 was used for analyses: 27 women and 21 men, ages 18 to 44 years (<italic>M</italic> = 22), and no pilots. All participants reported to be in good health with no history of seizures and had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity as tested prior to data collection with a Snellen visual acuity test. The experiment was conducted at NAWCTSD in Orlando, Florida.</p>

<sec id="section16-0018720811428734">
<title>Stimuli and apparatus</title>
<p>The same design and equipment were used in Experiment 2, with a few notable exceptions. Human participants were used instead of the rigid plastic head, camera, and motion platform setup. Also, the OTW dome simulator imagery and HMD imagery were different from those used in Experiment 1. The OTW imagery was a still frame, and the HMD image was updated as the head moved. Both the OTW and HMD displays were of realistic imagery representative of the view of a pilot in visual meteorological conditions on approach to an airport that is partially surrounded by mountains. The OTW imagery was full color, and the HMD imagery was green monochrome. The same HMD was used, with only the right eye display turned on for testing. A laser pointer was mounted to the plastic head attached to the pan-tilt motion platform. Participants used the red dot from the laser pointer, projected onto the OTW display, as a visual cue to follow.</p>

<p>A 3 × 2 between-subjects design was implemented, with 8 participants placed in one of six testing groups on the basis of the order tested. The first independent variable was head movement frequency of 5°, 25°, or 45° per second, and the second independent variable was predictive compensation either off or on. The dependent variables were now simulator sickness ratings, measured by the VRSQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720811428734">Ames et al., 2005</xref>), of eight general body symptoms and five eye-related symptoms, as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720811428734">Table 2</xref>. Each symptom had a rating from 0 to 6, from <italic>no symptoms</italic> to <italic>severe</italic>. Thus, the body symptoms had a possible overall rating from 0 to 48 and eye-related symptoms from 0 to 30.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants first provided informed consent. Participants were not screened for motion or simulator sickness history prior to testing, and we decided to not administer a pretest VRSQ to minimize preexposure to knowledge of symptoms, which may possibly increase simulator sickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018720811428734">Young, Adelstein, &amp; Ellis, 2006</xref>). However, per Navy policy and part of the informed consent, each participant understood that testing may result in adverse physiological feelings. Each participant was tested for visual acuity as well as for postural stability with the Standing on Preferred Leg postural equilibrium test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720811428734">Johnson, 2005</xref>), both pre- and posttest for safety reasons. After the pretest measures, participants were seated in a chair so that their eyes were at the same location as the camera in Experiment 1. Participants sat down to simulate sitting in an aircraft cockpit. In addition, sitting would limit the possibility of vasovagal syncope, which results in physically swaying about or fainting and occurs when heart rate fails to be maintained while standing and has occurred or has been thought to have occurred in past studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720811428734">Moss &amp; Muth, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018720811428734">Smart, Pagulayan, &amp; Stoffregen, 1998</xref>). Participants were fitted with the HMD and optics optimally configured for clarity.</p>
<p>To address several limitations of previously described studies, this experiment involved a simple task that would minimize several possible confounding variables. Although the task reduces ecological validity of the experiment, it maximizes reliability of the data (reliable head movement frequency and direction) between participants and is highly repeatable in future studies. The researcher instructed participants of their task: to rotate their head side to side from −60° to +60° for 10 min following a red dot that was projected onto the OTW simulator display while only rotating their head (not scanning with their eyes) and not rotating their torso (not swiveling the chair).</p>
<p>Using the red dot as a visual reference, along with the simple direction of head movement, minimized errors in head movement frequency and direction between participants, which in past studies have not been properly controlled for, resulting in unknown differences in magnitude of apparent latency between participants in those studies. To that same end, it was also important to eliminate torso movement, as such movement has been identified as a possible contributor to sickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720811428734">Bouyer &amp; Watt, 1996</xref>). At the end of testing, participants immediately completed the VRSQ to evaluate symptoms before they diminished in severity. A background questionnaire, given after testing, indicated that 1 participant had a short-duration experience in a simulator but did not experience simulator sickness, and thus data were used for analyses.</p>

<sec id="section19-0018720811428734">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A 3 × 2 between-subjects MANOVA was conducted on the effect of head movement frequency and predictor state on simulator sickness, with an alpha level of .05 used for all statistical tests. MANOVA is a statistical technique that is appropriate to use when outcome measures are expected to correlate, because the measures represent two ways of looking at the same underlying issue. A Pearson’s correlation on the data found a moderate correlation of .457, which is significant at the .01 level. Given the possibility of non-normally distributed data, a test of skewness was performed. A slight degree of skewness was present in the data, but MANOVA is very robust to modest violations of normality if they are caused by skewness rather than outliers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018720811428734">Mertler &amp; Vannatta, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018720811428734">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 1996</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In previous research, system latency, in milliseconds, and not apparent latency has been used to describe findings, and thus our study will compare in this same manner. As discussed previously, results conflict on the perceptibility of latency. In many of the testing conditions, system latency was greater than the perceptibility threshold in many previous studies already discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720811428734">Adelstein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720811428734">Ellis et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018720811428734">Mania et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018720811428734">Regan et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, in conversation with participants after testing, we found that latency was more perceptible, or more participants could perceive it, in the higher latency testing conditions. However, no formal data were collected to further verify this finding.</p>
<p>Even though latency was perceptible in many of the conditions, system latency was quite low compared with previous studies of simulator sickness. The highest system latency observed in our study was 85.57 ms in one of six conditions (at 45° per second and predictor off)—lower than 200 ms, which produced simulator sickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720811428734">DiZio &amp; Lackner, 1997</xref>), and the following, which did not produce sickness: 280 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018720811428734">So, 1994</xref>); 46 ms, 96 ms, and 146 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018720811428734">Nelson et al., 2000</xref>); 150 ms and 250 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720811428734">Draper et al., 2001</xref>); and 40 ms and 240 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720811428734">Moss &amp; Muth, 2011</xref>). The lack of a significant effect of head movement frequency on simulator sickness is thought to be directly attributed to this low system latency and, even more so, to the small difference in system latency between frequency conditions: 34.48 ms at 5° per second, 57.47 ms at 25° per second, and 52.68 ms at 45° per second.</p>
<p>In terms of simulator sickness ratings, as head movement frequency increased, body symptoms increased and then decreased, yet eye-related symptoms only decreased, as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018720811428734">Table 1</xref>. We concluded that even though latency was perceptible in many of the testing conditions, it did not necessarily translate to feelings of simulator sickness in the frequency conditions. Larger differences in latency between each testing condition may bring about simulator sickness. For frequency conditions, 16 participants were in each testing group, whereas there were 24 participants in each predictor state. More participants may be needed to overcome the inherent variation in susceptibility. Also, the duration of testing may need to be extended to bring about simulator sickness. More research is needed to explore these questions.</p>
<p>With regard to evaluating the effect of predictive compensation on simulator sickness, it was observed that system latency and apparent latency both decreased from the off to the on condition, from 78.33 ms (2.07°) to 18.09 ms (0.58°). This difference in latency, according to past studies, is perceptible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720811428734">Adelstein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720811428734">Ellis et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018720811428734">Mania et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018720811428734">Regan et al., 1999</xref>), and conversation with participants after testing indicated that this latency was indeed perceptible to the users, with the higher latency perceptible and the lower latency slightly or not at all perceptible. Although past studies cannot definitively support that decreased latency contributes to decreased simulator sickness, because of the controlled nature of this study, we directly relate this decrease in system and apparent latency to the decrease in simulator sickness.</p>
<p>Some studies have indicated that the physical act of moving the head may have an effect on simulator sickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720811428734">Bouyer &amp; Watt, 1996</xref>); however, studies have not rigidly controlled for consistent head movement in the same manner as in our study. At 25° per second and 45° per second in the predictor-on conditions, apparent latency was nearly equal, yet at 45° per second, there was lower magnitude of body symptoms. In addition, eye-related symptoms decreased each time head movement frequency increased. Also, the predictor-on conditions produced significantly lower simulator sickness even though the participants used the same head movement frequencies as in the predictor-off conditions. Because of these results, it seems that the physical act of moving one’s head did not produce sickness distinct from the independent variables. The unique design of the study maintained consistent magnitudes of head movement frequency within a particular testing condition. In contrast, other studies utilized tasks that did not maintain consistent head movement frequency, and thus the physical movement of the head may have had an effect on simulator sickness.</p>
<p>In terms of individual symptoms, the noticeable difference in boredom scores at 45° per second seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720811428734">Table 2</xref>, when apparent latency was greatest (in degrees) between the two predictor conditions, leads us to believe that apparent latency produced visual stimulation that was not clearly defined and resulted in feelings of boredom. This boredom, however, because of the trend seen in the data, is thought to be attributable to the abnormal visual stimulation caused by apparent latency and not the act of performing the task. Boredom, like the other symptoms, is an adverse result of latency and may lead to performance degradation in training.</p>
<p>Because of the natural variation of physiology between participants, it was best to analyze the body symptoms and eye-related symptoms as two data points. Although overall severity of symptoms was low in each condition, as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720811428734">Table 2</xref>, the predictor condition still yielded a significant effect. It may be that these sickness scores were quite low and that the differences are not meaningful in this particular experiment; however, the results certainly indicate promising use of predictive compensation in reducing simulator sickness when latency is higher and the duration of testing is longer.</p>

<title>General Discussion and Practical Implications</title>
<p>Of the three theories discussed in the Introduction, simulator sickness may be explained by a variant of the sensory conflict theory. As conflicting sensory inputs are experienced by the brain, there may be a physiological reaction indicating to stop the activity causing conflict. In this study, conflict between the visual and vestibular systems was dissimilar to that in past studies involving occluded HMDs. There is only the HMD image in an occluded HMD, which may lead to visual-vestibular conflict because, as the head moves, the image does not correspond with the position of the head because of latency.</p>
<p>In a see-through HMD, there are unique sensory perceptions that are different from those in an occluded HMD. A see-through HMD creates two images: HMD and OTW imagery. Head movements resulted in three perceptions: (a) The OTW imagery, because it was fixed on the simulator display, produced images on the retina that varied directly with head movement and thus did not produce a visual-vestibular conflict; (b) the HMD imagery did not directly correspond to head movement because of latency and thus produced a visual-vestibular conflict; and (c) the separation between the HMD and the OTW imagery, caused by latency, produced a visual-visual conflict. We believe the second perception was difficult for the user, or this perception would have comparably less effect, because the user was continuously rotating his or her head.</p>
<p>This study contrasts with research, described in the Introduction, in which users detected latency in virtual environments by rotating their head. Those studies involved a still virtual object whereby latency could be detected if the object moved slightly. This study was different in that it included imagery in the entire field of view and the imagery was supposed to move across the retina as the head moved. Because of this movement of imagery, the user did not have the same cue of latency. Also, this study differed from several studies that employed discrete (start-and-stop) head movements with use of occluded or see-through HMDs, which produce visual-vestibular conflict of slew, or “catching up,” of the HMD image when the head stops. Our study did not include this cue, and so we believe the second perception described previously had little to no effect. As a result, we conclude that the third perception contributed to simulator sickness, as a visual-visual conflict.</p>
<p>These findings lead us to believe that there does not necessarily need to be a sensory mismatch between systems, such as between the visual and vestibular systems, as the sensory conflict theory states, but that simulator sickness may also occur as a result of a sensory mismatch <italic>within a system</italic>, particularly, the visual system. The hypothesized cause of the sickness was that the apparent latency produced horizontally separated yet similar images that conflicted with past experience of smooth and continuous images very much grounded in the history of the visual system. When continued visual stimulation occurs that conflicts with this history, the result may be feelings of simulator sickness. Also, although this visual-visual mismatch occurred, significant eye-related symptoms did not. This finding does not seem logical, but it may be that apparent latency has a weaker effect on eye-related symptoms, and thus larger apparent latency is then necessary to bring out those symptoms. However, more research is needed to support these claims.</p>

<sec id="section25-0018720811428734">
<title>Future Research</title>
<p>As advancements in technology lead to predictive strategies that are more refined, testing can be performed with a similar design as used in this study to directly compare and evaluate the improved accuracy and effectiveness of those emerging technologies. There were limitations to this study that should be explored in future research, such as the use of a binocular see-through HMD, which may increase the perceptibility of latency; use of larger apparent latency; and greater duration of testing. Although not believed to have contributed to simulator sickness, the effect of head movement on simulator sickness, if any, should be investigated in future studies. Last, it is important to stress the relatively basic approach, with rigid task parameters, this study took toward evaluating simulator sickness and the practical application limitation this approach places on the study. Continuous rotation of the head back and forth is not used in training programs, yet we believe it was necessary to approach the study in this way for several reasons previously discussed in this article. By doing so, this study allowed for a more fundamental understanding of the factors contributing to simulator sickness and strategies to minimize sickness, which can then be considered when developing, testing, or modifying simulators or training programs.</p>
<p>Although subjective reports offer an insight into simulator sickness, they suffer from measuring only the outward expression of simulator sickness, and so there must also be an understanding of the physiological cause not bound by the natural limitations of subjective measures. It will be necessary to perform neural imaging studies of participants before, during, and after simulator exposure with and without HMDs. Perhaps there are unique interactions between certain areas of the brain that arise while performing specific tasks in these simulator environments. Only by understanding the neural mechanisms stimulated by various manipulated independent variables, such as latency, along with evidence from basic and applied psychological studies can theories converge on the underlying cause(s) of simulator sickness and methods devised to mitigate or eliminate these symptoms entirely.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Since HMDs are plagued by issues of latency, it has been troublesome, at times, to train in simulators. For this study, we used predictive compensation to minimize system and apparent latency and thereby reduce simulator sickness. By simplifying the task, we were able to control several variables, such as head movement frequency and direction, previously left unaccounted for. This control allowed for the accurate and reliable measurement of apparent latency as well as of its effect on simulator sickness because participants experienced the same apparent latency within each testing condition. The results of this study are promising for the use of training simulators with HMDs as well as other applications in which latency is to be mitigated. For aviation, the military could save millions of dollars in fuel and other operational costs by increasing use of simulators. Moreover, scenarios could be practiced on the ground, allowing innovative research to be conducted with minimal danger to the pilot. With exciting new breakthroughs occurring in optics and computer technology, there are sure to be new strategies of reducing latency that need to be thoroughly researched before implementation in simulation-based training with use of HMDs.</p>
