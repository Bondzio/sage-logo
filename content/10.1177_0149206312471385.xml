<abstract>
<p>While previous research has investigated structural hole positions through single-level models, describing their positive effects, this article elaborates a multilevel model and supports an antithetical position, revealing a dark side of structural holes. Although individual-level structural holes are supposed to exercise positive effects, it is theorized that group-level mean and group-level variance in structural hole positions are negatively associated with individual outcomes. The argument that justifies the aforementioned negative association is that the individualistic, competitive, manipulative and power-oriented behaviors of employees occupying structural hole positions may be beneficial when considering independent individuals, but, instead, they create frictions and problems when it comes to group functioning and group climate. This article provides evidence that group composition variables exercise a constraining effect on individuals, making them perceive less autonomy, and negatively affect satisfaction and performance. Findings provide support for the multilevel nature of networks and for the opposite causal mechanisms activated by structural holes at different levels of analysis.</p>

<p>Over the past two decades, research on social networks has been strongly influenced by the theory of structural holes. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206312471385">Burt (1992)</xref>, an individual who bridges contacts not tied to each other occupies a structural hole position, which is supposed to lead to advantageous consequences. A flurry of empirical investigations has supported Burt’s theoretical position demonstrating the diverse benefits which stem from bridging unconnected others at the individual level of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206312471385">Burt, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0149206312471385">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206312471385">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206312471385">Fleming, Mingo, &amp; Chen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206312471385">Mizruchi &amp; Stearns, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0149206312471385">Rodan &amp; Galunic, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0149206312471385">Seibert, Kraimer, &amp; Liden, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0149206312471385">Soda &amp; Bizzi, 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206312471385">Moliterno and Mahony (2011)</xref> acknowledged that network theoretic constructs tend to be isomorphic, since the explanatory mechanisms are generally replicated considering different levels of analysis: As it is beneficial for an individual to bridge unconnected individuals, we would expect that it is likewise beneficial for a group to bridge unconnected groups.</p>
<p>Yet the argument for the benefits of structural holes may be challenged focusing on the nested nature of individual networks in groups. More specifically, an unexplored dark side of structural holes emerges if we investigate the cross-level relationship between the group composition of structural holes and individual outcomes. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206312471385">Burt’s (1992)</xref> theory, by bridging two unconnected alters an individual ego becomes capable of filtering and maneuvering information so that he or she can have access to superior information and can exercise a form of control over the behaviors of these alters. Therefore, an individual ego derives personal gains from bridging two unconnected alters. But what happens to these two alters? The personal gains for ego can represent personal losses for alters. Brokers gain advantage as long as they keep information to themselves or charge a “brokerage fee” that unconnected others must pay for the information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206312471385">Buskens &amp; van de Rijt, 2008</xref>). Brokers exercise control over the most rewarding opportunities and gain advantage because they do not permit others to likewise exploit them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206312471385">Burt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206312471385">Fernandez &amp; Gould, 1994</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0149206312471385">Obstfeld (2005)</xref>, structural hole theory is built on the idea of adversarial relationships, on manipulating others for one’s own personal benefit, and on playing people off against one another. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206312471385">Burt (2000</xref>: 355) mentions that, to serve personal interests, “ambiguous or distorted information is strategically moved between contacts by the <italic>tertius</italic>.”</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0149206312471385">Krackhardt (1999)</xref>, the logic of the <italic>tertius gaudens</italic> (third who rejoices) used by Burt is built on the assumption of independence among actors: Bridged alters comply with the competitive game and do not expect that a broker behaves in their interests or joins them if they need. However, while the competitive and self-oriented logic of brokers may be advantageous for independent individuals, it engenders frictions when it comes to employees affiliated with the same group, who are, in fact, not independent. The competitiveness of structural holes exacerbates rivalry decreasing the likelihood of pursuing collective goals, while closed networks create bonding that facilitates the pursuit of collective goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206312471385">Adler &amp; Kwon, 2002</xref>). Work groups function effectively when members equally share knowledge with one another, do not engage in self-oriented behaviors and collaborate instead of competing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206312471385">Harrison, Price, Gavin, &amp; Florey, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0149206312471385">Stasser &amp; Titus, 1985</xref>). So would a group function well if members withhold, filter, manipulate, or control information for their own personal benefit?</p>
<p>To address this question, the present article elaborates a multilevel theory of structural holes and explores how individual structural hole positions aggregated at the group level exercise cross-level effects on individual perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors. Addressing this question allows filling a gap in the exploration of multilevel studies on network research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206312471385">Brass, Galaskiewicz, Greve, &amp; Tsai, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206312471385">Moliterno &amp; Mahony, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0149206312471385">Provan, Fish, &amp; Sydow, 2007</xref>). Although previous authors started studying how networks at one level of analysis affect networks at another level of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206312471385">Contractor, Wasserman, &amp; Faust, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206312471385">Moliterno &amp; Mahony, 2011</xref>), the question of how individual networks should combine in aggregate network structures to lead to beneficial outcomes for the individuals still remains theoretically and empirically open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0149206312471385">Ibarra, Kilduff, &amp; Tsai, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>A Multilevel Network Model of Structural Holes</title>
<p>Considering the nested nature of individuals in groups, the individual level can be conceptualized as the network of each group member, while the group level can be conceptualized as the whole structure derived aggregating group members’ networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0149206312471385">Ibarra et al., 2005</xref>). Scholars have previously examined the predictive role of group network density and network centralization, which can somehow be respectively conceptualized as group-level mean and group-level variance in network degree centrality, when only ties internal to the group are considered. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206312471385">Balkundi and Harrison (2006)</xref> performed a meta-analytical study and supported that density in both instrumental and affective networks relates to aggregate performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0149206312471385">Sparrowe, Liden, Wayne, and Kraimer (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206312471385">Cummings and Cross (2003)</xref> found evidence that centralization negatively relates to group performance. These works are fundamentally single-level empirical studies, since both dependent and independent variables are measured at the group level. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206312471385">Moliterno and Mahony (2011)</xref> notice that although previous studies addressed the nested nature of individual networks in groups, they were not empirical works employing multilevel methodology and examining the cross-level bridges between variables and different levels of analysis.</p>
<p>To fill the gap in the multilevel exploration of structural holes, this article proposes a model to study how the group composition of individual structural hole positions affects individual outcomes. There are two group-level variables that can be derived from the aggregation of individual structural hole positions at the group level. The first variable is group-level mean in structural holes, which is derived by averaging the individual structural hole position of team members in the organization. Group-level mean in structural holes follows an additive composition logic that assumes that the higher level construct is derived from the aggregation, or the average, of the lower level constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206312471385">Chan, 1998</xref>). Group density, for instance, may be conceptualized as a group-level network construct derived from the aggregation of individual degree centralities within the group. The second variable that can be studied to describe the group composition of individual structural holes is group-level variance in structural holes. Group-level variance in structural holes follows the dispersion composition logic that assumes that the variation or heterogeneity in scores at the lower level defines the construct at the higher level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206312471385">Chan, 1998</xref>). Group centralization may be conceptualized as a group-level network construct derived from observing the dispersion of individual degree centrality scores within the group.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0149206312471385">Figure 1</xref> provides a graphical illustration of three distinct groups studied in this empirical investigation. The three figures on the left report illustrations of the aggregate ego network of individuals in the team, encompassing both the direct ties among members and the ties among contacts of members. The three figures on the right illustrate only the direct ties among group members. While the figures on the left directly depict the structural hole positions of each team member, the figures on the right show how broker members tend to have many contacts, contacts in different units, and fewer overlapping contacts with each other as compared to nonbroker team members. Group 1 represents the case of a team responsible for service outsourcing in the company and is populated by individuals spanning several structural holes. Group 3 shows the opposite case of a team responsible for procurement, in which members are embedded in closed networks with low structural holes. Group 2 is an intermediate case of a team responsible for project design in which some members span several structural holes while other members do not. This last case is characterized by high variance in individual structural hole positions. The next section of the article elaborates a theory on the cross-level effects of group networks on individuals and illustrates how the two identified constructs, group-level mean and group-level variance in structural hole positions, exercise similar effects on individual cognitions, attitudes, and behaviors.</p>

<title>The Constraining Effect of Structural Holes Across Levels of Analysis</title>
<p>The first cross-level effect of structural holes studied examines the individual cognition about discretion in decision making, which is captured by the perception of autonomy. It is germane to consider this variable because according to previous research structural holes enable individuals’ opportunities for exercising discretionary behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206312471385">Burt, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0149206312471385">2004</xref>). Yet the evidence of the cross-level effects of structural holes may be the opposite. More specifically, group-level mean in structural holes may constrain discretionary choice, negatively affecting the individual perception of autonomy. An explanatory mechanism that intervenes in the relationship between group-mean in structural holes and the individual perception of autonomy is dependence. Network relationships generate conditions of dependence on others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206312471385">Brass &amp; Burkhardt, 1993</xref>). In particular, an ego in structural hole position gains an advantage over brokered alters because alters depend on ego for access to information, resources, and opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206312471385">Burt, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206312471385">1997</xref>). If contacts do not have alternative sources of information, they are in a vulnerable position of dependence in which their behavioral opportunities are constrained by the actors they depend on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206312471385">Bonacich, 1987</xref>). Dependence on others reduces the perception of individual autonomy because it decreases the opportunities for exercising discretionary choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206312471385">Brass, 1981</xref>). Consequently, while being in a structural hole position can empower the exercise of behavioral opportunities exploiting dependence of others, being in a group where all group members occupy structural hole positions creates conditions of dependence over the other members, which can exercise an aggregate constraining force and hamper the exercise of behavioral discretion. A single member can perceive lower autonomy as a result of the condition of dependence on all other members.</p>
<p>An additional mechanism that intervenes to explain the relationship between group-mean structural holes and autonomy is trust within the group. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206312471385">Dirks and Ferrin (2001)</xref> note, often trust within a group does not have a direct effect on outcomes, but can serve as an intermediary mechanism that transfers an effect on the final outcomes. When members in a group span structural holes, they may not develop interpersonal trust, differently from individuals embedded in closed networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206312471385">Coleman, 1990</xref>). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206312471385">Coleman’s (1990)</xref> logic, an individual embedded in a closed network avoids behaving opportunistically with others because opportunistic behaviors can easily be detected: A team member whose contacts overlap may signal to other members that he or she has nothing to hide, leading to a lower perception of potential opportunistic behaviors and more trust. By contrast, an individual in a sparse network can be less observed and have more occasions to engage in opportunistic behaviors without punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206312471385">Brass, Butterfield, &amp; Skaggs, 1998</xref>). If individuals are independent, they may not need to monitor each other’s behaviors, but if individuals participate to joint group activities, they feel the need to know what everyone is doing, and the lack of trust will result in an increased monitoring of behaviors that constrain the choices of the actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206312471385">Costa, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206312471385">Langfred, 2004</xref>). When members lack interpersonal trust of each other, a deleterious group climate for trust emerges in which the shared perception of possible opportunistic behaviors increases individual monitoring and constrains everyone’s exertion of discretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206312471385">Costa, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206312471385">Costa &amp; Bijisma-Frankema, 2007</xref>). Lack of trust among members at the group level generates the need for increased individual monitoring, which decreases the perception of autonomy of each member of a team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206312471385">Langfred, 2007</xref>). In a team in which everyone spans structural holes, it is, therefore, likely that a deleterious group climate for trust develops, leading to a reduced perception of autonomy in each member. Furthermore, in a group composed of brokers, the effect of trust on the perception of autonomy may be exacerbated by the simultaneous condition of high dependence among brokers because when actors heavily depend on each other, poor conditions of trust are likely to provide a strong disincentive to relinquish control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0149206312471385">Mayer, Davis, &amp; Schoorman, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Note that a core argument in favor of structural holes is that individuals are less monitored in brokerage positions, while closed networks develop social norms that limit the discretionary behaviors of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206312471385">Burt, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0149206312471385">Krackhardt, 1999</xref>). However, this argument builds on the assumption that individuals are unaffiliated to groups. Groups exercise control when they perceive that the potential denial of norms can threaten the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206312471385">Feldman, 1984</xref>). On the contrary, through the mutual expectation of compliance to social norms, group members reduce their doubts with regard to each other, enabling discretionary action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206312471385">Gibson &amp; Earley, 2007</xref>). Closed networks, facilitating social norms, create perceptions of clear group membership, which decrease the need to exercise social sanctions, while the socially disparaged behaviors of brokers in a group encourage social sanctions that confine the exercise of behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0149206312471385">Xiao &amp; Tsui, 2007</xref>). As a result of the previously mentioned mechanisms, it is anticipated that</p>
<list id="list1-0149206312471385" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1:</italic> Group-level mean in structural holes is negatively associated with individual perception of autonomy.</p></list-item></list>
<p>In addition to group-level mean, group-level variance in structural holes is likely to exercise an effect on the perception of autonomy. Heterogeneity in structural hole positions occupied by team members can activate group dynamics that affect the individual perception of discretion. Individuals bridging structural holes and individuals in a closed network embrace and reinforce discordant and opposite views and values, which hinder the formation of shared beliefs about what is acceptable group behavior, thus impeding the enablement of discretionary choice. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0149206312471385">Podolny and Baron (1997)</xref> individuals with high and low structural hole positions develop opposite views on normative expectations and believe in the appropriateness of different behaviors. Individuals spanning structural holes progressively embrace a logic of calculation, exchange-oriented relationships, and personal gain, while individuals in closed networks, sharing contacts, learn how to value social obligations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206312471385">Buskens &amp; van de Rijt, 2008</xref>). It might become salient for a broker to engage in entrepreneurial behaviors, while someone embedded in a closed network learns the relevance of respecting established norms and adequately performing what is expected of him or her (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206312471385">Burt, 2000</xref>). Structural hole positions reinforce orientations toward the propensity for risk and the search for personal authority, while closed positions reinforce orientations toward an aversion to risk and the search for security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206312471385">Burt, Jannotta, &amp; Mahoney, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Discordant and opposite views among team members are the core reason behind the development of conflict in a group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206312471385">Amason, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206312471385">De Dreu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0149206312471385">Jehn, 1995</xref>). Conflict in the group can represent a key mechanism that intervenes to explain individual perceptions of autonomy. The relationship between group conflict and group outcomes is mixed, with authors debating over a positive or negative view of conflict for group outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206312471385">De Dreu &amp; Weingart, 2003</xref>). Authors have likewise specified the divergent effects of different types of conflict, especially task or relational conflict, on group outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206312471385">Jehn &amp; Bendersky, 2003</xref>). However, in spite of the implications for group outcomes, the effects of conflict types on autonomy may be convergent. From a negative view of conflict, team members are constrained by their dissention and block each other’s individual action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206312471385">De Dreu &amp; Weingart, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206312471385">Jehn &amp; Bendersky, 2003</xref>), hence potentially leading to a lower perception of autonomy. From a positive view, conflict motivates team members to constructively resolve it. However, in the attempt to resolve conflict, the group engages in shared action and refrains from allowing each individual to behave autonomously because the basis for dissention would be exacerbated rather than mitigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206312471385">De Dreu &amp; Van Vianen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0149206312471385">Jehn, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206312471385">Jehn &amp; Bendersky, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206312471385">Jehn &amp; Mannix, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Hence, both positive and negative views of team conflict may suggest a constraining effect on discretion, influencing the individual perception of autonomy. In a recent meta-analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206312471385">de Wit, Greer, and Jehn (2012)</xref> found that although the effect of group conflict on distal outcomes such as group performance varies, conflict tends to be negative for proximal outcomes, such as individual perceptions and states, because individuals in teams will generally perceive conflicting situations as constraining and detrimental to their individual expression. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206312471385">Jehn and Bendersky (2003)</xref>, although different types of conflict, task or relational, show divergent effects on group performance, they all negatively affect the capacity to reach consensus, which can limit the ability of exploiting behavioral choices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206312471385">Langfred (2007)</xref> found that team conflict, both relational and task, is deleterious to the perception of individual autonomy because members can withhold each other’s autonomy as punishment for disagreement, as revenge for personal dislikes or because they are less prone to delegate responsibilities to each other. Following the proposed rationale, through the intervening mechanism of group conflict, individuals in a heterogeneous group, composed of members spanning structural holes and members embedded in a closed network, are expected to perceive lower autonomy.</p>

<title>The Attitudinal Effect of Structural Holes Across Levels of Analysis</title>
<p>The group composition of structural holes may also have an effect on individual attitudes. More specifically, the group-level mean in structural holes is expected to affect individual job satisfaction. Individuals are likely to be less satisfied in a group where members occupy structural hole positions than in a group where members are embedded in closed networks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206312471385">Buskens and van de Rijt (2008)</xref> argue that individuals spanning structural holes substitute a logic of social obligation with a logic of calculation and personal gain. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0149206312471385">Watts (1999</xref>, p. 495) networks can be used as a “device to be manipulated consciously for an actor’s own ends.” By contrast, individuals embedded in a closed network learn how to value collaborative behaviors and how to share information with others, without keeping information for themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206312471385">Coleman, 1990</xref>). A group in which team members display collaborative behaviors is likely to have more satisfied individuals than a group in which all team members display calculative and self-oriented behaviors. The collaborative orientation of individuals in a team creates a climate of group harmony in which every individual gets personal gratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206312471385">Bell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206312471385">Eby &amp; Dobbins, 1997</xref>). When team members display collaborative behaviors and share sources of information with each other, they can influence each other’s cognitions, leading to the formation of group shared beliefs that reinforce the contentment of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206312471385">González-Romá, Peiró, Lloret, &amp; Zornoza, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0149206312471385">González-Romá, Peiró, &amp; Tordera, 2002</xref>). When team members display and embrace collectivist behaviors, based on mutual reliance and concern instead of individualism, they become personally interested in each other and concerned with the well-being of any member, resulting in positive psychological attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206312471385">Dierdorff, Bell, &amp; Belohlav, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0149206312471385">Jackson, Colquitt, Wesson, &amp; Zapata-Phelan, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, if individuals bridging structural holes are affiliated to the same group, they could dislike each other and develop negative emotional states, which ultimately lead to lower gratification and satisfaction. As individuals inhabiting sparse networks do not learn to value trustworthiness and reciprocity, they are more likely to develop negative affective states toward close peers, leading to lower satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206312471385">Labianca &amp; Brass, 2006</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206312471385">Brass et al. (1998)</xref>, brokers, playing one actor off against the other, have more opportunity to engage in unethical behavior, which generates negative emotional responses from proximal individuals. Emotional tensions among brokers in the same environment could rise because brokers may decrease each other’s opportunities through simultaneous brokerage behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206312471385">Buskens &amp; van de Rijt, 2008</xref>). When team members display self-interested behaviors motivated by the pursuit of personal gain, the group can catalyze and exacerbate interpersonal frictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206312471385">Eby &amp; Dobbins, 1997</xref>). Brokers are competitive, and individuals working with colleagues who are perceived as competitors grow hostile attitudes and become jealous of each other, developing negative emotional states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206312471385">Cohen-Charash &amp; Mueller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206312471385">Mouly &amp; Sankaran, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0149206312471385">Smith, Parrott, Ozer, &amp; Moniz, 1994</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206312471385">Labianca, Brass, and Gray (1998)</xref>, within the organization, individuals can simply avoid relating to others who they dislike, but in work groups members are bound together and cannot circumvent their negative relations, exacerbating states of frustration and dissatisfaction. For these reasons, it is anticipated that</p>

<p>Beside group mean, group variance in structural hole positions is expected to exercise an effect on job satisfaction. The logic by which group-level variance in structural holes affects job satisfaction springs from the application of homophily theory. According to homophily theory, individuals derive higher satisfaction from being associated with others similar to themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0149206312471385">McPherson &amp; Smith-Lovin, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206312471385">McPherson, Smith-Lovin, &amp; Cook, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206312471385">Lazarsfeld and Merton (1954)</xref> identify two main forms of homophily: value homophily, in which similarity is based on a set of inner values, beliefs, and attitudes that individuals embrace, and status homophily, in which similarity is based on either a formal or informal recognition of status. As previously specified, an individual bridging structural holes and an individual in a closed network are likely to embrace and reinforce different values. Furthermore, an individual bridging structural holes and an individual in a closed network are likely to gain dissimilar status. Structural hole positions and status are tightly intertwined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0149206312471385">Soda &amp; Zaheer, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0149206312471385">Podolny (2005)</xref> argues that individuals bridging structural holes are likely to gain more status than individuals in a closed network because their position as spanners allows them to gain prominence, visibility, reputation, and legitimacy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0149206312471385">Seibert et al. (2001)</xref> argue that individuals occupying positions that bridge structural holes understand how to behave appropriately to gain visibility and prominence within the organization.</p>
<p>Multiple research streams have elaborated separate theoretical positions that lead to the same conclusion that group differences in both values and status are likely to generate negative attitudinal effects such as lower satisfaction. Research on group composition posits that diversity in personal values within groups is likely to trigger negative affective outcomes, such as lower satisfaction, at both the individual and aggregate group levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0149206312471385">Milliken &amp; Martins, 1996</xref>). Research on relational demography suggests that diversity in values and status might hamper group integration because it decreases the interpersonal liking of members, making each individual less gratified and satisfied to work in the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206312471385">Byrne, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206312471385">Harrison, Price, &amp; Bell, 1998</xref>). Research on self-categorization posits that individuals derive their self-identity as a function of the characteristics of others in the group and differences will promote less attachment to the social collective and lower gratification with working in a group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0149206312471385">Tsui, Egan, &amp; O’Reilly, 1992</xref>). As people uncover differences in what they believe, in what they value, and in what they care about, it becomes less pleasant to work together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206312471385">Harrison et al., 1998</xref>). Applying the logics of these lines of reasoning, if people derive higher satisfaction from being associated with others who have similar status and similar values, individuals in a group with high variance in structural hole positions will consequently experience less satisfaction than individuals in a team with low variance in structural hole positions. Hence, the following relationship is hypothesized:</p>

<title>The Behavioral Effect of Structural Holes Across Levels of Analysis</title>
<p>Last, group-level variables of structural holes are expected to exercise an effect on individual behaviors. More specifically, group mean in individual structural hole positions affects individual performance. A core explanatory mechanism supposed to justify the relationship between group-level mean in structural holes and individual performance is associated with the power mechanisms activated by structural hole positions. Structural hole positions allow individuals to develop a power base and to develop an orientation toward exploiting personal power, while individuals in a closed networks gain less personal power and become less interested in seeking it out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206312471385">Burt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0149206312471385">Rodan &amp; Galunic, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0149206312471385">Seibert et al., 2001</xref>). In a team with individuals seeking personal power, there is a climate characterized by power struggles, tension, and defensive and aggressive behaviors, which hinder the execution of tasks in the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206312471385">Greer, Caruso, &amp; Jehn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206312471385">Greer &amp; Van Kleef, 2010</xref>). Groups composed of many power- and status-oriented individuals lack integration and exhibit vindictive behaviors and counterproductive disputes, which hamper group functioning and each person’s performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0149206312471385">Groysberg, Polzer, &amp; Elfenbein, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206312471385">Overbeck, Correll, &amp; Park, 2005</xref>). Groups composed of individuals with high power are characterized by power struggles because high-power individuals show dominant behaviors: Multiple parties characterized by dominant behaviors in the same social environment clash with each other, compromising group functioning and hindering everyone’s execution of tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0149206312471385">de Reuver, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0149206312471385">Tiedens &amp; Fragale, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206312471385">Flynn and Wiltermuth (2010)</xref> posit that brokers, gaining personal power, tend to become more focused on themselves and less sensitive to others’ view, which in turn exacerbates clashes in the team and hindrance of behaviors.</p>
<p>The incompatibility of the competitive behaviors of brokers and the collaborative behaviors of individuals in a closed network may also affect performance beyond the effect on attitudes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206312471385">Buskens and van de Rijt (2008)</xref> posit that in an environment in which all members simultaneously seek to span structural holes, individuals hinder each other’s opportunities because, in a zero-sum game logic, the opportunities created by someone’s brokerage behaviors can be reduced by the brokerage behaviors of the others. By contrast, groups composed of team members who display collectivist behaviors and develop reliance on others are likely to function better and enable each individual to effectively execute the assigned tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206312471385">Dierdorff et al., 2011</xref>). Although team members who demonstrate competitive behaviors can access diverse information, they do not share it, try to outdo one another, hide information, and obstruct each other’s efforts, resulting in a poorer performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0149206312471385">Somech, Desivilya, &amp; Lidogoster, 2009</xref>). In a meta-analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206312471385">Bell (2007)</xref> showed that groups composed of team members displaying collectivist behaviors are associated with better functioning and performance implications as compared to groups composed of individuals displaying competitive behaviors. For the previously mentioned reasons, it is hypothesized that group-level mean in structural holes is negatively associated with individual performance.</p>
<list id="list5-0149206312471385" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 5:</italic> Group-level mean in structural hole positions is negatively associated with individual performance.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Last, group-level variance in structural hole positions is expected to affect individual performance. The core explanatory mechanism that is supposed to intervene to justify this relationship is related to the dynamics of information sharing. Ideally, a broker embedded in a sparse network has access to nonredundant information, while an individual in a closed network is exposed to the same type of information that recirculates within the network of contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206312471385">Granovetter, 1973</xref>). Following this argument, an individual who bridges structural holes can potentially contribute by providing more information to the group than can an individual in a closed network. On these premises, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206312471385">Oh, Labianca, and Chung (2006)</xref> proposed that groups could function well if brokers span outside connections and bring the outside knowledge inside the group for the benefit of everyone. Individuals in a team could specialize in brokering external relationships while sharing their unique sources of information with everyone inside the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206312471385">Ancona &amp; Caldwell, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet are brokers naturally motivated to share the informational advantage of their position with their group colleagues, especially when these colleagues belong to a closed network? The idea that brokers benefit from their access to information depends on the fact that they are used to keeping such information for themselves, filtering it and hence gaining personal control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206312471385">Burt, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0149206312471385">Obstfeld, 2005</xref>). A network structure does not give direct power, but rather the potential for gaining power, which is exploited when the informational benefits of structure are combined with tactics through which the individual withholds information and conveniently exchanges it when it leads to personal utility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206312471385">Brass &amp; Burkhardt, 1993</xref>). Individuals in structural hole positions do not derive advantage when they broker information for free, but can gain advantage because they charge an implicit “brokerage fee” for their service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206312471385">Buskens &amp; van de Rijt, 2008</xref>). Logically, if a broker collaboratively and automatically passed on all relevant information to his or her contacts, these contacts would be exposed to the very same opportunities for entrepreneurial behavior and the broker would be merely an efficient transmitter with no gatekeeping control, no information advantage, no dependence advantage, and thus no power advantage. In particular, if a broker transfers information about unique behavioral opportunities to a team member embedded in a closed network, such information will be quickly spread to all his or her contacts within the dense network, thus diluting any potential for competitive advantage and gain.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206312471385">Burt’s (1992)</xref> logic, unconnected contacts are not particularly troubled by the possible individualistic and opportunistic behaviors of their broker. However, team members may oppose these behaviors, especially if they are embedded in a closed network and are used to sharing the acquired information for the benefit of the network in which they are embedded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206312471385">Coleman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206312471385">Gargiulo &amp; Benassi, 2000</xref>). A group with diversity in structural hole composition will be characterized by individuals with high access to novel knowledge but who are less motivated to share it and individuals with low access to novel knowledge but who are more motivated to share it. It is plausible to assume that those individuals will clash with one another, potentially hampering the execution of each other’s tasks. Previous research provides substantial support for the argument that team members work well together and perform adequately if they share information in a similar fashion and likewise face difficulties when some share information in the interest of the group while others withhold information for their own interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206312471385">Hinsz, Tindale, &amp; Vollrath, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206312471385">Marks, Mathieu, &amp; Zaccaro, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0149206312471385">Marks, Sabella, Burke, &amp; Zaccaro, 2002</xref>). As a result of the previously mentioned argument, it is theorized that that group-level variance in structural holes is negatively associated with individual performance.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-0149206312471385">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Given the necessity of reaching a sufficient sample of individuals nested in groups, I collected empirical data by administering the same surveys to employees and supervisors of two distinct organizations. The two organizations are considerably different in terms of operations and markets, decreasing the concern that findings are contingent on a specific industry and have low external validity. The first organization is a company involved in the production and marketing of pharmaceuticals in North America. The company has 151 total employees, and usable answers were obtained from 138 of them (a response rate of 91%). There is substantial variety among units in the organization, as each unit deals with distinct processes, including business development, sales and marketing, human resource management, finance, and quality control. The second organization is a division of a video game company with operations in North America that is involved in the development of video games marketed all over the world. This organization has 191 total employees, and viable answers from 152 of them (response rate 80%) were collected. In this organization as well, there is a substantial variety of tasks performed by the units: Some units have engineers and programmers; some units have creative and artistic teams; some units have marketing and sales specialists; some units deal with quality control; and some units are responsible for traditional staff functions, such as human resources management and administration. In both organizations, I achieved a high response rate, which is a prerequisite for studies on networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0149206312471385">Wasserman &amp; Faust, 1994</xref>). I aggregated individuals by their groups, and I removed from the sample management, staff employees, and all individuals who were not formally affiliated to a work group, although their responses were retained for the data set on the network. Overall, the network data set is composed of 290 individuals (138 in the first organization, 152 in the second). The groups had an average of 5 team members, ranging from 3 to 11 respondents. The sample of individuals for the regression analyses is composed of 225 individuals (107 in the first organization, 118 in the second), and the sample of groups is composed of 46 groups (19 in the first organization, 27 in the second).</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section8-0149206312471385">
<title>Structural holes</title>
<p>All employees were administered a name generator survey in which they were asked to name the persons with whom they regularly exchange information. In this study, I focused on instrumental network relationships. Respondents reported the first and last names of the people with whom they “regularly exchange information about work-related issues several times a week or more.” To capture stable and established relationships, the questionnaire requested that they report current and regular relationships formed at least six months before the administration of the survey. Discussions with management were held to ensure the appropriateness of capturing stable and established relationships with a minimum duration of six months. After collecting all relational data, I constructed two matrixes, one for each organization. Individual structural hole positions were calculated employing the Network Constraint Index (<italic>C Index</italic>) developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206312471385">Burt (1992)</xref>. Network constraint captures the lack of brokerage, and it is a reverse indicator of structural holes. From the constraint indicator, I derived the composition variables of group-level mean and group-level variance, following the logic of both additive and dispersion aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206312471385">Chan, 1998</xref>). Note that while the within-group mean in constraint, calculated as a simple arithmetic average, represents the reverse indicator of within-group mean in structural holes, within-group variance in constraint, calculated through the squared distances over the mean, equals within-group variance in structural holes and is not a reverse indicator.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0149206312471385">
<title>Autonomy</title>
<p>The individual perceptions of autonomy were operationalized through two separate indicators to develop a richer understanding of individual cognitions and capture distinct facets of employees’ perceptions. The first indicator focuses on cognitions about the self and measures the perception of individual autonomy in the job. The variable was measured through the three-item and 5-point Likert-type decision-making autonomy scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206312471385">Morgeson and Humphrey (2006)</xref>. This scale shows adequate reliability properties (Cronbach’s α = .86). I also included a second indicator to capture the individual perception of the autonomy in the group. Individuals may transfer their personal cognitions about autonomy to the group because if individuals in a group constrain each other’s behaviors, the group may no longer be capable of exercising its decision-making discretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0149206312471385">Langfred, 2000</xref>). I used the three-item scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206312471385">Campion, Medsker, and Higgs (1993)</xref> to measure group decision-making autonomy (Cronbach’s α = .89). An exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation confirmed that the items of the two indicators of perceptions of autonomy load in two separate factors.</p>

<sec id="section10-0149206312471385">
<title>Job satisfaction</title>
<p>As I wanted to measure overall job satisfaction, I adopted a single-item measure of satisfaction that directly asks for a general assessment and does not differentiate among multiple facets of satisfaction, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0149206312471385">Scarpello and Campbell (1983)</xref>. Although single-item questions are generally unwarranted, for specific measures of satisfaction they have been heavily employed as they offer robust empirical findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0149206312471385">Wanous, Reichers, &amp; Hudy, 1997</xref>). They also avoid the risk of adverse attitudes toward the questionnaire that repetitious items about satisfaction could generate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0149206312471385">Nagy, 2002</xref>). I used a 5-point Likert-type item: “I am very satisfied to work in my subunit.” Subunit was defined on the same page as the group working under the same immediate supervisor. The item narrows the focus of attention on the group and measures overall job satisfaction to work in the group, although it does not specifically measure satisfaction <italic>with</italic> the group or <italic>with</italic> coworkers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0149206312471385">
<title>Individual performance</title>
<p>Individual performance was measured through supervisory ratings. The immediate supervisor rated the performance of his or her employees. Performance was measured as the comparative evaluation of the employee in relation to the average of his or her colleagues in the organization. Discussions with management were held before administering the questionnaire to confirm the ability of supervisors to assess subordinates in comparison with colleagues in the organization. Supervisors usually participate to the annual review of performance and obtain adequate information so that they are able to assess their own subordinates compared to colleagues in the organization. Responses ranged from 1 (<italic>much below the average</italic>) to 5 (<italic>much above the average</italic>), with 3 as the average. To facilitate the task of comparing the focal employees with their colleagues and capture the appropriate indicators of performance in each company, specific dimensions were used for each organization. For the pharmaceutical company, I employed three general dimensions (effort, quality of work, and quantity of work) used to measure performance in the network study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206312471385">Brass (1981)</xref>. In this organization, performance evaluations were included in the supervisory questionnaire in which supervisors also reported their networks. In the second organization, performance requirements were different and management identified a larger set of core dimensions. Such core dimensions include efficiency, determination, market orientation, creativity, innovation, and collaboration. In this company, management independently collected ratings from supervisors and distributed the results to me. The use of organization-specific dimensions to capture performance allows a more valid measurement of the construct and effective comparison across employees in the same organization. This approach creates a limitation when it comes to aggregating responses from the two organizations. Yet given the comparative nature of performance assessments, the problem of the difference in performance indicators between organizations is mitigated and does not create incongruity in the aggregated analyses.</p>

<sec id="section12-0149206312471385">
<title>Controls</title>
<p>I included a series of demographic variables at the individual level of analysis to better isolate the effect of networks on the studied individual outcomes. First, I included a dummy for the <italic>organization</italic> to control for differences across the two companies. Controlling for the type of organization may be relevant since the sample is composed of dissimilar organizations. The patterns of relationships can vary across diverse types of organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0149206312471385">Shrader, Lincoln, &amp; Hoffman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0149206312471385">Tichy &amp; Fombrun, 1979</xref>), as well as the degree of autonomy perceived by individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206312471385">Miles, Snow, Meyer, &amp; Coleman, 1978</xref>). Furthermore, controlling for the organization becomes fundamental given that performance indicators in the two organizations are different. I controlled for <italic>gender</italic> (<italic>male</italic> = 1, <italic>female</italic> = 2) because individual networks may vary substantially in men and in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206312471385">Ibarra, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206312471385">1993</xref>) and to account for possible gender effects on cognition, satisfaction, and performance. I also controlled for <italic>age</italic>, assuming that young individuals may be more dynamic in networking, or have more enthusiasm and satisfaction with their job, although they may not leverage previous work experience for performance.

Controlling for tenure could be relevant as it may relate to performance behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0149206312471385">Ng &amp; Feldman, 2010</xref>) or to satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206312471385">Lee &amp; Wilbur, 1985</xref>). Networking could also be a function of accumulated experience in the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206312471385">Nebus, 2006</xref>).

<title>Analysis and Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0149206312471385">Table 1</xref> shows means, standard errors, and correlations among the variables considered in this study. The lower diagonal reports the correlations with variables at the individual level of analysis, while the higher diagonal reports the correlations aggregating the variables at the group level of analysis. From the correlations with the organizational dummy, it is possible to observe the differences across organizations. The video game organization has considerably younger individuals, with lower tenure in the organization and mostly male employees. Comparatively, the pharmaceutical organization has older individuals, with considerably higher tenure in the organization and a more balanced representation of the genders. As expected, group-level mean and group-level variance in structural holes exhibit a significant correlation, testifying to the importance of capturing their simultaneous and unique effect on individual outcomes.</p>

<p>Given the nested nature of the data set for this article and the cross-level nature of the hypotheses explored, I performed a series of hierarchical linear model (HLM) regressions. The analysis of the eta-squared provides evidence of a considerable portion of individual variance attributed to group difference: 29% for structural holes, 21% for individual autonomy, 26% for group autonomy, 30% for job satisfaction, and 30% for performance. I performed a set of HLM regressions to test the hypotheses. Results of the HLM regressions are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0149206312471385">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0149206312471385">3</xref>. For each dependent variable, as a first step, I developed random coefficient models at Level 1, including the control variables at the individual level. The individual-level variables were grand-mean centered to decrease possible problems of collinearity between levels of analysis and to better assess the incremental effects of the group-level variables above and beyond the effect of the individual-level variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206312471385">Hofmann &amp; Gavin, 1998</xref>). In the second step, I developed intercept-as-outcomes models at Level 2, including the two variables of structural holes at the group level as fixed effects and calculating the intercepts of the Level 2 variables.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0149206312471385">Table 2</xref> shows the results of the HLM regressions with the individual perceptions of autonomy as dependent variables. With regard to the perception of autonomy for the individual, the results show that no control variable at the individual level exercises a significant explanatory value. At the group level of analysis, the mean in structural holes is negatively and significantly related to autonomy (network constraint γ = 1.34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), while variance in structural holes does not exercise any predictive value. When taking into consideration the perception of autonomy for the group, both group mean in structural holes (network constraint γ = 1.09, <italic>p</italic> = .01) and group variance in structural holes (network constraint γ = −2.29, <italic>p</italic> = .03) exercise a significant and deleterious effect on the individual perception of group autonomy. Note that, as specified in the section on methodology, the group mean in network constraint represents a reverse indicator of structural holes, while group variance in network constraint does not. From the results it is possible to find empirical support for both Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2, although support for the first hypothesis is stronger.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0149206312471385">Table 3</xref> reports the HLM regressions taking into account the final outcomes of job satisfaction and performance. It is interesting to see that structural holes at the individual level show a significant and positive relationship with satisfaction (constraint γ = −0.58, <italic>p</italic> = .02). To shed more light on the individual effect of structural holes, I also ran the HLM regressions group-centering individual structural holes. Results confirm the same level of significance and provide evidence that within the group it is beneficial for an individual to span structural holes. Comparatively, at the group level of analysis, structural holes exercise a deleterious effect on job satisfaction. More specifically, the group mean of structural holes is negatively and significantly related to job satisfaction (constraint γ = 1.02, <italic>p</italic> = .04). Group-level variance in structural holes shows a negative coefficient, although the relationship does not reach a significant level. Hypothesis 3 is supported, while Hypothesis 4 is not supported. When it comes to performance, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0149206312471385">Table 3</xref> shows a strong predictive value of group-level mean in structural holes (constraint γ = 1.07, <italic>p</italic> = .003), while there is no significant value associated with group-level variance. It is interesting to notice that, even in this case, structural holes at the individual level show a positive and marginally significant relationship with performance (constraint γ = −0.30, <italic>p</italic> = .06). Even in this case, I performed a series of HLM regressions, group centering the individual-level predictors and replicating the results obtained with the variables centered on the grand mean. Hypothesis 5 is supported, while Hypothesis 6 is not supported.</p>
<p>Unlike ordinary least squares regressions, HLMs do not compute any <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> statistics because of the problems associated with the interdependence of explanatory variables among the different levels of analysis and the ensuing difficulty in isolating the unique contribution of each single predictor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0149206312471385">Snijders &amp; Bosker, 1994</xref>). Nevertheless, authors have proposed different effect size measures that, although they cannot be interpreted as an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> statistics in multiple regressions, offer aggregate information useful in assessing improvements in a model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0149206312471385">Snijders &amp; Bosker, 1999</xref>). In this article, I used the formula developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0149206312471385">Snijders and Bosker (1999)</xref>. This formula builds on the same premises of the formula developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0149206312471385">Raudenbush and Bryk (2002)</xref> and computes the proportional decrease in the residual and intercept variance components once the hypothesized predictors are included in the HLM model. Applying the formula, we can see that the group-level variables of structural holes explain 5% of the total variance in the perception of individual autonomy, 3% of the variance in the perception of group autonomy, 2% of the variance in the perception of satisfaction, and 4% of the variance in individual performance.</p>
<p>To corroborate the results and provide further evidence of their solidity, I performed a further set of HLM regressions using only variables at the individual level of analysis. From the network data set, I constructed an individual network measure capturing the average degree of structural holes in group coworkers, excluding the focal individual. In other words, I eliminated the effect of the focal individual in the measure of the group structural holes to isolate the effect of other group members on individual outcomes. I could then study the effect of <italic>group coworkers’</italic> structural holes on the individual. This variable does not provide the same information as the group-level variables in structural holes because it does not capture the group-level dynamics and group climate also dependent on the structural holes of the focal individual. Nevertheless, this measure provides complementary information that aides in examining the effect of being in a group in which the other group members have high or low structural holes, regardless of whether the focal individual is a broker or not. Individual demographic controls, individual structural holes, and the individual measure of coworkers’ structural holes were included in random-intercept multilevel models without accounting for the group-level network characteristics. The results of the HLM models show that group coworkers’ structural holes significantly predict perception of individual autonomy (constraint γ = 0.85, <italic>p</italic> = .001), perceptions of group autonomy (constraint γ = 0.51, <italic>p</italic> = .06), satisfaction (constraint γ = 0.62, <italic>p</italic> = .04), and performance (constraint γ = 0.67, <italic>p</italic> = .003). Results are slightly weaker as they do not entirely capture the group-level explanatory mechanisms specified in the theory, but they substantially replicate evidence on the dark side of structural holes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present investigation elaborated a multilevel network theory and highlighted the importance of studying group composition of individual structural holes, showing its predictive validity on relevant individual outcomes. A theory of the multilevel “dark side” of structural holes was developed, showing how group mean and group variance in structural hole positions trigger deleterious consequences at the individual level. Groups composed of brokers, who display competitive, calculative, and power-oriented behaviors, are characterized by tensions that negatively affect individual perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors. Groups with both types of members, those who bridge structural holes and those embedded in a closed network, display incompatible behaviors and attitudes at work, resulting in deleterious consequences at the individual level. The present theory provides preliminary evidence that suggests the possibility of divergent causal dynamics across levels of analysis. Within a group it may be beneficial for an individual to span structural holes, according to the arguments developed by previous scholars and according to the evidence shown in this study. However, as suggested in the theory proposed, negative consequences could manifest both in groups with individuals who span structural holes and in groups with heterogeneous composition of structural holes. An illustrative display of these aggregate logics is portrayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0149206312471385">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Previous scholars endorsed the idea that structural hole positions at the individual level are beneficial to individual outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206312471385">Burt, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206312471385">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0149206312471385">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206312471385">2007</xref>). However, as we can see from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0149206312471385">Figure 2</xref>, due to the influence of group effects, without controlling for group affiliation the data structure would show a negative effect of individual structural holes on individual outcomes. So how does the theory supported in this article combine with previous research that shows positive effects without controlling for the group level? First, although the dominant position of previous research endorses the benefits of structural holes, there is still empirical controversy in previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206312471385">Fleming et al., 2007</xref>). There may be different types of brokerage and, for instance, the effect of structural holes may vary if a broker spans separate individuals or separate cliques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0149206312471385">Krackhardt, 1999</xref>). Second, in all empirical cases in which employees are not clustered in work groups, act fairly independently, or belong to groups whose dynamics are relatively unimportant to task execution, the incidence of group climate and functioning would be mitigated and structural holes would positively affect outcomes. The positive effects of structural holes were found for independent bankers closing deals with corporate clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206312471385">Mizruchi &amp; Stearns, 2001</xref>) or investments bankers, financial analysts, and supply chain managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206312471385">Burt, 2007</xref>) who may be nested in temporary teams but often have individual objectives and deal independently with clients. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0149206312471385">Xiao and Tsui (2007)</xref> argued that the benefits of structural holes are manifested in individualistic cultures but found that they have negative effects in contexts in which working in groups is considered important. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206312471385">Burt, Hogarth, and Michaud (2000)</xref> found that structural holes are generally beneficial in contexts that welcome individual competition, but in contexts where peer pressure is relevant, brokering can generate negative emotional states. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0149206312471385">Podolny and Baron (1997)</xref> argued that structural holes can be advantageous in traditional bureaucratic organizations but not in contexts where groups have social identities. Third, in all cases in which there are no significant between-unit variations in groups, there would be no group effects and it would be reasonable to expect that individual structural holes positively affect outcomes. These observations suggest that that the evidence collected in this article is compatible with previous findings and complements them rather than challenges them.</p>
<p>The findings of this article question the idea of the informational advantage of groups with members who span structural holes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0149206312471385">Hansen (1999)</xref> already challenged the informational advantage of sparse networks in groups, stating that higher access to information may be related to a lower capacity for sharing and using the information internally. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206312471385">Burt’s (1992)</xref> informational advantage of structural holes, we could assume that members who span structural holes in the same group may have access to diverse information and share with the other team members their own unique information, accumulating a larger pool of knowledge that could eventually lead to superior group outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206312471385">Oh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0149206312471385">Reagans &amp; Zuckerman, 2001</xref>). However, this argument is built on the assumption that brokers are disposed to share their unique information with the other team members of the group and will collaborate with each other to pursue group rather than personal outcomes. Collaborative behaviors characterize individuals embedded in closed networks, but not brokers, who do not pursue group outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206312471385">Adler &amp; Kwon, 2002</xref>). Brokers keep their contacts separate not because they want to efficiently share with others their unique information and collaborate in joint group efforts, but because they can attain or maintain personal supremacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0149206312471385">Krackhardt, 1999</xref>). A group with brokers may have potential access to more information, but this information will not be shared, creating group tensions instead of better solutions.</p>
<p>Besides answering the call by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206312471385">Brass et al. (2004)</xref> and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206312471385">Moliterno and Mahony (2011)</xref> to devote more empirical attention to the exploration of multilevel network relationships, this study also answers the call by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206312471385">Kilduff and Tsai (2003)</xref> to devote more attention to the dark aspects of social networks, as most previous studies were concerned with legitimizing the benefits of relationships. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206312471385">Brass et al. (1998)</xref> developed a theory of networks and unethical behaviors: Although they did not argue that networks directly affect unethical behaviors, they stated that networks interact with individuals and contextual factors in the prediction of unethical behaviors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0149206312471385">Sparrowe et al. (2001)</xref> posit that network relationships may not only facilitate but also hinder behaviors of individuals through social expectations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206312471385">Bizzi and Langley (2012)</xref> highlight how a process perspective on the study of networks can help show how relationships exercise constraining forces rather than triggering solely benefits. This article identifies a few deleterious mechanisms related to social relationships that can inform future research on the outcomes of networks and their ambivalent effects.</p>
<p>This study also contributes to research on group composition. Previous authors have devoted substantial effort to understanding whether the group composition of individual characteristics is beneficial or deleterious to the attainment of individual or aggregate outcomes but have obtained conflicting empirical results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206312471385">Boone, Olffen, &amp; Witteloostuijn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206312471385">Campion et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206312471385">Jehn, Northcraft, &amp; Neale, 1999</xref>). Such investigations often lacked depth, focused on simple demographic attributes such as age, gender, or ethnicity, and neglected to tap into deeper sources of homogeneity or heterogeneity that could have strong explanatory value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206312471385">Harrison et al., 2002</xref>). This article expands research by proposing networks as a major factor to consider when studying team composition. Note that findings are also directly relevant to practitioners. Team composition is a factor that management controls directly, and network analyses are becoming popular among practitioners and consultants to detect and correct functional problems within an organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206312471385">Cross &amp; Parker, 2004</xref>). Companies can conduct a study on social networks and identify, through the explanations provided, a reason for the ineffectiveness of individuals in groups. Management can then directly intervene by recomposing the groups, reallocating responsibilities, redesigning tasks, or directly attempting to influence the structure of relationships among individuals in the same group.</p>
<p>The results of this article are qualified by some limitations. First of all, the sample size at the group level of analysis is relatively small, and the number of individuals in each single group is not high. However, this limitation is not uncommon in multilevel network research since it is difficult to simultaneously obtain a high sample of individuals nested in groups and a high response rate. Another limitation is related to the performance indicators, which were adapted to both organizations. Yet the adaptation of performance instruments allows the advantage of better measurement validity, while problems are mitigated by the relative comparison among employees. It is also important to specify that the theory developed may not effectively describe dynamics in all work groups. Specific types of groups, such as temporary project teams and cross-functional teams, may not particularly need internal collaboration and joint effort to perform the tasks assigned, making the group functioning and climate less relevant, and making the predictions of this theory less applicable.</p>
<p>To conclude, the present article developed a multilevel theory of social networks revealing a dark side of structural holes. More specifically, it was argued that that while individual-level structural holes may be beneficial to individuals, group-level mean and group-level variance in structural holes exercise deleterious effects on individual outcomes. It was theorized that team members having high structural holes and team members having heterogeneous degrees of structural holes would perceive lower autonomy, be less satisfied, and perform less effectively. Findings provided suggestive evidence for the different dynamics that characterize structural holes at the individual level and at the group level. The evidence collected in this article asks us to revise some of our assumptions about the role of bridging unconnected others, hopefully fueling new investigations in the field of network research.</p>
