<p>Migration has moved from the periphery of sociological concern to its center, less an optional aspect of social experience to a fundamental dimension of accelerating globalization as well as social and technological change itself. Keith Jacobs’ book, <italic>Experience and Representation</italic>, is focused on the way in which migration has been experienced and responded to in Australia, but it should be approached as an account with relevance to the understanding of migration in any national setting, providing a way of thinking about the migrant experience with analytical implications that are not confined to the Australian story. The book’s concern is to assemble the most recent developments in understanding the sociology of migration, organized around core concepts like identity, mobility, memory, globalization and transnationalism. It examines what is characteristic of the contemporary migrant experience shaped by all the processes constituting globalization, with both increased population movements around the world and a greater capacity for cultural groups to remain in communication with each other.</p>
<p>Its particular focus is on the subjective, psychological, and emotional dimensions of migration, examining how concepts of home, attachment (to place, family, and social networks), borders, mobility can be more extensively utilized to come to grips with how migration is encountered in a variety of constantly changing ways. The book is unambiguously an exercise in sociology, but of the richest interdisciplinary kind, because Jacobs draws on a broad range of social science perspectives, reaching across to anthropology and human geography, and especially to psychoanalysis. Psychoanalytic thought is approached not so much as a closed body of theory, and more as a way of sensitizing us to emotions, feelings of loss, fear, attachment, and mechanisms of identification and disindentification.</p>
<p>There is an enormous amount of sociological intelligence in literature and cinema, and a central strength of the book is the way in which Jacobs suggestively reflects on how the experience of migration is portrayed in those cultural arenas. Two of the book’s chapters look at the way in which a selection of novels and films outlines key elements of the cultural expression of migrant as opposed to non-migrant identities. These include forced migration after the experience of war, women moving from South-East Asia with husbands and children, post-World War II moves from Western and Central Europe to urban and rural Australia, often destined for quite harsh living and labor conditions, the problem of return and the splitting of the conception of “home.” Also important are the experiences of refugees and asylum-seekers, and how local communities respond to the changes brought about by new waves of newcomers, as well as the introduction of new forms of cultural difference, and what they mean for their understanding of place and home.</p>
<p>Other chapters outline the most important dimensions of the politics of Australian migration, outlining Australian multiculturalism and its link to basic demographic shifts, its character as the product of lobbying of particular ethnic groups, as well as discussing the critiques of multiculturalism, significant but without ever having reached the levels of intensity seen in Europe or the United States. The media portrayal of migrants is crucial to the politics, and Jacobs outlines the ways in which the newspaper and television framing of issues regarding migration, multiculturalism, refugees, and asylum-seekers constitute an assemblage of various forms of social anxiety concerning crime, cultural change, the “outside,” terrorism, the challenge of Islam, refugees and “the boats.” For Australia, there has long been an more-or-less clearly articulated anxiety among the Anglo-Celtic population about the “hordes” of populous Asian countries, envious of all that space, sliding, drifting, sailing, or flying down the globe to fill up the Australian continent to the same degree of population density as their homelands. The media treatment of migration is thus an important terrain across which a variety of anxieties and fears are played out and played upon. Jacobs explains usefully how the question of national identity is caught between Britishness (split between English and Irish, a subtle but important local distinction), some kind of distinctive Australian character (drawing a lot on the Irish), and the considerable variety of post-war cultural inputs. The most recent of these are unsettled and complicated even more by transnationalism, the “spreading” of the sources of identity and self-formation across the globe.</p>
<p>It is hard to know if this constitutes a reservation, but the book is organized around providing a review of all the important recent literature with any bearing on the topic at hand. This is both a strength, in that it is a useful route to a quick mastery of the book’s concerns for the non-specialist; but for some readers it may be a weakness, in that the author’s own voice has some trouble asserting itself. But there are a number of significant initiatives being taken here, particularly to include a discussion of psychoanalytic perspectives, as part of a concern with the subjective dimensions of migration, and taking seriously the content of non-academic, cultural spheres such as literature and film, so that overall the book is an important contribution to the field.</p>
