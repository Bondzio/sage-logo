<title>Background:</title>
<p>Acute avulsion fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal are common and are treated in a variety of ways. The aims of this study were to compare pain, functional outcome, and time taken off work after treatment with a walking boot or a short-leg cast.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100712460197">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Of 39 patients with acute avulsion fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal, 23 were treated with a short-leg cast and 16 with a walking boot, according to the preference of the consultant present at outpatient clinic. Functional outcome was assessed by the Visual Analogue Scale Foot and Ankle Questionnaire (VAS FA), pain, and other complaints on presentation and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks after injury. The VAS FA scores were compared between the 2 groups by a paired Student <italic>t</italic> test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100712460197">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The mean time to return to the level of pain and function before injury was approximately 9 weeks after treatment in the walking boot group and 12 weeks with a short-leg cast. Patients with walking boots reported less pain between 3 and 12 weeks than did those with short-leg casts after 6 (<italic>P</italic> = .06), 9 (<italic>P</italic> = .020), and 12 weeks (<italic>P</italic> = .33). Function was significantly better with Aircast walking boots after 3 (<italic>P</italic> = .006), 6 (<italic>P</italic> = .002), and 9 weeks (<italic>P</italic> = .002) but not after 12 weeks (<italic>P</italic> = .09). Patients returned to their preinjury level of driving after 6 weeks with walking boots and 12 weeks with short-leg casts (<italic>P</italic> = .006). Employed patients took a mean of 35.8 days off work (range, 28-42 days), fewer with boots (31.5 days) than with short-leg casts (39.2 days).</p>

<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The walking boot was better treatment than a short-leg cast for avulsion fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal. Patients had an improved combined level of pain and function 3 weeks earlier, at 9 weeks post injury, when managed in a walking boot.</p>

<body>
<p>Avulsion fracture of the base of the fifth metatarsal is common and is usually treated conservatively. An avulsion fracture is a zone 1 fracture defined as involving a variably sized portion of the tuberosity or styloid process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712460197">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460197">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712460197">13</xref></sup> Conservative management of avulsion fractures is by protected weightbearing. Two methods of protected weight-bearing are a short-leg cast and a walking boot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712460197">3</xref></sup> There has been no comparison of the outcome of treatment of the avulsion fracture of the base of the fifth metatarsal with a walking boot or short-leg cast. The primary aim of the study was to compare pain and functional outcome following such fractures treated in a walking boot or short-leg cast. The secondary aim was to establish time lost from work and the cost of the 2 treatments.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>Between May 6 and December 22, 2010, 43 patients with an avulsion fracture of the fifth metatarsal who attended the fracture clinic of a district general hospital were treated with either a short walking boot (DJO Aircast Walker, Vista, CA) or a short-leg cast, according to consultant preference, and weightbearing with crutches for 5 weeks. Seven consultants were independently involved in determining their preferred type of immobilization (short-leg cast or walking boot) for the patients attending their clinic. Four patients declined to complete the questionnaire. Of the 43 patients who met the study criteria, 39 (13 males, 26 females) provided written consent. Twenty-three patients received a short-leg cast and 16 a walking boot for 5 weeks. The patients’ ages ranged from 18 to 81 years (median 56) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712460197">Table 1</xref>). The boot was removable, and patients were advised they could remove it at night for comfort only. The short-leg cast comprised an underlying cotton stockinette, padding, and 3 layers of polyester casting tape. Both extended approximately halfway up the leg.</p>

<title>Outcome Measures</title>
<p>At the initial clinic visit and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks, the Visual Analogue Scale Foot and Ankle Questionnaire (VAS FA) was administered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712460197">Figure 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460197">6</xref></sup> We used the VAS FA because we believed that it was the best validated scale of the available foot and ankle outcome measures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460197">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460197">11</xref></sup> The primary outcome measure was time taken to reach preinjury level of pain and function for the 2 methods of immobilization. Secondary outcome measures included time taken off work, cost of the boot or casting material, and ability to drive a vehicle.</p>

<p>The Visual Analogue Scale Foot and Ankle Questionnaire (VAS FA) used to assess pain, functional outcome, and other complaints.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460197">9</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>The VAS FA is based on 20 questions and requires subjective answers that can be subdivided into 3 distinct categories. It is designed to add more weighting toward function than pain or other complaints. There are 11 questions on function, 4 on pain, and 5 on other complaints.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460197">9</xref></sup> Each VAS was measured to give a score out of 100 for each question and a combined maximum score of 2000. To assess the time taken for a return to preinjury function or pain, a mean score greater than 90 out of 100 was interpreted as a return to preinjury level. “Other complaints” data recorded in the VAS FA include gait, perception of unilateral leg weakness, presence of callosity, problems finding appropriate footwear, and sensory disturbance in the foot.</p>

By 12 weeks there was no significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = .09). The VAS FA was significantly less in patients for reaching preinjury level of pain wearing the walking boot after 9 weeks (<italic>P</italic> = .02). At 3, 6, and 12 weeks, there was no significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = .11, .06, and .33, respectively). Time taken to achieve preinjury level of pain and function was 9 weeks using the walking boot and 12 weeks with the short-leg cast.

<p>Radiographs were taken only on initial presentation to the clinic and in those patients with a great deal of pain clinically at the fracture site at the 6-week stage. Eight patients from the short-leg cast group and 5 patients from the boot group had radiographs at 6 weeks, all of which showed presence of callus but not union. Fracture union was defined radiographically by bridging bone on at least 3 of 4 cortices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712460197">3</xref></sup> Further radiographs in the patients were not indicated, as all had clinically united by 12 weeks.</p>
<p>Eighteen patients were employed and missed a mean of 35.8 days (range, 28-42 days) from work. Patients with the boot missed 31.5 days and those with the short-leg cast missed 39.2 (<italic>P</italic> = .002). Four patients who were self-employed missed work for a mean of only 28 days and explained that they returned to work early for financial reasons. They described pain on walking but were sufficiently mobile to work. One patient returned to work after 28 days due to pressure from the workplace. The remaining patients all felt that they returned to work at a satisfactory time and all took at least 35 days off.

<p>There is paucity of literature regarding avulsion fractures of the fifth metatarsal base. Only 3 prospective studies have examined pain and functional outcome following such avulsion fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712460197">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460197">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712460197">12</xref></sup> Two were comparative studies that compared functional outcome after plaster slipper and Tubigrip support<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460197">5</xref></sup> and short-leg cast and soft Jones dressing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712460197">12</xref></sup>; the third investigated functional outcome with a hard-soled shoe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712460197">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other studies have combined avulsion with Jones fractures and other variants of fractures of the proximal fifth metatarsal and universally report clinical union of fractures of the fifth metatarsal base.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712460197">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460197">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460197">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460197">11</xref></sup> There has been no previous comparison study investigating pain and functional outcome following treatment with a short-leg cast and a walking boot, and this is the first study to use a validated foot specific outcome measure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460197">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study demonstrated that pain and function recovered earlier in patients treated with a walking boot than in those with a short-leg cast. The literature suggests that less rigid immobilization leads to better pain and functional outcome. Our study showed that all patients achieved clinical union by 12 weeks, which is supported by the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460197">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712460197">12</xref></sup> Gray et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460197">5</xref></sup> found that patients had better improvement of both pain and function after 2 weeks with a plaster slipper than with Tubigrip support. Wiener et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712460197">12</xref></sup> reported that patients returned to preinjury activity by 33 days with a soft Jones dressing compared with 43 days for patients who had a short-leg cast. However, Egol et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712460197">3</xref></sup> reported that clinical union was achieved in only 20% of their patients by 12 weeks when treated with a hard-soled shoe. This suggests that a less rigid form of immobilization than a short-leg cast gives better early results following such fractures. The walking boot group took their boot off at night, allowing ankle movement, similar to movement achievable in a Jones dressing, which may have improved early functional outcome. Analysis of the fracture registry by Clapper et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712460197">1</xref></sup> showed that all 68 avulsion fractures in military personnel healed uneventfully in an average of 4.7 weeks with no difference between results with a hard-soled shoe or a cast.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712460197">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712460197">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present study found that fractures of the fifth metatarsal base are a source of lost work productivity. Egol et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712460197">3</xref></sup> reported on 52 similar patients treated with a hard-soled shoe who lost an average of 22 days from work; 47% took up to 10 days off and 37% more than 10 days. Gosele et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712460197">4</xref></sup> reported on a series of 52 patients with such fractures treated with an orthopedic shoe and found an average of 19 days taken off work. The present data show that a mean of 35.8 days were missed from work, and this number was lower with walking boots (31.5 days) than with short-leg casts (39.2 days). Perhaps it is because a short-leg cast prevents ankle movement, and thus, additional rehabilitation time is required to overcome stiffness. Although Egol et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712460197">3</xref></sup> reported fewer mean days lost from work with a hard-soled shoe than was found in our treatment groups, only 20.4% of their patients returned to preinjury functional status by 3 months. This suggests either that the patients returned to work early, involving an increased level of weightbearing activity, or that a hard-soled shoe did not provide adequate treatment. The occupations of patients in both of our treatment groups were similar in terms of the level of weightbearing activity required during the working day. In this study, 5 of the 18 patients who returned to work after 28 days for financial reasons and workplace pressure did not feel ready to return to work, because of continuing pain. Thirteen patients felt well enough to go to work from at least 35 days post injury.</p>
<p>Cost of treatment is a very important consideration given the continued increased pressure by health care organizations to reduce spending. The walking boot (DJO Aircast Walker) cost was estimated at £62 each and should cover the duration of treatment. The total cost of materials to apply a single short-leg cast was estimated at £9, and all patients required at least 1 further cast change. A plaster slipper was estimated to cost £7.50 and a Tubigrip support bandage to cost £1.50. Although treatment is much more expensive with a walking boot, patients in this study recovered 3 weeks earlier and returned to work 8 days earlier than after cast immobilization. State benefits as an Employment Support Allowance to individuals who cannot be paid following absence from work because of injury are approximately £67.50 per week for single males over 25 years old with no dependents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712460197">2</xref></sup> This suggests that the boot is cost-effective. Konkel et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712460197">7</xref></sup> pointed out that closed treatments give predictable bone healing with minimal cost and a high satisfaction, but medical fees, radiographs, and orthopedic equipment in North America range from $692.50 to $2820.50, with an average total fracture care medical cost of $1414.09.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712460197">7</xref></sup> A walking boot is not reusable in the United Kingdom; were that permitted, their cost would decrease.</p>
<p>There is no formal guidance from the literature regarding when patients should return to driving following metatarsal base avulsion fractures. This study found that walking boots allow patients to return to their preinjury level of driving after 6 weeks compared with 12 weeks with a short-leg cast.</p>
<p>Orr et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712460197">8</xref></sup> reported that the total brake-response time for people wearing a controlled-ankle motion boot or a short-leg cast was greatly increased or worsened in comparison to wearing normal footwear, suggesting that it is unsafe to drive with any of these devices.</p>
<p>The strengths of our study lie in its prospective and standardized nature with regard to treatment and follow-up questionnaires scheduled at regular time intervals. The use of the VAS FA was subjective and did not require clinical examination, and it was completed independently by each patient without any external influence. Limitations of our study are that the design would have been better as a randomized controlled trial; it evaluated only 2 treatment modalities and administered the VAS FA at 3-week intervals for a total of 12 weeks post injury, when recovery tended to be maximal in the first 6 weeks. We also did not have radiographic evaluation beyond 6 weeks, so we cannot comment on the incidence of true nonunion.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Avulsion fractures of the fifth metatarsal base treated conservatively require support during healing beyond that provided by a Tubigrip but not as rigid as with a short-leg cast. The walking boot was more expensive but was effective, providing earlier recovery and return to work.</p>
