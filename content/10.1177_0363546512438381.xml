<abstract>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: Cam impingement is a well-recognized cause of hip pain and might cause osteoarthritis of the hip. Clinically, cam impingement is mostly observed in young, active male patients, but only a few studies have focused on the manifestation of cam-type deformities during skeletal development.</p>
<p><bold>Purpose</bold>: To determine the age of onset and prevalence of cam-type deformities in young male soccer players versus controls.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design</bold>: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: In this study, 89 elite preprofessional soccer players and 92 controls aged 12 to 19 years were included. In the soccer players, range of motion and impingement tests were performed. Both an anteroposterior (AP) pelvic radiograph and a frog-leg lateral radiograph of the hip were obtained according to a standardized protocol. Controls with both an AP pelvic and a frog-leg lateral radiograph and no hip disorders were obtained from radiology databases. The α angle was automatically determined in all radiographs, using a threshold value of 60° to define a cam-type deformity. Further, all radiographs were scored using a 3-point scoring system. The anterosuperior head-neck junction was classified as (1) normal, (2) flattened, or (3) having a prominence. Differences in prevalence were tested using logistic regression. Differences in range of motion were calculated using generalized estimating equations.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: An α angle &gt;60° was already found at the age of 12 years in some soccer players and controls. A cam-type deformity defined by α angle tended to be more prevalent in soccer players (26%) than in controls (17%; <italic>P</italic> = .31). In 13% of soccer players, a prominence was visible on radiographs and was first seen at the age of 13 years. The anterosuperior flattening (56% vs 18%, <italic>P</italic> = .0001) and prominence (13% vs 0%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .03) were more prevalent in soccer players than in controls.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Cam-type deformities were recognizable and present from the age of 13 years and were more prevalent in soccer players than in their nonathletic peers. Cam-type deformity develops during adolescence and is likely to be influenced by high-impact sports practice.</p>

<body>
<p>Some sporting activities have been associated with a higher incidence of hip osteoarthritis (OA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512438381">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546512438381">45</xref></sup> This applies for soccer, especially in elite soccer players.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512438381">27</xref></sup> A possible explanation for the higher risk for hip OA in elite soccer players is the existence of shape deformities of the femoral head.</p>
<p>From the 1960s until the 1980s, it was suggested that many cases of “primary” or “idiopathic” hip OA are actually secondary to shape deformities and thus do not have a systemic origin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512438381">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512438381">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546512438381">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546512438381">41</xref></sup> From the 1990s, research has indicated that subsets of hip OA are indeed secondary to minor, previously unrecognized, or subclinical shape deformities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512438381">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512438381">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512438381">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512438381">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512438381">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546512438381">44</xref></sup> The path from these minor shape deformities to OA might follow the mechanism of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) proposed by Ganz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512438381">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Femoroacetabular impingement is an abnormal contact between the femoral neck and the acetabulum. There are 2 classic types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512438381">13</xref></sup> The first one, pincer impingement, is an overcoverage of the femoral head by the acetabulum and is mostly seen in middle-aged women. The second one, the subject of this article, is cam impingement, mostly seen in young, active male patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512438381">12</xref></sup> It is caused by an abnormal shape of the proximal femur: a nonspherical head that is caused by a flattening or prominence on the anterosuperior part of the femoral head-neck junction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512438381">21</xref></sup> As a result of this anatomic anomaly, the head-neck offset is smaller and squeezed in the acetabulum. It has been suggested that this causes repetitive minor trauma to the anterior acetabular margins, thus causing labral tears and cartilage damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512438381">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512438381">31</xref></sup> These injuries may eventually lead to hip OA.</p>
<p>Although the exact cause of a cam-type deformity is not well understood, suggested causes are bone remodeling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512438381">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512438381">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512438381">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0363546512438381">46</xref></sup> a growth abnormality of the epiphysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546512438381">38</xref></sup> or subclinical slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512438381">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512438381">14</xref></sup> The general hypothesis based on research on young, active adult men is that the deformity develops during adolescence after a long period of excessive sports practice during growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512438381">30</xref></sup> Recently, Siebenrock et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546512438381">37</xref></sup> showed that young basketball players are at higher risk for having a cam-type deformity, which developed especially around the time of physeal closure. Thus, high-impact sports, such as basketball, ice hockey, and soccer, might predispose to developing a cam-type deformity because of the high shear stress applied to the femoral head.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512438381">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>For this study, we investigated at what age a cam-type deformity develops and tested the hypothesis that cam-type deformities are more prevalent in adolescent preprofessional elite soccer players than in their nonathletic peers.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0363546512438381">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>We included boys (12-19 years) who played in selection teams of the Feyenoord soccer club in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. They follow a particular school program to train at the optimal intensity. An information letter was sent to 141 boys who met the inclusion criteria; 101 boys gave informed consent, of whom 89 finally joined this study, while 12 boys did not come for clinical and radiological evaluations. Exclusion criteria for soccer players were any hip disorder. The study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Erasmus Medical Center (Rotterdam, the Netherlands).</p>
<p>All soccer players had anteroposterior (AP) pelvic and frog-leg lateral hip (commonly known as the Lauenstein view) radiographs and a clinical investigation. For controls, boys aged 12 to 19 years in whom both an AP and a frog-leg lateral radiograph of both hips were available were selected from the radiology databases of Erasmus Medical Center and Reinier de Graaf Groep Hospital. The exclusion criteria were any hip disorder as diagnosed clinically by a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon or radiographically by a musculoskeletal radiologist. Further, 19 participants were excluded because sports practice was reported by the orthopaedic surgeon in their medical records. Participants were not excluded when a cam-type deformity without any other hip disease was diagnosed (n = 2). The selected controls had radiographs of both hips in the diagnostic course of complaints of the hip (84%), knee (4%), back (5%), or other (7%). None of the controls visited the hospital again because of their complaints within a minimum of 2 years after the radiographs were obtained. There were 92 participants in the control group.</p>
<p>The soccer players were clinically examined to measure the range of motion (ROM) of the hip, and an anterior impingement test was performed. The ROM was measured by a goniometer in flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, internal rotation, and external rotation of the hip. A positive impingement test result was defined as a sharp pain in 90° of flexion with adduction and internal rotation. The boys were asked to complete a questionnaire including items related to groin pain, medical history, and demographic data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512438381">
<title>Radiology</title>
<p>Most cam-type deformities are located anterosuperior in the femoral head-neck junction. To detect a cam-type deformity in this region, an AP view as well as a lateral view of the hip is needed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546512438381">43</xref></sup> Both radiographs were obtained, namely an AP pelvic view and a frog-leg lateral view.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512438381">7</xref></sup> The radiographs were made according to a standardized protocol.</p>
<p>For the AP radiograph, the participant was positioned supine with his feet in a frame to ensure 15° of internal rotation. This provides the best view of the head-neck junction. The tube to film distance was 130 cm, and the beam was centered 5 cm above the pubic symphysis.</p>
<p>The frog-leg lateral radiograph was performed with the patient in a supine position with the leg of interest abducted using a 45° wedge under the knees. The heel rested against the medial aspect of the contralateral knee to position the leg in 90° of external rotation. The tube-to-film distance was 115 cm, and the beam was centered in the middle of the groin on the femoral head. Gonadal shields were worn to reduce the radiation load.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512438381">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>We used the α angle as a quantitative outcome measure and a visual scoring system as a semiquantitative outcome measure for a cam-type deformity. The shape of the proximal femur in the AP and frog-leg lateral radiographs was assessed using statistical shape modeling (SSM) software (ASM tool kit, Manchester University, Manchester, United Kingdom). The shape is defined by a set of landmark points that are positioned along the contour of the bone in the image. Each point is always placed on the same landmark of the contour to allow comparison between the shapes. All radiographs of the left hip were mirrored to appear as right hips to be able to use the same set of landmarks.</p>
<p>The α angle was automatically calculated in all radiographs from the point sets of the SSM software using Matlab (version 7.1.0, MathWorks Inc, Natick, Massachusetts) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512438381">Figure 1</xref>). The α angle is measured by first drawing the best fitting circle around the femoral head and then a line through the center of the neck and the center of the head. From the center of the head, a second line is drawn to the point where the superior surface of the head-neck junction first departs from the circle. The angle between these 2 lines is the α angle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546512438381">32</xref></sup> We defined the presence of a cam-type deformity as an α angle &gt;60°, as osseous abnormalities below this threshold value have been suggested to pose less of a risk for developing hip pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512438381">2</xref></sup> In addition, radiographs were scored semiquantitatively by an experienced orthopaedic surgeon and a musculoskeletal radiologist based on consensus, using a 3-point scoring system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512438381">6</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512438381">Figure 2</xref>). The anterior head-neck junction was classified as the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0363546512438381" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Normal: slight symmetric concavities of the anterior head-neck junction with respect to the posterior head-neck junction.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Flattening of the head-neck junction: moderate decrease in the anterior head-neck offset with respect to the posterior head-neck junction.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Presence of a prominence: a convexity in the anterior head-neck junction as opposed to a concavity.</p></list-item>
</list>

<label>Figure 1.</label>
<caption><p>To measure the α angle, we fitted a circle to the femoral head and placed a line through the center of the head and the middle of the neck. The α angle is the angle between the line through the neck and the point where the head-neck junction deviates from the circle. (A) A normal α angle of 42° is shown in a 16-year-old soccer player. (B) An abnormal α angle of 76° is shown in a 19-year-old soccer player.</p></caption>

<p>Radiographs were presented in a randomized order to the orthopaedic surgeon and the musculoskeletal radiologist, who were blinded for and unaware of whether the hip radiographs were of a soccer player or of a control participant. Repeating this procedure in a random sample of 52 hips showed an intraclass correlation coefficient of .82 for intraobserver reliability.</p>
<p>Finally, the skeletal maturity was determined in all radiographs using the Oxford score because the chronological age can be different from the skeletal age. The Oxford score ranges from 0 to 45 and is determined by maturity indicators in the pelvic region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512438381">1</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section5-0363546512438381">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>A patient was classified as having a cam-type deformity when an α angle &gt;60° was measured in at least one hip in either the AP or frog-leg lateral view. A participant was classified as having a flattening or prominence when such was visually scored in at least one hip in either the AP or frog-leg lateral view. When a participant had both a flattening and a prominence, he was classified as having a prominence. Differences in prevalence numbers between groups were calculated using logistic regression, corrected for age. By correcting for age, differences in prevalence between the groups were not influenced by the slight difference in age between the groups. Differences in the ROM between cam-type deformity patients and normal soccer players were calculated using generalized estimating equations (GEEs), corrected for age. By using a GEE regression model, we could model the correlation between left and right hips. Differences between the Oxford score in soccer players and controls were calculated using a univariate general linear model, corrected for age. The χ<sup>2</sup> test was used to study groin pain, leg dominance, and impingement test results in relation to the existence of a cam-type deformity.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The mean age of the 89 soccer players (178 hip joints) was 14.8 years (range, 12-19 years), and the mean body mass index was 20.13 kg/m<sup>2</sup> with a standard deviation (SD) of 2.25. The intensity of soccer practice had a mean ± SD of 7.96 ± 1.77 h/wk, and the years playing soccer ranged from 4 to 15 years, with a mean of 8.97 years. None of the participants had a history of hip disease. The mean age of the 92 (184 hip joints) controls was 13.8 years (range, 12-19 years), which was significantly lower than the soccer players (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). From the age of 14 years, the Oxford score tended to be slightly higher in the soccer players, although no statistically significant differences were measured in skeletal maturity (<italic>P</italic> = .07). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512438381">Table 1</xref> illustrates the mean per age.</p>

<p>In the soccer players, an α angle &gt;60° was first found at the age of 12 years on the frog-leg lateral view and at the age of 14 years on the AP view.

<p>Of all cam-type deformity cases in the soccer players determined by an abnormal α angle, 44% of the cam-type deformities were located only in the right femur, 26% were located only in the left femur, and 30% were bilateral. In addition, the visual prominences were located in the right femur in 33%, in the left femur in 17%, and were bilateral in 50% of the cases. The side affected was independent of leg dominance. In the controls, 31% of the cam-type deformities defined by an abnormal α angle were located only in the right femur, 63% were located only in the left femur, and 6% of these deformities were bilateral.</p>
<p>In the soccer players, internal rotation was significantly reduced in hips with cam-type deformities determined by an α angle &gt;60° compared with hips without cam deformities (19.7° vs 26.2°, <italic>P</italic> = .002); this was also true for hips with a flattening or prominence on the frog-leg lateral view compared with those without (20.4° vs 29.8°, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). No such differences in ROM were found when having a flattening or prominence on the AP view. No significant association was found between a positive impingement test result and the existence of a cam-type deformity or between groin pain and the existence of a cam-type deformity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cam impingement has been defined as a cause of hip pain in young adults and a potential cause for OA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546512438381">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546512438381">39</xref></sup> Young, active male patients are thought to have a higher risk for developing cam impingement. Some evidence exists that young, active male patients indeed have a higher prevalence and that a cam-type deformity develops during closure of the growth plate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546512438381">37</xref></sup> Our study supports this line of thinking.</p>
<p>The 2 main results of our study were that a cam-type deformity is present early in adolescence and seems to be more prevalent in soccer players. Furthermore, prevalence of cam-type deformities based on visual scores increases with age. The higher prevalence of cam-type deformities in soccer players has also been shown by Murray and Duncan,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512438381">30</xref></sup> who reported more tilt deformities on AP radiographs from male athletes exposed to a more active regimen in school. Recently, Siebenrock et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546512438381">37</xref></sup> showed that high-intensity basketball playing during adolescence was associated with a higher risk of cam impingement. They reported a prevalence of 89% cam-type deformities in basketball players after closure of the capital growth plate, which is comparable with the visual scores for flattening and prominence from the age of 14 years in our study. Other studies have shown that the prevalence of such deformities in asymptomatic men ranges from 9% to 25%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512438381">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512438381">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512438381">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546512438381">37</xref></sup> However, these percentages are difficult to compare because different measures were used to quantify a cam-type deformity. Nowadays, the α angle is the measure generally applied to quantify a cam-type deformity, although a validated threshold value for an abnormal α angle remains to be determined. Osseous abnormalities below the threshold value of 60° have been suggested to pose less of a risk for developing hip pain,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512438381">2</xref></sup> which is why we applied this cutoff value as a quantitative outcome measure.</p>
<p>A remarkable finding was an α angle &gt;60° in some 12-year-old boys. However, in 12-year-old boys, the α angle might be a less accurate measure for cam-type deformities. When the growth plate is not fused anterosuperiorly, the contour of the femoral head appears more oval, resulting in large α angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546512438381">Figure 4</xref>). In addition, we could not define a cam-type deformity purely visually when the growth plate was incompletely closed. Once the growth plate has almost closed, the typical shape of a cam-type deformity is more pronounced and recognizable. An interesting observation was that in some 12-year-old boys, the proximal femoral growth plate was more extended into the neck, which gave the head-neck junction a flat appearance. A follow-up study is needed to find out whether the large α angles and an extended growth plate in the youngest boys are precursors to the development of a classic cam-type deformity.</p>

</fig>
<p>Soccer players did not only have cam-type deformities more often, but these deformities were also more pronounced at this age. In soccer players, most hips with cam-type deformities that were identified with an abnormal α angle were visually scored as having a flattening or as having a prominence. In contrast, in the hips of controls with cam-type deformities identified by an abnormal α angle, most hips were visually scored as normal and some as having a flattening. In addition, in soccer players, 35% of the cam cases had an α angle &gt;60° in both the AP and frog-leg lateral radiographs, whereas none of the controls had an α angle &gt;60° in both radiographs. Dudda et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512438381">9</xref></sup> showed that those patients with an aspherical head-neck junction in both an AP and a lateral radiograph had the most prominent asphericity on magnetic resonance arthrography. Thus, obvious “bumps” were not seen in the controls, whereas these were present in soccer players and significantly increased in prevalence with age, reaching a prevalence of 40% in soccer players older than 17 years. The prevalence of a flattening did not increase with age in the soccer players, although <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512438381">Figure 3B</xref> suggests that a flattened head-neck junction can evolve toward a prominence over time.</p>
<p>Our study showed some discordance between the presence of a cam-type deformity defined by an α angle &gt;60° and the visual scores. In soccer players, 6 of the 18 hips visually scored as having a prominence did not have an α angle &gt;60°. This was caused either by a convexity anterior in the head-neck junction, which is visually detectable as a sclerotic region on the frog-leg lateral view, or by a convexity in the femoral neck instead of the head-neck junction. In both situations, the α angle was normal because these abnormalities do not affect the contour of the head-neck junction. Vice versa, in controls, 13 of the 17 hips with an α angle &gt;60° were visually scored as normal. Because all the radiographs of the controls were taken during normal clinical routine, these were not as standardized as in the soccer players. As a result, the α angles might have been influenced by the rotational position of the femur.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512438381">15</xref></sup> For instance, we observed that hips with an α angle &gt;60° that were visually scored as normal often had more externally rotated legs in the radiographs, which led to the higher α angle. In these cases, the head-neck junction could still be visually assessed, and a prominence or a flattened head-neck junction would have been recognized. Finally, in both soccer players and controls, the α angle might be less accurate when the growth plate is not completely fused anterosuperiorly. Taken together, the α angle is important as a quantitative outcome measure, but in this population, we observed that the α angle might have underestimated the prevalence in soccer players and might have overestimated the prevalence in controls. Therefore, we applied a visual scoring system that better represented the differences between soccer players and controls.</p>
<p>In addition to an AP pelvic view, a lateral view is necessary to visualize cam-type deformities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546512438381">43</xref></sup> Meyer et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512438381">28</xref></sup> showed both the Dunn view in 45° or 90° of flexion and the cross-table projection to be optimal for identifying femoral head-neck asphericity. However, they did not study the frog-leg lateral view. Clohisy et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512438381">7</xref></sup> concluded the frog-leg lateral view to be the most distinctive and reliable view for detecting cam-type deformities. In our study as well, most prominences were visually detectable in the frog-leg lateral view.</p>
<p>The anterior impingement test is most commonly used when FAI is suspected. In our study, the outcome of the impingement test was not associated with the existence of a cam-type deformity, for which we have 2 possible explanations. The first is that the anterior impingement test was not sufficiently sensitive. The second is that in these young soccer players, labral injury, which causes pain, was not yet present. The second explanation is more likely because studies with arthroscopically proven labral tears have reported high numbers of positive impingement test findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512438381">5</xref></sup> In hip joints with a cam-type deformity defined either by an α angle &gt;60° or by a flattening and prominence, internal rotation in 90° of flexion was significantly reduced. Thus, in young adolescents without any significant labral or cartilage damage, reduced internal rotation might be a more clinically relevant sign for a cam-type deformity than a positive anterior impingement test finding. This point needs further study.</p>
<p>Cam-type deformities were more often bilateral in soccer players than in controls. In the soccer players, prominences were bilateral in half of the cases, and cam-type deformities defined by α angle were bilateral in 30% of the cases. On the other hand, cam-type deformities defined by α angle in the controls were bilateral in only 6% of the cases. In addition, the higher prevalence and the more pronounced cam-type deformities in soccer players, combined with the fact that such deformities were already present when the growth plate had closed, suggest that a cam-type deformity develops during skeletal maturation and high-impact sports practice. The longer lateral extension of the epiphysis into the neck, as described by Siebenrock et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546512438381">38</xref></sup> that we frequently noticed indicates that a growth abnormality of the epiphysis due to the high shear stresses applied on the proximal femoral epiphysis might be a cause of a cam-type deformity. This growth abnormality might be caused by a delayed separation of the common physis between the femoral head and the greater trochanter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546512438381">36</xref></sup> or by a structural adaptation of the epiphysis to resist the higher demands of the proximal femur. A subclinical SCFE has been hypothesized to cause a cam-type deformity as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512438381">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512438381">14</xref></sup> However, all soccer players were without complaints during weightbearing, so a subclinical SCFE was not very likely. The controls in our study did have complaints, but because none of them had follow-up radiographs within the first 2 years after the initial radiographs, (subclinical) SCFE is unlikely. Radiographs of both soccer players and controls had no signs of a preslip, that is, widening and irregularity of the physis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546512438381">42</xref></sup> We therefore have no indication that most cam-type deformities are caused by a subclinical SCFE.</p>
<p>This study had some limitations. First, the prevalence of cam-type deformities might have been underestimated because conventional radiographs were used. Although radiographs are important for the initial diagnosis of cam impingement, several studies have shown that 3-dimensional imaging such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is slightly more sensitive for diagnosing a cam-type deformity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512438381">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512438381">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512438381">9</xref></sup> Using 3-dimensional imaging, the complete anterosuperior portion can be evaluated, and maximum α angles can be calculated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512438381">18</xref></sup> In contrast, when using AP and frog-leg lateral radiographs, the α angle only can be measured in the superior and anterior portion, respectively, which may therefore be lower, and prevalence might be underestimated. Second, we were unable to include a healthy control group because of ethical considerations related to radiation in the pelvic area. As an alternative, we selected a control group of comparable age from the radiology databases of 2 hospitals. Because these radiographs were mainly made in response to complaints related to the hip, the control group might not completely represent a healthy adolescent population. However, because none of the controls visited the hospital again with a minimum of 2 years after the radiographs were obtained, we consider the control group as a relatively normal adolescent population. Still, the prevalence of complaints related to cam-type deformity might have been overestimated in our controls relative to healthy controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512438381">33</xref></sup> Participants in whom sports activity was reported in their medical records were excluded from the control group. Although activity level is well documented, especially when participating at a high level, it is possible that some of the included controls did participate in sport. Taken together, this may explain why Siebenrock et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546512438381">37</xref></sup> found a slightly lower prevalence in their healthy, nonathletic adolescent control group than we did (9% vs 17%). We could not compare the outcomes of the clinical examination between soccer players and controls because no ROM and impingement tests were performed in the controls. Finally, controls aged over 15 years were less available, and thus, the age distributions of the 2 groups did not match completely.</p>
<p>This study showed that a cam-type deformity in young male soccer players and in the control group was visually recognizable and present as soon as the growth plate had closed. Cam-type deformities were more prevalent among young male soccer players than in the control group. This might suggest that intense high-impact sporting activities at a young age, especially during the closure of the proximal femoral growth plate, could be an important factor in the development of a cam-type deformity.</p>
