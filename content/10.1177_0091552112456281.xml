<abstract>
<p>This study used data from the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study to examine the demographic and in-college characteristics of students with disabilities at 2-year institutions, identify the types of educational services available to them, and determine how students’ disability conditions and their selected demographic and in-college characteristics related to their persistence. Nearly 25% of the students with disabilities in the sample did not persist beyond their first year, and almost 51% left without return by the end of their third year. The results from chi-square tests revealed that nonpersistence was associated with depression, physical or orthopedic conditions, and other conditions not specified in the survey. Delayed enrollment decreased the likelihood of both first-to-second and 3-year persistence. Conversely, full-time enrollment, high grade point averages (GPAs), high degree aspirations, and meetings with academic advisors were positively related to persistence. Recommendations for faculty members, administrators, and disability services staff members at 2-year institutions are provided.</p>

<p>The relationship between completion of a college degree or certificate and improved employment outcomes has been well established in the higher education and rehabilitation literature. However, individuals with disabilities enter postsecondary education at lower rates than their peers without disabilities and are less likely to persist until completion of their educational programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091552112456281">Ponticelli &amp; Russ-Eft, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0091552112456281">Quick, Lehmann, &amp; Deniston, 2003</xref>). Although students with disabilities are still underrepresented in higher education, they are entering postsecondary institutions in growing numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091552112456281">Garrison-Wade &amp; Lehmann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091552112456281">Hawke, 2004</xref>). Data on the enrollment of students with disabilities in postsecondary institutions have not been systematically collected, but estimates indicate that the percentage of postsecondary students who reported a disability increased from 2.6% in 1978 to 10.5% in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091552112456281">Getzel, Stodden, &amp; Briel, 2001</xref>). More recently, national data collected from degree-granting postsecondary institutions about students with disabilities revealed that in the 2008-2009 academic year, 707,000 students with disabilities were enrolled in postsecondary institutions, with about half of these students attending public 2-year institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0091552112456281">Raue &amp; Lewis, 2011</xref>). The growth in the number of students with disabilities can be attributed to factors such as enhanced assistive and instructional technology, expanded disability support service programs, greater self-determination among individuals with disabilities, and increased public awareness regarding the capabilities of individuals with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0091552112456281">Prentice, 2002</xref>). Continued enrollment increases are also anticipated because of the passage of recent legislation (e.g., the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008, the Higher Education Opportunity Act, and the Post-9/11 Veterans Education Act) that expands civil rights protections and educational benefits to individuals with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0091552112456281">Mamiseishvili &amp; Koch, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Research has documented that community colleges are the primary avenue for participating in higher education for individuals with disabilities. A study sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education found that nearly 60% of college students with disabilities attended institutions with 2-year programs or programs of less than 2 years in duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091552112456281">Horn, Peter, &amp; Rooney, 2002</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0091552112456281">Mamiseishvili and Koch (2011)</xref> found that approximately two thirds of a total national sample of college students with disabilities in the 2004-2006 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study data set attended 2-year or less-than-2-year institutions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0091552112456281">Johnson, Zascavage, and Gerber (2008)</xref> speculated that 2-year institutions may provide more intensive support services for students with disabilities and that these supports foster a greater sense of self-efficacy for college success. For those individuals who do not plan to transfer to 4-year institutions, 2-year institutions also provide opportunities to acquire marketable job skills and occupationally specific training within a relatively short period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0091552112456281">Lindstrom, Flannery, Benz, Olszewski, &amp; Slovic, 2009</xref>). They are often more affordable than 4-year institutions, have open enrollment, and offer developmental or remedial classes to those who need them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091552112456281">Ankeny &amp; Lehmann, 2010</xref>). As such, they serve students with varying degrees of academic preparedness and provide educational options that are not available at 4-year colleges and universities.</p>
<p>With continuing growth in the enrollment of students with disabilities at 2-year institutions, it is essential that these institutions are prepared to serve the needs of this population by providing the necessary educational accommodations and academic supports for their success. However, our extensive review of the higher education and rehabilitation literature revealed that only limited research has identified the factors that influence the persistence of 2-year college students with disabilities until completion of their programs of study or transfer to 4-year institutions. Much of the existing research on persistence and college success has focused on students with disabilities at 4-year colleges and universities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091552112456281">DaDeppo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0091552112456281">Vogel &amp; Adelman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0091552112456281">Wessel, Jones, Markle, &amp; Westfall, 2009</xref>). The limited research that exists on students with disabilities at 2-year institutions has utilized local or regional samples instead of nationally representative samples. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0091552112456281">Lindstrom et al. (2009)</xref> examined factors associated with program completion in a sample of students with disabilities at four community colleges. These community colleges partnered with a state vocational rehabilitation office to provide short-term skills training to participants in the study. The researchers found that women, older participants, and individuals who received financial support were more likely to persist until certificate completion, obtain employment, and maintain employment for 90 days; individuals with psychiatric disabilities were less likely to obtain positive outcomes. In another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091552112456281">Ponticelli and Russ-Eft (2009)</xref> examined the transfer outcomes of students with disabilities attending California community colleges between 1995-1996 and 2006-2007. They found that the average number of years for a transfer to a 4-year college for these students was 5.83. Furthermore, the study revealed that the proportion of transfer courses students took and the proportion of units they completed were the two strongest predictors of transfer.</p>
<p>The purpose of our study was to examine the persistence outcomes of a nationally representative sample of students with disabilities enrolled in 2-year postsecondary institutions in the United States. More specifically, we examined first-to-second and 3-year cumulative persistence rates of 2-year college students with disabilities and investigated how their persistence varied by disability condition and other selected demographic and in-college characteristics. The following questions guided our investigation:</p>

<sec id="section1-0091552112456281">
<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>A substantial theoretical basis has been established to guide the study of student persistence. One of the earliest theoretical models developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0091552112456281">Tinto (1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0091552112456281">1993</xref>) argued that students’ interactions with the social and academic systems of the institution affect their decisions to persist or depart from college. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0091552112456281">Tinto’s (1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0091552112456281">1993</xref>) model has had considerable influence on community college research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091552112456281">Bailey &amp; Alfonso, 2005</xref>); however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091552112456281">Braxton, Hirschy, and McClendon (2004)</xref> noted that the utility of Tinto’s model in explaining 2-year college student departure has remained “undetermined and open to empirical treatment” (p. 18). In particular, researchers have questioned the relevance of Tinto’s social integration concept for students at 2-year institutions, many of whom are older, more likely to enroll part-time, and have family and other personal commitments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091552112456281">Bean and Metzner (1985)</xref> suggested that “academic variables represent the primary way in which nontraditional students interact with the institution” (p. 492). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091552112456281">Braxton and Hirschy (2005)</xref> also argued that in the absence of social communities, “the academic realm of the institution holds the primary status” (p. 78). In their theory of student departure in commuter institutions, Braxton et al. described three elements (student entry characteristics, academic integration, and environments on and off campus) that influence students’ institutional commitment and, subsequently, their decision to persist. It should be noted that none of these aforementioned theoretical perspectives has been developed specifically for 2-year institutions. For example, Bean and Metzner’s model of nontraditional student persistence does not differentiate between nontraditional students at 2- and 4-year institutions. Similarly, the model developed by Braxton et al. focuses on commuter colleges and universities overall, and not on 2-year commuter institutions in particular. Despite these constraints, these models provide a good theoretical foundation to explain student persistence behaviors in 2-year college settings.</p>
<p>In addition to the existence of a strong theoretical basis, there also exists a substantial empirical basis to guide the study of student persistence at 2-year colleges. Researchers have extensively explored the effects of students’ demographic and in-college characteristics on 2-year college persistence. For example, past research has identified delayed enrollment in postsecondary institutions as a potential risk factor for nonpersistence. Studying a sample of first-time, full-time students at a community college in New England, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091552112456281">Craig and Ward (2007-2008)</xref> found that the length of time between high school graduation and college enrollment was the only demographic predictor that was significantly related to student retention.</p>
<p>Among in-college characteristics, the effects of academic integration and academic performance on 2-year college student success have been thoroughly researched (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091552112456281">Bers &amp; Smith, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091552112456281">Deil-Amen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0091552112456281">Hagedorn, Maxwell, Rodriguez, Hocevar, &amp; Fillpot, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091552112456281">Karp, Hughes, &amp; O’Gara, 2010-2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0091552112456281">Mutter, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0091552112456281">Nippert, 2000-2001</xref>). Past research has revealed that students with low first-semester grade point averages (GPAs) or in need of remediation are at a higher risk of attrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091552112456281">Bailey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091552112456281">Barbatis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091552112456281">Crews &amp; Aragon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091552112456281">Fike &amp; Fike, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0091552112456281">Hoyt, 1999</xref>). Hoyt’s study, conducted at a large urban community college, found that students’ first-semester academic performance had the strongest influence on retention. Furthermore, students who took two or more remedial courses were significantly more likely to leave than their peers who did not need remedial education. In addition, Nippert, in a study of 2-year college students using the data from the Cooperative Institutional Research Program’s 1986 and 1990 surveys, found that involvement in academic activities significantly influenced persistence and degree attainment. Two recent studies have also highlighted the importance of academic interactions with faculty members, staff members, and peers for students at 2-year institutions. Deil-Amen conducted interviews with 125 students from 14 public and private 2-year institutions and concluded that students’ in-classroom interactions facilitated both academic and social integration. Karp et al., based on interviews with students at two Northeastern urban community colleges, also found that many academic relationships that developed as part of the academic process, such as study groups, encompassed social elements and extended to social interactions as well (p. 83).</p>
<p>Over the past several decades, interest in studying student persistence has remained strong because “it is an outcome that mediates other outcomes: attainment, graduate school attendance, income, and career status” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0091552112456281">Walpole, 2007</xref>, p. 48). Despite this substantial research base on persistence in 2-year college settings, there is still a need to examine educational outcomes of disadvantaged student groups such as students with disabilities. Although they are attending community colleges in growing numbers, research on their persistence outcomes is still underdeveloped.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The study utilized a nonexperimental research design combining survey and explanatory correlational research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0091552112456281">Creswell, 2008</xref>) to examine trends in the sample of students with disabilities attending 2-year institutions, including their demographic and in-college characteristics, disability conditions, and types of accommodations available to them. The study also sought to investigate the association between these variables and the likelihood of first-to-second and three-year cumulative persistence.</p>
<sec id="section3-0091552112456281">
<title>Data Source and Sample</title>
<p>Our investigation utilized data from the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/06) data set. The BPS:04/06 data set includes a nationally representative sample of college students who started their postsecondary education for the first time in the fall of 2003. The 2003-2004 base-year sample of 23,090 students was drawn from 1,360 postsecondary institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091552112456281">Cominole et al., 2007</xref>). The students were first surveyed at the end of the 2003-2004 academic year and then surveyed again in the first follow-up study conducted in 2006. Survey interviews were administered in three modes: web-based, self-administered interviews; computer-assisted telephone interviews; and computer-assisted personal interviews. Approximately, 18,640 of the 23,090 base-year sample members were determined to be eligible for inclusion in the first follow-up study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091552112456281">Cominole et al., 2007</xref>). The overall unweighted response rate for eligible sample members was 80%, with a weighted response rate of 77%.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this study, we selected the sample of students with disabilities who enrolled at 2-year postsecondary institutions in the fall of 2003. Within this sample, there were 890 individuals who reported having some type of disability or condition that had lasted 6 months or more, including any sensory impairment, such as blindness, deafness, or a severe vision or hearing impairment; any mobility impairment that substantially restricted students’ basic physical activities; or any other mental, emotional, or learning condition limiting students’ ability to learn, remember, and concentrate. Because the BPS:04/06 data set relied on a complex sampling design, which included stratified multistage sampling with unequal probabilities of sample selection, we utilized relative weights to correct for oversampling and make the data representative of the target population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0091552112456281">Thomas &amp; Heck, 2001</xref>). Relative weights were computed by dividing the raw weights provided in the data set by their mean and applied to data analysis by using WEIGHT BY command in SPSS.</p>

<title>Variables</title>
<sec id="section5-0091552112456281">
<title>Persistence</title>
<p>Two success measures served as outcome variables in our study: first-to-second-year persistence and 3-year cumulative persistence. The first outcome variable indicated students’ persistence and attainment anywhere in the system at the end of the first academic year. Students who had attained an associate’s degree or a certificate by the end of the first year, or who had enrolled for at least 1 month during the 2003-2004 academic year and reenrolled at any institution of higher education in a later year, were considered to be persisters; those who left without return by the end of the first year and who had not earned a degree or certificate were coded as nonpersisters. On the second outcome measure, students who had attained any certificate or degree, or who were still enrolled at any postsecondary institution by the end of the third year in June 2006, were coded as persisters; those who were no longer enrolled and who had not attained any degree or certificate were considered to be nonpersisters. In other words, the 3-year persistence variable indicated the cumulative outcome of enrollment by the end of the third year, regardless of any breaks or stops. As evident from the description of the outcome variables provided above, measures of system or individual persistence, rather than institutional persistence, were used in this study. System persistence focuses on the individual student and takes into account whether the student remains enrolled in the higher education system as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0091552112456281">Hagedorn, 2005</xref>). Therefore, according to this approach, students who transferred to another institution but remained enrolled anywhere in the system were also coded as persisters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0091552112456281">
<title>Disability-related variables</title>
<p>Disability-related variables included both students’ disability conditions and the types of educational services provided to them. The variable indicating students’ main disability type or condition included the following categories: sensory condition (i.e., hearing impairment, blindness, or visual impairment), orthopedic or mobility impairment, specific learning disability or dyslexia, attention-deficit disorder (ADD), health impairment or problem, emotional or psychiatric condition, depression, and other (e.g., speech or language impairment, developmental disability, brain injury, or other conditions not included in any other category). Disability-related services or accommodations included adaptive equipment and technology (e.g., assistive or listening devices, talking computers), alternative examination format or additional time, course substitution or waiver, readers, classroom notetakers or scribes, registration assistance or priority class registration, sign language or oral interpreters, tutors to assist with ongoing homework, and other services. The respondents were asked to report which of these services they needed but did not receive and which of these services they received during 2003-2004 academic year.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0091552112456281">
<title>Demographic and in-college characteristics</title>
<p>We examined the following demographic and in-college characteristics of students with disabilities at 2-year institutions: gender, race and ethnicity, delayed enrollment, first-year GPA, attendance intensity, remediation, degree aspirations, and academic integration variables. The variable of gender was represented by two categories: male and female. The variable of race and ethnicity included four categories: Whites, Blacks/African Americans, Hispanics or Latino/as, and Other (i.e., individuals who were in other race categories or who were in more than one race category). The delayed enrollment variable was dichotomous, indicating whether or not students delayed their enrollment in postsecondary education after high school graduation. The first-year GPA variable represented students’ cumulative GPA in academic year 2003-2004. It was standardized to a 4-point scale and included four categories: 1 = 0.1 to 1.0 (D- to D), 2 = 1.1 to 2.0 (C- to C), 3 = 2.1 to 3.0 (B- to B), and 4 = 3.1 to 4.0 (A- to A). The attendance intensity variable was collapsed into a dichotomy based on the students’ enrollment patterns during the 2003-2004 academic year: 1 = full-time, and 0 = part-time or mixed (i.e., both part-time and full-time at differing points during the academic year). The remediation variable included two categories: 1 = students enrolled in at least one remedial course in their first year, and 0 = students did not take any remedial course. The degree aspirations variable indicated the highest level of education that the students ever expected to complete: 1 = no degree or certificate, 2 = associate’s degree, 3 = bachelor’s degree, 4 = postbachelor’s certificate or master’s degree, and 5 = doctoral or first-professional degrees. Academic integration included four variables that indicated how often students participated in study groups, had social contact with faculty members, met with an academic advisor, or talked with faculty members about academic matters outside of class. On each of these academic integration variables, respondents were asked to report the frequency of their participation (i.e., 0 = <italic>never</italic>, 1 = <italic>sometimes</italic>, and 2 = <italic>often</italic>) in each of these activities during the 2003-2004 academic year.</p>

<sec id="section8-0091552112456281">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics were used to observe the characteristics of students with disabilities at 2-year institutions, including their disability conditions, types of disability services available to them, persistence rates, and their selected demographic and in-college characteristics. After the descriptive analysis, Pearson’s chi-square tests were conducted to examine whether there was any significant association between persistence of students with disabilities and their disability conditions, as well as with selected demographic and in-college characteristics. The data met the assumptions for the chi-square test: Each item in the data contributed to only one cell in the contingency table, and all expected frequencies were greater than five (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091552112456281">Field, 2005</xref>). Phi and Cramer’s V statistics were examined for each chi-square test to indicate the strength of the association between the variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091552112456281">Field, 2005</xref>). The phi statistic was used when both variables have only two categories. Cramer’s V statistic was reported when variables have more than two categories.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0091552112456281">Table 2</xref> provides data on the background and in-college characteristics of students with disabilities, in the aggregate as well as for the persister and nonpersister groups. The sample comprised 66.9% Whites, 12.4% Hispanics, 9.4% Blacks or African Americans, and 11.4% individuals in other race and ethnicity categories or in more than one race category. More than half (54.3%) were female, and 45.7% were male. Nearly 54.0% of the students delayed their enrollment in college after high school and a slight more than half of the sample (51.0%) attended part-time or had a mixed enrollment pattern (i.e., both part-time and full-time). Of the total sample, 26.5% took one or more remedial courses during the 2003-2004 academic year. The majority of the students’ GPAs were above 2.0 (79.7%). The students also revealed high degree aspirations, with 32.0% aspiring to complete a bachelor’s degree and 30.6% aspiring to complete a postbaccalaureate certificate or a masters degree. In terms of their academic involvement, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0091552112456281">Table 3</xref>, 73.0% of the students never had any informal meetings with faculty members, and 59.9% never participated in study groups during their first year in college. Overall, the number of students who reported that they were often involved in any of the academic activities examined in the study ranged from 6.1% to 13.5%.</p>

<title>Factors Related to Persistence of 2-Year College Students With Disabilities</title>
<p>The data revealed that of the total sample of 890 two-year-college students with disabilities, 220 (24.7%) left without return by the end of the first year and 450 (50.6%) left by the end of the third year. Pearson’s chi-square tests were conducted to determine if the type of disability had any significant association with students’ first-to-second-year and 3-year cumulative persistence outcomes. As indicated by chi-square values reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0091552112456281">Table 1</xref>, students with depression were more likely to leave than persist through the second year, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 6.844, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. In addition, students with other conditions were also at a higher risk of leaving by the end of the first year, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 4.677, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Furthermore, students with orthopedic or physical conditions were at an increased likelihood of dropping out sometime within the first 3 years, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 4.917, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. On the other hand, significant positive associations were observed between emotional or psychiatric condition and 3-year persistence and between dyslexia and both measures of persistence.</p>
<p>Chi-square tests were also conducted to see whether there was any significant association between any of the students’ demographic and in-college characteristics and their likelihood of persistence. Results from these chi-square tests, provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0091552112456281">Table 2</xref>, reveal that delayed enrollment decreased the likelihood of both first-to-second-year persistence, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 22.127, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and 3-year persistence, χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 29.959, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, with phi statistics of –.16 and –.18, respectively (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). More specifically, 67.4% of the students who delayed their enrollment for 1 year or more after finishing high school did not persist through the second year, as opposed to 32.6% who enrolled in college right after high school. Similarly, in terms of their 3-year persistence, 62.8% of the nonpersisters had delayed enrollment, and 37.2% did not have a gap between high school and college. Higher degree aspirations were also significantly and positively associated with both persistence outcomes, χ<sup>2</sup>(4) = 10.816, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and χ<sup>2</sup>(4) = 16.711, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, with Cramer’s values of .11 and .14, respectively.</p>
<p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0091552112456281">Table 2</xref>, full-time enrollment during the first year in college was not significantly related to 3-year cumulative persistence; however, it had a positive effect on the first-to-second-year persistence, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 23.722, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, with the phi value of .16. More specifically, among the first-to-second-year nonpersisters, 65.5% were enrolled part-time or mixed (i.e., both part-time and full-time at differing points during the academic year) compared to only 34.5% who were enrolled full-time. GPA was not significantly related to the likelihood of first-to-second-year persistence. On the other hand, higher first-year GPAs increased the likelihood of persistence over the 3-year period, χ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 11.557, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, with a significant Cramer’s V of .11 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Finally, chi-square tests were also conducted to observe any significant association between academic involvement and persistence. As indicated by chi-square values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0091552112456281">Table 3</xref>, among academic integration variables, meetings with academic advisors had a significant positive association with students’ long-term persistence outcome, χ<sup>2</sup>(2) = 6.571, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, with a Cramer’s V statistic of .09 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). More frequent academic advisor meetings decreased the likelihood of a student leaving without return over a 3-year period.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Two-year colleges serve the largest segment of the population of postsecondary students with disabilities and offer educational options and academic supports that may not be available at 4-year institutions, yet half of the 2-year college students with disabilities in our nationally representative sample failed to persist, transfer, or complete a degree or a certificate by the end of their third year. This finding represents a pressing problem for administrators and disability support staff members at 2-year institutions, and failure to seriously examine what these institutions can do to increase the persistence rates of students with disabilities disadvantages a large segment of the student population. Also of concern is our finding that having an orthopedic or physical condition was negatively associated with 3-year cumulative persistence because students with these conditions represented the largest portion of the total sample of students with disabilities. It is also noteworthy that depression decreased the likelihood of first-to-second-year persistence. The onset of depression typically occurs during adolescence or young adulthood, and the symptoms associated with depression (e.g., insomnia, fatigue, diminished ability to concentrate) can substantially interfere with one’s ability to fulfill the requirements of postsecondary education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091552112456281">Collins &amp; Mowbray, 2005</xref>). Consequently, the stress of transitioning into postsecondary education is often compounded by the simultaneous onset of disruptive symptoms.</p>
<p>On the other hand, emotional or psychiatric conditions were positively associated with 3-year cumulative persistence. This finding is promising in light of prior research indicating that approximately 86% of individuals with psychiatric disabilities withdraw from college prior to completion of their program of study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091552112456281">Collins &amp; Mowbray, 2005</xref>). Greater stigma is often associated with psychiatric disabilities, in comparison to physical disabilities, because of the ambiguous nature of these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0091552112456281">Smart, 2009</xref>), and prior research has indicated that students with psychiatric disabilities are often hesitant to request the academic supports necessary for their success out of fear that the responses they will receive will be negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091552112456281">Brokelman, Chadsey, &amp; Loeb, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091552112456281">Collins &amp; Mowbray, 2005</xref>). Perhaps our finding reflects a positive change in attitudes toward psychiatric disability as well as improvements in the capacity of 2-year institutions to academically support and retain these students. The same could hold true for students with learning disabilities, specifically with dyslexia, whose disability type was positively associated with persistence. It appears that 2-year institutions are doing an adequate job of accommodating students with learning disabilities in a way that facilitates their persistence, and research has, in fact, documented that 2-year institutions possess many characteristics that facilitate the persistence of students with learning disabilities to completion of their programs of study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0091552112456281">McCleary-Jones, 2008</xref>). Finally, in interpreting the findings regarding the association of disability type to persistence, it must be taken into consideration that responses were derived from the question, “What is the main type of condition or impairment you have?” and survey respondents were instructed to choose only one disability type. This imposes limitations on our ability to truly understand the impact of disability type on persistence and necessitates further research.</p>
<p>Assistance with examinations and the provision of tutors to assist with homework were among the most frequently received accommodations by students with disabilities in this study. These were also the services that were most frequently mentioned as those that were needed but not received. Access to appropriate accommodations may play a critical role in the success of students with disabilities; however, based on our study, it was difficult to determine the reasons why students did not receive these accommodations. In the postsecondary education context, it is the student’s responsibility to request the services and present the necessary documentation to receive the supports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0091552112456281">Getzel, 2008</xref>). Students with disabilities may not be aware of what the process is for obtaining and utilizing these accommodations, or they may not be ready to disclose their disability and ask for specific services. Getzel indicated that “understanding how to access and use accommodations is a critical self-determination skill” (p. 210) for college students with disabilities and institutions need to assist these students with the development of these skills.</p>
<p>More than half of the students with disabilities in this study (53.7%) delayed their enrollment in postsecondary education after finishing high school. In addition, 51.0% maintained only part-time or mixed enrollments during their first year in college. The study showed that both of these nontraditional student indicators put students with disabilities at a higher risk of dropping out and decreased their likelihood of persistence. These findings are consistent with much of the previous research on students without disabilities as well (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091552112456281">Craig &amp; Ward, 2007-2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0091552112456281">Summers, 2003</xref>). However, delaying enrollment in college and navigating full-time enrollment during their first year may create additional challenges that are unique to students with disabilities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0091552112456281">Getzel (2008)</xref> stated that adjusting to college life is difficult for all students, but managing accommodations together with the demands of postsecondary education may have greater effects on the persistence of students with disabilities.</p>
<p>Our study also revealed that having higher GPAs and degree aspirations during the first year in college were associated with an increased likelihood of persistence. It is also noteworthy that the majority of students with disabilities in this study entered 2-year institutions with high degree expectations. Almost 77.0% of the students aspired to earn a bachelor’s degree or higher, yet half of the students with disabilities in this study (50.6%) left without returning at some point over a 3-year period. These findings suggest that there is a mismatch between what these students aspire to and what actually happens once they start navigating postsecondary education.</p>
<p>Previous research has consistently demonstrated that students greatly benefit from in- or out-of-classroom interactions with their peers, faculty members, and staff members. For students with disabilities, these interactions create a sense of inclusiveness and belonging that become essential elements for their success in college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091552112456281">Belch, 2004-2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0091552112456281">Johnson, 2000</xref>). A mixed-methods study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0091552112456281">McCleary-Jones (2008)</xref> examining the experiences of students with learning disabilities at two community colleges indicated that faculty members play an important role in the success of these students. McCleary-Jones concluded that in the context of similar resources and accommodations, the students with disabilities were retained longer and had higher GPAs at the community college that had a better rapport between faculty members and these students. Given the significance of involvement with peers and faculty members, it is concerning to find that majority of students with disabilities attending 2-year institutions in our study never had informal meetings with faculty members and never participated in study groups (73.0% and 59.9%, respectively).</p>
<p>In addition, 44.3% of students in this study reported that they never met with their academic advisors during their first year in college. This latter finding is particularly significant because the analyses revealed that more frequent academic advisor meetings during the first year in college were positively and significantly associated with 3-year persistence of students with disabilities. Previous research shows that meetings with academic advisors facilitate students’ short- and long-term academic planning and assist them with choosing the right course of study to complete an associate’s degree or transfer to a 4-year institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0091552112456281">Purnell, Blank, Scrivener, &amp; Seupersad, 2004</xref>). Academic advisors may play a critical role in the process of educational planning that leads to successful college outcomes. For example, after examining transfer patterns of 31,590 students with disabilities in the California community college system over a 12-year period, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091552112456281">Ponticelli and Russ-Eft (2009)</xref> found that course enrollment patterns (e.g., the proportion of transferable courses or credit completed, the number of degree-applicable courses completed) were among the strongest predictors of transfer.</p>

<title>Implications for Policy and Future Research</title>
<p>The findings of our study have important implications for policy and future research. The focus should not just be on improving access to college for students with disabilities but also on helping these students persist to degree completion once they are in college. The focus on improving successful outcomes of college must start at the secondary school level. School counselors and special educators should encourage students with disabilities to enter postsecondary education soon after finishing high school and educate them on the process of requesting and utilizing accommodations in college. Once in college, academic advisors and disability services staff members should assist these students with academic planning and choosing a program of study that is realistic and fits their goals. Full-time enrollment should be encouraged when the abilities and circumstances of the student make full-time study possible. New student orientation programs should be used to lay the foundation for students’ academic integration through encouraging frequent interactions with faculty and academic advisors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0091552112456281">Nippert, 2000-2001</xref>). In addition, our findings seem to suggest that 2-year institutions need to further improve the persistence of students with disabilities, especially those with depression and physical or orthopedic conditions, by (a) removing environmental barriers that impede persistence in addition to providing classroom accommodations, and (b) coupling supports such as health management and campus-based mental health services with the academic supports that are offered by campus disability services offices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091552112456281">Collins &amp; Mowbray, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The study revealed that students with disabilities enroll in 2-year institutions with high degree aspirations. But our study also showed that having high aspirations may not be sufficient without proper academic planning and realistic action plans. Faculty and staff members working with students with disabilities need to foster high goals and aspirations in these students, but, at the same time, they need to provide proper supports to help them persevere and achieve their goals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0091552112456281">Yuen and Shaughnessy (2001)</xref> have recommended helping students with disabilities develop life plans based on their goals, objectives, and available resources. They suggested the use of reflective journals and discussions to help students become more self-aware, develop options, and find resources to fulfill their goals.</p>
<p>Academic integration through faculty and peer interactions should continuously be encouraged. Faculty members can play a critical role in creating a learning environment that encourages collaboration with peers within and outside of the classroom. Recent studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091552112456281">Deil-Amen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091552112456281">Karp et al., 2010-2011</xref>) have shown that for community college students, relationships that begin in the classroom extend beyond academics to the social spheres of their lives. Student-centered, collaborative learning opportunities, such as study groups, can be one way to foster these relationships and a sense of connectedness with the institution for students with disabilities.</p>
<p>The study has several limitations that must be acknowledged. We examined the availability of disability-related accommodations (i.e., whether the student received a service or whether the student needed a service but did not receive it); however, it should be noted that having access to specific services does not mean that the services are necessarily appropriate or effective. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091552112456281">Kurth and Mellard (2006)</xref> examined community college students’ perceptions of the accommodation process and found that participants rated many accommodations typically found on college campuses as ineffective “at least 25% of the time” (p. 81). Future study needs to further examine the effectiveness of the accommodations provided to students with disabilities at 2-year institutions.</p>
<p>Our study examined persistence of students with disabilities through the second year in college and by the end of their third year in college. Previous research has indicated that students with disabilities generally take longer to complete their course of study and graduate (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0091552112456281">Murray, Goldstein, Nourse, &amp; Edgar, 2000</xref>). On the basis of our findings, we were not able to determine whether the students who were on the persistence track but who had not yet transferred to a 4-year institution or completed any degree or certificate by the end of the third year would eventually be achieving these outcomes. Future study needs to examine persistence pathways and educational outcomes of students with disabilities at 2-year institutions over a longer time frame than 3 years. It is through “program completion that students realize the greatest economic benefits of higher education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091552112456281">Corrigan, 2003</xref>, p. 25). A college degree leads to better employment outcomes, greater earning power, and overall improved quality of life. Therefore, it is important to know whether the students with disabilities who stayed on the persistence track for the first 3 years would eventually earn their degrees.</p>
