<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to provide research-based argument for a better housing for the dementia elderly within the apartment complex neighbourhood. Six case study’s designs are included to illustrate the types of facilities that could be possible that would provide a better environment for the care of elderly and older people with dementia. Literature was analyzed to give the perspectives of “sustainable and aging society,” “social integration” and “natural environment that promotes health.” Small group workshop was carried out with experienced professionals to discuss the concepts and features of the developed housing alternatives plans to validate the proposal to integrate local residents and promote holistic health for the fragile aged. The findings illustrate the vision for the shared space community, a community home for the dementia elderly, with appropriate scale for easy management and being connected with local community and with affluent green environment for healing and natural environment that would ease local residents’ aversion towards elderly housing. These housing alternatives would enable the elderly to age in place and with the most natural social integration available to local people, with a proper spatial planning to promote holistic health of the fragile aged.</p></abstract>

<sec id="sec2-1420326X11419349"><title>Background and Purpose</title>
<p>Since 1970’s industrialization, mass production of houses has been possible and as a result, 7.8 million apartments have been built in Korea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11419349">1</xref>]. Physical proximity of apartments has led to active interaction among residents and this has created a new form of community culture. However, frequent contact within the community deepened competition among groups and generated another social complication.</p>
<p>Alongside with the world’s aging population issue, Korea has already faced an aged society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11419349">2</xref>]. With an increasing aged population and an outbreak rate of dementia in this population has been rising. According to Statistics of Korea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11419349">3</xref>], the outbreak rate of dementia within the elderly aged over 65 is 8.6%. Approximately 460,000 of the elderly are dementia patients and it is expected that the number of dementia patients in this group would ascend to 690,000 in 2020. Contrary to the general elderly, a physical, psychological and economic burden on supporting family members or care givers is great in order to meet the needs of the elderly with dementia. Therefore, staying in dementia facilities is an absolute option when the level of dementia is severe. Despite growing interests on life of the elderly with dementia and healing environment for them, constructive base to support their lives is lacking. Furthermore, such elderly housing is considered an unpleasant facility, thus local residents avoid it being built within their community. Yet, our society is aging rapidly and there will be more needs of elderly housing in a city along with aging speed, thus evading elderly housing is an inappropriate and unhealthy aspect as it creates an obstacle in making the city sustainable and accommodating elderly housing well in an urban setting is as significant as city’s ecological issues. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to clarify usefulness of housing alternatives that would promote holistic health of the fragile aged within the neighbourhood.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1420326X11419349" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>Literature research and small group workshop were used as a methodology. Literature was analyzed by the following three perspectives, which are “sustainable and aging society, social integration and natural environment that promotes health”. These were chosen to build sustainable society, by solving aging-related social problems in a socially integrative perspective. The provision of natural environment can work as a buffer zone for social integration in an architectural design for the elderly. Publications, precedence researches, statistics, conference data etc. were used for literature research. Small group workshop was carried out on three professionals who have more than 20 years of experience in providing better dementia care environment within elderly care facilities. Concepts and features of housing alternatives for the fragile aged that could be inserted into the existing apartment buildings were discussed. Housing alternatives were explained with visual means i.e. plans, perspective views, videos. To gather small group workshop participants’ opinion, IAI-C-CCC method was used which pursues following process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11419349">4</xref>].
<list id="list1-1420326X11419349" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><bold>Initiate</bold>: Speak up and voice your opinion. Do not wait for others to make statements that you only respond to. Think about what you want to say and say it clearly. Be creative. Have ideas.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Advocate</bold>: Stick up for yourself with a good, well thought-out argument. Refer to facts that can be verified. Plan your argument so that it is convincing; but be ready to see other people’s points of view if they present logical reservations. Be ready to overcome other team members’ “reservations.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Inquire</bold>: Whenever anyone else in the team makes a point, before you disagree, ask them to clarify what you may not understand or to explain what facts they are basing their argument on. People will listen to you if you first listen to them.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Conflict</bold>: If everyone in a team agrees totally with each other, there is no reason to have a team meeting. Disagreement is the basis of a good team meeting. But do it right. Do not argue or fight. Do not get personal. Let the facts speak for themselves. Listen to the other person’s point of view. Present differences you may have in terms of well thought-out “reservations” to the point of view of another. Such a statement is an invitation to others to overcome the reservation. Until the other person’s point of view has been discussed, do not present your own “counter proposal.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Consensus</bold>: The best way to make group decisions is for everyone in the group to agree without reservation by consensus. To achieve this quickly, listen to other team members and if you disagree think carefully about your concerns, say: “My reservation is…” then wait for that person and other team members to resolve your concerns. That is their responsibility; not yours. If a reservation cannot be overcome, the team has to adopt that change. When everyone’s reservations are resolved the team has consensus. If you cannot reach consensus, you have to either vote, which means some people’s reservations have not been included in the decision, or you have to appoint one person as the decision-maker. Both voting and appointing a decision maker are flawed processes; they leave opinions and people out of the decision.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Commitment</bold>: When the group in which you are a part makes a decision together by consensus, every member of that group is taking that decision as an individual as well. If you agree to do something either in the group or as an individual within the group, this represents a commitment. Commitments are met. There are no consequences for unmet commitments because that would give the person the option of choosing to do what she or he said or to live with the consequences. When team members repeatedly meet the commitments they make in the group. When they match their deeds to their words over time, the group develops trust.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Critique</bold>: In order to improve team results and teamwork skills team members engage in critique before, during and after each team meeting. Critique is not criticism; comparing actions to plans made and principles agreed to enable the team to continually improve. Plan beforehand. Pre-critique. Do not be afraid to say “time out” during the meeting. Time-out critique. Be sure to review as a team how well you practised teamwork principles and how you are going to improve the next time. Post critique.</p></list-item></list></p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1420326X11419349"><title>Literature Review</title>
<sec id="sec5-1420326X11419349"><title>Sustainable and Aging Society</title>
<p>The concept of is often related to saving natural resources and environmentally friendly issues that are related to ecological crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11419349">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11419349">11</xref>], however, supporting human’s physical decline due to aging should also be considered to build sustainable society. In other words, respecting human aspect in an inclusive social environment would fit the meaning of sustainable society. Thus, in order to aid physical deterioration of the elderly and to construct sustainable society, sharing urban space effectively is the key.</p>
<p>Considering characteristics of the elderly who spends most of the time in their houses, housing issues for the elderly should be solved with first priority. According to Lee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11419349">12</xref>], the ideal elderly housing ought to encourage the elderly age in place regardless of one’s culture and nation. “Aging in Place” means making the elderly be able to continuously live in the existing house without moving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11419349">13</xref>]. As the elderly prefers small-scaled houses as managing houses would become problematic due to physical weakness, desirable housing type would be a group of homes that would enable them to age in place within the community and to interact with people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11419349">14</xref>]. Even though personal resources are limited, utilizing the space where an elderly group home’s co-residents and local residents could share would lead to the direction of building sustainable Korean society and promote the elderly to age actively.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1420326X11419349"><title>Social Integration</title>
<p>Social integration is an integrating process that segregated groups or individuals can adjust to each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11419349">15</xref>], and this means accommodating the minority groups such as ethnic minorities, refugees and underprivileged sections of a society into the mainstream of societies. Members of the minority groups thus gain full access to the opportunities, rights and services available to the members of the mainstream.</p>
<p>It is a widespread problem that dementia elderly housing or social housing is considered as an unpleasant facility and there has always been objection issue to develop it in one community due to NIMBYism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11419349">16</xref>]. Lack of community spirit and differences among social groups in an information-oriented society have led to the exclusion of the socially disadvantaged group like the elderly with dementia or low-income people from the mainstream. It has been predicted that making Korean society socially integrative would be costly and compulsory social integration could create side effects, thus ingenious strategies are necessary to accomplish social integration naturally.</p>
<p>The national project called “Development of Socially Integrative Housing Community Regeneration Technology” carried out by the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs approves social integration issue as a significant factor for urban planning. The project seeks ways to naturally integrate the social minorities into the mainstream, to build sustainable society and to bring liveliness to a local community. With this background, Unit Insertion Building System (UIBS) has been proposed which can be applied to apartment buildings in order to promote active social interaction among apartment residents and open up to a new way of living. UIBS is the Skeleton Infill (SI) housing with an open building concept which would enhance durability of the building and vitalize local community culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X11419349">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1420326X11419349">18</xref>].</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1420326X11419349"><title>Natural Environment that Promotes Health</title>
<p>Natural environment can provide affluent atmosphere that would enriches people’s lives. It promotes people’s physical health through exercises and emotional health via visual tranquility. Natural environment is also a positive distraction to the elderly with dementia. Its healing role to the elderly with dementia has been proven in precedence researches. Carman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X11419349">19</xref>] indicated that a garden space within dementia elderly housing facilities would positively stimulate sensory organs of the elderly with dementia and helps to cure emotional control and memory disabilities. Moreover, natural environment would facilitate for the elderly with dementia to maintain their physical ability and to heal depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1420326X11419349">20</xref>] and promotes emotional stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1420326X11419349">21</xref>]. According to Oh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X11419349">22</xref>], dementia elderly housing residents who get access to safe wandering space and outdoor nature space would have less disruptive and problematic behaviours and a higher independence in comparison to those who do not have them. Natural environment is beneficial to not only general public but the elderly with dementia.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1420326X11419349"><title>Dementia Elderly Housing Plan within Existing Apartments in Korea</title>
<sec id="sec9-1420326X11419349"><title>Background of Planning Target</title>
<sec id="sec10-1420326X11419349"><title>Development of Shared Spaces in Korean Apartments</title>
<p>The word “community” originated from the Latin word “communitas” that means an unstructured community in which people are equal with an intense solidarity and togetherness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X11419349">23</xref>]. This implies people in a community usually share the common environment and common concerns. The concept of shared space means that a sense of community is reflected in a space, and shared space in apartments in Korea is residents’ common space to satisfy various functions as daily welfare of residents. Although more than 7.8 million units of apartments have been built for last 50 years, apartments in Korea have not formed a housing culture of community successfully, and shared space has been made only as a simple common stairway or an aisle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1420326X11419349">24</xref>]. However, as the restrictions on the maximum prices of apartments by government were lifted and residents’ demand to pursue the quality of life has been on an increase, residents’ shared spaces and community centres began to be built. In the middle of 2000, more than 100 kinds of shared spaces including community conference room, fitness space and others were built, which shows apartment buildings are being developed to stimulate the community activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1420326X11419349">25</xref>]. In addition, increasing emphasis in the community-shared space would form a green infra where residents can experience and realize the green life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1420326X11419349">26</xref>], though any functional spaces may be installed in line, and suggested that the community-shared spaces be converted into “green + α”. Shared space in apartments in Korea is now expected to promote the symbiotic living environment and function like a sponge that will relieve many social problems.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1420326X11419349"><title>Concept of Building Innovation Model</title>
<p>Korean people are resolved to solve the urgent social problems caused by changing demographic structure and aging society, and have to challenge diverse issues such as energy-efficient ways for the existing concrete buildings to restore the ecosystems. Some representative books for symbiotic housing culture established by vitalizing shared space are “Housing for the Korean Elderly” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1420326X11419349">27</xref>], “Future Housings and Residents’ Shared Space” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1420326X11419349">28</xref>], and “Millennium Community Center” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1420326X11419349">29</xref>]. These researches suggested a comprehensive model for residents’ shared space in residential areas. In connection with these studies, Lee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X11419349">17</xref>] suggested to establish an “Apartment Community Space Project” as national project or system for apartment innovation. Key points of this proposal are to utilize the shared spaces of the apartments for necessary functions according to social changes. For instance, 5%–10% of the apartment building is secured as the minimum community shared space, and the extra spaces are recommended to be secured with the consensus of the residents. These are new ideas for the shared spaces that will activate the community life not only at the level of apartment complex but also at the level of unit buildings where hundreds or more residents live together, realizing the vertical community vitalization.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-1420326X11419349"><title>Benefits of Green Infra and its Relevance of Community Shared Space</title>
<p>Ecosystem crisis with climate changes, urbanization and exhaustion of natural resources has become global issue, and in order to solve this problem, various efforts and researches for greening by constructing green environment with plants and developing new eco-friendly techniques have been made. Introducing community gardens or farming gardens in buildings for green environment is one of these efforts, and these green environments are implemented with green infra concept. One of the representative ecological problems in the industrialized cities is the phenomenon of urban heat island. In order to relieve this heat island effect, formation of planting and water space, energy efficient construction technology and installation of pilotis in the residential complex can be used. If green spaces are installed on rooftop and walls in the residential building, the air temperature around the building is adjusted and indoor heating environment is improved and cooling expense in summer can be saved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1420326X11419349">30</xref>]. From this viewpoint, if community-shared space is required to be constructed at a certain proportion or more in all the buildings, it is expected that, in most cases, greening space or community garden will be installed on the roof and the ground floor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1420326X11419349">31</xref>]. Therefore, community-shared spaces will function as a space for promoting interaction and cooperation among the residents through preventing the heat island effect and by providing the residents with greening experience information, solving the problems of ecosystem crisis, achieving the bio diversity and providing a healthy environment opportunity for the residents including socially disadvantaged people with easy accessibility.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec13-1420326X11419349"><title>Planning Guidelines</title>
<p>Planning guidelines of dementia elderly housing can be divided into indoor and outdoor space guidelines. Looking into indoor space first, residents’ privacy in their personal space should be protected. General indoor space should be open plan in order to provide urban plaza-like atmosphere. Because the elderly with dementia cognizes small indoor communal space in the facility as neighbourhood environment within a community, indoor space has to be planned in a way to enhance cognitive skills of the elderly with dementia and wandering space should be secured. Furthermore, natural observation should be reinforced in the indoor space design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1420326X11419349">32</xref>]. When planning outdoor environment in dementia elderly housing, outdoor space should be visible from indoor space. If there is an adjoined outdoor space to the facility, it should be utilized without intruding existing space. Placing positive architectural features near the facility can be an effective way to reduce local residents’ negative perception on dementia elderly housing and natural environment should be sufficiently exploited.</p></sec></sec>

<p>Case I</p>
<sec id="sec15-1420326X11419349"><title>Project Statement</title>
<p>An apartment is the dominant housing type in Korea and many of them are facing the regeneration phase, so utilizing space in apartment buildings for all residents is a key to aim towards socially healthy and sustainable community. The housing design proposal target was a rooftop and its design consists of affordable housing with healing garden for the elderly with dementia and community garden for the residents. They are linked and divided naturally and the scheme maximizes benefits for the users with minimum resources. Five elderly with dementia and one manager can live in the house.</p></sec>

Discussions were made about the answers and questions, and if opposing viewpoints were presented, workshop proceeded to facilitate to reach the consensus on the topics ultimately.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec31-1420326X11419349"><title>Opinions about the Future Direction of People with Dementia and Their Environment</title>
<p><list id="list1-1420326X11419349" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Paradigm to enhance the quality of life and understanding for the people with dementia</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Regarding the desirable paradigm in the future, following three questions were presented and the experts opined as follows:
<list id="list1-1420326X11419349" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Experts generally agreed on the fact that people with dementia must be respected properly as people with brain and emotion without having any viewpoint that they are people devoid of certain functions, though they suffer from deficiencies of certain capabilities. This means efforts must be made to sustain their daily life without leaving them carelessly by observing their process of degeneration carefully and protecting them safely.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>All participants agreed positively on the recent viewpoint that ascertains a comprehensive approach combining the medical approach and non-pharmacological approach must be applied to enhance the quality of life of the people with dementia. Particularly, the non-pharmacological method that used to be overlooked in the past has been recognized as an important alternative medicine, which implies the space environment, techniques and technology can be used as non-pharmacological resources and their value as important resources is expected to be improved in the future.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Regarding the desirable alternative to make up for the decreasing service providers while their care need is increasing, following three points were proposed: Firstly, it is necessary to continuously bring up the care providers with professional skills and qualifications, and as their numbers fall short absolutely, even multinational workforces must be accepted. Secondly, though care providers may fall short of the needs, the caring environment must be improved for suitable care services and advanced technologies are required to be introduced to lessen the burden of the care providers or replace the care providers. This means the utilization of space environment as an alternative to the care providers.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p><list id="list1-1420326X11419349" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Opinion on characteristics and scale of residence for the aged people with dementia</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>For this purpose, two questions were presented and the conclusions of discussion are as follows:
<list id="list1-1420326X11419349" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Among the two terms of “facility” and “house,” all experts agreed it is more desirable to approach with a concept of a “house” rather than “facility” and to name the “facility” as “house” apparently. This implies that facility means a temporary residence to serve the people with dementia, while the residence for the people with dementia must be a house that has close relationship with settlement and psychological comfort.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Regarding a large-scale and a small-scale facility, all the experts preferred the small-scaled facility, and they opined that a facility for 7–10 persons per unit would be suitable in Korea, but they said that the accommodation scale per unit can be expanded up to 30 persons as it is stipulated in the criteria of AID. This can be explained that, as for the facility unit, the smaller is the better, but the scale of the public facilities in Korea can be expanded up to accommodate 30 persons per unit considering the various economic situations, factors and the rising number of the people with dementia in Korea, if the facility is well-equipped.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p><list id="list1-1420326X11419349" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Status of nursing and caring facilities in Korea</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Regarding the level and status of nursing and caring facilities in Korea, following two questions were presented:
<list id="list1-1420326X11419349" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Concerning the current environmental status and level of the nursing and caring facilities for the aged people in Korea, all the experts answered the facilities face difficulties or are not in the desirable situations as they expect and the facilities cannot take their environments into consideration presently. The major reasons for these situations were that the facilities accept only the dementia people with the 1st or 2nd degree dementia according to the nursing care insurance and the atmosphere and economic situation of the facilities have become deteriorating more and more. That is, though people deeply recognize the ideal and desirable direction how to care for the people with dementia, the experts said, currently, the caring facilities are being operated and managed in adverse direction in Korea.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In order to improve the environmental situation of the caring facilities for the aged people, first of all, the hardware of facilities and sufficient skilful care providers are very important to run the facilities smoothly and, most of all, what is urgently needed is the necessary fund and economic support. If the economic situation is not improved, fund cannot be invested to improve the environment. Therefore, it is almost impossible to enhance the environment of the facilities without the systematic support of the government. However, though the existing facilities cannot be innovated due to these reasons, a concrete guideline for caring facilities must be introduced and reinforced to prevent these kinds of errors when new facilities are planned to be built.</p></list-item></list></p></sec>
<sec id="sec32-1420326X11419349"><title>Experts’ Response to the Newly Developed Residential Alternatives for the Aged People</title>
<p>This consulting was processed in the form of workshop. The backgrounds about the newly developed residential alternatives for the aged people and their new designs were explained and comprehensive presentations about their implications were made for about 20 min. Then questions were asked to the experts about their opinions concerning the basic concepts of the new models. The conclusions were as follows:
<list id="list1-1420326X11419349" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Older people who need nursing and caring facilities should be integrated into typical apartment units taking into considerations the rapid increase of older population. They added that living altogether naturally would be desirable in the end for the society. However, NIMBY symptom is feared to prevail during the transitive period. On the other hand, according to them, the rapid change in the sense of socio-culture and the breathtaking pace of building apartment units which is the prevalent type of residential structure in Korea could hasten integration of the facilities into apartments.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>All the experts agreed with the proposal to secure space amounting to 5%–10% of the space in the main apartment building as welfare infra so that it can be used flexibly to meet the demands of the society in consultation with residents. They only feared the price of the neighbouring houses could be affected afterwards. But there was assertion that the house price would not depreciate due to the establishment of facilities for older adults in the apartment building as the secured space can be utilized not only for the welfare of the aged but also for other needs of the other residents. The function of the space could be changed with time. And it was discussed that fear of price downing is unfounded as the value of houses neighbouring care facilities might be increased in parallel with changes in the social attitude towards such kind of welfare facilities.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Those experts agreed in principle that the NIMBY syndrome that could appear with the availability of care and service facilities in the residential complex could be solved with systematic and policy measures. Then people for whom welfare benefits are not available will be able to receive care services naturally and they then need not be moved to care facilities when they are struck with dementia, the society will accept the older adults with dementia smoothly.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec33-1420326X11419349" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Apartment reform proposal has been presented to establish a new space infra aimed at vitalizing community needs and meeting needs in the aging society. The space will be a community centre space and would comprise spaces of diverse functions in accordance with changing needs of the society. A model of care has been presented during a workshop; this would provide residence for the older people with serious dementia, which can be housed in the community space. The opinions of field experts were surveyed, on what kind of houses that would be needed for the memory impaired. Experts said wards for the people with dementia are being built now, as outside the residential area people are worried that there might be problems with entering into residential area due to NIMBY syndrome. But the experts generally agreed that the proposal would be the ideal direction Korea should go for.</p>
<p>The three experts, who are pioneers in the care services in Korea, have long engaged in the care service activities for the people with dementia and have many experiences and vision for the future-oriented welfare for the older people. Their responses on the proposed welfare infra in the apartment buildings would mean that dementia care environment could be incorporated into the general residential environment. Such integration would be desirable for the holistic health of the older people. People in the typical care-providing facilities are prone to be waning as their free movement within the facilities are controlled due to shortage of care givers, absolutely poor environment and to meet the safety requirement needed for these types of accommodation. In contrast, the proposal will contribute to promoting physical health of the older people by providing care-giving facilities with environment that are comparable to that of nearby apartment units. From the mental point of view, aging in the home-like environment will help enhance stability of patients. The most important thing is that the nursing and caring facilities for people with dementia should have environment like homes and the smaller size care facilities would be better than the larger ones to treat the aged with dementia as a person with dignity. In the proposed space, the older people with dementia will be better treated in that direction. It is also anticipated that the planned facilities will help improve holistic health of residents as the inpatients can interact with people of diverse backgrounds in the local community. Furthermore, the planned space is to be established on the basic plan of green infra enabling the older people to enjoy a more healthy life surrounded with natural environment.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec34-1420326X11419349" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study was planned to validate usefulness of housing alternatives that have been designed to ease aging crisis, that is lack of appropriate facilities for the fragile aged, and are an innovative way to utilize urban space. Apartments have been used in this model as an innovative mechanism and a focal point is a community space which could enhance local residents’ welfare by adapting diverse functions into the space. One of the housing alternatives proposed has suggested the provision with visuals for the fragile aged who either has dementia or requires intensive care on daily basis. This would provide a socially integrative care environment within the existing community for the fragile aged and by providing small-scaled home-like environment and familiarity that would promote physical, psychological and social health of them, the validity has been proved.</p>
<p>Apartments are the dominant housing type in Korea, which should be part of housing the fragile elderly with dementia effectively. This study has its distinct uniqueness in promoting holistic health of the fragile aged, natural social integration and sustainability of our society by converting negative image of fragile elderly facilities and making them recognized as one of general housing types. In addition to this, employing visuals, rendered perspective views, virtual reality based simulation, which were developed for an accurate communication among small group workshop participants, has actualized the housing alternatives’ concept. Further studies on a wider range professionals working in elderly facilities and family members of the fragile aged would be necessary in order to reconfirm and drawing positive national response out on these housing alternative models.</p></sec>
