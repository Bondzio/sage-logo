<p>March 1987</p>
<p>The first WES editorial provided both an intellectual map and a manifesto for the journal. It had three purposes: to justify itself, to signal its scope, to state its mission. The first was easy; the sheer weight of interest and research on work and employment required a separate journal. As for the second, the journal was to both reflect and shape a new research agenda. Brown wanted research beyond the three Ms – male, manual manufacturing workers – and wanted it to be multi-disciplinary – though still speaking to sociologists – and also international and comparative. As for the third, its mission, WES was to be ‘an essential source and point of reference for all those working on work’ (p. 6) – academics, practitioners and policy-makers. Twenty-five years on, the need for WES is as great as ever, particularly as a counter to claims of the ‘death of work’. Many of the topics Brown signalled as important still resonate: flexibility, low pay, unemployment, home-based work, gender and race discrimination for example – though WES has also provided a platform for new concepts, ideas and developments. It has also become one of the world’s leading journals in the field for academics. It still needs to reach out better to practitioners and policy-makers but maybe that task is for the next 25 years.</p>

<p><italic>Work, Employment and Society</italic> 1(1): 25–55</p>
<p>March 1987</p>
<p>It is difficult to overstate the importance of Hyman’s seminal article in, appropriately, the first issue. Elucidating the contemporaneously popular notion of business strategy, Hyman confronted the paradox of strategic choice; how to reconcile management’s latitude in decision-making with apparently deterministic economic forces. Emphasizing the Marxist concept of contradiction – between forces and relations of production and the production and realization of surplus value – strategy was best conceptualized as ‘the programmatic choice among alternatives none of which can be satisfactory’. In our era of irresolvable economic crisis, Hyman’s analysis of managerial strategy and labour control may yet deliver its most enduring insight.</p>

<p><italic>Work, Employment and Society</italic> 1(3): 281–308</p>
<p>September 1987</p>
<p>In this article, Streeck both summarizes and anticipates debates about the implications of changing employer strategies for industrial relations. Authors have cited (and continue to cite) the article in a variety of ways, ranging from general reflections on the new strategic problems that employers face as they respond to volatile market conditions, to more specific points about uncertainties underlying the choice between ‘internal vs external’ forms of organizational flexibility. The distinction that Streeck draws between status and contract has endured as a way of describing changes in the employment relationship that occur as employers seek to overcome organizational or labour market rigidities – gaining higher flexibility based on ‘return to contract’ or through ‘extension of status’. These insights continue to be relevant in the current period of economic volatility, as many of the status guarantees that workers in countries like Germany have long enjoyed come under threat.</p>

<p><italic>Work, Employment and Society</italic> 2(1): 71–87</p>
<p>March 1988</p>
<p>‘Which is the best WES article you ever read?’ An exacting challenge since every volume contains many good articles that may lose resonance over time. Michael McGuire’s article on the reproduction of sectarian employment relations in the north of Ireland was and remains compelling. The article still retains a remarkable freshness because in bringing together a range of otherwise separate traditions – the sociology of spatial relations, work and employment, political sociology – it extended the critique on the enduring peculiarities of the north of Ireland but for a wider (not only) academic audience. Rather than allowing the debate on sectarianism to remain at the level of ideology and political strategy, Michael Maguire’s article continued the critical tradition established by the path breaking work of the Belfast Bulletin group and O’Dowd, Rolston and Tomlinson (<italic>Northern Ireland, Between Civil Rights and Civil War</italic>) in the 1980s. His article shed yet more light on the ways in which the preferences of local ‘sectarian’ capital recreate class, gender and status divisions that are also quite readily sustained by female and male factory workers and their trade union. More than an attitude of mind, the article exposes the utterly bizarre yet seeming normality of the structural character of sectarianism. It constitutes a pattern of living and labour subordination extending beyond place and custom into every corner of material life in the north of Ireland. It is difficult to think of another academic journal article at the time demonstrating the natural, social rootedness of the north’s sectarian political economy.</p>

<p><italic>Work, Employment and Society</italic> 3(1): 89–104</p>
<p>March 1989</p>
<p>I first read Streeck’s seminal article as an MA student and have read it many times since. He presents a cogent critique of the self defeating imperatives of supply-side economics. High skills are seen as necessary to sustain high wage economies, but cannot be produced by free markets as they are a collective resource. The dilemma is that, while employers may not regard skills investment as rational, the skills needed for the future can only be produced at the workplace. His conclusion that regulation is needed through social democratic politics and strong trade unions remains more salient today than ever.</p>

<p><italic>Work, Employment and Society</italic> 3(3): 307–22</p>
<p>September 1989</p>
<p>In common with many other contributors to this section my choice of a favourite WES article is one that I read as a PhD student. Armstrong’s fearless analysis is always a delight and here he tackles that most fraught of topics, managerial work. He challenges the idea that management can be a labour process since this simply reduces the term to a synonym for work and instead reinstates class into the analysis, arguing that management is itself an agency relationship and that managerial work cannot be abstracted from this relationship so task-based models will always be open to challenge. Employers and senior managers are dependent on trust, but trust is expensive so there are also incentives to deskill and control managerial work. It is a perceptive piece which captures and explains many of the contradictions that beset the study of managers and managerial work. Beautifully written, cogently argued, stimulating and challenging. An exemplary article.</p>

<p><italic>Work, Employment and Society</italic> 4(2): 157–88</p>
<p>June 1990</p>
<p>The model of the flexible firm proposed by John Atkinson in the 1980s was an exciting conception that brought together ideas from labour market segmentation and organization theory to highlight current trends in the labour market. So I eagerly read Catherine Hakim’s analysis and critique of this notion when it was published in 1990 in WES. Her probing conceptual and empirical analysis identified points of tension and controversy surrounding this idea, opening up new avenues of research on labour market segmentation from the perspectives of labour law, industrial relations, organizational strategy, economics and sociology.</p>

<p><italic>Work, Employment and Society</italic> 5(1): 1–16</p>
<p>March 1991</p>
<p>This innovative article was the first to probe the ways in which managers in the burgeoning service sector incorporated customers and their feedback on the quality of service into the employment relationship. Fuller and Smith built on earlier work that highlighted the distinctive features of interactive service work, as opposed to manufacturing, with which sociologists had long been disproportionately obsessed. In the context of the triangular relationships among employers, workers and customers or clients, the article exposed the ways in which managers in the service sector, who are forced to offer their employees considerable discretion if service is to be effectively delivered to customers, manage to exploit those customers to secure control over the labour process. Twenty years later, this insight has become part of our conventional wisdom, but at the time it was a path breaking contribution.</p>

<p><italic>Work, Employment and Society</italic> 5(3): 319–51</p>
<p>September 1991</p>
<p>Reading Duncan Gallie’s <italic>In Search of the New Working Class</italic> was a pivotal point in my education. At the time my reading of choice was Marxist state theory, a literature so rarefied the empirical world looked like a distant blue globe in a void of speculation. Gallie’s book led to an empiricist’s epiphany and I decided I wanted to be a researcher. I have remained a fan since and this article exemplifies what I like about his work. It deals with a big subject in economic sociology – the trend in skills – extracts the essential propositions from competing theories and uses a carefully designed survey to reject, support and reconcile these various positions. The article is also written in crystal-clear prose so that anyone can follow the line of argument. Gallie’s work is not fashionable – rarefied writing is still in vogue – but it has got real class.</p>

<p><italic>Work, Employment and Society</italic> 6(1): 113–26</p>
<p>March 1992</p>
<p>I first read this article during my MA in sociology at Leeds. This early Notes and Issues piece certainly fuelled my interests in welfare states and social inequalities. Bagguley and Mann tackle journalistic and scholarly representations of the underclass colourfully, with flare but also with care and precision. Re-reading the article 20 years later is sobering in terms of connections with current political, social and economic concerns: youth unemployment, urban riots, welfare state dependency, inequality, poverty and blame. Even Rupert Murdoch and the News International Group are in the mix. Bagguley and Mann forcefully argue that the underclass concept ‘serves to conceal causal factors rather than reveal them’ and is founded on ‘a demonstrably false set of beliefs’ obscuring ‘the real problems of poverty and the real state welfare dependency of the wealthy’. Someone send this article to David Cameron.</p>

<p><italic>Work, Employment and Society</italic> 6(1): 65–86</p>
<p>March 1992</p>
<p>By the early 1990s feminists and social scientists had realized that the equality hoped for when sex discrimination was outlawed in the 1970s would not be delivered through legislation alone. Instead progress was found to depend more on the organization of society, in the form of the welfare state and the structure of labour markets, including public sector employment. Gillian Whitehouse’s article ranks among the classic contributions to this emerging debate; her work demonstrated the superiority of the collective over the individual legislative approach and pointed to the wide country variations in the adoption of these collective measures. That these influences on gender equality are now considered commonplace is but a tribute to the importance of this work. It is very timely to revisit these findings as we struggle to defend the welfare state or even the legitimacy of public services employment in this age of austerity.</p>

<p><italic>Work, Employment and Society</italic> 6(2): 161–83</p>
<p>June 1992</p>
<p>This article dates from the early 1990s and offers an insightful prediction of the now established mantra among UK policy-makers that raising skill levels is the solution to poor economic performance. Cutler argued that as trade union power had declined, the ‘British worker problem’ was being replaced by the narrative of the ‘British training problem’. Drawing upon Theo Nichol’s rigorous dismantling of the evidence on the link between unions and poor productivity, Cutler provides an excellent critique of the widely cited NIESR matched plant studies. The conclusion is particularly important as he identifies the ideological and political developments which preclude ‘intervention against the market’, leaving education and training as one of the few acceptable policy options.</p>

<p>June 1992</p>
<p>I read this article during the first year of my PhD. It is fair to say that it had a profound effect on my doctoral thesis and beyond! Amidst burgeoning, often uncritical literatures on the flexible firm, flexible specialization and HRM, this article clearly demonstrated the tensions and contradictions in employers’ strategies and debunked received wisdom about the virtues of flexibility. Going beyond simplistic notions of flexibility as ‘good’ and rigidity as ‘bad’, the article was one of the first to focus in depth on the experiences of temporary workers, something which inspired me to focus on this group of workers in my own research. The article has stood the test of time - 20 years on, I cannot think of a better piece for demonstrating the limits and contradictions of HRM.</p>

<p>In this 1993 article, Pfau-Effinger analyses two countries with very different rates of female part-time employment: Finland and West Germany. My own doctoral thesis, which began a year later (1994), looked at women’s part-time employment in two countries with very similar (though diverging) rates: Britain and Denmark. Rather than focus only upon familiar explanations that stressed e.g. variation in state policies and in flexibilization as causal factors shaping gendered work time, Pfau-Effinger argued that we also need to analyse cultural norms and values. She raised key questions about change and continuity in the gender contract, about what is ‘appropriate’ gendered work and whether and why this varies cross-nationally.</p>

<p>June 1996</p>
<p>My favourite WES article reflects an important moment in the development of research on women’s employment. Three strands of interest that were consolidating over the 1990s are braided together. First, attention to the flow of experience within individual lifetimes is recognized as a way to capture the complexity of how women negotiate their multiple work demands. Second, a sophisticated methodological approach to identifying change over time is used to illuminate historical shifts in the impact of childbearing on women’s employment. Third, there is attention to variations within women’s experiences and the recognition that these variations have significant meaning for policy, politics and the sociological understanding of women and work. What more could one ask for?</p>

<p>A succinct example of good critical social science, this article addresses an important question: ‘Does safety pay?’ It provides a critique of the shortcomings of an HSE research report, <italic>The Costs of Accidents at Work</italic>, and a case study of the capsizing of the aptly named Herald of Free Enterprise ferry at Zeebrugge in 1987. The logic of the HSE report suggested that enforcement activities would be virtually redundant since it is in the financial interests of employers to pursue safety – an idea unfortunately that continues to inform health and safety policy in the current age of self regulation.</p>

<p>September 1997</p>
<p>I decided to ease the task by looking only at the three years (1996–8) when I was WES editor. Still spoilt for choice, I went for Rosenthal, Hill and Peccei. This article investigates the impact of quality initiatives on workers’ work experience. It stands out for several reasons. It was one of the first studies to move beyond an empowerment <italic>or</italic> degradation view by spelling out the subtle ways in which initiatives work and revealing the balance of gains and losses for workers. It is empirically sophisticated, combining a case study analysis of one firm with surveys at two points in time of worker opinion in that firm. One can see how in both these respects later work built on the contribution, for example in developing more exact analyses of autonomy and commitment. And, while stressing some of the positive aspects of quality programmes, it was intensely aware of their limits (they neither do, nor pretend to secure wider employee commitment to an entire managerial discourse) and of the fact that this case may not be typical (the article details four conditions on which success rested). It is a model of the careful sociological linking of theory and evidence and of how to present a clear but subtle analysis.</p>

<p><italic>Work, Employment and Society</italic> 13(3): 525–38</p>
<p>September 1999</p>
<p>My favourite WES piece is Thornley and Coffey (1999). Their example of how the initial national minimum wage (NMW) level in the UK was influenced by the Government’s role as the country’s major employer is revelatory. They identified that for each penny above the rate that the NMW was eventually set, the number of low paid public employees – mostly women – who would have benefited, would rise exponentially. The initial rate therefore excluded many of the state’s own low paid employees. These findings provide an important insight into the overlapping roles of the state as employer, legislator and paymaster. Much of my own research in the public sector has since been inspired by this article.</p>

<p><italic>Work, Employment and Society</italic> 16(3): 497–510</p>
<p>September 2002</p>
<p>The concept of ‘body work’ is so obvious; it should already have been part of the sociology of work. But are not all great ideas obvious once they have been explained? This article is where Carol Wolkowitz first outlined the manifold ways that paying workers to work on other people’s bodies (‘body work’) complicates the employment relationship and shapes ideas about and experiences of embodiment. Carol deploys a wide sociological lens, exploring occupational power, workplace conflict and classed, raced and gendered divisions of labour, while highlighting the body’s materiality, pacification and objectification. The article is historical and theoretical. There is no resolution, there are no neat analytic boxes, but there is enormous intellectual stimulation.</p>

<p><italic>Work, Employment and Society</italic> 17(2): 289–308</p>
<p>June 2003</p>
<p>When I was asked to think of my favourite WES article, the one that immediately sprang to mind was Bolton and Boyd’s ‘Trolley Dolly or skilled emotion manager? Moving on from Hochschild’s <italic>Managed Heart</italic>.’ This piece had made a big impression on me when I was working on my dissertation and I was no less impressed upon re-reading it. The article makes at least three significant contributions to the sociology of work in general and interactive work in particular. First, it is one of the first pieces that challenges scholars to transcend dichotomous formulations associated with the concept of emotional labour, including public/private, commercial/uncommodified and authentic/inauthentic. Second, the authors go beyond a simple critique of these formulations to offer a typology of four kinds of emotion management, which emerges from the accounts of flight attendants themselves. Finally, their analysis highlights the complexity of workers’ emotional lives; workers experience multiple emotional modes at once, which are influenced but not determined by organizational imperatives. Overall, the article is an important example of systematic analysis of the multiple aspects of worker experience, based in solid empirical evidence, which transcends the binaries that have often marked the sociology of work.</p>

<p><italic>Work, Employment and Society</italic> 27(2): 359–78</p>
<p>June 2003</p>
<p>Implicit and explicit bargains between employers and employees are essential in managing employment effectively. In this article, Thompson evaluates why the financialization of capitalism makes it increasingly difficult for employers to honour those bargains. In later articles, he develops points about why this makes the core tenets of HRM so problematic. Here, the objective is to turn our attention to the ‘big picture’ and evaluate the ways in which changes in capitalism have influenced work and employment. It is a provocative and wide-ranging contribution to those debates and is undoubtedly worth engaging with for both research and teaching.</p>

<p><italic>Work, Employment and Society</italic> 20(4): 629–47</p>
<p>December 2006</p>
<p>Having researched low paid public sector workers myself, I have been struck by the commitment that many have to ‘the public good’: cleaners who take their own cleaning materials in to work because those provided by their employer are not good enough; workers who go ‘beyond contract’ to make sure their clients’ needs are met; and care workers who tell you, ‘To do what I do is wonderful.’ In this article, McDonough draws on Bourdieu’s concept of habitus to explore the continuing salience of a vision of the public good among public service workers, in a context in which the material conditions which support this vision have been undermined. It analyses how workers defend their altruistic vision of public service against market rationales, often at a cost to their own health and well-being. Her analysis points to the way in which this vision can also form a source of employee resistance and mobilization. The article focuses on municipal workers, but the analysis has wider significance for contested definitions of public good in the restructuring of public services.</p>

<p><italic>Work, Employment and Society</italic> 21(2): 299–316</p>
<p>June 2007</p>
<p>Watts’s article is based on interviews with women professionals working in the UK construction industry, a field notorious for sexual harassment and ‘laddish’ work cultures. Her interviewees talk of ‘dread[ing] going to work….’ and the culture being ‘appalling’, yet they also speak with glowing pride about the outcomes and processes of their work: ‘it means everything to me….’; ‘it’s beautiful, really beautiful, and I was part of it.…’ It vividly shows how sociology of work can illuminate an enduring paradox that exists in many occupations – the paradox of work as both intolerable and hugely rewarding.</p>

<p><italic>Work, Employment and Society</italic> 23(1): 160–68</p>
<p>March 2009</p>
<p>This hard-hitting On the Front Line article privileges the testimony of a production worker from ICL Plastics, the negligent Glasgow firm whose flawed safety regime led to a 2004 disaster. Connelly describes suffocating fumes from barrels of toxic degreaser, the factory cat that ‘fell to bits’ from prolonged exposure to harsh chemicals and workers having tea on tables coated with a moss of poisonous dust. Uninterrupted by the usual scholarly interjections, the piece revives a rich vein of ethnographic practice, simultaneously engaging and transforming workers as they make sense of – and act upon – the social world around them.</p>

<p><italic>Work, Employment and Society</italic> 23(1): 169–80</p>
<p>March 2009</p>
<p>There is a lively debate about whether occupational structures are unilaterally up- or down-skilling. The hourglass economy brings these two theories together by assuming that jobs are polarizing at the higher and lower ranks of the occupational hierarchy. Pauline Anderson analyses the development of the neglected intermediate occupations in the UK between 1984 and 2004. Her surprising result is the relative stability of the size of intermediate occupations, which is completely overlooked in the skill debate. Most theories on skill development seem to rest on weak foundations. Her article has far-reaching consequences for educational policies, which mostly are built on the upskilling or hourglass theories.</p>
