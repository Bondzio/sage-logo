<p>For readily understandable reasons, Muslim political thought and the workings of polities classified as ‘Islamic’ have attracted much attention in the past two decades, and most particularly after 11 September 2001. Much of this interest has been driven and guided by the parameters of immediate political interests, and much of it has been unable or unwilling to escape the constraints of such interests or popular moods and prejudices, including the moods and interests of apologists of political Islam. Yet some academic work has attempted to go beyond these constraints and to identify and treat pertinent matters in a manner that is deliberately well considered and firmly anchored in historical research. The significant collection of essays under review is one such attempt.</p>
<p>Perhaps inevitably, the essays collected in this book are uneven. Many, also perhaps inevitably, are constrained by the paradigmatic limitations of Islamic Studies as practised in universities overall, including a certain persistent reluctance deliberately and systematically to conceptualise the topics and themes chosen for study in general terms. These limitations are well represented by the editors’ Introduction. While calling, however vaguely but quite correctly, for the greater analytical ‘depth’ of a ‘universalistic’ approach to the study of courts designated as Islamic, the editors find themselves quite captive to the implicit and explicit conceptual commonplaces of the Islamic Studies institution.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not entirely clear if the ‘culturally different’ contexts they appeal to are meant to comprise every separate courtly instance studied by the various contributors, or if this is meant otherwise to describe a generic courtly type, or ideal type, characterising Muslim courts in general. On balance, it is more likely that it is the latter that is intended, with the implicit assumption that these courts are in some way to be differentiated from others—however categorised—by a number of distinctive features they share exclusively.</p>
<p>This is of course difficult to sustain; to include the early Arab empire of the Umayyads and the Khedival court in nineteenth-century Cairo under the same rubric yields more problems than it solves. Still, it does seem that an implicit assumption of cultural distinction is the motive force behind the category of ‘Islamic courts’ which, considering the Umayyads and the Khedives in tandem, yields all manner of incongruities and implausibilities that would call into question the very idea of ‘Islamic categories’ as a category of interpretation. This would, in turn, invite reflection upon the conceptual wherewithal, upon the requisite level of generality to be adopted, on more generic socio-historical and historical–anthropological issues and literatures connected with questions of patronage, the internal operation of courtly polity and its social settings, rituals of royalty, and much else. All these topics are taken up in the contributions to this volume, in various ways and with varying degrees of deliberation and reflection.</p>
<p>And while some of the contributions do solicit comparative historical materials from different (mostly European) historical moments, none refers to, or seems well versed in pertinent historico-sociological and anthropological literature, or in scholarship that has considered what, for the sake of argument here, might be referred to as Muslim polities in terms of more general considerations arising from the literature indicated. It seems little appreciated by the editors and some authors of this volume that there might be more to comparativism than cataloguing similarities, and that this would need to involve the consideration of specific sets of thematic data in terms other than those of the data themselves, and in terms of higher-order, mid-level concepts.</p>
<p>Quite pertinently, the editors pose the question as to whether there might be some specifically Islamic ‘context’ (a vague term, often an escape clause) for Islamic court cultures. Their answer is in the affirmative, and it is here that the theologico-centric approach of the Islamic Studies paradigm and its stress on an initial Arabian condition as an explanatory grid becomes quite palpable. They speak of a ‘tension’ between ideals and realities as a structuring element. Of course, such a tension is a phenomenon ubiquitous to the degree of banality; more interesting and more pertinent are the ways in which, and the conditions under which, appeal to ideals is made, rather than the assumption that the ideal is constituted, as an initial condition and once and for all, outside of time and indeed before it, and that subsequent history is a series of accommodations. Unsurprisingly, the most interesting and productive essays in this collection are those which are not constrained by such an assumption of tension, and that hardly address the question which, in my view, is spurious and produces false research questions. The least interesting are those that take this assumption seriously as an interpretative and analytical grid.</p>
<p>Two last comments are in order before proceeding further. First, the editors identify ‘normative expectations’ with the Koran. The idea that legitimation starts with the Koran, according to which ideas and institutions are parsed and to which they are accommodated, does not bear historical scrutiny, not least because appeal to the Koranic text varied historically, and the hermeneutical techniques of such appeal are broad and cannot be summarily stated. It might well be remembered that soliciting a political theory, including ‘legitimation’ of courtly institutes, from the Koran would have seemed incongruous to classical Muslims; the first deliberately political reading of the Koran goes back only to the middle of the twentieth century, in the Protestant fundamentalist spirit of Sayyid Qutb. Further, legitimation of rule obeyed its own complex rules and patterns, all of them of quite universal incidence, to which appeal to the Koran was supplementary. The underlying assumption that the central legitimators of court were members of the religious institution is historically untenable.</p>
<p>The theme of ‘legitimation’ is used vaguely and with little regard to sociological discussions following Weber, and more recent discussions in political theory. Legitimation of Umayyad and Abbasid rule for instance, the term being used for the sake of convenience, would on deliberate scrutiny appear to be a matter far more involved than orchestrating a concord between ideals and realities. It was not a coherent package, but rather a cluster of ideological motifs and arguments expressed in a variety of literary genres no less than in its architectural projections and in palatine ceremonial and other practices as they evolved. Each was appropriate to particular times, places, occasions and constituencies. Among these one might mention legitimation in terms of sacral kingship and oecumenical monarchy, of dynastic and Arab geneaological arguments, of succession to Muhammad in terms of kinship no less than in his capacities as the founding hero of a polity and as prophet. In all these, Koranic citations were used in different ways among other arguments, but is not the fount of legitimation, let alone being its principal instrument and argument. That which constituted ‘Islamic’ arguments varied enormously, and the statement that matters Islamic were a garb in which un-Islamic, Byzantine or Sasanian institutes were clothed merely begs the question.</p>
<p>The second point to be raised here is that of the other ‘tension’ between the ‘nomadic origins of the Muslim community’ and urban Muslim culture, an issue taken up by one of the essays in terms of tension between palace and tent. This is of course redolent of the commonplace image of the Arab conquerors as a swarm of bedouins breaking out with sword in one hand and a book in the other. It might simply be remembered that those who built this ‘community’ expressed an evident hostility to nomadism and to nomads, all of them congenital antinomian miscreants, according to this view. There are resonances and symbolic appeals that go beyond the appeal to distant origins in the use of tents by Seljuqs or by Qadhdhafi, for instance: all specific to time and place, all appealing to specific constituencies rather than items of a more general, trans-historical anxiety. Rather than being in tension, they seem to co-exist happily as coordinate and sometimes co-extensive projections of power and authority. Seljuq sovereigns were both sultans and Turkic warlords; Tughrul Beg wore a sheepskin, but also wished to marry into the Caliphal family. A similar situation obtained with many Germanic chiefs in the late Roman empire.</p>
<p>The book treats of court cultures regarded by the editors as Islamic according to the views sketched above, and constituting at once an Islamic instance of courts and courts that are specifically Islamic. The essays here collected range in time from Muhammad to the nineteenth century and in space from Spain to India. Strangely, there is only one study of matters Ottoman, of favouritism in the Ottoman court in the eighteenth century (by H. Sievert, really an inconclusive narrative account of one episode), although studies of the Ottoman court are, both empirically and conceptually, well in advance of studies of other areas covered in this book.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, the book is divided into two broad sections, one entitled Politics arranged chronologically and the other Patronage, arranged thematically. In the first article of the book, Cook broaches the question of whether Muhammad kept court, but the compass he uses to disengage what might be established historically (whatever utility this might have) and what was later retrojected is all too brief. Heidemann and Kennedy take up themes at once relevant and tangential to the issue of courts, respectively the representation of the Umayyad state on coin imagery and elite lifestyles in the late Byzantine and Sasanian periods (including resources of the early Arab aristocracy). Both are very interesting in themselves, but the themes remain auxiliary to court cultures and little attempt is made to work out relevant relations between courts and their wider bearings considered.</p>
<p>El Cheikh considers Abbasid courtly terminology, but with little attempt to go beyond the abstract vocabularies and discuss actual arrangements in place. She concludes that the court was not so much a formal institution as a domain for a ‘politics of intimacy’, an apt term that still requires a treatment in terms of political sociology and a proper consideration of the concept and the workings of the ‘household’ in relation to the social operations of power. It is indeed true that the political sociology of this, as of many other periods, is one that is still in its beginnings, but stopping there, and commencing and ending with expressions of vexation is not particularly helpful for the further development of the field, not least as material is available, and is well used by Walker in his essay on the courtly milieu of the Fatimids in Cairo. For his part, Korn (on art and architecture in the Artuqid court) brings in interesting material and concludes that the crucial issue is the household, without treating this central concept in a manner that is consequential analytically, despite the fact that the notion and the term have been studied extensively in a variety of social histories, including that of the Mamluks.</p>
<p>Müller’s study of non-qadi jurisdiction in tenth-century Cordoba treats this, quite rightly, as an instance of the diversification of the Umayyad state apparatus between the eighth and eleventh centuries. Nevertheless, had the author not bound himself to the notion that this <italic>mazalim</italic> jurisdiction was in some way extraordinary, and the collateral theologico-centric assumption that the qadi courts must be seen as the principal form of jurisdiction, he would have been able to flesh out the way in which the judicial system actually worked, with material on the underlying socio-legal structure, the pattern according to which circumstances, particular types of cases, were allocated to this or that system, and indeed the relationships between the two and between them and social types of jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Closely related to this cluster of themes is Fuess’ contribution on forms of politico-legal representation in Mamluk Cairo, with much interesting material that the author struggled to interpret in terms of the overarching theme of this book. The essays by Gilly-Ellewy (on central and local courts in Mongol Baghdad), Newman (on subalterns and the Safavid court), Reinfandt (on welfare administration under the Mamluks) and Hartung (on the patronage of religious scholars in pre-modern and early modern times) contain interesting material, but are too bound up with the material itself to allow for general conclusions or for proper conceptualisation. The essay by von Hees on political advice literature is really a synopsis of part of a book by Ibn Nubata and reaches the fairly obvious and circular conclusion that the purpose of advice literature is to advise and legitimate (whatever this might mean), and to establish a relationship of patronage between author and patron. Again, much comparative material is available and might have sharpened perspectives and opened fresh ones.</p>
<p>Of greater pertinence for thoughts in the field are the contributions of Kumar (on the Delhi sultanate in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries), Orthmann (on court culture and cosmology in the Mughal court) and Werner (on taming tribal politics in the court of Shiraz in the eighteenth century). Although in an excellent article Kumar seems to subscribe to the commonplace that there is such a thing as an ‘Islamic paradigm’ of the sovereignty of God, he does work from actual practice, thereby rendering this paradigm irrelevant, despite the best efforts of court chroniclers. Orthmann’s essay takes up, exemplarily and most illuminatingly, the development of the <italic>din-i ilahi</italic> in terms most apposite for the study of courtly ideology and its associated forms of ceremonial and architectural projections that deliver promises going much beyond commonplace assumptions. In his turn, Werner, despite mention of the ‘dichotomy’ between palace and camp and begging the question of what it is that constitutes an ‘Islamic’ court, discusses the nature and function of the court, these being politics by means of civilising and corrupting courtiers, and does so illuminatingly, again rendering commonplaces redundant. One should mention here Brentje’s essay on Ayyubid princes and their patronage of non-religious cultural goods, which opens up perspectives of historical research that should redress the balance of historical reality by showing that the primacy generally assumed for religious culture is very highly questionable.</p>
<p>Other contributors to this volume who dealt with matters relating to art and architecture offer studies that are better than most. Writing in copious but well-measured detail on the splendid mid nineteenth-century illustrations of the <italic>Thousand and One Nights</italic> by Sani al-Mulk, commissioned by the Qajar Nasir al-Din Shah, Amanat considers courtly patronage and its social locations under conditions of rapid change in social relations, artistic tastes and technical capacity, to all of which the author is very alert and highly sensitive. Neither does the author have any need to deploy ‘cultural difference’, based on religion, as a principle of classification, being more interested in the way that segments of culture dealt with change, and change significantly. This is clearly a major study which, again, proceeds analytically without feeling the need to have recourse to commonplaces about what it is that constitutes an ‘Islamic’ court as an analytical template and as a grid for setting questions of research. In certain ways, the themes here treated are consonant with those taken up by Konrad in his essay on the Khedival court. Keshani’s essay on architecture and courtly culture in Awadh treats its topic in terms of forms of political practice and performance aiming at integrating elite domestic environs with those of court, without needing to read theology into buildings, and the results are most suggestive.</p>
<p>In all, there are some pathbreaking contributions to this volume, ones that suggest possibilities for the cumulative analytical understanding of courtly cultures in terms that allow conclusions of a general nature, and that invite comparative study properly considered. In contrast, one might safely say that any specificity that might be ascribed to ‘Islamic’ courts are far less persuasive, and that Muslim court cultures as a historical category and historical topic does not emerge. It is curiously noteworthy that it appears from this volume that works on courts in Arab lands are far more encumbered by commonplaces than those treating of Iran or of India, and that work of art-historical nature is generally much in advance conceptually than work based on literary sources. This suggests differential disciplinary developments and disjunctions, different ways of reading, and also suggests that those scholars with a primarily philological training are generally less attentive to developments in the social and human sciences overall than scholars otherwise trained, including scholars who come from History.</p>
<p>We have in the unevenness of this volume an eloquent case in point of both the limitations and possibilities of studies of the histories of ‘Islamic’ polities, and an equally eloquent case for the need to disencumber ourselves of the baggage of commonplaces that generally comes with unreflective training in Islamic Studies. A principal one among these is ‘culture’, ‘Islamic culture’ in this case, as an anachronistic meta-historical tool of analysis which clouds the understanding and produces fantasmatic categories of historical research and false research questions in cognitive dissonance with the realities of history.</p>
<p>Scholars working on courtly and other socio-political arrangements that are, for disciplinary and other conveniences, termed Islamic might wish to consider amelioration by looking at neighbouring fields. Rather than considering comparativism as an occasional register of vicarious similarities, or poaching this historical instance or that as an adjunct to the case under study, they might cast a somewhat more deliberative glance at, say, the conceptually more developed studies of Byzantine or Latin courts. They will find that historians have, for long, stopped postulating bald disjunctions between ideals and realities, and commenced analytically with the construal or putative scripturalist norms and are deriving causal grids from them. Some of the contributors to this book are indeed, as indicated, beyond this institutional habitus, one which is no longer taken seriously or regarded creditably in the historical profession overall.</p>
