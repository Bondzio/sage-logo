<abstract>
<p>In this article, a new three-dimensional finite element modeling approach with less computing time and space is introduced to study the buckling behavior of sandwich panels, containing a face–core debond. The finite element model presented in this study relates the motion of the face sheets to the core through constraint equations utilizing the concept of slave and master nodes, thus representing a more realistic model of the sandwich panel. The composite face sheets are modeled with shell elements, and the core is modeled using the 3D structural solid elements capable of taking transverse flexibility into consideration. In order to model the debond, the constraints between the nodes of the face sheet and the core are removed and replaced with contact elements in the debonded region to avoid interpenetration. The model is validated through comparison with experimental results reported in the literature. The validated model is then used to study the effects of the size, shape, aspect ratio of the debond, as well as fiber orientation of the face sheets and the influence of core stiffness on the buckling load of the panel subject to different boundary conditions on the top and bottom face sheets of the panel.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311410495" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>A sandwich panel is a highly optimized mechanical structure that is made up of two face sheets of strong and stiff materials separated by a lightweight core. Due to their high stiffnesses resulting from their face sheets and low specific weight thanks to the core, sandwich panels are extensively used in automotive, aerospace, and navy industries to mention only a few. Because of the large dissimilarities in the properties of the core and face sheets, sandwich panels are prone to a wide variety of defects and failures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311410495">1</xref></sup> Damage and defects in fiber-reinforced polymer sandwich structures can be categorized into two main classes, namely production defects and in-service damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311410495">2</xref></sup> One of the most important defects in a sandwich structure is the local separation between the face and the core, also known as face–core debonding. Debonding in sandwich structures is a concept similar to delamination in laminated composites. Debonds in sandwich structures, however, most frequently occur between two extremely dissimilar materials, i.e., between the core and the face sheets rather than between two similar plies of the face sheet laminate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311410495">3</xref></sup> Debonds in a sandwich panel can be as a result of either manufacturing flaws or in-service loads. Loading a debonded sandwich panel in compression may cause the face sheet in the debonded region to buckle, which can result in the propagation of the debond and thus leading to the collapse of the structure.</p>
<p>In spite of these findings, the imperfect composite sandwich plates, in fact, can still be capable of resisting increased compressive edge loads well beyond the instant at which initial buckling occurs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311410495">4</xref></sup> Therefore, a clear understanding of the post-buckling behavior for the debonded plates is of extreme importance, especially in designing and maintaining composite sandwich structures. The problem of buckling and post-buckling of delaminated composite laminates has been addressed by many researchers. Barbero and Reddy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311410495">5</xref></sup> extended the layer-wise laminate theory of Reddy to study multiple delamination between the layers of a composite laminate and included geometric non-linearities to study buckling. Kim<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311410495">6</xref></sup> presented a finite element model to study the post-buckling behavior of composite laminates with an embedded delamination by a two-dimensional (2D) theory. A finite element model based on the efficient higher order zigzag theory with multiple delaminations was developed by Kim and Cho<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311410495">7</xref></sup> in which the bending part of the formulation is constructed from the concept of discrete Kirchoff quadrilateral element to circumvent the requirement of C1 continuity. Tafreshi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311410495">8</xref></sup> developed a finite element model in ABAQUS to study the global, local, and mixed modes of buckling behavior of composite plates with embedded delaminations in which the laminate is split up into two sub-laminates in the delaminated region. Zhang and Wang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311410495">9</xref></sup> presented a new mechanical and computational model for bucking, post-buckling, and delamination propagations in debonded composite laminates based on the layer-wise theory of Reddy, where the possible displacement jumps across delamination interfaces were taken into account in the assumed displacement field with step function supplements, and the geometric nonlinearity was included through the use of von Karman's nonlinear strain–displacement relationships. However, since this model is based on Reddy's layer-wise theory which neglects the transverse normal strains and transverse flexibility of the plate and uses only one displacement field for all the layers, it fails to yield acceptable accuracy in dealing with soft and flexible materials such as foam cores in sandwich structures, especially when the debond is between the two layers of dissimilar materials (the soft core and hard face sheet). In addition, the above-mentioned models including Zhang and Wang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311410495">9</xref></sup> are based on plate theories and are therefore not applicable to sandwich structures because of the relatively large thickness of the core as well as dissimilar materials of the core and the face sheets. That is why, studying the response of debonded sandwich panels to buckling loads calls for more rigorous approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410495">10</xref></sup> The buckling of sandwich structures with face–core debonds has been studied both analytically and experimentally. Most of the analytical works have analyzed debonded sandwich columns such as those conducted by Cheng et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311410495">11</xref></sup> and Veedu and Carlson.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311410495">12</xref></sup> In reality, debonds in sandwich structures are most commonly found embedded in large panels in 2D forms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311410495">3</xref></sup> Frostig<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410495">10</xref></sup> studied the buckling behavior of a soft core sandwich panel without and with debond using a higher order theory formulation which considered nonlinear distortions of the cross-section of the core as well as changes in its height. Mahfuz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311410495">13</xref></sup> developed a finite element model in ANSYS to study the effect of core–skin debonding and core density on the buckling of sandwich panels. They also conducted tests with various foam densities and with implanted debonds between the core and the face sheets. Although their finite element model yielded acceptable results for sandwich panels without debond, the buckling load for the debonded sandwich panel was much lower than what was found experimentally. Later, Aviles and Carlson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311410495">3</xref></sup> conducted a 3D finite element analysis to study the local buckling behavior of composite sandwich panels under the influence of square and circular debonds of different sizes for three different core materials. Although the results agree well with experiments, due to the element they have implemented, their FEM model fails to investigate the effect of fiber orientation of the face sheets and the effect of different boundary conditions on the top and bottom face sheets. In fact, the effects of fiber orientation of the face sheets and different boundary conditions on the top and bottom face sheets and the shape of the delamination on the buckling response of debonded sandwich panels have not systematically been studied yet.</p>
<p>This article develops a novel approach for the finite element modeling of sandwich panels by means of a user-defined APDL (ANSYS Parametric Design Language) code. In the finite element model presented in this study, the motion of the face sheet is related to the motion of the core through constraint equations utilizing the concept of slave and master nodes, thus representing a more realistic model of the structure. The face sheets are modeled with shell elements and the core is modeled with 3D solid elements and is therefore capable of taking transverse flexibility into consideration. In order to model the debond, the constraints between the nodes of the face sheet and the core are removed and replaced with contact elements in the debonded region to avoid the interpenetration of the finite element nodes of the face sheet and the core. The present finite element model not only requires fewer elements and thus less computing time, it is also capable of modeling debond between the soft core material and hard face sheet material and therefore studying the effects of the size, shape and aspect ratio of the debond as well as fiber orientation of the face sheets and the influence of the core material on the buckling load of the panel. In particular, certain boundary conditions which may not be studied analytically can be studied using the present finite element model.</p>

<p>The element type used to model the composite face sheets is the 8-node Layered Structural Shell 99. The core is modeled using the 3D 20-node structural Solid 95 element which is capable of modeling the transverse flexibility of the core using 3D elasticity. The shell elements by default place the nodes at the mid-plane of the top and the bottom face sheets. If the nodes of the shell elements were shared with the solid brick element, half of the face sheet element in the thickness direction would penetrate into the solid brick element which would therefore result in a wrong representation of the actual structure. This problem can be removed through the use of user-defined constraint equations, which relate the degree-of-freedom values together. A useful concept for constraint equations is that of master and slave nodes. The displacement of the slave node can be described in terms of the displacement of the master node.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311410495">14</xref></sup> Once the constraint is specified, only one of the two nodes whose motions are to be related is retained in the matrix system of equations, which is called the master node, while the remaining node is called the slave node.</p>
<p>Through the use of the above-mentioned elements, the model uses the CLPT (Classical Plate Theory) for the face sheets and a 3D elasticity theory for the core. The kinematic relations for the face sheets are:

<p>The kinematic relations for the core based on the small deformation theory read:

<p>The compatibility conditions assuming perfect bonding between the core and the face sheets at the upper and lower interfaces with the coordinate system placed at the center of the mid-plane of the top face sheet require that:

<p>Through the above- mentioned equations, the mid-plane nodes of the top and the bottom face sheets are related to the upper and lower surfaces of the core, respectively, using the constraint equations developed in ANSYS Parametric Design Language. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311410495">Figure 1</xref> shows the schematic of the sandwich plate model. The debond between the core and the face sheet is modeled by removing the constraints between the top face sheet nodes and those of the core. In order the avoid interpenetration of the surfaces, contact elements are used between the core and the face sheet in the debond region. For simplicity, the debond is assumed to be embedded at the center of the panel.

<p>Buckling occurs when the membrane strain energy of a structure is converted into strain energy without any change of the externally applied load.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311410495">15</xref></sup> The stiffness matrix in a finite element buckling analysis is made up of two parts:

<p>In this part, the critical buckling load of a debonded sandwich panel is calculated and the results are compared to the buckling loads determined experimentally by Aviles and Carlson.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311410495">3</xref></sup> The panels examined in the experimental study in Aviles and Carlson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311410495">3</xref></sup> were 20 × 15 cm<sup>2</sup> (length × width) consisting of 2-mm thick (plain weave) glass–epoxy face sheets over 25 mm foam core. The experiment was carried out for four square debonds and four circular debonds of different sizes. The compressive load is applied on the shorter edge of the panel. The debond was modeled by implanting a thin (30 µm thick) nonstick Teflon sheet between one face sheet and the core at the center of the plate. The material properties of the face sheets and the core are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311410495">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998311410495">3</xref>. Simply supported boundary conditions are imposed on all edges of the panel except that the loaded edges are free to move in the direction of the compressive load. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311410495">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the 3D geometry of this sandwich panel with a square debond of 45 cm side length in ANSYS resulting from the present simulation. Due to the symmetry of the geometry and material properties, only one quarter of the sandwich panel is modeled.

It can be seen that for smaller debonds, there is good agreement between the results of the present analysis and those of the experiments, whereas for larger debonds the present finite element model yields more conservative results. This discrepancy can be due to the Teflon film implanted between the face sheet and the core to model the debond. As mentioned by the authors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311410495">3</xref></sup> the Teflon film may adhere to the core after resin infusion which may result in an improper modeling of the debond. Another reason may be attributed to the fact that in the present finite element model as mentioned earlier, the debond is modeled by removing the constraint between the core and the face sheet rather than inserting an external material such as Teflon between the core and the face sheet in the debonded region. This in turn represents a relatively weaker structure compared to that of the experiment.

<sec id="sec8-0021998311410495"><title>Effect of shape and size</title>
<p>Although actual debonds in sandwich structures tend to be of irregular shapes, they are frequently approximated as circular or square shapes. In particular, square debond geometry is a simple choice which can be used to approximate and study the characteristics of the debond.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311410495">16</xref></sup> In this section, the effects of the size of circular and square debonds on the critical buckling load of a sandwich panel are compared. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311410495">Figure 5</xref> shows how the critical buckling load changes with the debond size for these two shapes where the debond size represent the diameter of the circular debond and the side of the square debond. The material properties of the panel are the same as those listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311410495">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998311410495">3</xref>.

<p>It can be seen the critical buckling load decreases with increasing debond area indicating that the very existence of the debond decreases the load capacity of the structure. Increasing the diameter of the circle or the side length of the square, i.e., the area of the debond decreases the buckling load. It is also observed that after certain debond size (55 mm in here), the buckling load starts to decrease at a lower rate. Since the diameter of the circular debond is assumed to be equal to the length of the square debond, the area of the square is more than that of the circle causing panels with square debonds to buckle earlier than those with circular debonds. This can also be attributed to the sharp corners of the square debonds which are the loci of high stress concentrations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0021998311410495"><title>Effect of boundary condition</title>
<p>To study the effect of boundary conditions on the buckling load, three different sets of boundary conditions have been considered, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311410495">Figure 6</xref>. The letters F, S, and C denote free, simply supported, and clamped edges, respectively. For instance, the boundary condition denoted by SSSS implies simply supported boundary conditions along the edges of the top face sheet and the bottom face sheet. The influence of boundary conditions on the critical buckling load for different area ratios, i.e. ratios of the square debond area to that of the face sheet is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311410495">Figure 7</xref>.

It is observed that the buckling load increases with greater geometric constraint imposed at the four edges of the top and bottom face sheets so that a fully clamped panel and the panel with two free edges have the highest and lowest critical buckling loads, respectively.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311410495">Figure 8</xref> shows how the critical buckling load of a sandwich panel with single ply face sheets varies with the fiber angle of the face sheet. <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>b</italic><sub>0</sub> are the dimensions of the square debond embedded at the center of the panel between the top face sheet and the core.

It is seen that the buckling load decreases with increasing fiber angle up to θ = 45°. This is due to the fact that the face sheets that are primarily responsible for carrying the load become weaker as θ increases. After θ = 45°, when the face sheets become extremely weak, the core starts taking the load, which leads to an increase in the buckling load.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311410495">Figure 9</xref> shows the effect of the debond aspect ratio (<italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub>/<italic>b</italic><sub>0</sub>) on the normalized critical buckling load of a simply supported sandwich panel when the debond area is fixed for different ratios of the area of debond to the area of the face sheet (<italic>A</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub>/<italic>A</italic>). The critical buckling load is nondimensionalized as follows:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula10-0021998311410495"><label>(10)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410495-eq10.tif"/></disp-formula>where <italic>h</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> and <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> denote the total thickness and the modulus of elasticity of the face sheet. Thus, aspect ratios greater than 1 represent rectangular debonds in longitudinal directions and aspect ratios smaller than 1 correspond to rectangular debonds in the transverse direction. Apart from the fact that the critical buckling load decreases with increasing the debond area, it is also seen that a square debond, in other words <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub>/<italic>b</italic><sub>0</sub> = 1, results in the lowest buckling load and that the buckling load decreases with increasing the debond area. In addition, a closer look at the graph shows that panels with transversely oriented rectangular debonds buckle earlier than those with rectangular debonds in the longitudinal direction, i.e., the debond which runs through the width of the panel perpendicular to the load direction reduces the buckling load more than a debond that extends through the length parallel to the load. This is because of the larger portion of the defect region created near the central part of the panel. It is also observed that as the debond size increases, the effect of the aspect ratio on the buckling load becomes less pronounced.

<sec id="sec13-0021998311410495" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A new finite element model for sandwich structures has been presented. The model utilizes shell elements for the face sheets and solid elements for the core capable of capturing the transverse flexibility of the core. The displacements of the face sheet and the core are related through defining constraint equations between the nodes of their respective finite element nodes based on the concept of master and slave nodes. The debond between the core and the face sheet is modeled by removing the constraints and implementing contact elements between the core and the face sheet in order to avoid interpenetration of the surfaces. The model is then used to calculate the buckling load of sandwich panels with and without face/core debonds. It is observed that the very existence of debond causes the buckling load of the structure to decrease and the rate of this decrease becomes lower after a certain debond area. Square-shaped debonds are found to reduce the buckling load more than circular debonds of the same characteristic length. The results show that increased geometrical constraints imposed in the form of boundary conditions on the face sheets causes the buckling load to rise. Studying the effect of fiber angle of the face sheets shows that the core causes the buckling load to first decrease and then increase as opposed to a laminate. For a fixed debond area, panels with transversely oriented rectangular debonds are seen to buckle earlier than panels with longitudinally oriented rectangular debonds. Finally, investigating the effect of the core stiffness led to the observation that the buckling load decreases with reduced core modulus. However, the sensitivity of the buckling load to core modulus was found to be more significant for smaller debonds. Reasonable agreement was found with experimental results reported in the literature.</p>
