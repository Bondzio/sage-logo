<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Support for the inclusion of world music in school music curricula in the United States has a well-established history. In the 1960s, the Tanglewood Declaration and the Goals and Objectives Project suggested there needed to be more emphasis on pluralistic musics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1048371312462215">Volk, 2004</xref>). Since 1970, the National Association for Music Education (then the Music Educators National Conference) has reinforced this idea through special journal issues, articles, book reviews, reports, commissions, and symposia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1048371312462215">Volk, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1048371312462215">2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Although most music educators would agree that including world music in their curriculum is important, gaining the knowledge to do so seems an overwhelming task. Literature indicates music educators experienced difficulty implementing the ninth National Standard for Music Education, “Understanding Music in Relation to History and Culture” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1048371312462215">Reimer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1048371312462215">Schmid, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1048371312462215">Schuler, 1995</xref>). There are increasing opportunities for self-directed learning for music educators seeking knowledge in world music pedagogy. Recently, readers of <italic>General Music Today</italic> have been encouraged to investigate online resources for gaining knowledge of world music pedagogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1048371312462215">Beegle, 2012</xref>). Current world music educational online technologies include the Association for Cultural Equity archives, the Smithsonian Folkways archives, and the EVIA project (Ethnomusicological Video for Instruction &amp; Analysis). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1048371312462215">Anderson and Campbell (2010)</xref> state the development of these resources is in response to “the needs of music teachers to create rich learning experiences in music and culture” (p. viii). These online technologies offer opportunities for K–12 general music educators to diversify and self-direct their professional development and to potentially learn to infuse world musics into music education curricula.</p>
<p>What are some implications for self-directed world music pedagogy professional development? First, it takes time to learn to communicate musically within a variety of musical traditions. Identifying accessible steps toward gaining knowledge of world music pedagogy helps determine personal motivation and approaches to learning. Second, learning will likely occur outside of school settings since there is little time for self-directed professional development during the teaching day. Third, engaging in recreational/community and media settings for learning is potentially motivating and stimulating. Moreover, it mirrors learning behaviors of adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1048371312462215">Raith, 2009</xref>), thereby providing K–12 general music educators with additional pedagogic insight and perspective.</p>
<p>This article identifies steps toward gaining knowledge of world music pedagogy. The majority of the article focuses on interaction with resources within recreational/community and online media environments to demonstrate ways general music teachers can diversify and self-direct their professional development. Later in the article, is a shorter section that outlines long-term strategies. It focuses on ways music educators can coordinate and network with people in the immediate and broader community to conceptualize, fund, and implement world music pedagogy curriculum projects. The end of the article provides an annotated list of websites discussed within the context of the steps.</p>

<sec id="section2-1048371312462215">
<title>Approaches for Interacting With Resources</title>
<p>The steps outlined in this section invite music educators to develop a motivated and purposeful mind-set for learning without becoming overwhelmed. Identifying and pursuing steps within recreational, community, and media environments takes pressure from perceived professional needs to develop absolute musical authenticity and fluency. Learners can isolate pedagogic skill development and develop competency in targeted areas.</p>
<sec id="section3-1048371312462215">
<title>Keep One Foot in the Familiar</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1048371312462215">Veblen, Beynon, and Odom (2005)</xref> argue that a personal challenge for music educators engaging with pluralistic musics is “how to move from the familiar to the unknown” (p. 4). They encourage teachers to begin with pieces of music that are familiar and then select music perceived to be “exotic.” I posit a variation on this approach, whereby the learner begins with music that is familiar and then explores musics that are unfamiliar but related to what is familiar. This approach reflects my own personal experience in my first years of teaching. I was very familiar with jazz and bossa nova repertoire and performance practices. As an artist-educator, I wanted to expand my performance repertoire and also create small curricular units for my general music students that reflected my personal professional development pathway. Bossa nova led me to multiple variations within Brazilian samba, followed by other Brazilian music genres. Encountering samba-choro led to me to investigate choro. The final leg of this self-directed journey led me from choro to maracatu. In this process, each stage represented a short-term goal to develop more familiar musical territory in my performance practice and general music pedagogy, while discovering new possibilities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1048371312462215">
<title>Try an Online Lesson Plan</title>
<p>The websites for the Association for Cultural Equity and the Smithsonian Folkways have lesson plans developed by music educators involved with these projects who are well versed in ethnomusicology. The lesson plans are appropriate for general music classrooms. Content in these lessons may be useful for your current teaching or spark ideas for you to develop. For example, the lesson titled “The Land Where the Blues Began” on the Association for Cultural Equity website might be a familiar starting place to explore American and West African musics. It provides authentic video footage from the Alan Lomax archives to use with the lesson plan.</p>
<p>The lesson plans and accompanying resources on these websites span K–12 and are developmentally appropriate for the indicated grade range.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1048371312462215">
<title>Learn a Song and Develop Your Own Lesson Plan</title>
<p>Both the Association for Cultural Equity and the Smithsonian Folkways websites have many sound recordings from which to develop a general music lesson plan. The EVIA project has video of song and dance practices from around the world. Goetze’s <italic>Global Voices in Song</italic> DVD series is another excellent resource. It scaffolds learning of performing arts practices from around the world. Working with the approach of selecting an unfamiliar song that is related to what is personally familiar might be useful. The ideas you generate may lead to your development of a three- to five-lesson curriculum unit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1048371312462215">
<title>Get Out Into the Community</title>
<p>You might begin with investigating online national cultural organizations. They may offer workshops or festivals in your state. Examples include the National Association of Latino Art and Culture, the Native Arts and Cultures Foundation, and the National Council for the Traditional Arts. These websites are annotated at the end of this article.</p>
<p>Your community may have periodic cultural events such as drum circles or workshops at universities and colleges focused on world music pedagogy. Exploring these options with a peer may stimulate motivation to learn. The Drum Circle finder website directs you to drum circles in your state or international country. I suggest you contact your local university or college for world music workshops open to teachers. Often drum circles and university workshops are free, with a suggested donation.</p>
<p>If you seek out kinesthetic application of musical ideas, movement and dance classes focused on a particular performance practice are an option. Universities and colleges often offer classes or clubs through their recreation facilities or cultural associations. Conducting an Internet search with your state name and the word “arts” produces the state arts council web page. Searching further into the website usually produces local cultural arts organizations and recreation centers for you to contact. Some drumming and dance performing art forms, such as samba, have an international following. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Worldsamba.org">Worldsamba.org</ext-link> lists samba schools and performing groups by U.S. state or international country. If you are not geographically close to these opportunities, the YouTube website has videos of drum circles, world music workshops, and cultural drumming and dance performance to observe pedagogic practice.</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Youtube.com/education">Youtube.com/education</ext-link> delimits your search to produce video clips that are content appropriate for children and education settings. Files of YouTube video clips can be kept for easy retrieval. It is wise to share with students only video clips with which you have detailed familiarity and have screened for suitability. Please check with your school administration for its specific policy on YouTube use within your teaching.</p>

<sec id="section7-1048371312462215">
<title>Mobile Recreational Learning at Home and on the Go</title>
<p>Mobile recreational learning refers to learning you can experience through Internet surfing with your mobile digital device, including cell phone, iPod touch, tablet PC, or iPad. Internet surfing time can happen in the free minutes of your day between activities. It is useful to create small steps for personal professional development. Having an initial recreational mind-set about a developing interest in the performance practices of a musical tradition sets aside pressure for mastery of performance and cultural context. In addition to websites cited earlier, the following websites contain robust sections on the performance practices of a wide range of cultures: World Music Network, National Geographic (World Music Section), and the University of Washington Library. You may wish to explore the diversity of a targeted geographic region. University websites often provide lists of websites focused on music from geographic regions, such as the Stanford University website. If you prefer to investigate current world music artists, you could begin with the Mondomix website.</p>
<p>It is helpful to organize and annotate the websites you have explored. Using a handwritten journal, data-processing digital file, or free online service such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://surfmark.com">surfmark.com</ext-link> will aid with this. If some of the websites’ reading levels and content are too difficult for the grade range with which you are working, you can develop your own school intranet website or blog that cites the original sources and modifies the information for your students.</p>
<p>Another step could be to explore and maybe join websites that provide a free social network designed for teachers and/or recreational music performers. Examples include the Times Educational Supplement network, the Drum Circle Magazine network, Djembefola, and the Banjo and Mando Hangout websites. These websites offer support for learners new to the musical tradition. Additionally, members provide helpful teaching and learning resources.</p>
<p>Engaging in these websites is a beginning step. There is need to get as close as possible to original sources. For example, an interest in the Djembefola website could lead you to investigate djembe master drummers. The Jembe Discography website lists master African djembe/jembe drummers who have recorded. You could search for the artists’ videos and recordings on YouTube and iTunes. The Drumdojo website provides a comprehensive history of the djembe in addition to information on world music percussion written by indigenous musicians.</p>

<sec id="section8-1048371312462215">
<title>Use Instruments Already in Your Music Classroom</title>
<p>The general music classroom instruments in your classroom can be used in a variety of music traditions. In this section, I describe options for adapting performance practices from around the world to general music classroom instruments. First, it is important to locate original sources. If you are interested in gamelan music, there are videos on YouTube of Balinese and Javanese traditional gamelan music performed by and for indigenous members of those cultures. Second, there are music educators well versed in ethnomusicology who have created excellent adaptations of traditional musics to general music classroom instruments. For example, Dr. Vera Flaig’s website listed at the end of this article provides detailed lesson plans for creating Javanese music using Orff barred instruments and introduces students to gamelan notation. Dr. Flaig’s lessons use the Javanese slendro scale, which has a close tuning to a Western pentatonic scale. Dr. Flaig uses the Orff instrumentarium in her lesson plans. Third, online music stores offer combination book, mp3 file download, and compact disk sets focused on a particular performance practice. Every publication is prepared with the involvement of a culture bearer. These repertoire resources are designed for use with general music classroom instruments. Finally, some performance practices use non-Western tuning systems. For example, the Javanese seven-note pelog scale differs in spacing between pitches from a Western diatonic scale. You may wish to temporarily tinker with the tuning of your Orff barred instruments in order to engage in this performance practice. Dr. Terese Volk has demonstrated at music education conference workshops how to approximate a Javanese pelog scale using Orff barred instruments. I observed how she applied plasticine putty to lower the individual pitch of an instrument bar. For additional detail on the interval-spacing differences between pelog and diatonic scales, please refer to the gamelan tuning system website listed at the end of this article.</p>

<title>Steps Toward the Longer Term</title>
<p>The previous section described steps toward introductory experiences into unfamiliar musical traditions through focus on interaction with resources. Your continued interest might progress into steps to be realized over the longer term. This section focuses on approaches for interaction with people in the immediate and broader community to develop world music pedagogy curriculum projects.</p>
<p>Long-term steps take additional commitment and planning. They should benefit your teaching and professional development at a core level. As recommended earlier, it is helpful to begin with what is familiar. For example, you could develop a comprehensive investigation of music that represents cultures in the community in which you teach. Interacting with resources will get you started. Steps toward the longer term can involve continued interaction with tradition bearer teaching artists who can help you to develop meaningful curricula for your students.</p>
<p>If you wish to travel to teaching artists, a pathway could be to take the Smithsonian Folkways certification course at the University of Washington School of Music in Seattle. Teaching artists include Thione Diop, master drummer from Senegal, West Africa, and León García (Mariachi). In addition, the Center for World Music offers courses outside of the United States, including Mexico, China, Indonesia, and West Africa, led by indigenous musicians and Dr. Lewis Peterman, Professor Emeritus of Music (San Diego State University), who is well versed in ethnomusicology. On completion of coursework, participants could benefit from forming an online professional learning community to continue peer and teaching artist interaction. In addition, participant peers may offer mutual support, feedback, and potential collaboration in the development of world music curriculum projects.</p>
<p>If you wish to engage a local teaching artist for your school, it is helpful if your pathway to the artist develops from your interaction in the community. It is recommended you experience the artist yourself by participating in their workshops, becoming familiar with their artistic work, and conducting a personal interview with the artist. Your school administration could assist with the interview. Over time, you can determine the depth of the teaching artist’s expertise and ability to interact with the diverse learning needs of students as well as his or her overall fit for your school. As you get to know the artist, it is helpful to outline a potential world music curriculum project. Within this planning, I recommend maintaining clear vision of your professional development goals. You will not always have opportunity to bring a teaching artist into your school, and you need to think in terms of sustainability: How can I continue to advance the world music learning that has resulted from my school’s interaction with the teaching artist?</p>
<p>The next step is to secure funding. First, artists may be looking to partner with teachers for grant applications because demonstration of education impact is a grant requirement. Consulting first with your school administration, your school could partner with other schools in your county to help defray costs. You also could partner with a district-level supervisor within your county who may offer professional development funding if additional teachers are involved in the project. Second, investigate local and state arts organizations. Arts organizations’ effectiveness is magnified when there is demonstrable impact across public and private sectors and demographics. Arts organizations may have a community engagement or outreach partnership program and welcome your involvement. Third, there may be state or federal professional development-focused grants where winning proposals demonstrate a similar partnering of schools. Finally, consulting first with your school administration, you could develop a Kickstarter online fund-raising campaign. Kickstarter is the world’s largest crowd-funding, online threshold pledge system platform for creative projects. You determine a campaign goal dollar amount and individuals pledge money online by debit or credit card. Kickstarter also enables people to follow your project online. Your Kickstarter creative project could fund the artist’s work in your school as well as community events where the artist and your students perform together. This could expand the network of potential funders and attendees at your school events and the artist’s community events where your students are performing. A Kickstarter campaign is one way to synergize music within the community and general music education in schools.</p>
