<abstract>
<p>The subcontracting and delocalization of productive activities that characterize the global capitalist economy are an attempt to reduce costs and exempt corporations from their responsibilities to labor by delegating production to other companies, regions, and countries and even to the workers themselves. Latin America is a prime destination for this corporate outsourcing. Outsourcing has increased deregulation and labor flexibility and introduced a model of high labor turnover and transience that creates fragmentation and precarious employment in the working class.</p>

<p>In recent years, Latin America has become a prime destination for the offshoring of foreign corporations’ production and service sectors. Offshoring is a form of outsourcing that involves transferring certain phases of production to other countries, and today it is one of the strongest influences on the world market. In an era characterized by increased trade and mobility of people, objects, and information technologies, the service and manufacturing industries have undergone drastic changes. Many nonessential or low-skilled production and service operations have been relocated outside of their countries of origin while management functions remain behind.</p>
<p>Consistent with the strategies adopted by the capitalist classes to reduce production costs and increase profits, outsourcing has increased in recent decades in the United States and globally. It began in the United States during the 1970s and increased notably during the next two decades with the rise of neoliberalism. Neoliberal policies were actively promoted by the Reagan administration and the conservative government of Margaret Thatcher in the UK. The structural crisis of the capitalist system in the mid-1970s and the subsequent restructuring led companies to outsource some of their management and production tasks to areas and countries with lower labor costs and standards, particularly countries with dependent economies.</p>
<p>Generally, North American governments have discouraged outsourcing within their own territories in favor of foreign countries. This has created a new reconfiguration of outsourcing that transcends national boundaries. Latin America has become a prime destination for this type of activity. Offshoring has led to increased deregulation and labor flexibility and introduced a model of high turnover and transience that creates fragmentation and precarious employment in the working class.</p>
<sec id="section1-0094582X13492124">
<title>The How and Why of Outsourcing and Offshore Industry</title>
<p>In the strictest sense, outsourcing is not new; it has existed, albeit in other forms, since the beginning of capitalism. Originally it took the form of subcontracting or piecework, but it has expanded and become more complex in recent years. The best-known model is the one in which a company delegates some production, financial, business, or service tasks to another company that, though usually smaller, has the technical ability to perform them. The company directly contracts for the services of the second, specialized business. Alternatively, companies may use an employment agency to hire temporary workers to perform specific tasks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094582X13492124">1</xref></sup> Whatever form it takes, outsourcing has its roots in subcontracting or piecework labor. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0094582X13492124">Marx (1988)</xref>, a worker in these circumstances continues to be a laborer even when engaging in more productive practices. Workers earn a wage and are not the owners of their product. Part-time workers hired for specific production, trade, or financial activities maintain their status as pieceworkers.</p>
<p>Outsourcing is not the only form of delocalized production. Globalization has converted the world economy, previously made up of national economies, into a highly integrated “global factory” supported by the facilities offered by technological development and information and knowledge control. The maquila industry is another form of decentralization of production that exploits comparative advantages, following the same logic of capital relocation from the core countries to the periphery in pursuit of expanded production, new markets, and abundant and skilled but low-waged labor. Both are part of the global restructuring of production promoted by international market competition and business demands for higher rates of profit. While the maquila is mainly restricted to manufacturing and trade and involves the relocation and installation of whole companies or parts of them in the periphery, outsourcing may involve “offshoring in a vacuum” with little or no foreign direct investment, as increasingly happens in services, which are limited to the recruitment of labor through specialized subcontractors.</p>
<p>The Harris Interactive survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0094582X13492124">HRM Guide, 2010</xref>) and Capgemini, a leading provider of outsourcing consulting and technology services, interviewed more than 300 high-ranking corporate executives and found that the three most attractive destinations for offshore activities were India (60 percent), China (27 percent), and Latin America (25 percent). Much of Latin America is characterized by weak and flexible labor laws. The working class has limited power, and labor laws often permit long work hours, few limitations on the length of shifts, short vacations, easy labor turnover, and substandard safety and employment conditions. Other factors that make Latin American countries attractive offshore locations are geographic proximity, low-cost energy, and cheap and abundant raw materials. The wage differential is not the only factor in determining offshore relocations, but it is one of the primary variables. According to the Harris Interactive study, North American corporations use the following criteria to determine the viability of offshoring in Latin America: labor costs (69 percent), technology and infrastructure (49 percent), the availability of a qualified workforce (48 percent), economic stability (44 percent), and language dominance (41 percent).</p>
<p>During times of crisis, many countries look to foreign investors to generate employment. They offer potential investors open access to infrastructure and an easing of regulations so that companies will install their subsidiaries in desired locations. The effects of foreign investment are quite diverse with regard to employment generation, but it has had noticeable effects on working conditions and the effectiveness of collective bargaining. One of the most pernicious effects of offshoring is the commoditization of work, through which governments actually diminish workers’ legal protections. Labor laws are made more flexible, and this creates more precarious working conditions, low wages, and a lack of social security. Furthermore, labor unions are often weakened or annulled.</p>

<title>Outsourcing in the United States</title>
<p>The period from 1945 to the mid-1970s is known as the Golden Age of capitalism. It was characterized by sustained economic growth rates and strong union activity in the United States and the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X13492124">Castillo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X13492124">Hamann and Kelly, 2010</xref>). This began to change at the beginning of the 1980s because of the economic crisis and the adoption of the neoliberal economic model. The adoption of this model to reverse the decline in capital accumulation rates created a crisis for labor unions and the working class; throughout the world, labor union affiliation and the strength of unions declined dramatically. In turn, this created a real loss of collective and individual bargaining rights and the ability to protect workers’ previous economic and social gains.</p>
<p>To resolve the profound productivity crisis due to the failures of Fordism and Taylorism, the neoliberal state and big business sought to subjugate the working class by introducing flexible working conditions. They began to focus on the new forms of work organization articulated in the paradigm of flexible automation and the emerging Toyota system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094582X13492124">Coriat, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0094582X13492124">Dal Rosso, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0094582X13492124">Harvey, 2004</xref>), a set of Japanese business organizational principles and practices involving “a system of production organization based on an immediate response to changes in demand, therefore requiring a flexible and integrated approach to labor (including employees)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0094582X13492124">Gounet, 1999</xref>: 29). Big business and capital were able to reinforce these policies amid the protracted crisis of the following decade, which was particularly acute after 1997–1998. Since then, the depressive tendencies of the new economy have become more pronounced and contributed to the weakening of the intensity and duration of the boom cycles in the capitalist economy as a whole. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X13492124">Brenner (1999</xref>: 24), U.S. growth rates “have been—in terms of the principal macroeconomic indicators of growth, production, investment, productivity, and real incomes—even less dynamic than its predecessors of the relatively weak seventies and eighties (not to mention those of the fifties and sixties).”</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0094582X13492124">Duménil and Lévy (2007</xref>: 27) characterize the crisis of the 1970s as follows: “Growth rates and technical advances were affected; record levels of inflation were recorded in the advanced capitalist countries. . . . Salaries entered a period of virtual stagnation; profit rates fell; and above all, full employment was replaced with a wave of unemployment.” They point out that this capitalist crisis and the economic restructuring of the 1980s marked the beginning of neoliberalism throughout most of the world. This gave rise to a pronounced change in the patterns of capital accumulation and reproduction that had existed since the immediate postwar period. In the 1980s there was a relative recovery of profit rates at the cost of a decline in standards of living among the working class. During the 1990s, however, strong profits no longer correlated with the accumulation rate, and investment and job creation rates declined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0094582X13492124">Duménil and Lévy, 2007</xref>: 51).</p>
<p>Capital’s strategy for alleviating the profitability crisis of the 1970s focused on regressive wage policies. In 2001, the real hourly wages of 80 percent of workers had stagnated to 1979 levels. As a direct result, the United States and the developed European countries were unable to stage an economic recovery. Wage stagnation resulted in a historic decline in global economic growth rates, causing a decline in earnings for the principal multinational and global corporations. These corporations were the real architects of the development of global capitalism during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, introducing wage cuts and increased productivity due to technological advances, rationalization, and the increasing efficiency of labor as a result of cuts and layoffs.</p>
<p>Through successive cycles of crisis and capital restructuring, the Toyota system became the dominant production model. Today it is found in practically all the economies on the planet and is changing the dynamic world of work. It is perfectly compatible with the current historical-structural context. Outsourcing, then, represents an additional competitive advantage for business. It allows companies to avoid investing in infrastructure and reduce operating costs and to benefit from a less expensive labor force. In particular, they can increase productivity by overexploiting labor in dependent countries.</p>
<p>Both during his campaign and as U.S. president, Barack Obama has rejected externalization and outsourcing, blaming them for the high unemployment rate in the United States, and sought to promote internal investment that will create jobs for U.S. citizens. He has tried to create a domestic policy that is favorable to internal investment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0094582X13492124">Obama, 2010</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>One of the keys to job creation is to support companies to invest more in the United States. For years, our tax code has given billions of dollars in tax breaks to encourage businesses to create jobs and profits in other countries. Instead of tax loopholes that encourage investment in jobs abroad, I am proposing a more generous offer: the permanent expansion of a tax credit that goes to research and innovation for companies that stay here in the United States.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Outsourcing aims to reconfigure corporations’ organizational and business practices in the national territory of other countries, particularly countries where wages are low and opportunities for flexibility and deregulation are high and guaranteed by the state. Using this logic, the ability of the corporation to manage its workforce flexibly—to hire and fire quickly at the lowest possible economic and political cost—is one of the essential criteria in choosing an offshore location. Although the number of displaced workers is small compared with the size of the national workforce, they have begun to represent a potential threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X13492124">Anderson and Cavanagh, 2004</xref>). While this is not a new practice, it has increased significantly with the privatization of public services and the long-distance operations made possible by technological innovations.</p>
<p>The tendency to relocate service-sector jobs is an extension of the older practice of subcontracting certain functions to smaller, nonunion companies within the United States. Today information can be sent quickly and easily throughout the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X13492124">Anderson and Cavanagh, 2004</xref>: 1). Approximately 14 million U.S. workers are susceptible to being incorporated into this labor model in an effort to reduce service costs and increase productivity.</p>
<p>The effects of outsourcing on unemployment can still be considered limited compared with the magnitude of unemployment directly linked to businesses’ relocating to other countries with cheaper labor. However, workers labor under the constant threat of being laid off or fired due to offshoring, and this puts them in a vulnerable and disadvantaged position in the light of declining working conditions and limited ability to negotiate. The decline of the North American manufacturing sector has coincided with the increase in outsourcing, but massive displacement of workers cannot be assumed. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X13492124">Houseman (2007</xref>: 1) argues that “the drop in manufacturing employment coincides with outsourcing to domestic contractors, including staffing services, and an increase in outsourcing of materials and services inputs to foreign companies or affiliates, commonly known as offshoring,” she cites Kirkegaard to the effect that “the heated public and political debate . . . has been vastly overblown” and that statistics show that firing associated with outsourcing in the manufacturing sector is approximately 4 percent.</p>
<p>Offshoring and outsourcing have modified the roles of the old and new peripheries in the framework of the global market and the international division of labor. Thus, it is part of the new process of global economic restructuring. It follows the same logic as immigration but in reverse. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X13492124">Beck (2000</xref>: 39), “People do not migrate, but rather jobs go to them.” India, China, and Latin America have become privileged offshore destinations for U.S. companies. Entrepreneurs and CEOs claim to have only two options: reducing working conditions and costs in their home countries or permanently moving their facilities (or parts of them) offshore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094582X13492124">Brooks, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>This process coincides with the adoption since the mid-1970s of relatively new strategies for promoting capitalization and earnings abroad that have had a noticeable impact on migration (and its restrictions) and the job market. The percentage of U.S. foreign investment rose from 8.6 percent in 1973 to 18.7 percent in 2008. During the same period, it increased from 7.9 percent of the total gross domestic product (GDP) to 15.7 percent, with a slight decline in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis. These strategies have captured the imagination of U.S. society. They seem to promise limited international immigration and better wages (with outside capital) for native workers. However, this is an extremely fragile supposition given that the imperialist country must maintain its position in the international system. In addition, it is possible that concessions will have to be made at the expense of foreign labor to benefit the dominant country.</p>

<title>Latin America and the New Peripheries of the Global Economy</title>
<p>In recent years, offshoring to less developed nations has become standard practice for large European corporations. They have moved their facilities to Eastern European countries such as Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Romania to take advantage of low labor costs, access to raw materials, and state subsidies in order to become more competitive in the international marketplace. New peripheries have developed as a result of the fall of the former Soviet Union in the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0094582X13492124">Sotelo, 2007</xref>), and they have experienced strong economic, political, and social pressure to accelerate the deindustrialization of their countries, regions, and localities. As the standard of living has risen in Eastern Europe, deindustrialization has led to the displacement of the axis of capital accumulation. In this environment, companies have considerable leverage and power. In 2004, the German company Siemens threatened to move part of its production to Hungary, where the median hourly wage was 3.8 euros compared with 26.5 euros in Germany. Services, maquiladoras, remittances, and raw material exportation have come to dominate the economies of semi-industrialized nations of Latin America such as Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Chile. There is also strong dependence on the Chinese economy, especially in the Southern Cone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094582X13492124">CEPAL, 2009–2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0094582X13492124">Sotelo, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>New offshore locations have emerged to challenge the three principal destinations (China, India, and Malaysia) for outsourced production and labor. Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and Argentina are now serious contenders, and Costa Rica, Panama, Uruguay, and Colombia have begun to receive offshore facilities. Multiple corporations and global entrepreneurs have invested in the region and now compete with local and regional companies. Offshore infrastructure and services in Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela reached a total of US$683.8 million in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0094582X13492124">Frost &amp; Sullivan, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Outsourcing is now part of the structure of the contemporary global economy. It creates pressure on two fronts. On the one hand, capital and national states are more structurally interdependent, and this has detrimental effects on the industrial, service, and subsistence agricultural sectors of less developed nations. Subsistence agriculture has been particularly hard hit, and as small farmers find themselves forced out of their livelihoods they are often forced to emigrate. On the other hand, labor in the central capitalist countries is overexploited. As the workforce becomes global, structural changes result in lower wages, increased work hours, and a general decline in working conditions. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0094582X13492124">Marini (1996</xref>: 65), “These changes have generalized to the entire system, including to the advanced centers. They have become a distinctive feature (but not an operating one) of the dependent economy: the generalized overexploitation of labor.” <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0094582X13492124">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Outsourcing tends to create precarious labor conditions. Jobs that were once stable have become either temporary or part-time positions. This is a general and complex trend that has occurred in developed economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X13492124">Castillo, 2009</xref>). In the United States, companies like Nike and Dell outsource their production to Third World developed nations such as Honduras, China, the Philippines, and other Asian nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0094582X13492124">“Outsourcing y offshoring,” n.d.</xref>). In Japan, “outsourcing has contributed to weakening an employment system that had been dominated by industry until recently. . . . The optimal employment system in the tertiary sector differs from industry, where there is now a propensity in the latter to offer temporary or part-time employment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094582X13492124">Coriat, Geoffron, and Rubinstein, 1997</xref>: 75).</p>
<p>Latin America and Africa are now the third-largest destinations for outsourcing facilities in the world, after Asia (with India and China leading) and Central and Eastern Europe. Mexico, Brazil, and Chile are the countries in the region that are identified as the most important in the A. T. Kearney Global Services Location Index, which rates the 50 principal offshoring locations for production and services. These three countries were rated sixth, tenth, and twelfth in Kearney’s 2011 publication, but the region had gained 20 positions in the ranking since 2005.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0094582X13492124">3</xref></sup> Although the mobility of different Latin American countries within the ranking has been uneven, Mexico has shown a significant gain, from seventeenth in 2005 to sixth in 2011. In contrast, Chile went from eighth to tenth, Brazil from tenth to twelfth, Costa Rica from twenty-first to nineteenth, Argentina from twenty-third to thirtieth, and Panama from thirty-sixth to thirty-fourth, and there were two new countries, Uruguay and Colombia, ranked forty-first and forty-third.</p>
<p>The 2011 Kearney index has a section dedicated to Mexico and the advantages that it offers to investors. It states that Mexico is superior to many other countries because of its high productivity and its developed industry and because its workforce has a wide range of skills and specialties throughout the country. In Mexico 84 percent of large private companies and transnational corporations that utilize outsourcing do it to reduce production costs by 5–15 percent (<italic>La Jornada</italic>, April 2, 2010). Furthermore, according to a report by the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León it is estimated that third-party hiring involving outsourcing has cost the nation approximately 5 percent of the gross domestic product, primarily because of the loss of tax revenue. Through payroll and income tax breaks, evasion, and loopholes, these companies failed to pay more than 15 billion pesos between 2004 and 2010. More than 14,000 companies failed to pay their contributions to the Instituto del Fondo Nacional de la Vivienda para los Trabajadores (Institute of National Housing Fund for Workers) and Social Security and their value-added and income taxes (<italic>El Universal</italic>, February 4, 2011).</p>
<p>The importance of Latin America as an offshore destination appears to be increasing. The principal reasons for this, according to the Kearney index, are a favorable business climate, a skilled labor force, and worker availability. Using these criteria (measured on a scale of 0 to 4 for the first factor and 0 to 2 for the latter two), Mexico has the highest rank in the region with scores of 2.68, 1.60, and 1.44 and an overall grade of 5.72. (The world leader, India, has a score of 7.01.) Chile has a grade of 5.52 and Brazil a grade of 5.48. According to Christian Callieri of A. T. Kearney, Argentina has a well-educated workforce, but its political environment and the large fluctuations in the exchange rate keep it from occupying a better position. Chile offers a “stable economy at Latin American prices” and has a well-educated workforce and excellent infrastructure. Its twin challenges have been its smaller population and its relatively small number of English-speakers, but the government has instituted programs for developing English-language skills in the labor pool. According to Callieri, Mexico “is quick and easy to get to” from most of the United States, and cost is another attraction. The country also scores high because of its breadth of quality workers, although it suffers from environmental issues and economic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0094582X13492124">Rosenthal, 2010</xref>). A study by the Association of Experts in Customer Contact Centers and Izo System has shown that in 2004 alone the offshore call center market in Latin America grew by 47 percent, billing US$324 million. In Argentina, in 2005, 50 percent of the revenue from call centers came from offshore services (65 percent of it from the United States and 30 percent from Spain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0094582X13492124">S&amp;T Consulting, 2005</xref>). Wage level is a determining factor in the dynamics of relocation from the core countries to the periphery. Empirical evidence for this assertion comes from a bivariate analysis showing an inverse relationship between median annual income and index of outsourcing with a Pearson coefficient of -0.417, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01.</p>
<p>Outsourcing has been significant in allowing companies to reduce production costs. It involves cost shifting from the primary company to subcontractors. Wage and benefit responsibilities, which are usually limited, are shifted to third parties. This has led to a global reduction in labor contracts and social rights. Through offshoring and outsourcing, companies have effectively modernized and increased the precariousness of working conditions. Workers’ rights have diminished with the reduction or elimination of collective bargaining. There is a direct correlation between the decrease in production costs and the rise in corporate profits. Some writers characterize outsourcing or offshoring as a mechanism typical of “external flexibility,” in which the corporation has no responsibility to labor. Many nations have accepted offshoring job creation and foreign capital investment uncritically, but it seems to us that the cost of this investment should be carefully considered. Public policies that are friendly to foreign investment but hostile to native workers cannot be justified. This type of outsourcing in Brazil has been accompanied by pro-business reforms, reduced wages, increased factory automation, and layoffs. Little attention has been paid to the social consequences of this situation.</p>
<p>Outsourcing reduces employment and leads to deteriorating labor relations. It “tends to polarize the division of labor between jobs with complex activities and ones of simple assembly. The former implies stability, training, and high value while the latter implies low-skilled, unstable employment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094582X13492124">Echeverría, 2010</xref>: 30). Since the end of the 1980s, outsourcing has reduced the number of industrial workers in Brazil, shifting the focus to the service sector. This has created a negative balance between lost industrial positions and jobs created in other sectors. Service-sector jobs tend to have lower wages, leading to a decrease in labor conditions and rights. Furthermore, Brazilian workers have seen their collective bargaining power diluted and fragmented in small companies while corporate and state power has increased. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0094582X13492124">Pochmann (2009)</xref>, during the Lula administration (2003–2010) the jobs created were mainly tertiary, temporary, and precarious.</p>
<p>Although Mexico has not experienced labor reform in the strict sense,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0094582X13492124">4</xref></sup> workforce management strategies have greatly changed. Neoliberal strategies for reducing production costs have resulted in the loss of workers’ rights, declining working conditions, and a systematic reduction in wages. This trend is tied to structural adjustment and has intensified during periods of national economic crisis. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (National Institute of Statistics and Geography— INEGI) points out that because of outsourcing almost half of the employees of large corporations in financial services, insurance, information services, and the mass media have no formal or direct relationship with their true employers. According to the INEGI’s economic census for 2010, outsourcing is especially prevalent in these sectors, in which 48.6 percent of employees are subcontracted as compared with 13.6 percent of workers in general (<italic>La Jornada</italic>, October 4, 2010).</p>
<p>An important example is the case of banking. According to <italic>México Laboral</italic> (January 18, 2010), from January to September 2009 banks created 8,690 jobs, 47 percent of them via outsourcing. Subcontracted employment grew more (7.6 percent) than that generated by the institutions themselves (4.8 percent) in the period in question. One of the major banking groups in the country, Bancomer, generated jobs only via outsourcing. According to the 2009 annual report of Grupo Financiero Inbursa, another important banking group, “the only consolidated subsidiary that has its own personnel is Inburnet Outsourcing.” Given the rapid growth of outsourcing in the country it would not be surprising if the number of workers subcontracted by this mechanism, in contravention of federal labor law, far exceeded the nearly 300,000 estimated by the tax agency’s auditors (<italic>La Jornada</italic>, February 5, 2011). The final results of a 2010 study by the Latin American Network for Research on Multinational Corporations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0094582X13492124">Puig, 2011</xref>) indicate that there are more than 50 million outsourced workers in Latin America and that outsourced workers constitute 30–40 percent of the formal workforce in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Uruguay. In Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru the estimate is even higher, 40–50 percent.</p>
<p>Public policies have been developed to deal with this problem. Laws designed to protect workers have been passed in Chile, Peru, and Ecuador. The Ecuadorian law, a constitutional amendment, is the most radical but has had only limited success. While many workers had to be rehired or given permanent jobs, the majority received a pay cut and/or a lower starting wage. In addition, the majority of workers reported that companies did not restore lost benefits such as seniority and adequate pensions. In addition, companies have developed new forms of outsourcing that are not yet regulated by the law. Since the law was passed in 2008, more than 200,000 Ecuadorians have become permanent workers. However, many workers have been given one-year contracts and then laid off. Thus, companies have been able to reinstitute the precarious labor conditions that the law sought to avoid. On a positive note, many workers have become part of the national social security system for the first time, and several thousand outsourcing companies have been closed down. Perhaps most interesting is that the law seems not to have had negative effects on foreign investment. To date, not one foreign company has left Ecuador. Transnational companies in Ecuador actually seem to have adapted better to the changes than Ecuadorian ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0094582X13492124">ICEM, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>According to data from the fourth annual “Nuestra América” labor union conference held in Nicaragua in 2011, outsourcing is the principal problem that 300,000 Nicaraguan workers face. Factories have sought to eliminate labor unions, creating more precarious labor conditions; some 100 factories have been able to eliminate the unions at their plants in the past four years. At the macro level, the countries identified as having the greatest labor instability are Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras (<italic>El Nuevo Diario</italic>, August 30, 2011).</p>
<p>It seems clear that the challenge is to create instruments and practices to limit the precarious labor conditions that outsourcing brings. The Ecuadorian law is one alternative that, in principle, benefits workers, but its results are currently unclear. Meanwhile, it is necessary to promote alternative development strategies in the region without neglecting or degrading working conditions and the collective rights of workers.</p>

<title>Final Considerations</title>
<p>The international division of labor has assumed new forms and created new social relationships. These new forms require institutional mechanisms for their implementation. Changes in employment, wages, qualifications, and outsourcing should be crystallized in legislation to maximize benefits for all. In other words, the state needs to play a fundamental role. Historically, it is the state that has been charged with instituting business, labor, and economic regulations. Currently, the welfare state is in crisis almost everywhere, leaving workers powerless and unprotected.</p>
<p>Outsourcing has paved the way for this crisis. It is a powerful tool that allows companies to survive, expand, and even bypass transcend national laws at the expense of the working class, which has had to bear the brunt of the capitalist crisis and corporate oppression. Workers have been attempting to develop new organizations representing their interests and demands in the face of a structural transformation in which outsourcing is a mechanism for weakening organized labor.</p>
<p>The contemporary capitalist crisis is opening a new historical conjuncture in which it is possible to shift the balance of power back to labor. Workers have been struggling with exploitative corporate strategies for reducing wages and benefits. The overexploitation of labor and increasingly precarious working conditions are directly linked to outsourcing worldwide. A fundamental task of labor movements and unions is to organize these millions upon millions of workers to fight against and overcome the capitalist earnings strategies that have limited and reversed social and labor rights for the working class. The challenge is to create instruments that limit the insecurity that such practices produce and promote alternative development paths that protect the working conditions and collective rights of workers.</p>

<p>Outsourcing has permeated various production and service sectors and subsectors in Mexico. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0094582X13492124">Vega García (2008)</xref> suggests that the impact of outsourcing on the national financial sector has resulted in “the pronounced loss of benefits and other labor conquests” and led to more precarious working conditions.</p>

<p>The neoliberal strategy tends to generalize the overexploitation of labor through the extension of the law of value. Similarly, it weakens and disarticulates production systems through the corrosive action of the capitalist crisis, leading to political instability, deindustrialization, and the creation of sweatshops in large areas of the world. At the same time, neoliberal practices reinforce commercial, scientific-technological, and financial trade dependency. In countries with capitalist hegemony, the state and capital are creating a system to reinforce labor overexploitation that they seek to implement in dependent nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0094582X13492124">Marini, 1996</xref>). Thus overexploitation becomes the link that connects new systems of work organization such as post-Fordism, Toyotaism, and corporate reengineering.</p>

<p>Although the federal labor law has been the object of several partial modifications, it has remained largely unchanged since 1970. Recently the Institutional Revolutionary Party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X13492124">PRI, 2010</xref>) has proposed an overhaul of the statute the objective of which is to legalize outsourcing.</p>
