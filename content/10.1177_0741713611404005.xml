<p>With all the texts written about Antonio Gramsci, it is difficult to make unique contributions to Gramscian studies, yet Peter Thomas has managed to write a major and innovative interpretation of Antonio Gramsci. I am confident that this will and should become a “go-to” text for those interested in understanding the importance of Gramsci. I highly recommend this text, and adult educators wanting to draw on Gramscian concepts would ignore this text at their own peril.</p>
<p>The text is important for a number of reasons. First, it is based on a close, philological reading of the complete <italic>Prison Notebooks</italic> in the original Italian; many interpretations of Gramsci are based on the incomplete translations of his notebooks in languages such as English. Second, Thomas bases his interpretation of Gramsci on a thorough knowledge of the large and ever-growing body of Gramscian studies in English, Italian, and German. Third, Thomas insists on a historically contextualized reading of Gramsci as a revolutionary of the period in which the Russian revolution was a major point of reference for socialists and communists around the world. In other words, rather than trying to hide from the fact that Gramsci was a revolutionary communist, Thomas makes this a starting point for his interpretation of the implications for Gramsci’s significant contributions to political philosophy and Marxist philosophy in particular.</p>
<p>Thomas’s exhaustive research and his complete reading of the <italic>Prison Notebooks</italic> allow him to show us how Gramsci was developing and reworking his concepts through his years in prisons. This also allows Thomas to convincingly challenge commonly held notions that Gramsci’s <italic>Prison Notebooks</italic> are overly fragmented and overly hampered by his physical condition and prison censors. Although not ignoring the constraints under which Gramsci worked, Thomas presents us with a relatively advanced and comprehensive philosophical research project under the banner of a philosophy of praxis, which for Thomas was not a euphemism but rather marked the new path on which Gramsci was resituating Marxist political philosophy beyond deterministic and positivistic tendencies emerging at the time.</p>
<p>Adult educators will probably want to pay particular attention to chapters 3 to 6 in which Thomas presents a multifaceted exposition of Gramsci’s concept of the Integral State. Gramsci argues that the Integral State is part and parcel of the emergence of modernity. The Integral State, Thomas argues, captures the interrelatedness of other key Gramscian concepts such as civil and political society, hegemony, organic crisis, and passive revolution. Thomas argues that Gramsci’s lifelong work was to develop a “political theory which would . . . give expression to—and . . . to shape and guide—the popular and subaltern classes’ attempts to . . . assume social and political leadership” (p. 159). From the Integral State’s hegemonic role, in chapters 7 to 9, Thomas is able to expound on the centrality of pedagogy in Gramsci’s philosophy and practice, relating this to Gramsci’s ideas on epistemology, ideology, and common sense.</p>
<p>Readers should be forewarned, however, of a few aspects of the text that will make it challenging for some readers. Those not familiar with the language and long tradition of Western philosophical thought will encounter many historical and contemporary philosophical figures and concepts along with Gramsci. As a philosophical text, do not expect a lot of practical applications of Gramsci; the emphasis of the text is on his philosophical breakthroughs. This approach does, however, allow for extended discussion of key Gramscian concepts.</p>
<p>Two points serve as both cautionary notes and critiques of the text. A frustrating aspect of the text is the fact that it is organized around an extended critique of Louis Althusser and Perry Anderson’s interpretations of Gramsci. Throughout the entire text, Thomas takes the reader through Althusser and Anderson on his way to his own interpretation of Gramsci. For those looking only for a more straightforward “what did Gramsci mean by the concept of . . . ?” you will need to make your way around the ongoing dialogue with Althusser and Anderson. In addition, Gramscian adult education literature is absent from the extensive use of secondary sources. This is unfortunate because in areas such as Gramsci’s unique understanding of ideology as one-sided, distorted thinking, which Thomas highlights, no mention is made of previous analyses of this by adult educators such as Paula Allman, John Wallis, and Peter Mayo. Thomas’s emphasis on the central pedagogical nature of Gramsci’s philosophy and practice is welcomed and very helpful, but, again, it is not based in the advances made in this area by adult educators.</p>
<p>Although Thomas has passed over Gramscian adult educators in this text, adult educators interested in Gramsci should not pass over Thomas. This text significantly advances Gramscian studies and can inform the work of adult educators interested in the application of Gramsci to our work.</p>
