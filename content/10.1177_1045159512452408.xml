<p>Among the plethora of books about curriculum development, few reflect the andragogical tenets that adult educators have come to embrace. Editor Victor Wang successfully incorporates andragogy into curriculum development, while also utilizing a globalist perspective in his <italic>Curriculum Development for Adult Learners in the Global Community, Volume II: Teaching and Learning</italic>. The second of a two-volume series, this book accomplishes the editor’s goal of providing a “current, practical, international, and adult learning based approach to designing and developing curriculum” (p. 2). With each chapter offering innovative theories and practical applications, it is a useful and timely text for all areas of adult educators.</p>
<p>Part one includes three chapters that explore the connection between culture and curriculum development. In chapter one, Guy presents a clear and compelling explanation of the role culture plays in the adult classroom. To help educators assess their own practice for cultural biases, he includes a list of six reflective questions, a thorough description, and examples of five forms of racial, class-based, and gender-based curricular biases. In chapter two, Alfred suggests six specific strategies for curricular design that acknowledges and incorporates recent demographic changes in the United States. Her description of <italic>transnational identities</italic> of today’s immigrants is a must-read for educators of a nonimmigrant cultural background. Zheng’s case study of English language education in China in chapter three provides a global example of curriculum development and concludes the first section.</p>
<p>In part two, authors explore the effects of globalization and focus on emerging adult learning methods. King sets the stage with her definition of the globally competent learner, describing specific competencies, and presents her view of what adult learning and teaching should look like. She ends the chapter with an extensive list of resources, including professional organizations, journals, websites, and more. In chapter five, Heuer presents an expanded conceptualization of informational literacy and the incorporation of collaboration, problem-based learning, context considerations, and hierarchical instruction into curriculum and instruction. To address the growing area of online learning, Nafukho presents a comprehensive overview of e-learning curriculum development in chapter six. After reviewing the latest findings on effective e-learning grounded in adult learning principles, he imparts the basics of e-learning curriculum development in a clear and straightforward way. The final chapter is written by Wang and serves as an appropriate culmination to the book. Chapter seven provides insight into the use of andragogical methods in the Chinese system of adult education, supported by the author’s recent findings. In his mixed methods study, Wang uniformly found the 195 adult educators surveyed expressed support for higher levels of pedagogical, rather than andragogical, teaching methods. Based on these findings, Wang developed a new model to understand andragogy in an authoritarian culture, providing a helpful framework for comparative adult education studies.</p>
<p>The organization of the book is beneficial and problematic. As noted by Wang, each chapter can be used independently and is a well-organized combination of theoretical and practical information. However, when viewed as an overall text, there is a slight lack of cohesion among chapters. While some work well together, such as Guy’s and Alfred’s or King’s and Heuer’s, others remain disconnected from each other, leaving the reader searching for a more uniform purpose.</p>
<p><italic>Teaching and Learning</italic> broadens the discussion of curriculum development for adult learners. Whether reading individual chapters or the entire book, adult educators will expand their vision and understand how to add not only a globalist but also an andragogical perspective to their teaching.</p>
