<body>
<p>The task of collecting, estimating, and analyzing health care costing data is less commonly understood compared with the method involved in the evaluation of clinical effectiveness. Increasing constraints on health systems around the globe have emphasized the need for clinicians to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of their clinical interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813487850">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813487850">2</xref></sup> As a result, it is essential for both clinicians and researchers to understand common cost accounting methodology to improve critical appraisals and development of future economic evaluations. Although the fundamentals of cost accounting can be quite basic, accurate health care costing can be tedious and challenging and thus prone to error. Furthermore, accurate methodological analysis and reporting are imperative to prevent bias and optimize economic evaluation conclusions.</p>
<p>The objective of this article is to outline common methodologies used to measure, estimate, and analyze health care costs. It will also discuss the following controversial topics of cost estimation: future costs and productivity costs. The purpose of this article is to improve understanding of cost collection–related methodology to improve the quality of critical appraisal and development of future economic evaluations in the otolaryngology literature.</p>

<title>Cost Overview</title>
<p>What is a cost? Economists consider a cost to be a sacrifice made when a given resource is consumed. This sacrifice is referred to as the “opportunity cost,” which is the lost benefit to one sector when using the resource in another sector (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599813487850"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). Economic theory states that the true value of a consumed resource is equal to its opportunity cost. Health care resource valuation will be discussed later in this article.</p>

<p>One of the most important components of cost collection is defining the cost perspective or reference point of any given analysis. A clearly defined costing perspective provides the framework to define which costs should be included and excluded in the analysis. For example, an economic evaluation from the government’s cost perspective should not include direct patient costs since it would inflate overall cost estimates and produce faulty conclusions. The most commonly used cost perspectives include patient, private third-party payer (ie, commercial insurance company), government payer, and society. A societal perspective takes into account all costs irrespective of who pays for them. Several economic evaluation reporting standards mandate that a clearly defined perspective be stated in the methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813487850">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813487850"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813487850">5</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section9-0194599813487850">
<title>Cost Collection</title>
<p>Cost collection can either be patient specific or non–patient specific. Patient-specific costs are “stochastic” since they vary in quantity and frequency between patients. Non–patient-specific costs are “deterministic” since they are the same among patients (ie, all patients receiving an intervention are assigned the same cost). On the basis of the type of cost collection, Drummond and Coyle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813487850">6</xref></sup> defined 3 approaches to cost collection: deterministic, partially stochastic, and wholly stochastic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599813487850"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). Although a stochastic approach can be technically challenging, a major advantage is that it yields very accurate patient-level costing data and facilitates statistical and subgroup analysis. A wholly stochastic cost collection should be the aim of researchers undertaking an economic evaluation and is typically performed alongside prospective clinical trials.</p>

<p>When a stochastic costing approach is selected, there are 3 broad “steps” for performing the cost collection process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813487850">7</xref></sup>:</p>

</list>
<p>This section will discuss the methods and principles surrounding each step. When the investigator decides to use a deterministic costing approach, steps 1 and 2 are irrelevant since the total cost is assigned at the group level, typically using large administrative databases.</p>
<sec id="section10-0194599813487850">
<title>Step 1. Defining Relevant Resources</title>
<p>This step is highly dependent on defining the study perspective. Cost inputs will differ depending on which perspective is chosen; therefore, it must be explicitly stated at the beginning of the economic evaluation. A common approach for defining relevant resources is to map out patient progress through the clinical pathway and identify all key resources consumed at the various phases. When evaluating a cost-effectiveness study, it is important to ask yourself if all relevant consumed resources were identified. Once all relevant resources are defined, the investigators can proceed to resource quantification.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0194599813487850">
<title>Step 2. Quantifying Resource Consumption</title>
<p>Resource quantification is most accurate when collected prospectively. Bottom-up micro-costing is a stochastic costing approach that prospectively measures patient-level resource consumption. This methodology is typically performed alongside a clinical trial. The major advantages of this approach are the following:</p>

<p>Enables subgroup analyses</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Can perform accurate statistical tests to handle uncertainty</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Although bottom-up micro-costing is extremely precise, it requires a tremendous amount of resources to implement, and there are several potential pitfalls from collecting cost data alongside a clinical trial. Authors need to be aware of these potential pitfalls and account for them in the final analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599813487850"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>For example, during a clinical trial of radiation vs transoral robotic surgery for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), all predefined relevant resources consumed by each individual patient would be collected alongside the effectiveness component of the clinical trial. A retrospective quantification could be performed using a chart review, but similar to the inherent flaws with retrospective effectiveness data, there are flaws in resource quantification since cost data would include only what is available in the chart as opposed to prospectively collecting all predefined relevant resources.</p>
<p>Since economic evaluations are concerned with the total therapeutic impact over a patient’s lifetime, all relevant resources consumed should ideally be quantified and tracked forever. Since collecting resource utilization over a patient’s lifetime is not realistic, assumptions pertaining to the quantity of future resources consumed beyond the study end point will need to be generated. A discussion on future costs will be performed later in this article in the section on controversial topics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0194599813487850">
<title>Step 3. Defining Resource Value</title>
<p>Resource valuation is simply the assignment of a monetary cost to a given resource. The monetary cost should equal the opportunity cost and typically reflects the payment provided from the respective payer. During micro-costing techniques, defining accurate monetary costs for individual resources (such as pharmaceuticals) can be challenging but often uses average sales price, which reflects a wide range of purchasers’ payments. Furthermore, it is important to remember that resource valuation will depend on the perspective of the economic evaluation. In other words, the same resource may vary in valuation depending on which perspective the study assumes. For example, the valuation of a paranasal sinus computed tomography (CT) scan from the perspective of a private third-party payer will be the payment it provides the health care facility for the patient to acquire the CT, whereas the valuation from the patient payer perspective will be the price he or she pays out of pocket to acquire the sinus CT (ie, co-payment and deductible). Therefore, researchers must ensure all resource valuations accurately reflect the perspective that is acquiring the cost.</p>
<p>Another important concept to recognize during resource valuation is to not confuse charge-based valuation with payment-based valuation. Health care institutions commonly provide charges to third-party payers (such as commercial insurance companies or government-sponsored payers such as Medicare), and these charges do not reflect the payments provided by the payers. For example, in the United States, hospitals’ real costs may be 65% to 70% of the charges to private insurers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813487850">8</xref></sup> Therefore, economic evaluations that use charge-based costs will inaccurately overestimate the real costs and produce faulty conclusions. Researchers must recognize when valuation is derived from charge-based costs and then appropriately adjust the price to reflect real costs.</p>
<p>When the economic evaluation uses a deterministic approach to costing, individual resource valuation is not needed since costs are defined at a group level. This type of costing is sometimes referred to as “gross-costing” and draws upon fee or payment schedules. Hospitals’ fee schedules reflect the charge provided to third-party payers; therefore, they must be adjusted to reflect true payment received. Costing accuracy for diagnostic-related group (DRG) costing depends on the homogeneity of case groups and quality of administrative cost accounting. One major disadvantage of DRG-based costing is the potential to miss costs associated with adverse events since they would often be coded under a different case group. Thus, DRG costing often underestimates the true cost.</p>
<p>An example of DRG costing is the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) database produced by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813487850">9</xref></sup> The HCUP incorporates data from 6 national databases and aggregates individual patient-level data into DRG-related groups. The HCUP databases contain total “charges” for each hospital encounter, regardless of payer. In other words, it represents the total amount the hospital billed for the entire stay and does not reflect payment that the payer provided the hospital. Therefore, one disadvantage with HCUP cost valuation is that it is based on hospital charges rather then true costs. Researchers using HCUP data must be aware of this disadvantage and convert the charge-based costs into true payment costs using the cost-to-charge ratio (CCR) files to avoid overestimating resource valuation per diagnosis.</p>
<p>The MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCE) database is another commonly used database that has collected medical and drug insurance claims on approximately 180 million patients and their dependents who have commercial insurance, Medicare supplemental, or Medicaid plan. Large subsets of the MarketScan population have their medical and drug claims linked to hospital records, dental claims, productivity (incidental absence, short-term disability, long-term disability, workers compensation) records, health risk assessment surveys, and outpatient laboratory results. One disadvantage of MarketScan CCE cost data is that they primarily reflect commercial third-party payers (~83% of claims); therefore, researchers performing an economic evaluation from the perspective of the government must ensure they select out the Medicare/Medicaid claims. Another disadvantage of the MarketScan database is that it will not capture cost information for uninsured patients. A summary of common health care databases with costing information is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0194599813487850"><bold>Table 4</bold></xref>.</p>

<p>The least accurate methods of deterministic resource valuation include disease-specific per diem and average per diem costing. These last two methods are rarely utilized in economic evaluations because there is significant input heterogeneity and they provide very inaccurate costing valuation which inherently produces inappropriate cost-effectiveness conclusions.</p>

<title>Discounting Costs</title>
<p>Time preference refers to the advantage of accruing costs in the future rather than today since a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future. Therefore, during economic evaluations, all future costs need to be discounted. A positive rate of time preference for costs exists primarily due to the consistent demonstration of positive economic growth over time.</p>
<p>The calculation for discounting costs is as follows: discounted cost = future cost/(1 + discount rate)<sup>n</sup>, where n is the number of years in the future. Most panels recommend using cost discount rates between 3% and 5%. Based on the best available evidence, Drummond et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813487850">12</xref></sup> provide 3 recommendations on how to present discounted cost data in economic evaluations:</p>
<list id="list3-0194599813487850" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Present costs and consequences in their “undiscounted” form, so that others can apply different rates if needed.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Present data using the discount rate prescribed in the jurisdiction concerned, if one exists.</p>

<title>Handling Cost Uncertainty</title>
<p>Because of the inherent imperfections in research data, statistical tests and sensitivity analysis to evaluate data uncertainty are a critical component to all economic evaluations. The most common areas of uncertainty associated with health care costing are as follows:</p>
<list id="list4-0194599813487850" list-type="order">

</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Discounting rates</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Statistical methods for handling uncertainty can be performed when using patient-level data, and this is a major advantage of adopting a stochastic approach to costing. A full discussion of statistical methods of handling cost uncertainty is beyond the scope of this article, and interested readers should refer to the guidelines by Johnston et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813487850">8</xref></sup> titled “Assessing the Costs of Healthcare Technologies in Clinical Trials.”</p>
<p>Sensitivity analysis is when key variables for both costs and effects are altered and the changes to final outcomes are evaluated. Since all cost data have imperfections, it is imperative to determine how robust the results are in the face of changing data. Understanding and quantifying the degree of uncertainty will provide policy makers with the information necessary to make the most accurate resource allocation decisions. Although there are several forms of sensitivity analysis, the <italic>probabilistic analysis</italic> is considered the most robust and comprehensive method of handling uncertainty in economic evaluations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599813487850">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813487850"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599813487850"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813487850"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599813487850">17</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section19-0194599813487850">
<title>Future Costs</title>
<p>The definition of “future” costs is controversial but necessary to consider during health economic evaluations. Based on altering the course of a patient’s life, future costs have been categorized into 4 different groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813487850"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599813487850">18</xref></sup>:</p>

<list-item>
<p>Unrelated future costs</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0194599813487850-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Related future costs are resources consumed to treat a disease process that results from the original treatment provided, such as treating a subsequent frontal sinus mucocele following an endoscopic anterior skull base resection. Unrelated future costs are resources consumed to treat a disease process that was not the result of the original intervention, such as managing colon cancer in a patient who underwent a previous endoscopic anterior skull base resection. Future related and unrelated costs should be contextualized into years of life lived anyways or occurring in the additional years of life.</p>
<p>The inclusion or exclusion of future costs is highly controversial, and most health economists would lean toward the following: (1) inclusion of “related” future costs in both life lived anyways and in additional life lived and (2) exclusion of “unrelated” future costs in both life lived anyways and in additional years of life. Although there are no guidelines on handling future costs, a strong economic evaluation usually includes related future costs and then performs a sensitivity analysis that includes unrelated future costs.</p>

<title>Productivity Costs</title>
<p>From the patient perspective, productivity cost relates to the time lost from either employment or leisure time during management of a disease. There is a debate regarding the role and the type of methodology for estimating productivity costs. Generally, the role depends on the perspective for costing. When researchers have elected to measure productivity costs, the 2 most common methods for estimating productivity changes include the human capital approach and the friction cost approach (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0194599813487850"><bold>Table 6</bold></xref>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The human capital approach is easier to implement; however, several major disadvantages limit its use in economic evaluations. First, short-term losses of productivity are often compensated by either the worker when he or she returns or by another colleague (thus lacking a net loss of productivity). Second, short-term losses of productivity are lost at the margin and are lower than the average wage (this assumes that jobs have more and less important tasks). Last, long-term losses of productivity will just result in hiring a replacement worker who was previously unemployed. For these reasons, it is usually argued that the human capital approach will overestimate the cost associated with productivity changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599813487850">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599813487850">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The friction cost approach is believed to more accurately represent productivity costs since it assumes the cost depends on the time taken to organize a replacement worker to restore the original level of productivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599813487850">21</xref></sup> This “friction period” will likely differ between industries depending on the level of training required. A major challenge with the friction method is defining accurate friction period values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599813487850">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Last, when productivity changes are included in the economic evaluation, there is a risk of double-counting costs since patients may include the impact of their lost income or loss of leisure time in their health assessments for the intervention. This double-counting will tend to reduce the overall cost-effectiveness of the intervention in favor of another intervention with improved productivity outcomes. Although there will continue to be a debate on how to handle productivity costs, Drummond et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813487850">12</xref></sup> have provided the following general recommendations to guide researchers:</p>
<list id="list6-0194599813487850" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Report productivity changes separately so that the decision maker can make a decision on whether or not to include them.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Report the “quantities” (ie, days lost from work, hours lost from work, etc) separately from the “prices” (ie, wages).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Consider whether wages adequately reflect loss of productivity at the margins and provide an adjustment if needed (eg, friction cost approach).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>With the increasing need to critically evaluate the cost-effectiveness of our clinical interventions, it is imperative that clinicians understand common cost collection methodologies. Due to several advantages, authors should strive for undertaking a stochastic costing approach and be aware of potential pitfalls associated with collecting costs alongside a clinical trial. The inclusion of future costs and patient productivity losses is controversial and is typically evaluated during the sensitivity analysis. To optimize data transparency and provide policy makers with the information necessary to make informed resource allocation decisions, standard cost reporting recommendations should be followed.</p>
