Evangelical Christian development
organizations have long realized that mission effectiveness is largely contingent
on the skills and abilities possessed by their human capital. A crucial way
to create that human capital is through development-oriented academic programs,
especially those focused on developing skills required by grassroots personnel
and their support organizations. A review of Eastern University's MBA in
economic development, celebrating its 25th anniversary, provides six conclusions
and recommendations for implementing and assessing effective NGO management
educational programs.

Introduction
Evangelical Christian development organizations have long realized that mission
effectiveness is largely contingent on the skills and abilities possessed
by their human capital. The vital roles non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
fulfill in poverty alleviation clarify the importance of properly prepared
personnel. NGOs primarily exist to reduce poverty by affecting a process through
which people progressively gain control over survival, well-being and empowerment
(Fowler,
147
1997).
As is noted by Ostwald in this issue of Transformation, their effective battle
against poverty is complex, addressing its root causes, which include the
complex, interlocking factors of physical weakness, vulnerability, isolation
and powerless- ness (Chambers, 1994). Additionally, because evangelical Christian
organizations acknowledge the existence of a spiritual dimension to the human
condition, that element adds both challenge and complexity to the approaches
and strategies of evangelical development organizations. The roles development
NGOs play and the tasks they perform in address- ing social problems determines
the management capabilities they must possess. Many, not necessarily exclusive,
opinions exist on what those roles and tasks are. Alan Fowler 's 1997 analysis
may be the most comprehensive as he identifies development NGO roles at both
the micro- and macro-levels of society: •~ Micro-level~ roles~ include:~
empowerment~ of~ communities~ and~ individuals,~ strengthening the capacity
of local institutions and sustaining improvements in physical well-being.
Micro-level tasks include: material services, social services, nancial
services, capacity building, process facilitation, fostering linkages, reconciliation
and mediation. •~ Macro-level~roles~include:~reform~of~the~international~order,~reform~of~public~service~
and public policies, restructuring of the political economy. Macro-level tasks
include: political advocacy, lobbying, public education, public mobilization,
monitoring compliance, reconciliation and mediation (Fowler, 1997: 5). Most
of the globe's more than one-hundred NGO sector serving academic programs
focus on the macro-level development roles that Fowler identified. For whatever
reason, few development-oriented academic programs have determined to equally
emphasize NGOs' micro-level roles, those required by grassroots personnel
and their support organizations. One exception is Eastern University (a comprehensive
Christian university of nearly 4000 students located near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
USA), which in 1984 launched the first Christian graduate degree for grassroots
development practitioners with its MBA in eco- nomic development. Eastern
University's economic development program founders included soci- ologist
Tony Campolo, economist and former corporate CEO, Linwood Geiger, and the
eventual president of World Vision and US ambassador for religious free- dom,
Robert Seiple. Advising them was Al Whittaker, CEO of the global micro- finance
development organization, Opportunity International. This impressive cast
attracted students from around the globe, resulting in hundreds of alumni
engaged in works of service in more than 60 countries and 50 American cities.
At the program's 20th anniversary celebration in 2004, it was calculated that
pro- gram students and graduates had helped create more than one million jobs
in the world's poorest communities and countries. After a flourishing first
decade, the Eastern University MBA in economic devel- opment began to experience
a host of administrative challenges. Then the tragic events of 11 September
2001 stifled international student supply and threatened the program's viability
in its traditional form. Eastern University administrators intervened with
a study soliciting input from internal stakeholders, program alumni and external
advisors and formulated a plan containing corrective actions. Five years into
the economic development program's reinvention, a program evaluation study
was carried out to determine if the essential elements were in place and operating
in accordance with the plans put forth in 2002.

This
article analyzes this history of Eastern's MBA in economic development. It
does not cover some of the foundational aspects of the program, such as the
integration of Christian faith into the curriculum and the emphasis on the
cohort model. Rather, it looks to present and explain the conclusions and
recommenda- tions of that program evaluation, with an eye towards shedding
light on the key elements necessary for implementing and assessing effective
NGO management educational programs. It begins with a review of NGO management
literature, takes a brief look at the history of Eastern's program, describes
the challenges that arose and the corrective actions prescribed, and concludes
with an evaluation of the steps taken and the insights and recommendations
that can be drawn from this evaluation and applied to development training
degree programs anywhere. Framework: NGO Management Literature In 1998, Peter
Drucker predicted that non-profit organizations will become increasingly important
in the 21st century as they increasingly assume tasks once thought to be the
responsibility of governments (Drucker, 1998: 131). Anheier and Salamon reinforced
this point of view that same year: Long recognized as instruments of relief
and promoters of human rights, such organizations have recently come to be
viewed also as critical con- tributors to basic economic growth and to the
broader civic infrastructure. (Anheier and Salamon, 1998: 1) However, little
if any academic literature has been produced on the distinctive management
issues of NGOs in developing countries. This gap has frustrated the construction
of a body of knowledge required for fueling effective NGO lead- ership practices
and constructing NGO management curricula. Chang in 2005 expands on this challenge:
As more NGO people are devoting themselves to working in underde- veloped
foreign lands, little research has been done on how to prepare these corps
to work in a different culture and environment. Training for those NGO international
workers is critical because it does not merely help improve service quality
for local people; equally important, it can help these service providers understand
how to maintain safety, prevent accidents, and avoid cultural conflicts. (Chang,
2005: 441) In this vacuum, organizations have had to rely heavily on reinterpreting
knowl- edge from the for-profit sector and observing cases of cross-cultural
applications of for-profit principles and practices (Goodall et al., 2004:
311). Chang cautions, however, that `there are limits to the extent to which
voluntary organizations can follow the same standards as profit organizations'
(Chang, 2005: 448). While they share a body of knowledge in common by virtue
of both being organizations, NGOs are largely distinct from for-profit organizations
and the MBAs that prepare business leaders. Recently, Collins acknowledged
this with the publication of a monograph to address the peculiar management
and leader- ship issues of social sector (also known as non-profit and NGO)
organizations, which he admitted overlooking in his renowned business text,
Good to Great. In it, he identified leadership and financial management issues
as key distinguishers between the for-profit and non-profit sectors (Collins,
2005: 11):
149
In a
nonprofit organization, a changing work environment, the often part- time
nature of the professional staff, the scarcity of budgetary resources, and
the inherent limitations of the volunteer role make for a climate of `impermanence
and improvisation'. (Hutchinson and Quartaro, 1993: 95) Both NGOs and for-profit
organizations may be described as organized, private, and self-governing organizations.
NGOs, however, are differentiated by being large- ly voluntary in nature and
nonprofit-distributing in character (Anheier and Salamon, 1998: 20), even
though in the development field they are becoming increasingly pro- fessionalized.
Additionally, NGOs in developing countries tend to arouse greater government
suspicion than for-profit businesses and, hence, encounter `increased government
scrutiny' and `control' (Anheier and Salamon 1998: 360). These differences
call for the creation and nurturing of effective NGO lead- ership education
programs and a body of NGO management knowledge to guide the accelerating
opportunities and expectations inherent in that sector. The Eastern University
MBA in economic development program's focus is one such degree with a long
history that is well known in evangelical circles for produc- ing graduates
who go on to work with Christian development organizations. On occasion of
the 25th anniversary of this program, it is fitting to assess whether and
how this program is strengthening the effectiveness of development-oriented
NGOs through building management capacity, and what can be learned through
this assessment that might be of help for other institutions which might feel
called to engage in a similar educational endeavor. Background In the same
year that Muhammed Yunus founded the Grameen Bank to extend microloans to
the poor in Bangladesh, Eastern University sought the blessing of its governing
authorities for a similarly revolutionary program. The MBA in economic development
was approved in 1984 as a Christian program designed to train entrepreneurs
to impart economically significant service to distressed com- munities in
developing nations and American cities. Many at the time, and since, have
hailed it as Eastern University's flagship program for the way in which it
expresses the University's vision to be `socially active evangelicalism's
pre- eminent institution for human, economic and faith-based community develop-
ment' (Eastern University, n.d.). As stated earlier, the program was formed
by sociologist Tony Campolo, economist and corporate CEO Linwood Geiger, and
the eventual CEO of World Vision and US ambassador for global religious freedom,
Robert Seiple. The pro- gram engaged people well known within and beyond the
Christian missionary, relief and development and corporate communities. Alfred
Whittaker, CEO of Opportunity International, served as the program's first
advisory council chair. Program faculty included Samuel Escobar, Ron Sider,
James Engel, David Fraser and Jayakumar Christian. In its first decade, the
program also seized the atten- tion of several philanthropists, including
Fortune 500 CEOs and internationally- known financier, Sir John Templeton,
whose family established the fledgling program's first endowed chair in Christian
Service through Entrepreneurship. This MBA in economic development attracted
students from around the globe, resulting in hundreds of alumni working in
more than 60 countries and 50 American cities. Over time, the program at Eastern
University grew through three focused strategies: new program development,
partnership development
150
and
a creative model for hybrid program delivery. The MBA in economic devel- opment
birthed many academic siblings both at Eastern University and beyond its borders.
The masters-level programs in nonprofit management, organizational leadership,
international development and urban studies at Eastern University were all
inspired by this program, as was the undergraduate degree in interna- tional
economic development. Entrepreneurial faculty created numerous research and
training centers, which enjoyed all manner of short and sustained lifespans.
Perhaps most notable was the Center for Organizational Excellence (COE), which
was created by James Engel and staffed by economic development students and
faculty. COE has since become Development Associates International (DAI) and
now plays an important role in assuring access to leadership training opportunities
for Christians in vari- ous developing countries. The economic development
program was also replicated in some of the many organizations where students
plied their emerging skills as interns. Esperanza USA, now the largest Christian
Hispanic community development corporation in the States, ventured on its
first urban development project twenty years ago (a combination laundromat/literacy
training center) after Eastern development interns performed a feasibility
study and composed a business plan. Finally, the program has also seen itself
replicated as alumni created institu- tions of higher learning and development
programs in disenfranchised com- munities around the globe, including John
Oduru's Boyer College in Ghana and Betty Glover-Palmer 's Institute for Community
and International Development at Beulah Heights University in Atlanta, Georgia.
The economic development program has also grown through maintaining a commitment
to a partnership culture. This partnership culture was nurtured in two ways:
through internships and program delivery models. In terms of the first, from
its outset the program realized that Christian leaders of grassroots develop-
ment organizations required fieldwork with like-minded organizations in order
to be impactful program alumni. Early program partners included urban non-
profits in the Philadelphia area, such as Habitat for Humanity, Hispanic Clergy
of Philadelphia and the African-American Churches' Center for Urban Resources.
Internships morphed to field-based education and international partners were
added for three-month field assignments, including Opportunity International
and Mennonite Economic Development Associates. The first successful international
partnership in program delivery was with World Vision International (WVI).
Together, Eastern University and WVI cre- ated a joint `Pathways to Leadership'
program for WVI's indigenous country leaders, which Habitat for Humanity joined
shortly thereafter. The success of the Pathways program required a borderless,
or hybrid, approach to education, which technology made possible. In the hybrid
model, students meet their profes- sors in a classroom, but for an abbreviated
20 hours (or 2.5 days) of face-to-face instruction for each of 4–5
courses. This time is preceded by some degree of stu- dent preparation and
followed by eight weeks of on-line instruction and course work. The face-to-face
instruction takes place in a residency of about 18–20 days, conveniently
located on their continent. Residencies allow students to have 20 hours of
course time with each of the courses taken during a given year of study. Students
take vacation or release time to attend the residency and then return to their
workplace. The rest of the year is divided into eight-week follow-up peri-
ods for each of these classes. This delivery process is repeated each year
until the
151
program
is completed. With this educational model, students can benefit from a quality
North American education while studying in their home countries and continue
in the workplace (LeQuire and Ridington, 2006). The hybrid delivery method
has been a positive undertaking for both students and the University. The
University has a new avenue for fulfilling its mission and its commitments
to justice, community and the world. From the students' point- of-view, the
distance delivery option allows them to avoid the expense, interrup- tion
and bureaucratic barriers of coming to study in the United States. As stated
earlier, hybrid delivery permits students to continue in the workplace as
they progress toward a Master of Business Administration degree. The same
commitment that led to this program's genesis yielded great rewards at the
point of its greatest challenge. In reaction to the 11 September 2001 events,
the USA took measures that effectively closed its borders to aspiring interna-
tional students and stifled (for a while) the overseas work of US-based develop-
ment organizations, both secular and Christian alike. With no students available
for study on campus in 2002, the overseas hybrid delivery program promised
a path forward, but proved over time to be much, much more. The success of
the Pathways program encouraged the development of other hybrid options. In
addi- tion to the MBA, soon a Master of Arts in International Development
and a Master of Arts in Organizational Leadership were added in the hybrid
format. Both of these degree programs were attractive to prospective development
students due to the fact that they were two- instead of three-year programs.
Additionally, the MA degrees have fewer prerequisites in the challenging disciplines
of economics and statistics. These MA options attracted NGO managers because
they repre- sented savings of both time and money (LeQuire and Ridington,
2006). For sev- eral years, these three hybrid options have been available
to students interested in taking their annual residencies in southern Africa.
A Spanish language version will come on line with Latin America residencies
in 2009. Now that the hybrid delivery is seen to be the preferred means of
future program growth, additional residencies and regions are planned for
2010 and beyond. The global challenges of 2001 and programmatic interruption
of 2002 provided opportunity to reconsider and reconfigure a consequential,
yet aging program. What follows is an account of some of the program challenges
that emerged in its second decade along with highlights from the corresponding
plan of corrective action. Identification of Challenges and Corrective Actions
The research for this article centered on a comprehensive review of the program's
documents and records, along with targeted interviews. Organizational docu-
ments and records can provide a valuable source of information for social
science research. Minutes of meetings, budgetary documents, planning reports,
progress reviews and the like typically serve to enhance accountability in
an organization because they provide a systematic picture of the past and
are typically available to the public (Denscombe, 2003). Eastern University's
MBA in economic development program, like many aca- demic programs no doubt,
knew no shortage of words or paper. Multiple pages of documentary evidence
covering several decades portrayed a program that experienced its share of
celebrations and challenges. After enjoying the long ten- ure of its first
permanent director and strong enrollments, the economic develop- ment program
cycled through four directors in its second decade. The graduate recruiter
position turned over with similar frequency as the program and Eastern
152
University
matured. In a program that placed a premium on relationship-building with
its international clientele, these developments resulted in a perception of
program instability in the global marketplace. The retirements of the program's
pioneering, high visibility faculty similarly impacted the market's concerns
about the program. Predictably, enrollments trended downward. Leadership transitions
added challenges to program administration. Relational interruptions between
faculty, staff and students contributed to breakdowns in advising, scheduling
and immigration, which translated to students failing to graduate or satisfying
placement expectations. As a result, fewer than half of those entering the
program typically returned to manage NGOs in their home countries within an
acceptable timeframe While the curriculum as a whole was strong, students
cited the need for more global perspective in their classes along with more
training opportunities in the program. Additionally, the faculty replacing
the program's creators challenged the University's original notion that international
and urban economic develop- ment constituted a single coherent discipline.
The University administration intervened in order to seek solutions to the
pro- gram's challenges. They gathered input from internal stakeholders including
faculty, staff and students. They queried MBA program alumni for their assessment
of the program and related suggestions for improvement. They engaged graduate
students to conduct benchmarking research and competitive analysis. They also
hosted a retreat with several NGO development leaders, known as the NGO Industry
Leader group, in order ascertain the future direction of Christian development
practice and the corollary workforce requirements. As a result of this input,
the University in 2002 approved the following path of action (Birmingham and
Lowery, 2001): 1 The program would be separated into two distinct degrees,
International Economic Development and Urban Economic Development, which would
be delivered in distinct contexts by distinct faculties. Additionally, the
programs would be staffed by distinct administrators, with the international
economic development program being located in Eastern University's School
for Leadership and Development (SLD) and the urban economic development program
being located in a separate department of Eastern's graduate school, the School
for Social Change. 2 The international economic development program would
continue to be offered on campus, but an additional delivery system would
be created in the form of an overseas-based distance programs with limited
residencies in partnership with indigenous organizations. 3 The international
development program director position, having been recently vacated, would
be recon gured to satisfy new program realities and be lled as soon as possible. 4 The faculty would conduct a formal and
thorough review of the curriculum in light of changing issues in international
development, to ensure the: (a) existence of updated syllabi, (b) utilization
of updated and relevant texts, (c) inclusion of case- study methodology in
teaching and (d) development of case studies as part of the program assignments.
5 A concentrated marketing effort would be executed for the start-up initiative,
made possible by increased budgetary resources for marketing during scal 2002 to prepare for a scal 2003 new program launch.
6 A coordinator would be assigned to establish an international alumni network,
a formal network of alumni on each continent that would serve as the voluntary
recruitment staff for all SLD programs, including economic development. 7
SLD would establish the Institute for the Advancement of Development as a
vehicle for creating knowledge and collecting research on best practices in
development.
153
Five
years after this reinvention of the economic development program, in 2007,
a program evaluation of the MBA in economic development was done to see whether
all the essential elements were in place and operating in accordance with
the plans put forth in 2002, and what might be learned from the process. It
is to the results of that evaluation that we now turn. Evaluation of the Steps
Taken The objective of program evaluation research was to establish whether
fidelity existed between activities and plan, and wherever applicable to understand
the reasons for alternative activities. Data were generated through interviews
and focus groups with current and former administrators, faculty, staff, students
and alumni. In what follows, we look at each of the planned interventions
in detail, and evaluate them based on the data collected. First Planned Intervention:
the program would be separated into two dis- tinct degrees, International
Economic Development and Urban Economic Development, which would be delivered
in distinct contexts by distinct faculties. Additionally, the programs would
be staffed by distinct admin- istrators, with the international economic development
program being located in the SLD and the urban economic development program
being located in the School for Social Change. This first planned intervention
was already underway prior to the produc- tion of the plan, and it was carried
out fully. Data collected on this first planned intervention through interviews
and focus groups yielded a common focus by the respondents on the reasons
for the separation of the two degrees more than anything else. Several identified
a philosophical divide between the program's founder and current faculty.
Others attributed the changes to internal politics, a clash of personalities
among faculty and mission drift. Most agreed that the existing program experienced
financial shortfalls, and something had to be done to enhance the long-term
growth and development potential for both the urban and international programs.
In fact, it was hoped that the possibility of expanded program and marketing
partnerships would be enhanced by the existence of separately organized schools,
each having its own focus and programs. While the proposed separation of the
program into international and urban schools with distinct administrations
and locations was executed as planned, based on the multiple reasons cited
earlier, neither program thrived in isolation, with the urban program suffering
the greatest decline. As a result, in 2007, the original decision was reversed,
with the urban and international development programs being reunited as concentration
options within the original economic development degree. Second planned intervention:
the international economic development program would continue to be offered
on campus, but would be aug- mented by the addition of an overseas-based distance
version with lim- ited residencies offered in partnership with indigenous
organizations. The second planned intervention was also implemented as projected,
and the reasons for this intervention were also clearly outlined by input
from the admin- istration, students, and NGO industry leaders. In his rationale
for mandating an intervention with the economic development program, the Dean
observed that,
154
`too
many international students do not return to their countries or continents
of origin to use the skills and concepts of economic development for the poor'
(Fraser, 2000). Students, on the other hand, focused on the benefits of having
access to a dis- tance learning economic development program in their own
country as opposed to traveling to the USA to study full time. These benefits
included less expense, greater access, family-friendly, convenience, culturally-sensitive,
praxis-based, and minimally disruptive to work and service. The same students,
however, noted several challenges to distance education, all of which related
to the expense of accessing and sporadic availability of online technology
throughout much of the developing world. The suggestions from the NGO Industry
Leader focus group also provided great impetus to this second planned intervention.
The NGO leaders were con- cerned with the extensive time away from the field
required by the US-based development program. They called for `appropriate
education', which included the following suggestions: two week to two month
intensives, education of staff while continuing to work, traveling `road shows'
to different global locations at `off' times, modularized skill-based programs
taught by practitioners, and gradu- ate level quality and intensity delivered
in a flexible and non-traditional format. A report of an NGO phone survey
with 14 organizations revealed similar findings in terms of concerns and ideas
for a different kind of graduate study format. The hybrid distance based format
called for by the second planned interven- tion was successfully executed
over a period of several years and built upon knowledge gained through prior
failures and false starts. A hybrid distance learn- ing classroom venture
met with disappointment when recorded classes proved to be little more than
`talking heads'. The idea of relocating the entire economic development program
to a developing country did not get off the ground because of fears by the University
administration that staff would feel dislocated and disconnected from North
American prospective students, and that the program would `disintegrate'.
It was not until March 2005 that the format for the hybrid distance learning
program was implemented with the first overseas residency in Durbanville,
South Africa, as a compliment to the traditional campus program. However,
realizing the final aspect of the second planned intervention, `in partnership
with indigenous organizations', proved most challenging. The NGO phone survey
report mentioned earlier also identified the importance of partner- ships
to NGOs. Eleven of the 14 surveyed organizations reported having both formal
and informal partnerships. Indeed, partnerships had been growing in importance
for Eastern's economic development program for some time. Several partnerships
had emerged with universities in Russia and China in the mid- 1990s, followed
by the first degree-bearing partnerships established with World Vision International
and with Cape Town–based, Cornerstone Christian College. Not all of
these, however, were successful, the failed attempts with indigenous partnerships
sharing the common denominator that they were with unaccred- ited or under-financed
institutions. The successful ones were built with western NGOs such as World
Vision, English Language Institute of China and Habitat for Humanity. The
overseas residencies have realized four annual cycles in Africa, and a Latin
American residency in the Spanish language is planned for 2009. The understand-
ing of `indigenous partnership' is evolving as well. Presently, the University's
part- ner in Africa is Stellenbosch University's School of Theology, and the
arrangement
155
is
primarily contractual in nature. Potential partners in other parts of the
world are also indigenous master 's and doctoral degree granting institutions.
In summary, even while the second planned intervention was satisfied, the
hybrid distance based delivery format and the partnership aspects continue
to be adjusted and explored, building on the learning that is occurring. The
campus program is thriving, while an overseas-based, hybrid distance version
of the cur- riculum with limited residencies and an indigenous partner has
been successfully launched in Africa. Third planned intervention: the international
development program director position, having been recently vacated, would
be reconfigured to satisfy new program realities and be filled as soon as
possible. The research shows that the economic development program experienced
a high turnover rate at the program director level. Between 1984 and 2002,
the aver- age tenure for a program director was just over two years, with
tenures deceler- ating toward the end of that time continuum. The major reasons
identified for the high turnover rate were lack of administrative support,
staff conflict, and being overworked. A number of the Directors interviewed
indicated that they left because they had grown too tired. The urgency of
this situation, given the premium on relationship building across cultures
and the role leaders play in this, was highlighted in a planning document:
In a program recruiting and educating people coming from highly rela- tionship-based
cultures, our turnover has damaged our maintenance of relationships and has
given a world-wide impression of program instabil- ity. (Birmingham and Lowery,
2001: 2) The third planned intervention was quickly satisfied as one of the
participants in the NGO leaders roundtable agreed to assume a program leadership
position. Soon thereafter, however, the situation unraveled, there was a separation,
and the position was reopened and remained vacant for several years. There
was no shortage of theories among faculty and staff concerning the difficulties
with locating and retaining an international development director. Several
pointed to the fact that prior directors had not been academicians, and had
therefore struggled with faculty teaching under them and in controlling the
curriculum and programs as a whole. This changed in 2006 when the international
development program director's position was filled with a candidate who bore
faculty status, and who was also given an endowed chair. To date, the director
has stayed in that position, meaning that the third planned intervention has
been successfully implemented after a false start. Fourth planned intervention:
The faculty would conduct a formal and thorough review of the curriculum in
light of changing issues in inter- national development, to ensure the: (a)
availability of updated syllabi, (b) utilization of updated and relevant texts,
(c) inclusion of case-study methodology in teaching and (d) development of
case studies as part of the program assignments. Over the life of the economic
development program, faculty initiated several assessments of the curriculum.
In fact, in 2001, an international students' focus
156
group
expressed their gratitude for the efforts undertaken in curriculum review
while they were there. At the same time, these students balanced their apprecia-
tion with an expression of concern that the texts they had used were less
than current and were too `western' in their focus. The evaluation affirmed
their concerns. As part of the evaluation, econom- ic development course syllabi
from the 2000–1 year were examined, and of the required texts listed,
17 were less than 3-years old. However, 21 texts were between 4- and 10-years
old and 13 texts were from before 1990. In addition, of the texts required
for economic development program in 2000–1, only 19 percent were from
non-western authors. While it is not always easy to ascertain contem- porary
relevancy, especially when many of the older titles are reputed to be `clas-
sic texts', there is no doubt that the program before the strategic plan was
put into place showed shortcomings in this area. An additional problem identified,
although perhaps more of an administra- tive problem rather than one that
affected the students' learning, was a lack of consistency in the curriculum
itself. The highly entrepreneurial environment of Eastern University and within
this particular program is extremely attractive for those who like to start
new things. At the same time, this can lead to incredible complexity and inconsistency.
For example, a former program director explained how difficult it was to advise
students due to her predecessors' frequent revisions of the program's curricular
requirements. A review of the MBA in college catalogs confirms such a consistent
pattern of curricular change. As part of its comments on the curriculum, the
NGO leader focus group cri- tiqued the economic development program for lacking
an internship, or expe- riential component, noting that students should experience
a minimum of three months of field experience as a part of their education.
This recommendation was instituted in the campus program shortly thereafter
and is currently the final requirement for graduation. The overseas residency
students are exempted from the requirement if they already serve in an NGO,
as almost all of them do. Finally, respondents had different opinions on the
use of case studies in teaching and their production by students, on the latter
two points. Newer faculty members made greater utilization of case studies
than their more veteran counterparts, but little progress has been realized
on the production of case studies by students. In summary, the evidence suggests
that the results are mixed in terms of the fourth planned intervention. Even
though curricula were constantly tweaked, their required texts appeared to
have been less current than one might expect. Under the new program director,
this has been remedied. The case study method, and production by students,
has not been as strong as it might have been, while an internship component
to the curriculum has been added and the feedback has been extremely positive.
Fifth planned intervention: a concentrated marketing effort would be executed
for the start-up initiative, made possible by increased budgetary resources
for marketing during fiscal 2002 to prepare for a fiscal 2003 new program
launch. From 1996–2001, the economic development program enrollment
dropped 33 percent. A phone survey of 14 NGOs in development indicated that
while 11 of 14 organizations surveyed had some knowledge of the program, no
more than 3
157
were
aware of its global reach. Faculty and staff reported in interviews that the
program had no coherent marketing plan and lacked the necessary budgeted resources
for adequate promotional activity. In part, this was due to internal, structural
challenges. Budgetary control and marketing personnel lay outside the program
and were shared with other departments. But the deeper, more chronic marketing
challenge was the inability to answer the question of how a program markets
to the whole world on any kind of budget. Surprisingly, none of the interviewees
or focus groups could speak definitively to the question of whether extra
resources were made available to the program to carry out this fifth planned
intervention. A review of institutional budgets shows no growth of resources
for marketing during the period in question. For the four of the six years
of the period under review, dollars dedicated for marketing the economic development
program fell in comparison with forecast expectations. The fact that at the
end of 2007 they were 34 percent below the budget planner is especially significant.
Therefore, marketing resources failed to be in line with forecast expectations.
In short, it appears that the fifth planned intervention was not carried out.
Sixth planned intervention: a coordinator would be assigned to establish an
international alumni network, a formal network of alumni on each continent
that would serve as the voluntary recruitment staff for all SLD programs,
including economic development. Globally, economic development program alumni
work with healthcare, water, disaster recovery, infrastructure, local church
ministry, micro-enterprise, human rights advocacy, hunger, education, HIV/AIDs,
agriculture, animal husbandry, research, rehabilitation, business development
services, organizational develop- ment, orphan care, refugee resettlement
and grant making. Based on an 81 percent program approval rating from alumni
almost a decade after the program began, alumni survey administrators recommended
the program use alumni to publi- cize the program (Bromley and Carlson, 1990).
Multiple sources agreed about the untapped potential of economic development
alumni for promoting the program, with administrators suggesting the program's
`number one recruiting tool' was the `word of mouth and personal networking'
of alumni in more than 60 countries (Birmingham and Lowery, 2001: 1). Yet
efforts to staff this function have met with continual frustration. An alumni
coordinator was initially hired, but did not persist. After the first hire
was released the alumni function passed through many hands in the following
years, but was always a minor (sometimes unwelcome) competitor for the limited
time of busy people. Years later the position remains unfilled despite near
unanimous opinion of the sixth planned intervention's strategic soundness.
The net result has undeni- ably added to the program's marketing challenges.
So, was the path taken justified? Were the changes to the planned interven-
tion made for good reasons? Most respondents agreed that the path taken was
unintentional and lacked justification. One subject's comment summed up their
responses, `it's always in the backs of all our minds, but it is never our
first priority'. Despite the claim that alumni relations is `important work',
the program's lack of activity suggests otherwise. Clearly, the sixth planned
intervention failed to be suc- cessfully executed, and no defensible justification
exists for the lack of progress.
158
Seventh
planned intervention: SLD would establish the Institute for the Advancement
of Development as a vehicle for creating knowledge and collecting research
on best practices in development. At their retreat, NGO leaders posed the
idea of an Institute that would include both non-formal (`intensive specific
training') and formal (degreed) study oppor- tunities. International students
proposed the addition of an `economic devel- opment forum that would be held
quarterly with required attendance'. These ideas formed the basis of the seventh
intervention to establish an Institute for the Advancement of Development
as a vehicle for creating knowledge, collecting research and dispensing information
on Christian development best practices. While no institutional campaign was
mounted to satisfy this initiative, vari- ous elements were realized through
a patchwork of individual faculty efforts. A `Development Dialogues' series
facilitates bi-weekly connections and non- formal learning between on-campus
students and NGO leaders. Certificate options are being unveiled at residency
locations as intensive training opportuni- ties in microfinance, sustainability
and entrepreneurship for students uninterested in or unable to complete a
graduate degree. Additionally, several faculty members initiated their own
development-oriented research centers at the University. The Global Center
for Applied Research persisted for several years and then became inactive.
Another `think tank' endeavor called TSEDEQ was launched, aligning with the
seventh intervention's stated objectives, but it, too, has lapsed with the
retirement of its faculty founder. In short, while the institutionalization
through the program of the creation of knowledge has not occurred as planned,
there are movements in that direction. Eastern University has also helped
this process by lightening teacher loads begin- ning in 2008–9 to encourage
increased scholarship by faculty. The program and University will co-host
a conference on Transformational Development August 2009 with the Christian
NGO, Food for the Hungry. A partnership is under discus- sion with a Southern
hemisphere research center committed to Christian NGOs. Finally a web-based
initiative, www.NGOleader.org, is taking form as a means to gather and publicize
research, ideas, and practices. Even though the economic development program
has not specifically satisfied the seventh proposed inter- vention as planned,
it hopes its current commitments and ongoing endeavors will lead to its eventual
realization. Conclusions The following conclusions and recommendations, drawn
from the discussion, have both practical and policy implications for institutions
of higher education. 1 The importance of faculty leadership for academic programs:
Leaders exercise tremendous in uence on their programs and institutions.
A graduate development program should be directed by a member of the faculty
who has substantial experience in the eld. In academic environments,
faculty status contributes to the effectiveness of program directors particularly
in matters of curricular development and faculty supervision. 2 The consequences
of constant curricular change: Frequent program leadership change leads to
constant curricular change, which adds both complexity and cost to a program
while simultaneously enhancing attrition. A graduate development program should
be subjected to a well-conceived approach to curricular revision that discourages
annual change in favor of a substantive multi-year review process.
159
3 The
signi cance of stability in the context of relationally-based
markets: Frequent staff turnover is severely disruptive and relationally fractious.
In a graduate international development program, programmatic instability
compromises relationship-based marketing efforts. 4 The value of planning
and resourcing marketing efforts: A graduate development program should create,
resource and implement a relationship-based marketing plan that takes full
advantage of global networking opportunities (such as alumni and potential
NGO partners) while constructing an institutional culture that prides itself
in ful lling its marketing promises. 5 The necessity of achieving
and teaching cross-cultural competency: A graduate development program excels
as the divide between classroom and context is narrowed. This includes curricular
commitments to merging (macro) understanding of development with the (micro)
skills required for execution at the grass roots; the utilization of texts
representative of multiple cultures and viewpoints; and the appointment of
faculty possessing a mixture of scholarship, appropriate experience and cultural
diversity. For the aspiring NGO leader, the importance of eld-based
learning over a period of at least three months cannot be overstated. 6 The
importance of extending accessibility and ensuring relevance through non-traditional
delivery options: A graduate development program should excel at bridging
the cultural and economic realities that frustrate the development of NGO
leaders. Because of the distinct nature of social service sector organizations
and their leaders, this will require alternative approaches to classic curricular
programs (such as MBAs) as well as innovative efforts at program delivery.
Program delivery that includes an interactive, cohort-based, portable learning
community option will retain program quality while ensuring accessibility
for adult NGO leaders who are severely challenged by the requirements of their
multiple professional and personal roles. The critical task of preparing grassroots
NGO leaders for service in the devel- oping world proceeds somewhat perilously
due to the lack of scholarship on the effectiveness of NGO management and
leadership preparation programs. Effective NGO leadership education programs
and a body of NGO management knowledge must be created to guide the accelerating
opportunities and expecta- tions inherent in that sector. As seen earlier,
the history and evaluation of Eastern University's MBA in economic development
sheds light on some key variables that need to be considered in the creation
and strengthening of institutions that develop programs serving the NGO community
and extend the abilities of NGO leaders to fulfill their missions. It is hoped
that this article will encourage this pro- cess in all of its aspects, including
the learning from and nurturing of indigenous institutions and their capacity
to deliver the training most needed and appropri- ate to foster development
in their own countries.
