<p>Our aim was to determine whether fetal exposure to intraamniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) persistently alters the lungs following moderate preterm birth.

Eleven weeks after preterm birth, lung structure was unaltered. <italic>Interleukin (IL)-1β</italic> messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were elevated in lungs of LPS-exposed lambs (<italic>P </italic>&lt; .05) but IL-1β protein levels were unaltered. Lung mRNA levels of <italic>IL-6, IL-8</italic> and <italic>tumor necrosis factor α,</italic> and percentage of inflammatory cells were not different between groups. <italic>Surfactant protein (SP)-A</italic> and <italic>SP-C</italic> mRNA levels and SP-B tissue protein expression were higher in LPS-exposed lambs than controls (all <italic>P </italic>&lt; .05); however, expression of SP-A and <italic>SP-C</italic> proteins was reduced. Prenatal LPS exposure causes a persistent increase in gene expression of proinflammatory mediators and surfactant proteins and a decrease in lung tissue SP-A and -C protein expression after preterm birth, which may affect lung immunity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Intrauterine infection or inflammation, including chorioamnionitis, is present in up to 60% of pregnancies that result in preterm birth and these factors are considered to play a major role in the etiology of preterm birth.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112450327">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112450327">2</xref>
</sup> In such pregnancies, the fetus is chronically exposed to inflammatory mediators that are now recognized as being able to affect the development of multiple fetal organs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112450327">3</xref>
</sup> As a result, exposure to intrauterine inflammation could have long-term consequences for health and disease.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112450327">4</xref>
</sup> The developing lung is known to be susceptible to intrauterine infection/inflammation, although the long-term pulmonary outcomes and underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. It is apparent that functional lung maturity may be enhanced soon after exposure to an inflammatory intrauterine environment,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112450327">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112450327">6</xref>
</sup> which could explain the reduced incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants exposed to chorioamnionitis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112450327">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112450327">8</xref>
</sup> This effect is thought to be mediated by an increased production of pulmonary surfactant, which results in increased lung compliance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112450327">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112450327">10</xref>
</sup> Although intrauterine inflammation can enhance lung function in preterm infants in the short-term, it has been shown to increase the risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112450327">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112450327">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112450327">12</xref>
</sup>; however, some recent studies show no such relationship.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112450327">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719112450327"/>

</sup> Experimental evidence suggests that prenatal inflammation could alter lung architecture by inhibiting alveolarization, thereby predisposing infants to BPD and later respiratory illness.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112450327">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719112450327">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Previous studies on the effects of intrauterine inflammation on fetal lung architecture and postnatal lung function have produced conflicting results. In preterm fetal sheep, intrauterine exposure to endotoxin has been shown to impair alveolarization, resulting in fewer and larger alveoli.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112450327">17</xref>
</sup> In addition, pulmonary microvascular development<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719112450327">19</xref>
</sup> and pulmonary elastin deposition are affected by fetal endotoxin exposure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719112450327">20</xref>
</sup> In contrast, prolonged intrauterine exposure to endotoxin did not affect lung morphometry in near-term fetal sheep,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719112450327">19</xref>
</sup> suggesting that recovery of normal structure had occurred.</p>
<p>Few studies have examined the lungs of postnatal animals following intrauterine lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure. Although alveolar simplification was seen at 0.86 of ovine gestation after LPS exposure,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112450327">17</xref>
</sup> no changes in lung structure were observed 2 months after spontaneous term birth following the same prenatal endotoxin exposure at 0.82 of term.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719112450327">21</xref>
</sup> In contrast, in rats, offspring aged up to 60 days had fewer and larger alveoli following intraamniotic administration of LPS in late gestation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112450327">22</xref>
</sup>; however, the growth of the rat pups exposed to LPS was lower than that of controls. </p>
<p>Although some studies have examined the long-term effects of intrauterine inflammation on lung development following birth at term,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719112450327">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112450327">22</xref>
</sup> few, if any, studies have been conducted following preterm birth. The pulmonary outcomes are likely to be different after preterm birth as the lung is required to function at an earlier stage of development. Although most infants exposed to intrauterine infection or inflammation, are born before term, the long-term postnatal effects of prenatal exposure to inflammation on lung development following preterm birth remain unclear. Owing to uncertainties as to the long-term, postnatal, effects of intrauterine inflammation on the developing lung our objective was to determine whether alterations in lung structure, surfactant production, and inflammatory status that have been observed in the endotoxin-exposed fetus persist into postnatal life following preterm birth. We continuously exposed fetal sheep to endotoxin (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>) during the saccular and early alveolar periods of lung development, which is when intrauterine infection is likely in most cases of preterm birth. We induced moderately preterm birth of lambs at the minimum gestational age for viability without the requirement of intensive care; the equivalent gestational age in humans is approximately 32 to 34 weeks of gestation. Our study is important as even late preterm birth increases the risk of illness, including respiratory distress, infection, feeding problems, cerebral palsy, and cognitive impairment.<sup>

</sup> We examined the lungs at 11 weeks after birth, which can be regarded as analogous to childhood in humans.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>All animal procedures were approved by the Monash University Animal Ethics Committee. We used 6 lambs prenatally exposed to endotoxin and 9 control lambs that were not exposed; all lambs were born approximately 14 days before term. The LPS-exposed lambs were singletons apart from 2 twins from the same pregnancy; the controls were singletons apart from 1 twin. To prepare for intrauterine LPS or saline exposure, date-mated pregnant Merino × Border Leicester ewes underwent aseptic surgery at approximately 110 days of gestational age (DGA; term is ∼147 days) for the chronic implantation of 2 osmotic mini-pumps (Alzet, 2.5 µL/h for 28 days) into the amniotic sac; the pumps were attached to the fetal hind limbs. The pumps contained either LPS (80 mg dissolved in saline; <italic>E coli</italic>, 055:B55, Sigma Chemical, St Louis, Missouri), which would deliver LPS into the amniotic fluid at 1 mg/d from the time of pump implantation,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719112450327">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719112450327">26</xref>
</sup> or they contained saline for control fetuses. Ampicillin sodium (1 g/5 mL dissolved in saline, intramuscularly [i.m.]) was administered to all ewes for 3 days after surgery. To monitor fetal well-being, fetal arterial blood (0.3 mL) was sampled at regular intervals after surgery until induction of preterm birth.</p>
<sec id="section2-1933719112450327">
<title>Induction of Moderate Preterm Birth</title>
<p>In all animals, we induced birth at approximately 14 days before term (0.9 of term) as described previously.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719112450327">27</xref>
</sup> Briefly, preterm labor and delivery were induced by administration of epostane (50 mg, intravenous [i.v.]; 2a, 4a, 17-4,5-epoxy-17-hydroxy-4,17-dimethyl-3-ketoandrostane-2-carbonitrile, Sanofi-Synthlabo), a competitive inhibitor of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which prevents the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone. Betamethasone (5.7 mg, i.m.; Celestone Chronodose, Schering-Plough, Australia) was administered to ewes on 131 days of gestation, 6 hours preceding epostane administration, to facilitate the survival of preterm lambs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1933719112450327">
<title>Management of Newborn Preterm Lambs</title>
<p>Pregnant ewes were monitored until vaginal delivery. When lambs were born, the ewe was allowed to lick and smell the lamb before it was dried and warmed. Newborn lambs were not intubated but if cyanosis was apparent, a face mask receiving 100% oxygen (3-5 L/min) was placed over the nostrils. Once the lamb’s condition was stabilized, indicated by regular breathing and lack of cyanosis, it was weighed, and measurements of crown-to-rump length (CRL), thoracic girth (TG), and forelimb length (FLL) were made; from these data, the ponderal index (PI; body weight/CRL<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112450327">3</xref>
</sup>) was calculated. Lambs were then placed in an open-topped container under a heat source. Within 1 to 2 hours of birth, lambs were fed colostrum expressed from the ewe.</p>
<p>Lambs were kept close to the ewe for the next 2 to 3 days. During this time, they were fed every 4 to 6 hours, primarily with milk expressed from the ewe; if ewe’s milk was unavailable, they were fed formula based on cow’s milk. At each feed, the lamb was weighed and rectal temperature recorded. After 24 hours, the lamb was encouraged to feed from the ewe. Approximately 2 to 3 days after birth, when the lamb was able to stand unsupported and its eyes were fully opened, it was allowed free access to its mother. All lambs were reared with their mothers until necropsy.</p>
<p>After birth, lambs were weighed weekly and CRL, TG, and FLL were measured. At 9 weeks after birth, lambs underwent surgery for implantation of femoral arterial and venous catheters. At 10 weeks after birth, the femoral arterial catheter was connected to a pressure transducer (DTX plus transducer, Becton Dickinson, Singapore), the output from which was digitally recorded (PowerLab8/30, ADInstruments Pty Ltd, Australia) using Chart for Windows software (version 5.01, ADInstruments Pty Ltd). Arterial pressure and heart rate (HR) were recorded for 2 hours on 2 consecutive days while the lambs lay prone in a sling. The digitized data were subsequently analyzed over 3-minute periods at 15-minute intervals to obtain systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures (MAPs). Heart rate was derived from the arterial pressure waveform. Arterial blood was collected for blood gas analysis (Radiometer, Denmark).</p>

<sec id="section4-1933719112450327">
<title>Necropsy and Tissue Collection</title>
<p>At 11 weeks after birth, lambs were weighed and their dimensions were measured; they were then euthanized by an overdose of sodium pentobarbitone (325 mg/mL, i.v.). The lungs were removed and weighed. The left bronchus was ligated, and the left and right lungs were separated. Small portions of the left lung (avoiding major airways and blood vessels) were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for molecular analysis. The right lung was fixed via the trachea using 4% paraformaldehyde (in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) at a distending pressure of 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. Sections were then processed and paraffin-embedded for light microscopy analyses. Other major organs including the brain, heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, and adrenal glands were collected and weighed. </p>

<title>Histological Analysis of Lung Tissue</title>
<p>Sections (5 μm thick) were stained and then examined using a light microscope. Color images were captured using a digital camera linked to image analysis software (Image Pro Plus, version 6.0). All measurements were made on coded slides by the same observer (AA) who was blinded to the experimental groups. For each morphometric parameter, we obtained data from a total of 15 randomly chosen bronchioles for the airway wall analysis and 15 randomly chosen fields of view for the lung parenchyma analysis. These 15 randomly chosen airways or fields of view were chosen from 3 randomly selected tissue sections from each animal; these included at least 1 section from the upper, middle, and lower lobes of the lung.</p>
<sec id="section7-1933719112450327">
<title>Morphometric analysis</title>
<p>Paraffin-embedded sections of lung tissue were stained with Masson Trichrome stain. Measurements were made by superimposing test grids over projected images of the lung. Tissue and air-space fractions and mean linear intercept, the average distance between alveolar walls (Lm), were determined by point-counting methods.<sup>

<p>Paraffin-embedded sections were stained for elastin using the Hart resorcin-fuchsin stain and counterstained with tartrazine (0.25%) in saturated picric acid. For the collagen analysis, paraffin-embedded sections were stained using the Gordon and Sweet reticular fiber stain, which stains collagen types I and III; the sections were counterstained with eosin. Analyses were performed at a final magnification of ×1000. For each field of view, the area of tissue stained for either elastin or collagen was expressed as a percentage of the total area of tissue. This was then averaged for each animal and each experimental group.</p>

<title>Analysis of bronchiolar wall structure</title>
<p>Sections of lung tissue were scanned at a magnification of ×400, and all noncartilaginous airways that appeared in a near-circular cross section were included in the analysis; the approximate diameter of the airways analyzed ranged from 70 to 320 µm. The airways analyzed were considered to be terminal bronchioles; their generation number cannot be determined as they are too small to be dissected from lung tissue. Using light microscopy and image analysis software (Image Pro Plus, version 6.0), we measured the luminal area, the perimeter of the basement membrane (Pbm), the area of airway epithelium, the area of collagen in the outer airway wall, the area of airway smooth muscle (ASM), and the number of alveolar attachments.<sup>

The thermal profile used to amplify the PCR products included an initial 2-minute incubation at 95°C, followed by 50 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 3 seconds, annealing at 58/59/60°C (depending on the primers for each gene; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1933719112450327">Table 1</xref>) for 20 seconds, and elongation at 72°C for 20 seconds. The fluorescence readings were recorded after each 72°C step. Dissociation curves were performed after each PCR run to ensure that a single PCR product had been amplified per primer set. Each sample was measured in triplicate, and a control sample, containing no template, was included in each run. The relative mRNA levels of each gene for each animal were normalized to the <italic>RPS29</italic> mRNA values for that animal, using the ▵▵Ct method (where Ct is cycle threshold), and expressed relative to the mean gene mRNA levels in control fetuses.</p>

<title>Inflammatory Cell Analysis</title>
<p>To assess the proportion of inflammatory cells within lung tissue, paraffin-embedded sections were immunohistochemically stained with an antibody against CD45 (mouse anti-sheep CD45 monoclonal antibody, 1:50; MCA2220, AbD Serotec). CD45, also known as common leukocyte antigen, is expressed on hematopoietic cells except erythrocytes and platelets; therefore, it is commonly used as an inflammatory cell marker. Sections underwent antigen retrieval (0.01 mol/L sodium citrate, pH 6; 20 minutes in microwave oven on high setting), and endogenous peroxidases were blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 10% normal horse serum/0.1% bovine serum albumin/0.05 mol/L Tris-HCl pH 7.2 for 30 minutes prior to incubation with the primary antibody. CD45 was visualized using a labeled polymer-HRP (DakoCytomation) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Specific staining of the primary antibody was confirmed using a negative control slide, which contained no primary antibody.</p>
<p>Analyses were performed at a final magnification of ×1000. Measurements were made on coded slides by the same observer (FS) who was “blinded” to the experimental groups. For each animal, the number of cells stained positive for CD45 was counted and expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells. This was then averaged for each experimental group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have shown, for the first time, that prolonged fetal exposure to an inflammatory intrauterine environment has persistent effects on the lungs following preterm birth, in the absence of differences in body growth. In the postnatal lungs, we found evidence of increased gene expression of surfactant proteins and an altered tissue protein expression of these surfactant proteins in association with a persistent elevation of proinflammatory cytokine gene expression. We therefore suggest that an altered immune gene expression profile may be responsible for the altered SP expression as reported previously in the fetal lung.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112450327">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1933719112450327">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1933719112450327">38</xref>
</sup> At 11 weeks after birth, we found no evidence of structural alterations in the lung parenchyma following intraamniotic LPS exposure; we also found no overt effects on the bronchiolar walls. Surprisingly, LPS exposure reduced kidney and spleen weights in relation to body weight.</p>
<sec id="section33-1933719112450327">
<title>Lung Structure</title>
<p>Previous studies examining the effects of intrauterine inflammation on fetal lung development have provided conflicting data. Administration of LPS (20 mg) into the ovine amniotic sac at 119 DGA led to an increase in alveolar volume and a reduction in alveolar number 6 days later.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112450327">17</xref>
</sup> A reduction in alveolarization (ie, fewer and larger alveoli) was also seen at 125 DGA following LPS infusion (0.6 mg/d) from 80 to 108 DGA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1933719112450327">37</xref>
</sup> Following 28 days of intrauterine LPS (1 mg/d) exposure in sheep, which started at 80 DGA, Kallapur et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719112450327">19</xref>
</sup> assessed fetal lung structure at both 110 DGA and 138 DGA. At 110 DGA, they found a reduced number of (pre-alveolar) saccules, but at 138 DGA (ie, 30 days after the cessation of LPS administration), they found no differences in lung structure. In another study of the long-term effects of intrauterine LPS (20 mg at 119 DGA) exposure in sheep, Moss et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719112450327">21</xref>
</sup> found no differences in lung structure or lung function in 8-week-old lambs born at term. Taken together, the data from the present and previous studies in sheep suggest that alveolarization in the developing lung may be inhibited by an inflammatory environment soon after exposure, but the lung undergoes repair following LPS exposure, potentially by accelerated alveolarization in utero or soon after birth. The initial inhibition of alveolarization may arise as a result of perturbed septal elastin deposition which has been reported at 3 to 7 days after LPS exposure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719112450327">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The inhibition of alveolarization by prenatal LPS exposure is supported by data from rats; however, unlike sheep, the effects persist after birth. Ueda et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112450327">22</xref>
</sup> found that late gestational exposure to LPS in rats, via maternal IP injection during the saccular stage of lung development, resulted in reduced alveolarization which was still evident at 60 days after birth; however, the postnatal growth of the rat pups exposed to endotoxin was lower than that of controls and restricted growth on its own can impair lung development.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1933719112450327">39</xref>
</sup> Similar findings have been reported by Zhan et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1933719112450327">40</xref>
</sup> in rats aged 7 and 14 days following intracervical LPS administration during the pseudoglandular stage of lung development. In another study using rats, maternal systemic exposure to LPS during pregnancy led to delayed alveolarization after birth, but the effect was absent 21 days after birth, suggestive of structural recovery as seen in our lambs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1933719112450327">41</xref>
</sup> The apparent differences between postnatal studies are likely due to species differences in the developmental timing of lung development, as well as differences in the level or timing of LPS exposure.</p>
<p>No previous studies have examined the effects of intrauterine inflammation on the conducting airways. It is likely that the airway epithelium would be exposed to intraamniotic LPS, as it has been shown that the effects of intraamniotic LPS on the alveolar epithelium are dependent upon access via the conducting airways.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112450327">10</xref>
</sup> The only evidence of a structural alteration in the airway walls was a trend for the bronchiolar epithelium to be thicker in LPS-exposed animals; it is possible that there may have been alterations in the airways at birth, and that wall structure had returned to normal by 11 weeks after birth.</p>

<title>Pulmonary Inflammation</title>
<p>An unexpected finding was the persistently elevated gene expression of <italic>IL-1β</italic> in the lungs of 11-week-old lambs exposed in utero to LPS, with similar but nonsignificant trends in <italic>IL-6</italic>, <italic>IL-8</italic>, and TNF-α. Interestingly, there was no increase in the tissue protein expression of IL-1β or the percentage of leukocytes in lung tissue, which may explain the absence of overt histological evidence of pulmonary inflammation. A previous study in which intraamniotic LPS was administered repeatedly throughout gestation in sheep, showed elevated leukocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) at term; however, by 7 weeks after birth, the pulmonary inflammation was absent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1933719112450327">42</xref>
</sup> It is possible that there is a transient increase in pulmonary inflammation at birth, following intraamniotic LPS, which resolves soon after birth. Our finding of elevated gene expression of <italic>IL-1β</italic> is consistent with the elevated proinflammatory cytokine (<italic>IL-1β</italic>,<italic> IL-6</italic>, and <italic>CXCL1</italic>) mRNA expression and infiltration of neutrophils that were observed in the lungs of 14-day old rats after late gestational exposure to LPS.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1933719112450327">41</xref>
</sup> This was associated with an attenuation of alveolarization, but by postnatal day 21, the difference from controls was no longer present. As the preterm fetal lung contains few macrophages or granulocytes,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1933719112450327">43</xref>
</sup> an inflammatory insult would be expected to recruit neutrophils and monocytes into the lung. This inflammatory insult may permanently alter gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines that may attenuate alveolarization at birth; however, the pulmonary inflammation appears to resolve with time such that alveolarization becomes normal after birth. It would be interesting to test the pulmonary inflammatory system in adulthood as the prolonged inflammation, as produced in our study, could persistently alter the development of the immune system as seen in preterm infants exposed to chorioamnionitis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1933719112450327">44</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>It has been shown that gestational exposure to LPS in rats can lead to decreased Th2 cytokine levels (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) and increased Th1 cytokine levels (IL-2 and IFN-γ) in offspring at 14 days of postnatal age.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1933719112450327">45</xref>
</sup> The Th1- and Th2-mediated responses are related to cell-mediated and antibody-mediated immunity, respectively. This altered balance of the Th1 and Th2 immune pathways might be partially responsible for the increased level of proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, there is evidence that IFN-γ, a Th1 cytokine, stimulates expression of surfactant protein production, whereas IL-13, a Th2 cytokine, suppresses SP production in adult human alveolar type 2 cells in vitro.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1933719112450327">46</xref>
</sup> Taken together, it appears likely that such an alteration of Th1 and Th2 immune system balance may lead to increased expression of surfactant protein mRNA. </p>

<title>Pulmonary Surfactant</title>
<p>Several studies have examined the effects of intrauterine inflammation on pulmonary surfactant before birth. In sheep, gene expression of <italic>SP-A</italic>, <italic>-B</italic>, and <italic>-C</italic> was increased in fetal lung tissue following various routes of LPS administration,<sup>

</sup> which is in agreement with the findings of the present study. An increase in SP-A and -B protein has been reported in lung tissue<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112450327">9</xref>
</sup> and an increase in SP-B protein has been reported in BALF<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1933719112450327">48</xref>
</sup> shortly after LPS exposure. In humans, an increase in SP-B concentration in amniotic fluid has also been reported in pregnancies with intraamniotic infection.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1933719112450327">49</xref>
</sup> However, we are unaware of studies that have examined the persistence of these effects after term or preterm birth. Given an increase in <italic>SP-B</italic> mRNA, albeit nonsignificant, in conjunction with an increase in lung tissue SP-B protein, it is likely that alveolar SP-B (ie, SP-B secreted from lung tissue into the lung lumen) was increased in the present study. The apparently conflicting changes in lung tissue protein and gene expression levels of SP-A and -C seen in our study could arise from a relative increase in alveolar secretion rates, leading to a depletion in protein tissue stores. Alternatively, there may be a decrease in translation rates of mRNA or an accelerated degradation of <italic>SP</italic> mRNA, both of which would lead to a decrease in alveolar protein. As BALF was not collected, it is unclear whether alveolar SP-A and -C levels increase or decrease. However, taking into account the previous findings of the effect of LPS on pulmonary SP expression,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112450327">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1933719112450327">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1933719112450327">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1933719112450327">48</xref>
</sup> together with the findings in the present study of increased proinflammatory cytokine expression, it is likely that there was a general increase in the rate of surfactant turnover. The increase in <italic>SP-A</italic> mRNA is likely stimulated by the altered inflammatory state of the lung, as IL-1α and -β have both been shown to stimulate <italic>SP-A</italic> gene transcription in vitro.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1933719112450327">50</xref>
</sup> However, it is also possible that the increased <italic>SP</italic> gene expression does not translate into increased protein expression, as increased inflammatory mediators, particularly IL-1 have also been shown to stimulate <italic>SP</italic> mRNA degradation in vitro.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1933719112450327">51</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Given the uncertainty of the changes in alveolar SP expression, the functional implications for the postnatal lung are unclear. If the levels of alveolar SP-B and -C increase then lung function is not likely to be adversely affected. Even if alveolar SP-B increases, but alveolar <italic>SP-C</italic> decreases, as observed with SP-B and -C tissue levels, lung function in the mature lung is unlikely to be affected, as the roles of these 2 hydrophobic proteins in promoting surfactant film formation and function are somewhat redundant.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1933719112450327">52</xref>
</sup> Indeed, we observed no evidence of differences in respiratory function (as indicated by arterial blood gases) or cardiovascular function (as indicated by MAP and HR) between the treatment groups. Changes in the expression of the hydrophilic collectins, SP-A and -D, may lead to alterations in pulmonary innate immunity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1933719112450327">53</xref>
</sup> Regulation and function of these 2 proteins is complex, as they are able to elicit either a proinflammatory response, if needed, to combat infection or an anti-inflammatory response, if required, to limit inflammation and avoid tissue damage (reviewed by Orgeig et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1933719112450327">54</xref></sup>). Hence, in the present study, a potential increase in alveolar SP-A may be protective, serving to limit tissue damage due to the presence of elevated proinflammatory cytokines. On the other hand, a potential decrease in production of SP-A may have a detrimental effect on lung innate immunity in postnatal life, with a potential for increased risk of infection, inflammation, and airway sensitization.<sup>

<title>Kidney Development</title>
<p>Surprisingly, we found that kidney weight, relative to body weight, was significantly reduced by 12% in the LPS-exposed animals compared with controls.

<title>Spleen</title>
<p>The weight of the spleen, relative to body weight, was reduced by 42% in LPS-exposed lambs compared with controls. The cause of this apparent hyposplenia is unknown. A previous study has shown that chorioamnionitis in humans results in injury to the spleen, including shrinkage and depletion of B and T lymphocytes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1933719112450327">63</xref>
</sup> The subjects of that study were fetuses and neonates who died of severe inflammation, whereas our subjects were exposed to only mild to moderate inflammation which caused neither fetal death nor abortion; therefore, the mechanism may be quite different. Intrauterine inflammation alters the immune system of the neonate postnatally in that Th1 immunity is augmented and Th2 immunity is reduced.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1933719112450327">41</xref>
</sup> The spleen is an important organ for antibody-mediated immunity, as it is the site of B-cell proliferation. Therefore, reduced activity of Th2 immunity could possibly diminish the proliferation of B cells leading to hyposplenia. Measuring serum immunoglobulin or the differential count of lymphocytes might provide evidence for this hypothesis. Hyposplenia may also be indicative of impaired red blood cell production in the fetus, but our LPS-exposed lambs had normal hematocrit and blood hemoglobin content (data not presented), so this is unlikely in our study.</p>

<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>To ensure the survival of our preterm lambs without the need for ventilatory support, it was necessary to deliver a single, small dose of corticosteroid (5.7 mg) before birth. Previous studies in sheep have reported that the immune/inflammatory response can be altered by antenatal corticosteroid exposure. Maternal betamethasone administration (0.5 mg/kg maternal bodyweight; approximately 30 mg) initially suppressed cord blood monocyte function in vitro by reducing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and IL-6 production for 3 days after stimulation by LPS; however, after 7 days, monocyte function was found to be more proinflammatory.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1933719112450327">64</xref>
</sup> Betamethasone administration (0.5 mg/kg maternal bodyweight) has also been shown to initially inhibit LPS-induced lung inflammation in the preterm lamb at 1 day; however, after 15 days, preterm lambs had increased lung inflammation compared with preterm lambs exposed to LPS alone.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1933719112450327">65</xref>
</sup> Lung function has been shown to be improved with combined betamethasone and LPS administration,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1933719112450327">65</xref>
</sup> compared with either agent alone.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1933719112450327">66</xref>
</sup> Although we observed no changes in lung structure, which may be due to our use of lower levels of betamethasone and endotoxin exposure than in previous studies, it is possible that either betamethasone and/or LPS exposure may be responsible for the increased <italic>IL-1β</italic> gene expression that we observed at 11 weeks of age.</p>
<p>We were unable to provide direct evidence that our LPS-exposed fetuses were indeed exposed to intrauterine inflammation; however, we used the same LPS infusion protocol as a previous study in sheep in which histological and cytokine evidence of intrauterine inflammation was obtained.<sup>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We conclude that chronic intrauterine exposure to LPS during late gestation leads to increased pulmonary gene expression of <italic>IL-1β</italic>, <italic>SP-A</italic>, and <italic>SP-C</italic>, increased lung tissue protein expression of SP-B, and decreased lung tissue protein expression of SP-A and <italic>SP-C</italic> at 11 weeks after preterm birth. It is likely that these effects are causally linked, as is the case in the fetus. Intrauterine exposure to LPS also led to reductions in kidney and spleen growth that persisted to 11 weeks after birth, which could have adverse long-term effects on renal function and immune function, respectively.</p>
