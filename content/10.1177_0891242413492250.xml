<p>With so much written on the topic of the impact of universities on economic development, one could question the contributions that could result from yet another edited volume on this topic. Despite the crowded literature, this book is a valuable contribution of well-written chapters on specific topics that connect together to form a coherent volume. Although <italic>Universities and Colleges as Economic Drivers</italic> is the product of a 2011 SUNY conference, the book speaks to issues of national concern of interest to higher education professionals, economic development practitioners, state policy makers, and those interested in the relationship between universities and economic development. Following a forward by Nancy Zimpher, chancellor of the State University of New York, the book has 10 chapters that address particular aspects of the relationship between higher education and economic development. A dominant theme of the book is the challenge in measuring the myriad ways universities contribute to economic growth and development, as almost every chapter concludes with a call for better measures and more data to clarify this relationship.</p>
<p>The first chapter by Lane shows that there is growing international recognition that universities are important to economic growth in developed innovation-based economies but that much more work is needed to measure the economic development contributions of universities. The chapter shows that many universities now place economic development as a central element of their institutional mission. This chapter is followed by a contribution by Gais and Wright that provides a good summary of the various ways that universities contribute to economic development. Such ways include the role of universities as spender and consumer, the contribution universities make to human capital development, research and development (R&amp;D) and entrepreneurship, business assistance such as through providing business services and student workers, and supporting community vitality. The chapter does miss the important role that universities make in providing leadership to regional economic development activities and perhaps being the catalyst for changing regional economic development trajectories.</p>
<p>A chapter that is a must read for university administrators who are engaged in showcasing how investments in their institution results in regional economic impact is a contribution by McHenry, Sanderson, and Siegfried. This chapter is one of the best I have seen in summarizing traditional measures of universities’ economic contributions to their regions and how they are used and misused. Many universities produce reports that conclude that the total economic and employment impact of a university is a huge number. The chapter summarizes studies of 617 institutions, categorizes the studies, and notes shortcomings that call into question the validity of results. University officials who are concerned about the credibility of studies they commission should heed the cautions raised in this chapter, such as applying a regional multiplier to all expenditures by the institution instead of only applying the multiplier to new-to-the-area funds, and to count these only once. This chapter alone makes this book a valuable purchase.</p>
<p>A chapter by Feldman, Freyer, and Lanahan specifically looks at the challenge of measuring the economic impacts of university research, with a specific focus on one multi-institutional National Science Foundation (NSF)–funded research center led by the University of North Carolina. In addition to summarizing the standard metrics to gauge the economic impact of a university research center, such as IMPLAN-generated multiplier impacts and measures of technology transfer (patents, startup companies, license agreements, etc.), the authors address the challenge of impacts that are more difficult to capture. These broader impacts may include stimulating new ideas in industry through industry–university interaction in conferences and seminars, improvements to public education through teacher training and new material development, and exposure of students, faculty, and other researchers to new approaches to interdisciplinary research. The chapter pulls examples from this case study to illustrate the broader impacts that such a center could have but falls short of providing a guide to those interested in capturing such broader impacts. I was less impressed by the section of this chapter that compared various funding scenarios to the broader impact of the project or projects. The authors make the reasonable claim that a well-funded multiyear center would reduce the administrative burden of proposal preparation and provide a larger base for researchers to make broader contributions beyond science and technology. In addition, funding for a longer period allows for the research to shift focus over time to pursue promising new areas. However, larger centers generally have staff dedicated toward education and outreach that is generally not the case for individual research grants or smaller center awards.</p>
<p>The chapter by Schultz looks at the challenge of measuring the economic impact of university–industry–government research centers. The chapter provides a high-level overview of the history of the development of these centers with a focus on NSF-funded centers. The chapter provides a very brief summary of avenues to encourage university–industry–government collaboration through the development of research parks, incubators, and cluster-based economic development but suggests various approaches to measure the impact of such ventures. In reviewing the history in the evolution of such centers, the chapter does not mention the work of the NSF-Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) program that was very early in working to involve state government, industry, and academia to produce statewide plans to upgrade innovation economies in lagging states.</p>
<p>The contribution by Carnevale and Rose looks at the relationship to postsecondary education to the labor market making the case that college graduates earn more over their lifetime and are less prone to suffer from economic downtowns. The chapter provides statistics showing the wage premium for those with a college degree and how this varies internationally and has changed over time. The authors state that higher education institutions are not producing enough graduates to meet the national demand for college-educated workers. The chapter is a good review of this current topic but does not provide explicit recommendations for policy makers.</p>
<p>The chapter by Jacobs on community colleges was not one of the stronger contributions and provides little new information or data on the contribution that community colleges make to local economic development and as economic development partners. The contribution is more of an essay that summarizes the emerging role of community colleges and highlights examples where community colleges have made a difference.</p>
<p>The chapter by Lane and Owens addresses the role of higher education institutions in the international realm. The authors provide evidence through an examination of institutional economic impact reports that many universities view some aspect of globalization as important to them. The chapter focuses not only on the movement of students and how this relates to economic impact but also considers the foreign direct investment component of multinational colleges and universities. The chapter will be valuable to institutions involved in international education as well as those exploring setting up branch campuses or units in other countries. The challenge of capturing higher education’s contribution to national trade and foreign investment and the impact of international branch campuses on international economic development are shown to be a fruitful area of both data collection and further study.</p>
<p>A contribution by Owen-Smith tackles the question of how universities approach technology patenting and licensing through the interaction of technology licensing offices and faculty inventors. Owen-Smith uses two universities as case studies, a large public university and a large private university, to highlight the different approaches of working with faculty inventors to promote the commercialization of technology. The chapter makes some interesting points, such as the distinction between intellectual property protection strategies between life science disciplines and engineering/physical science disciplines, and suggests topics for additional study.</p>
<p>The volume concludes with a short chapter by Johnstone on how state and federal financial austerity may affect the ability of universities to continue to make economic development contributions. While not adding new data, the essay is a useful summary of financial challenges that seem to grow deeper each year. Johnstone suggests that universities will need to take steps to deliver value while making cuts (such as reducing programs), and by investing in activities that are likely to generate revenue (technology commercialization programs) and state economic impact (such as workforce development).</p>
<p>In summary, this edited volume is a strong contribution to the literature on the role of universities in economic development and belongs on the bookshelf of those like myself who have an interest in this topic. Although some of the contributions are not as strong as others, all provide useful information. The chapters frequently reference each other, terminology is defined (e.g., triple helix model), and each chapter stands as an individual contribution. The message of the importance of better ways to measure the impacts of universities on economic development sets the stage for additional work that will likely produce a better understanding of this relationship and help guide those who fund higher education institutions on the broader impact they have on regional economies.</p>
