<abstract>
<p>Accidental poisonings and abuse of prescription drugs have been classified as an epidemic by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). Health care providers, especially those who practice in the home environment, should be aware of the scope of this problem as well as the recommendations for management and disposal of unused prescription drugs that are present in the home. This article reviews the problem of accidental poisonings and prescription drug abuse, and summarizes recommendations provided by various government agencies for appropriate management and disposal of prescription drugs.</p>

<title>Unintentional Poisonings and Prescription Drug Abuse—A Growing Problem</title>
<p>Many of the approximately 3.9 billion prescriptions dispensed in the United States each year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1084822312473829">1</xref></sup> will not be used or finished by patients, resulting in a vast reservoir of unwanted and expired medications in communities across America. Some estimates indicate that more than 40% of prescription drugs dispensed to consumers each year are never actually used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822312473829">2</xref></sup> These unwanted, unused, and expired medications have the potential to damage the environment if they are disposed of improperly and contribute to the growing problem of unintentional poisonings and substance abuse when they are retained indefinitely in local medicine cabinets. Though there are currently no federal regulations regarding disposal of unwanted medications, several government agencies have issued recommendations. This article will review the scope of this national problem and summarize recommendations from various government agencies regarding proper disposal of these potentially harmful medications.</p>
<p>Unintentional poisoning deaths are increasingly common, second only to motor vehicle accidents for the general population and the most common cause of death among persons aged 25 to 64 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1084822312473829">3</xref></sup> In 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 28,754 (91%) of all deaths due to unintentional poisonings were caused by drugs, with prescription opioids being the greatest culprit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1084822312473829">3</xref></sup> More than 800,000 emergency department visits were attributed to unintentional poisonings in 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1084822312473829">3</xref></sup> Children who were brought to the emergency department for poisonings were two times more likely to have ingested medications rather than household products, such as cleaning solutions or personal care items.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1084822312473829">3</xref></sup> To prevent accidental poisonings, the CDC recommends disposing of unused, not needed, or expired medications by following proper guidelines or by participating in drug take-back programs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1084822312473829">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The CDC has classified prescription drug abuse as an epidemic, and the fastest growing drug-related problem in the United States. Unintentional drug overdose is on the rise in part due to an increase in the number of prescriptions for opioid analgesics, which are primarily used for pain management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1084822312473829">5</xref></sup> As of 2003, opioid analgesics have resulted in more deaths from overdose than cocaine and heroin combined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1084822312473829">5</xref></sup> For every one person who has an unintentional overdose death from an opioid analgesic, there are nine people admitted for substance abuse treatment, 35 who will visit an emergency department, 161 who will report drug abuse or dependence, and 461 who will say they use opioids for a nonmedical use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1084822312473829">5</xref></sup> The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) conducts a survey on drug use and health annually in persons aged 12 years and older on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco in the United States civilian, noninstitutionalized population. SAMHSA’s 2011 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) found that for persons aged 12 years and older, nonmedical use of prescription drugs ranked second among illicit drugs, only behind marijuana.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1084822312473829">6</xref></sup> In 2011, 6.1 million persons reported they used psychotherapeutic drugs for a nonmedical purpose in the last month, which includes 4.5 million people using pain relievers, 1.8 million using tranquilizers, 970,00 using stimulants, and 231,000 using sedatives nonmedically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1084822312473829">6</xref></sup> More than half of the nonmedical users of pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives reported that they received the drugs they most recently used from a friend or relative for free,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1084822312473829">6</xref></sup> which includes drugs obtained from home medicine cabinets. Of those surveyed, only 3.9% responded that they had received pain relievers from a drug dealer or a stranger.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1084822312473829">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In light of these sobering statistics, it is imperative that health care professionals are knowledgeable about the recommended methods for storage and disposal of expired and unused prescription medications in the home. Health care providers who provide services in the home environment have a unique opportunity to assist patients with removal of these potentially dangerous substances from the home in a safe and environmentally responsible manner and to provide education to the public regarding proper storage and disposal methods.</p>

<title>Government Guidance Regarding Prescription Drug Storage and Disposal</title>
<p>Preventing accidental poisonings and illicit drug diversion can begin with proper storage of household medications. The CDC and other government agencies including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) have joined with private partners including the American Association of Poison Control Centers, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, and others, to promote the Up and Away Campaign.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822312473829">7</xref></sup> The Up and Away campaign is an educational initiative to remind families of the importance of safe medication storage. The Up and Away website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.UpAndAway.org">www.UpAndAway.org</ext-link>) provides many useful printable educational materials for public use. It is recommended that medications be stored in childproof containers out of sight and out of reach of children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822312473829">7</xref></sup> It is important to recognize that even seemingly harmless over-the-counter (OTC) products can be dangerous to children. The potential danger of OTC medications was highlighted in October of 2012, when the FDA issued a public warning about OTC eye drops and nasal sprays as the result of hospitalizations of several children aged 5 years and younger due to accidental ingestion of these products.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1084822312473829">8</xref></sup> Because the majority of nonmedical users of prescription pain medications obtain these medications from friends and family,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1084822312473829">6</xref></sup> storing medications out of sight of visitors and family members may also help to deter and prevent drug diversion. Once medications are expired or unwanted, it is best to remove them from the home to reduce potential for poisoning or diversion. Recognizing that drug disposal is an important way to reduce supply of drugs with abuse potential from American communities, the White House has included drug disposal as one of four pillars of the National Drug Control Strategy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1084822312473829">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Government agencies have issued guidance for the public regarding the disposal of unused and expired prescription medications, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). The FDA and the ONDCP have jointly developed recommendations for prescription drug disposal, which are available to the public on both the ONDCP and the FDA websites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1084822312473829">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1084822312473829">11</xref></sup> Prescription drug take-back programs are advocated as the preferred method of disposal, and consumers are advised to contact their local government’s trash and recycling service for information about these programs. When drug take-back programs are not available locally, the FDA and the ONDCP recommend disposing of expired or unused medications in a manner that deters others from easily retrieving the drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1084822312473829">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1084822312473829">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1084822312473829">11</xref></sup> Consumers are instructed to dispose of medications by mixing and crushing them with an undesirable substance, such as kitty litter or used coffee grounds. This mixture should then be placed inside a disposable container, such as an empty margarine tub (with lid) or a sealable plastic bag, and then placed in the trash. These measures are intended to prevent accidental or deliberate ingestion by others though it is still possible for drugs disposed of in this manner to pollute local water supplies.</p>

<p>It is recommended that a select group of drugs be flushed down a toilet, including those that appear on the FDA’s list of flushable medications and those that have labels that specifically state that flushing is the preferred disposal method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1084822312473829">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1084822312473829"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1084822312473829">12</xref></sup> Currently there are 32 specific prescription medication formulations for which the FDA recommends flushing as the preferred method of disposal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1084822312473829">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1084822312473829">12</xref></sup> This list of flushable medications is under continuous review by the FDA and is updated regularly. Medications for which flushing is recommended are those that the FDA has determined have the highest risk of accidental poisoning of people or pets if placed in the trash. Though the FDA acknowledges that drug residues in the water supply and environment are a valid public concern, the administration maintains that, for the select list of 32 drugs, the risk of accidental household poisoning to people or pets outweighs the potential risk to the environment caused by flushing these medications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1084822312473829">12</xref></sup></p>

<p>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in collaboration with the American Pharmacists Association and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, through a public–private partnership, have developed the SMARxT DISPOSAL<sup>™</sup> Campaign.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1084822312473829">13</xref></sup> This group aims to educate the public about proper disposal of prescription medications. The SMARxT DISPOSAL<sup>™</sup> recommendations for disposal of prescription medications agree with those of the FDA and the ONDCP. The SMARxT DISPOSAL<sup>™</sup> Campaign maintains a website where pharmacies and other stakeholders can download free printable educational materials for distribution to the public.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1084822312473829">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Concern about medication residues in the water supply has led to increased scrutiny on medication disposal practices. Though the FDA recommends the public flush certain medications, health care facilities, including assisted living facilities where clients reside independently or semiindependently, may be restricted by state law from disposing of medications via the flushing route. For example, the state of Illinois recently passed the Safe Medication Disposal Act of 2010, which levies fines up to US$500 for each offense on health care institutions, employees, or contractors who “flush, pour, or empty any unused medication into a public wastewater collection system or a septic system.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1084822312473829">14</xref></sup> Facilities without a DEA registration number, such as nursing facilities, may have limited options for disposing of controlled substances and thus be more likely to flush these medications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1084822312473829">15</xref></sup> These facilities should attempt to utilize local prescription drug take-back programs if possible. Health care facilities should adhere to their institutional policies regarding disposal of medical waste, including medications, and should ensure that these policies are not in violation of state or federal law. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides guidance to health care facilities for designing policies on hazardous waste disposal, including unused or expired prescription drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1084822312473829">16</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1084822312473829">
<title>Prescription Drug Take-Back Programs</title>
<p>Though local prescription drug take-back programs are an ideal way to reduce the supply of unused and expired prescription drugs in the community, potentially reducing drug abuse and environmental pollution, these programs are not currently available in every community. In addition, the utility of such programs has historically been limited by the structure of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which creates a closed system of distribution in which only registered handlers may lawfully participate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1084822312473829">17</xref></sup> Without law-enforcement participation, local prescription drug take-back programs may only accept noncontrolled substances to not be in violation of the CSA. The DEA has recently begun a national campaign to provide take-back events where the public can return both controlled and noncontrolled substances for destruction. The first DEA sponsored national drug take-back event was held on September 25, 2010, where more than 4,000 sites in all 50 states accepted more than 242,000 pounds of unused prescription medications from the public.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1084822312473829">18</xref></sup> Over the last 2 years the DEA has held a total of five drug take-back events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1084822312473829">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1084822312473829"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1084822312473829"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1084822312473829"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1084822312473829">22</xref></sup> The fifth and most recent drug take back was held on September 29, 2012 and collected 488,395 pounds of unused medications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1084822312473829">22</xref></sup> Because of the success and overwhelming public response to these events, the DEA has stated a commitment to continue to hold one-day take-back programs several times per year. These events are a significant part of the White House’s prescription drug abuse prevention strategy and are included in the 2012 National Drug Control Policy as a Strategy Action Item.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1084822312473829">23</xref></sup> At the time of this submission, the DEA had not yet announced the date of the next national drug take-back event. However, there has historically been one event in the fall and one event in the spring of recent years, and it is anticipated that the next take back event will be held in the spring of 2013. The DEA routinely announces dates for national drug take-back events on the DEA website at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.justice.gov/dea/index.shtml">http://www.justice.gov/dea/index.shtml</ext-link>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1084822312473829">24</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section4-1084822312473829">
<title>Future Directions</title>
<p>Recognizing the limitations the CSA places on responsible drug disposal efforts, the 111th Congress debated several bills introduced in 2009-2010 to address this issue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1084822312473829">25</xref></sup> Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota sponsored the bill, which ultimately was passed, known as S. 3397 or The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010, which was signed into law by President Obama on October 12, 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1084822312473829">26</xref></sup> This Act amends the CSA to allow for end users or their legal agents to deliver controlled substances to an entity that is authorized under the CSA to dispose of them. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act has cleared the way for the DEA to develop regulations governing the return of unused controlled substances to DEA registrants for disposal. It is important to note that until these regulations are formally implemented by the DEA, under the CSA it is still considered trafficking for a person other than the intended end user to possess and/or transport unused controlled substances from the intended consumer to a DEA drug take-back event. Therefore, health care providers should educate clients about drug take-back events, but should not volunteer to transport medications to these events on behalf of patients. It is always advisable to contact local law enforcement with any questions regarding transportation of controlled substances to the DEA’s drug take-back events.</p>
<p>In light of the dangers of accidental poisonings, the widespread abuse of prescription drugs, and the fact that most abusers acquire the drugs from a friend or relative, it is imperative that health care providers who provide services in the home environment be aware of this problem and are knowledgeable about where to find information regarding storage, diversion prevention, and disposal. Convenient and environmentally responsible drug disposal programs as advocated by ONDCP and other agencies are becoming more accessible to communities throughout the United States. Health care providers should be ready to provide information to their clients regarding proper disposal of these potentially dangerous medications.</p>
