<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In mental work settings, operators acquire information from displays and execute their actions with maneuverable devices. These individuals are required to execute primarily internal mental actions rather than external motor actions that can be observed directly. Motor actions are gradually being replaced and may be only episodic, whereas sensory-perceptual and mental activities are increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812437275">Bedny &amp; Karwowski, 2006</xref>). Thus, it is difficult to observe task-performing body behaviors in such work settings because of their infrequent occurrence. To date, the analysis of actions directly involved in test tasks, such as eye movements and motor actions, have been used extensively and comprehensively for workload analysis.</p>
<p>Workload is defined as the impact of work demands on operators with individual characteristics and needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018720812437275">Rohmert, 1989</xref>). The measurement of workload remains an important, central task in ergonomics research. To measure workload for mental work, numerous methods have been developed in literature, including the following: (a) activity measures, for example, eye movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018720812437275">Rötting, 2001</xref>); (b) physiological measures, for example, heart rate variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720812437275">Meshkati, 1988</xref>) and blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018720812437275">Vogt, Hagemann, &amp; Kastner, 2006</xref>); (c) subjective assessments, for example, the NASA– Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812437275">Hart and Staveland (1988)</xref> and the Subjective Workload Assessment Technique by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018720812437275">Reid and Nygren (1988)</xref>; and (d) performance and errors during task execution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720812437275">Eggemeier &amp; Wilson, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>These methods have obvious disadvantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720812437275">Cain, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812437275">Farmer &amp; Brownson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018720812437275">Meshkati, Hancock, Rahimi, &amp; Dawes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018720812437275">O’Donnell &amp; Eggemeier, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018720812437275">Wierwille &amp; Eggemeier, 1993</xref>). Questionnaires cannot be used for continuous workload measurements. Different physiological measures have been used in numerous ergonomic studies and have been found to be sensitive to certain stages of information processing during mental work. Large individual differences exist in physiological responses; hence, measurability is a critical issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720812437275">Nachreiner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018720812437275">Schmidtke, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812437275">Balaban et al. (2004)</xref> concluded that physiological measurements were “highly susceptible to confounding factors” (p. 267).</p>
<p>Because of the performance of and errors involved in workload measurement, the performance of both primary and secondary tasks has been analyzed. The performance of primary and secondary tasks depends on the strategy of task performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018720812437275">O’Donnell and Eggemeier (1986)</xref> noted that underload may enhance performance, whereas overload may result in a floor effect. Task-performing body behavior reflects only the input and the output from the person rather than all internal activities in the brain. Moreover, the effect of the workload on an operator in a mental work setting is generally interpreted through the integration of all the measurements being used.</p>
<p>In some special mental work settings (e.g., air traffic control, train traffic control), an operator sits on a chair to supervise and control traffic, and only a few task-performing motor actions are displayed. Most of the time, it seems that the operator is just sitting there. Hence, the total activities (both mental and external activities) of the operator would not be entirely revealed if only his or her sensory-motor actions were analyzed. To date, non-task-performing body behavior, such as body posture and movement, has not gained much interest in mental work analysis, even though it does occur and is supportive of and accompanied by task-performing body behaviors.</p>
<p>For example, an operator needs a proper body posture for motor action execution, even if no motor action is executed. In response to new or significant information from the environment, the human body orients toward a stimulus, and this body orientation reaction could arrest ongoing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720812437275">Mulder, 1979</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720812437275">Feyer (2007)</xref> suggested building up a human performance model that included the interactions between current physical and cognitive models. Body behaviors (activities), no matter whether they are directly involved in performing the task or not, are influences on the interactions and have an influence on human performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720812437275">Feyer, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812437275">Keijzer (2005)</xref> proposed a theoretical analysis of behavior and noted that body behavior was an obviously observable aspect that can reflect mental processes.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812437275">Graf, Guggenbühl, and Krueger (1995)</xref> analyzed the sitting postures at five workplaces (assembly, visual display unit [VDU], office, cashier, and listening) and found that task demand had a significant effect on sitting positions. VDU workers maintained upright or forward-leaning positions for keying tasks at higher speeds and maintained more comfortable positions for keying tasks at low speeds or for conversation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812437275">Dellemann, Haslegrave, &amp; Chaffin, 2004</xref>). In the study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720812437275">Rogé, Pebayle, and Muzet (2001)</xref>, body movements (moving the trunk forward, tilting sideways) were demonstrated to be related to physiological signs of low vigilance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812437275">Balaban et al. (2004)</xref> used a dynamic postural assessment chair with pressure sensors to analyze postural control and measure the head and trunk positions of participants in a simulated airspace-monitoring task. The results of this study indicated that participants moved their head closer to a computer display when the task difficulty increased. Meanwhile, the participants preferred to lean their trunk backward against the chair back with lower work demand.</p>
<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720812437275">Frank (2006)</xref> investigated seated postural changes during a simulated airspace-monitoring task by measuring the distributions of pressure over the seat and back pads of the chair. A relationship between the seated postural changes and the levels of task difficulty were found: Participants moved less during tasks with higher difficulty. Considering sitting trunk posture in a similar mental work setting (computer games), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720812437275">Mota (2002)</xref> investigated seat pressure measurements and showed that the sitting trunk posture—forward, straight, and backward—changed in children trying to infer various cognitive states or emotions (e.g., frustration).</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, non-task-performing body behavior, especially body posture, has not been studied widely in mental work analysis, and it is the focus of this article. Furthermore, existing studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812437275">Balaban et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720812437275">Frank, 2006</xref>) of body posture analysis involving pressure sensors focus on the relationships between body posture and task difficulties rather than the relationships between body posture and workload.</p>
<p>Therefore, a key objective of this study is to demonstrate that non-task-performing body behavior (body posture), which is easily observed and measured during work, can be regarded as a practical, continuous, and supplementary method for making workload measurements. The major assumption in this study is that behavior can be used to describe mental processes in some context. A novel supplementary method based on human behavior, particularly, the behavior not directly related to task execution, is proposed to assess the workload in mental work situations. The primary advantage of this method is that measurement of such behavior is more inherent, unobtrusive, and noninvasive while providing insight into a participant’s cognitive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812437275">Balaban et al., 2004</xref>). In this study, we address the links between non-task-related body behaviors (trunk posture and head posture) that occurred while participants performed tasks with different workloads in mental work settings.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section9-0018720812437275">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>We recruited 22 participants through voluntary responses to fliers; there were 8 females (mean age = 27.36 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.61) and 14 males (mean age = 24.14 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.83). The participants were students from a university. All participants were right-handed. They reported that they had experience with computer games, and 8 had previous experience with the Tower of London or the Tower of Hanoi task. All of the participants reported that they had no mental or physical health problems.</p>

<sec id="section10-0018720812437275">
<title>Experimental Material and Equipment</title>
<p>The Psychology Experiment Building Language (PEBL), a free psychology program for designing and carrying out standard psychological experiments, was used as the test system (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pebl.sourceforge.net/index.html#about">http://pebl.sourceforge.net/index.html#about</ext-link>).</p>
<p>The test system was run on a computer with optimal capability, and the tasks were shown on a 14-in. LCD display that was placed on a worktable with a height of 70 cm. A vertically adjustable and rotatable chair with a backrest and no armrests was provided for the participants during the experiment. We used two Panasonic camcorders (one located to the left of the participant and the other on the left side of the participant’s back) to capture the entire body posture of a given participant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0018720812437275">
<title>Experimental Tasks</title>
<p>To simulate mental work environment, mental tasks with various components representing the various stages of information processing (information acquisition, information analysis, decision selection, and action implementation) should be selected. With regard to the different learning abilities of the participants, the tasks should be easy to learn and perform so that a stable performance can be achieved. In addition, the tasks should be engaging for the participants to avoid boredom. Natural body posture, particularly, trunk posture, should be visible during task execution. Mental tasks requiring a very short period of time to complete were not suitable for this experiment because the initial body posture could be assumed intentionally for the experiment rather than naturally.</p>
<p>As shown in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812437275">Hart &amp; Staveland, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720812437275">Perez, Masline, Ramsey, &amp; Urban, 1984</xref>), various types of tasks can contribute to different aspects and the amount of workload. Therefore, the expectation of this study was to construct different overall workloads (OWL) through different major aspects based on information processing. Thus, different work activities were included in this study. Four typical psychological tests were chosen to simulate various mental activities.</p>
<list id="list1-0018720812437275" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Simple reaction time (SRT): A participant performing this task was required to press a key on the keyboard in response to the presence of a visual stimulus (<italic>X</italic> sign), which appeared as 1 of 10 contiguous delays between 250 s and 2,500 s from the previous response. The size of the <italic>X</italic> sign on the display in this study was approximately 8.5 mm in length.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Compensatory visual tracking: The execution of manual responses in terms of rapidity and accuracy was evaluated in this task. A participant was instructed to continuously adjust a mouse to keep a circular disk within a bull’s-eye ring on a display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018720812437275">Makeig &amp; Jolley, 1996</xref>). Generally, the difficulty of the tracking task is determined by two parameters: the order of control and the bandwidth of the forcing function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018720812437275">Vidulich, 1988</xref>). This task was originally used to investigate vigilance. The actual radius of the circular disk was 4.5 mm on the display in this study. The radius of the inner circle forming the ring was equal to that of the circular disk; the radius of outer circle was twice as large as that of the inner circle.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Tower of London: This task is a traditional test for problem solving and task planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018720812437275">Shallice, 1982</xref>). Four beads of different colors were used in our study. The objective for the participants was to move a pile of beads using three keys (1, 2, and 3) on the numerical block of the keyboard from their original configuration to the configuration shown at the top of the screen. The actual size of the beads was 46 mm wide by 8 mm tall.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Two-column addition: This task tests a participant’s ability to sum simple addition problems in terms of the speed and accuracy required to retrieve arithmetic information and use procedural knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720812437275">Perez et al., 1984</xref>). Short-term memory for retaining the result was necessary. Each participant was presented with a set of trials, each of which consisted of three two-digit numbers shown on a display in a column. The participant was instructed to sum the numbers as rapidly as possible. The left-hand digit of the answer had to be entered first. The three numbers disappeared after the first numerical key was pressed. The participant had to enter the answer with the Return key within 15 s; otherwise, a new trial was shown. A total of 45 trials were used in our study. The three numbers were shown in the middle of the display. The actual length of each digit was approximately 8.5 mm.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Snapshots of each task are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720812437275">Figure 1</xref>. According to one expert rating and the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812437275">Hart &amp; Staveland, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720812437275">Perez et al., 1984</xref>), the difficulty of the SRT task was the lowest among the four tasks. The tracking task required a high degree of physical effort and a high level of information analysis. Mental demands should be a major factor in the workload of the cognitive tasks (Tower of London and addition).</p>

<title>Experimental Procedure</title>
<p>The tasks and the experimental procedure were explained to all participants. Each participant began with a biographical questionnaire. The participant was then seated on the chair and was asked to find his or her normal seated position for working in front of a display by moving the table and adjusting the chair or the display. The participants practiced the various tasks one by one. After the training period, the participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire regarding their state of mind using the Positive Affect/Negative Affect Scale (PANAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018720812437275">Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Each of the four tasks performed by the participants lasted 6 min. The order of the tasks was randomized by the software for each of the participants. After each task, the participants filled out a NASA-TLX questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812437275">Hart, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812437275">Hart &amp; Staveland, 1988</xref>) to assess their mental workload during the task. At the end of the experiment, the participants were asked to assess their state of mind again.</p>

<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>Body posture was recorded by two cameras. The views of the cameras are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720812437275">Figure 2</xref>. After the cameras were started, a light flash lasting 0.04 s was used for synchronization, and the time of the flash was recorded. To measure body posture, a video-based software system was used for dynamic postural assessments. This software system can analyze the positions of points on the human body or objects by recognizing markers on the points. The positions of points on the body (left shoulder, left hip, and corner of the left eye) and the corner of the display were measured with the Cartesian coordinate system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720812437275">Figure 2</xref>). These four points were marked with full dark circles.</p>

<p>Cartesian coordinate system (X = sagittal axis, Y = transverse axis, Z = longitudinal axis). D = distance; L = longitudinal length; θ = trunk angle; e = corner of the left eye; d = corner of the display; s = left shoulder; h = left hip.</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0018720812437275-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<p>The value of the middle point of the display in the coordinate system was determined by the values of the corner of the display and the size of the display. The distance between the left eye point and the display’s center point on the transverse plane in the coordinate system, which is shown by the distance between the point d′ and the point e′ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720812437275">Figure 2</xref>, was calculated. The longitudinal length (L) between the left shoulder and the hip was calculated as a measure of upper trunk posture. The distance between the points s″ and h′ is the longitudinal length in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720812437275">Figure 2</xref>. The trunk angle between the line defined by L and the sagittal plane was another measure of the upper trunk posture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720812437275">Figure 2</xref>). The mean and standard deviation of each variable for body posture were calculated. These three variables are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720812437275">Figure 1</xref> with dark-colored letters. The trunk angle of L was normalized as follows because each individual participant had a different normal seated posture:</p>

<p>We collected subjectively measured data for workload using the NASA-TLX for each task. A tally of the importance selections for each rating from the pairwise comparisons in the NASA-TLX questionnaire ratings was calculated and acted as a weighting factor for each rating. We calculated the subjective OWL for each task for each participant using the values of the ratings and the weights. To avoid individual biases for the tasks, the OWL and all dimensions of the subjective workload, that is, mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort, and frustration, were normalized. Thus, the values of all the workload dimensions ranged from 0 to 1. The normalizing procedure for each dimension (WL) was as follows:</p>

<p>We also collected the state of mind of the participants at the beginning and at the end of the experiments using the PANAS. This evaluation consisted of 10 items for the Positive Affect scale and 10 items for the Negative Affect scale. The positive items included attentive, interested, alert, excited, enthusiastic, inspired, proud, determined, strong, and active. The negative items were distressed, upset, hostile, irritable, scared, afraid, ashamed, nervous, and jittery. The means and standard deviations of the positive and negative items were calculated for the timings before and after the experiment.</p>
<p>In this study, we performed the statistical analysis using SPSS Version 17 with the significance level set at 5%.</p>
<p>We used generalized estimating equations (GEE) to analyze the effects of tasks on body posture. The GEE method, proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720812437275">Liang and Zeger (1986)</xref>, is a procedure to extend generalized linear models and to analyze repeated measurements and correlated data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812437275">Hanley, Negassa, Edwardes, &amp; Forrester, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812437275">Hardin &amp; Hilber, 2001</xref>). There are two approaches that have been developed for testing model effects in GEE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018720812437275">Ziegler, 1999</xref>). The first is a modified Wald statistic (or a modified score statistic), and the second is goodness of fit. In SPSS, QICC (the corrected quasi-likelihood with an independence model criterion) was applied for the goodness-of-fit test. A model that yields the smallest QICC is better than other models. The results of the Wald statistic are shown in the following results. A task factor was used as a within-subject variable, and pairwise comparisons between the tasks were performed with the Bonferroni adjustment method. The relationships between body position and the subjective workload assessments were also analyzed with the use of GEEs.</p>

<p>A slight increase in negative affect (before, 1.274 ± 0.243; after, 1.335 ± 0.428) and a decrease in positive affect (before, 2.935 ± 0.826; after, 2.817 ± 0.078) were found after the experiments. The scores for the positive and negative affects were within the normal limits of skewness and kurtosis. However, a repeated-measures analysis indicated that there was no significant difference for either positive or negative affect.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A review of archival literature revealed that the current methods (questionnaires, measurement of activities for task performance, subjective assessments) of workload measurement involve many challenges. Non-task-performing behavior measures are more amenable to direct and continuous observation. Therefore, non-task-performing behaviors were studied as new and alternative measures for workload during mental tasks. As an initial proof of concept for this new method, the relationships between workload and aspects of body posture (i.e., trunk and head postures) were studied during mental tasks in the current study.</p>
<p>All of the mental tasks used in this study were presented on a display and required different levels of effort from the participants for each stage of information processing; for example, the perception demand for the tracking system was higher than that for the addition task. The workload and its components for the various tasks imposed different effects on the participants’ behaviors. The participants were asked to adjust the experimental setup so that they could reach the keyboard and use the mouse without changing their normal seated posture. Hence, the trunk position during task performance was not affected by the various operation types.</p>
<p>With regard to the distance between the head and the display, the participants sat closer to the displays in the addition task, during which they had a higher OWL. This result is consistent with the results of the study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812437275">Balaban et al. (2004)</xref>. Furthermore, this distance was not sensitive enough for us to discern differences in the OWL in the low range; we found no differences in the distances between the tasks with comparatively lower workloads (SRT, tracking, and Tower of London). Meanwhile, the standard deviation of distance was shorter in the SRT than in other tasks, which indicated that the participants changed their upper trunk posture across a larger range in the SRT task.</p>
<p>The significant influence of the tasks on the angle is in line with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812437275">Graf et al. (1995)</xref>. Furthermore, the angle for the addition task was larger than that for the other tasks. This result indicated that the participants preferred to lean their trunk forward with higher task demand, a finding that is consistent with the results of a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812437275">Dellemann et al., 2004</xref>). The distance between the shoulder and the hip decreased with the OWL, whereas the angle increased with the OWL. The participants leaned their trunks forward in high OWL situations. Both the standard deviation of the angle and the distance were correlated significantly with mental demand, which indicated that the participants maintained their trunks in a relatively constant position when they had higher mental demand.</p>
<p>The results of the current study reveal that the differences in body posture were barely discernible for midrange workload levels. A possible explanation might be that non-task-performing behavior is nonlinearly correlated with workload, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812437275">Bedny, Seglin, and Meister (2000)</xref> indicated. Furthermore, only two components of non-task-performing behaviors were analyzed, and body movements were not considered in the current study.</p>
<p>The selected tasks in this study were of different types and thus did not reflect different workload levels within each type. To develop and validate a method for measuring workload through body behavior analysis, further research is required. Follow-up research could involve the simulation of tasks for each stage of information processing in the laboratory setting with the use of different methods of workload measurement (e.g., physiological measures) to verify the results of body posture. Meanwhile, other body behaviors (e.g., posture and movement of the hands and legs) can be analyzed as part of the workload assessment. Body posture should be studied in its entirety to measure workload.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0018720812437275" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study, the relationships between body postures and workload were investigated with the use of video-based analysis. The results showed that participants kept their heads closer to the display when they had a higher OWL. In addition, with a lower mental workload, the participants adjusted their head with respect to the display to maintain a variety of working positions. They preferred to lean their trunks forward during higher OWL. Given these findings, the seated body posture can be used as an indicator of the workload in mental work settings. It is recommended that different levels of the same type of mental task be used in further research to develop a supplementary method for workload assessment based on body posture. This method may be useful for real-time observations or the monitoring of mental states in analogous environments (e.g., rail traffic dispatching, air traffic control) with current powerful computer technology for image recognition.</p>
