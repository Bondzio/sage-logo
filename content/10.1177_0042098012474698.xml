<abstract>
<p>Sustainability’s reception is dependent upon its presentation. While academics may be reaching the consensus that pursuing sustainability requires at least a triple-bottom-line approach, in practice, planners, legislators and other leaders often choose an approach that best suits their needs. In north central Texas, this has in recent years meant an approach with a focus on fiscal matters. Whatever the pro-market flavour of sustainability practice in north central Texas, elements of the conservative base have resented its pursuit. Because planners and legislators in north central Texas have muddled their concept of sustainability with jargon, conflated it with other causes and failed clearly to justify its pursuit, elements of the conservative base have interpreted sustainability as an externally motivated, threatening agenda. This paper presents eight points for planners and other leaders to consider when framing sustainability in conservative contexts for the purpose of finding for positive dialogue and outcomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Finding sustainability in any context is a tall order, given its blending of often contradictory social justice, economic and environmentalist concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098012474698">Campbell, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098012474698">Gunder, 2006</xref>). On the ground, sustainability’s definition and reception vary, with emphasis on growth over the environment, the environment over social justice or some other scenario, as will happen when<disp-quote>
<p>Environmentalists want environmental systems sustained. Workers want jobs sustained. Capitalists and socialists have their ‘isms’ while aristocrats, autocrats and technocrats have their ‘cracies.’ … With the term meaning something different from everyone, the quest for sustainable development is off to a cacophonous start (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098012474698">Norgaard, 1988</xref>, p. 607).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The quest is certainly cacophonous in North Texas.</p>
<p>This paper is derived from observation of Tea Party affiliates’ responses to planning explicitly or implicitly related to sustainability in Dallas–Fort Worth area communities. Conservative élites, including local legislators and business leaders, supported these efforts at first. While opponents were not initially in the political mainstream, even of the Tea Party, they demonstrated significant influence. My perception, based on observation of Tea Party meetings, various publications, public hearings and interviews with area planners and legislators, is that élites and planners could have avoided this disconnect with their constituents had they broached sustainability differently. Whatever the pro-market bias of local sustainability plans, elements of the conservative base have interpreted them as threatening to their livelihoods. How should planners and élites engage in sustainability planning in conservative contexts to counter the misinformation cited by opponents? It is not a task of obfuscating truth or presenting counter-information, but of understanding how sustainability fits into both the local context and wider conservative agendas.</p>
<p>The implications of this paper extend beyond conservative jurisdictions. It is argued that concepts dear to conservatives are important to achieving greater sustainability and that these concepts should come to the forefront for the purposes of achieving buy-in from disruptive groups and expanding public enthusiasm for planning. In the spirit of communicative action theory, it asks planners, as “organizers of public attention”, to politicise planning and bring attention in conservative contexts “to particular arguments” for action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012474698">Forester, 1982</xref>, pp. 68 and 73). In many cities, it probably is too late for rapprochement. However, going forward, planners and élites in conservative contexts can anticipate how to talk about sustainability. This paper opens with a discussion of the Dallas–Fort Worth context, followed by an introduction to the Tea Party and theoretical background, and then presents eight items for planners to consider when discussing sustainability with conservative élites or their constituents.</p>

<sec id="section2-0042098012474698">
<title>The Dallas–Fort Worth Context</title>
<p>Comprehensive planning has become an election issue in the Dallas suburb of Garland, where planners explained that previous plan updates were never contentious. Garland has withdrawn from the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), a non-governmental organisation founded in 1990 and thought by Tea Party affiliates to be circumventing the constitution in disseminating sustainability plans. This is despite, according to Councilman Doug Athas, the city’s history of using ICLEI to secure federal funds for cost-saving initiatives. Activists have similarly attacked a regional economic development plan “Vision North Texas” sponsored by the North Central Texas Council of Governments and supported widely in private- and public-sector circles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0042098012474698">1</xref></sup> Legislators halved in scope a “Hike and Bike System Master Plan” in Arlington, Texas, that only implied the promotion of sustainability. The Dallas suburb of McKinney has also been in the fray (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098012474698">Figure 1</xref>). Beyond Texas, similar stories have unfolded in California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098012474698">Hurley and Walker, 2004</xref>), Maine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098012474698">Betts, 2010</xref>), Tennessee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098012474698">Pare, 2011</xref>), Oklahoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098012474698">Holt, 2011</xref>), Virginia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012474698">Fears, 2011</xref>), Maryland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098012474698">Simpson, 2011</xref>) and elsewhere.</p>

</fig>
<p>According to one analysis of the 2004 presidential election, Garland and Arlington are among the 30 most conservative cities of over 100 000 in the US.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0042098012474698">2</xref></sup> Currently (September 2012) all four of Garland’s congressional representatives are Republican, as are all four of Arlington’s and both of McKinney’s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0042098012474698">3</xref></sup> These are perhaps not places where sustainability initiatives would take root without questioning or conflict. Yet these were plans for redevelopment and complete streets, the primary goals of which were enhanced property values and tax revenues, public safety and beautification. It is that diluted concept of sustainability critiqued by numerous scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098012474698">Dyllick and Hockerts, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098012474698">Gunder, 2006</xref>). Yet the plans alienated many conservatives.</p>
<p>Planners in north Texas cities have been preoccupied with denying collusion with federal or international influences, but privately scoffing. One area municipal worker said: “It’s a sham when these people show up and intimidate council and say the elected officials are working against everybody”. Another lamented: “I’m not hearing any real proposals, solutions, thoughts as to what they’d like to see. It’s all negative”.</p>
<p>In the meantime, opponents tapped deep-seated concerns related to property rights and the planning process, and alarmed elected officials, locally and nationally. The mayor of Garland, a longtime figure in community politics, pulled the city out of ICLEI to shake voters’ suspicions, and other Texas cities have followed suit (Batheja, 2012). Nationally the Republican National Committee has adopted a resolution condemning the United Nations’ Agenda 21 not as a mandate <italic>per se</italic>, but a “comprehensive plan … being covertly pushed into local communities”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0042098012474698">4</xref></sup> However, many aspects of sustainability parallel conservative values—energy conservation,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0042098012474698">5</xref></sup> mobility choice and a more diverse housing market, for example, each has its appeal in expanding choice and empowering individuals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0042098012474698">
<title>The Tea Party and Sustainability</title>
<p>At the heart of this revolt is a curious reading of Agenda 21, an outcome of the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. Agenda 21 is a ‘non-binding policy statement’ provided to world governments large and small to aid them in their pursuit of sustainable practices, should they choose to pursue them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042098012474698">UN GAOR, 1992</xref>). Since its inception, some right-wing groups, including the John Birch Society, have interpreted it as a plot to herd humanity into containment at the behest of a misanthropic global conspiracy.</p>
<p>That such a conspiracy would be widely suspected in Texas, where interventions were supported by Republican leadership, is all the more confounding, unless one understands the culture of the Tea Party. The Tea Party was conceived independently of mainstream Republican political organisation and has remained apart from and scornful of party leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042098012474698">Skocpol and Williamson, 2012</xref>, pp. 27 and 89). Tea Partiers in the South, despite demonstrating hallmarks of social conservatism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042098012474698">Skocpol and Williamson, 2012</xref>, p. 36), also share with their northern and western counterparts an often-dissonant libertarian streak. This sets them apart from establishment big-business Republicans who see some role for government—namely, in promoting market-based solutions to environmental and social challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042098012474698">Skocpol and Williamson, 2012</xref>, p. 101). Such solutions are in the far-right discourse of Tea Partiers symptomatic of ‘crony capitalism’, a favourite descriptor.</p>
<p>Even if Tea Party affiliates did not believe sustainability to be a United Nations mandated programme, it is understandable how common presentations would alienate this over 45, White, middle-class demographic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042098012474698">Skocpol and Williamson, 2012</xref>, pp. 23–26). Appreciating sustainability requires understanding the global impacts of individual action that, at face value is local and intimate. ‘Think globally, act locally’ inspires many so-called millennials, but oponents of Agenda 21 believe that it submits individuals to a compromising global commons (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098012474698">Newman 2012</xref>). It opens doors to the possibility that profitable or long-enjoyed activities should cease, despite their negative consequences never having been directly witnessed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0042098012474698">6</xref></sup> This feeling does not stop at the Tea Party: in Kari Marie Norgaard’s assessment of attitudes towards climate change in Norway and the US, there is a<disp-quote>
<p>disjuncture between the local sense of time and place … and the sense of time and place that would be needed to conceptualize climate change for it to seem ‘real’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098012474698">Norgaard, 2011</xref>, p. 76).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Given the remoteness of the consequences, alternative behaviours such as bicycling or denser living, can in the individualistic, self-centred logic of Tea Party affiliates only become commonplace because they are rewarded, subsidised or mandated; as indicative therefore of a patronising government, they are to be resisted.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is not a lack of information (as information is everywhere), or prevalent stupidity (as the facts are simple), but the facts are “overwhelming” and “people want to protect themselves” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098012474698">Norgaard, 2011</xref>, pp. 1–4).</p>
<p>In addition, that people in wealthy nations benefit from polluting technologies raises unwanted feelings of guilt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098012474698">Norgaard, 2011</xref>, pp. 72 and 85–87). And the conditions under which many people are willing to accept disturbing information do not include arguments with self-important experts, as embodied by property regulating planners, environmentalists or anyone perceived as “wearing the political badge of one side” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042098012474698">Wheeler 2012</xref>, p. A13).</p>

<title>Theoretical Background</title>
<p>Planners and élites in conservative contexts and elsewhere must reassess their presentations of sustainability because this may do more than confront conspiratorial thinking. It is not shocking that sustainability is resisted so acrimoniously: not for decades have planners had such focus. As Scott Campbell observed, there have been “sweeping calls” for transformation, “sermonizing about the moral and spiritual corruption of the industrial world,” that is “too reminiscent of our naïve belief during the 1950s and 1960s in comprehensive planning for a single ‘public interest’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098012474698">Campbell, 1996</xref>, p. 303). The critique of sustainability, Campbell foresaw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098012474698">1996</xref>, p. 304), is overdue. Steven A. Moore wrote that sustainability “is just the Enlightenment turned inside out: a scheme to predict and control humans rationally on behalf of endangered nature” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098012474698">Moore, 2007</xref>, p. 24). That planners claim sensitivity to local concerns at the same time as they present a deluge of unfamiliar buzzwords and images presents a paradox to those fearful of a conspiracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012474698">Koire, 2011</xref>, p. 12). It is a primary reason for believing one exists.</p>
<p>Despite planners’ emphasis on local input, sustainability is not often a home-grown concept; instead, it is based on best practices in distant places or supposedly universal scientific knowledge. There has been a preoccupation with promoting an ideal. Sustainability has its roots in hopes for a “steady-state, no growth” scenario (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098012474698">Campbell, 1996</xref>, p. 304) in which husbandry of the land would not compromise future generations’ ability to follow suit while maintaining their predecessors’ quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042098012474698">WCED, 1987</xref>). Scholars have argued that the pursuit of sustainability should operate between the poles of economic gain and ecological stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098012474698">Satterthwaite, 1997</xref>) or adopt a multi-bottom line approach featuring equal attention to issues of ecology, social justice and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098012474698">Gunder, 2006</xref>). Emphasising a multifaceted concept of sustainability can convey that all facets must be explicitly and equally valued in all contexts. The pursuit of an ideal in the tradition of “armchair theorizing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098012474698">Innes 1995</xref>, p. 183) conflicts with otherwise predominant calls for communicative action. These advocate “publicly aired political argument”, not propaganda, but the use of particular truthful information to “organize the attention” of unique groups to “options for action” that, I should add, constituents see as personally beneficial in their own terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012474698">Forester, 1982</xref>, pp. 68 and 73).</p>
<p>A few scholars have observed this conflict before. Patrick Hurley and Peter Walker observed an episode in California where activists opposed conservation planning as a UN-mandated implementation of the Wildlands Project, a plan to create biodiversity corridors in North America through development rights acquisition. They observed that<disp-quote>
<p>Scientific visions (when viewed as espousing ‘universal truths’) can provide the conspiratorial ‘hook’ for opponents of conservation planning by undermining the perceived legitimacy or ‘localness’ of scientific practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098012474698">Hurley and Walker, 2004</xref>, pp. 1531–1532).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>They argued that<disp-quote>
<p>successful use of claims of global conspiracy … underscores social realities that planners and scholars need to consider when promoting what they often view as simply ‘good planning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098012474698">Hurley and Walker, 2004</xref>, p. 1530).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Andrew Ross noted that advocates of alternative energy have used a new approach in the Arizonan context, <italic>truthfully</italic> posing green building and similar reforms as “individual lifestyle options” rather than any comprehensive vision of “sustainable urbanism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098012474698">Ross, 2011</xref>, p. 70; quoting Anthony Floyd of the Scottsdale, AZ Green Building Program). Ross concluded that “top–down efforts at regulation are asking for trouble if they do not have roots in a community-level movement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098012474698">Ross, 2011</xref>, p. 68). Moore documented “alternative paths to sustainability” in Austin, Curitiba and Frankfurt that “so altered [his] understanding of what sustainable development might ‘look like’ and how it might ‘show up’ in a place” that he became “prepared to argue that sustainability is a story line or plot—not a scientific condition or concept” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098012474698">Moore, 2007</xref>, p. 1).</p>

<sec id="section5-0042098012474698" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>I pursued a diverse methodology owing to the difficulty of achieving interviews with Tea Party activists. I observed seven Tea Party meetings in the Dallas–Fort Worth area in 2011 and 2012: two in McKinney, two in Garland, two in Arlington and one in North Dallas. Only one in Arlington and one in McKinney were totally focused on development issues and development issues were not mentioned at all the meetings. A few activists I met at these meetings promised formal interviews but none followed through. I had several informal conversations and these activists also provided opportunity for observation at hearings and visioning sessions for “Vision North Texas”. I also contacted out-of-state activists with significant on-line presence and achieved an interview with one in Massachusetts who provided opinions on environmental review and other features of development review less prominent in Texas. I conducted interviews with five Dallas–Fort Worth area municipal officials who had had experience with Tea Party affiliates and with Councilman Douglas Athas of Garland, Texas. The most significant source of information has been the bountiful on-line literature and videos produced by local Tea Party affiliates and national figures such as Rosa Koire, as well as a few printed publications. I drew background from politically diverse scholarly literature. Consequently what is presented here is not a comprehensive ethnography of any particular group or a history of recent events; nor are the eight topics for conversation the result of any formal protocol. They are personal reflections, although each is related to some source of consternation identified in personal observations and in print or on-line media.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0042098012474698">
<title>Point 1: Sustainability Can Involve the Enhancement of Property Rights</title>
<p>In areas of Garland scheduled for denser development under the new comprehensive plan opponents perceive an intrusion on a way of life protected by zoning. The irony is not lost on Councilman Athas: “If they stop to think that what they’re supporting is this very draconian system of regulation of land … they wouldn’t stand behind it”. When legislators in north Texas talk about sustainability, what they most prize are fiscal benefits of efficient uses of land—namely, fashionable, high-priced, mixed-use communities. This requires removing what conservatives call the ‘closed-system’ approach of conventional zoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098012474698">Staley and Scarlett, 1997</xref>). It is also accepted knowledge among planning scholars that liberalising zoning codes is “a prerequisite to alternative development forms” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098012474698">Levine, 2006</xref>, p. 65). However, some North Texans see such developments as a product of Agenda 21.</p>
<p>Area planners did not discuss how sustainable development practices might utilise the frameworks of property rights and the market by allowing more efficient development. Searching for common ground with conservatives is not an original suggestion: observing an anti-Smart-growth conference in 2003, Joel Hirschhorn advised smart growth advocates to “stress market forces” and to “start paying more attention to the many grassroots groups working under the banner of Smart Growth but fighting any form of local or regional growth” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098012474698">Hirschorn, 2003</xref>). Portland took the right approach, wrote Samuel Staley of Reason, not in a growth boundary, but in forbidding the prohibition of in-demand housing types by local zoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042098012474698">Staley, 2000</xref>, p. 68).</p>
<p>Complicating the picture is a misconception that up-zoning creates density rather than allowing it. One local planner explained<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t think they understand how development works. … From the range of statements that have been made, I think they view it as the government is going to zone something that way and see that it happens.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Randal O’Toole has successfully politicised planning to the advantage of his anti-density agenda, calling his defeat of up-zoning in Oak Grove, Oregon, a victory against the “planners’ wrecking ball” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0042098012474698">Texas Public Policy Foundation, n.d</xref>.). Although up-zoning simply allows denser development if there is demand, saying he defeated the “market’s wrecking ball” or even the “developer’s wrecking ball” would not seem fitting to his audience. That O’Toole can bill himself a promoter of libertarian values is unfortunate. Oregonians in Action pushed a ballot measure in 2002 that attempted to ban residences above stores—this was not about enhancing property rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012474698">Flint, 2006</xref>, p. 202). Up-zoning, at least within a traditional pyramidal zoning scheme, is pro-market as it allows more choice. Athas was more accurate when he condemned prevalent low-density zoning as “communistic”.</p>
<p>Pointing out that fighting density involves suppressing development rights may be useful, unless planners are awarding these development rights not to existing landowners but the purchasers of forcibly assembled properties. Perceived abuse of eminent domain is, many interviewees pointed out, at the crux of Agenda 21 opponents’ frustrations. I will return to this point later.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it would be productive for planners and élites in conservative contexts, as O’Toole has done, to tap into the “deep well of respect for property rights in the American culture” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012474698">Flint, 2006</xref>, p. 147). Athas continued<disp-quote>
<p>If they understood that the market is so encumbered by our current zoning system they would see it differently. But they’ve got to stop and listen to someone say that before they can understand it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Could a more libertarian land use policy be more sustainable? It is a question worth asking—the failure to express where sustainability co-exists with market interests is an error when operating in conservative contexts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0042098012474698">
<title>Point 2: There May Be Merit in Questioning Environmental Review as Currently Practised</title>
<p>Hal Shurtleff, a Boston-area John Birch Society member, laments sustainability initiatives that simultaneously advocate urban living and make it more expensive<disp-quote>
<p>They make it so difficult to live in a city like Boston. … So it’s working against us, sustainability. It sounds warm and fuzzy. But you try to live in the city of Boston, on one income, it’s pretty tough.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Do common environmental review practices lead to a protected environment? Evidence exists that the heightened discretion characteristic of environmental review allows pockets of restricted development in prime growth areas, and backfires in the form of high costs and more sprawl.</p>
<p>Those promoting sustainability in conservative contexts may wish to admit that the regulatory approach has had negative consequences for people and the environment. Since <italic>Friends of Mammoth</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042098012474698">Supreme Court of California, 1972</xref>), the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) has required performance-based evaluations for nearly all projects permitted by any government agency in the state. These evaluations identify existing natural and man-made resources at development sites and require the mitigation of significant impacts on these resources. Researchers soon found that, state-wide, developers were “overdesigning” to avoid triggering costly studies, inflating housing costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042098012474698">Small and Knust, Inc., 1980</xref>7, 46).

<p>Go to almost any planning conference in California, and you are likely to find sessions about how CEQA prevents good planning.

<p>The costs of mitigation can deter developers altogether and send them to less populated, less supervised areas, contributing to sprawl.</p>
<p>This substantiates the arguments of libertarian scholars such as Bernard Siegan<disp-quote>

<p>Implementing performance review on top of existing regulations has, however, become a preferred strategy for environmental protection.

<title>Point 3: Sustainability in Conservative Circles Can Be Focused on Fiscal Restraint</title>
<p>Garland is experiencing difficulties typical of older suburbs. Its zoning was tailored for low-density development and the city is now nearly built out. Spending on new infrastructure and cheap land keeps greenfield development elsewhere in the area attractive, while in Garland, housing trickles down to low-income populations and tax burdens increase. Regional and state policy favour outward development<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0042098012474698">7</xref></sup> over redevelopment to the detriment of older areas, a typical story of post-war urbanisation. If the built-out suburbs of Dallas want reinvestment, they may find it in obstructing infrastructure expansion into the prairies. If sprawl is the target, sustainability advocates should promote austerity and here the conservative base provides allies.</p>
<p>The theory that suburbanisation has been largely dependent on government subsidy is not the propaganda of liberals or environmentalists. The Government Accountability Office concluded in 1999<disp-quote>
<p>Historically, federal housing and highway programs contributed to suburban growth because the availability of housing loans facilitated suburban homeownership and federal highway spending financed the expansion of highways that gave consumers access to suburban locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098012474698">GAO, 1999</xref>, p. 2).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>That highway spending, the Federal Housing Administration and other measures made suburbia possible in large part makes some conservatives uncomfortable. Advisor to George W. Bush, Karl Zinsmeister remarked that<disp-quote>
<p>The liberal, make-the-world-over mentality that serves us so well in, for instance, the realm of technology can cause great damage if applied without caution in the world of human relationships. When it comes to things like building workable communities, raising children, and defining our obligations to fellow citizens, a lot more humility is called for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0042098012474698">Zinsmeister, 1996</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Investment in decentralisation is not only of questionable social benefit, but fiscally unsustainable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012474698">Anthony Flint (2006</xref>, p. 248) argued that if planning pursues primarily a “fix it first” approach to infrastructure, and seeks as a first course of action the relaxation of land regulation, it has at once accomplished its mission and become conservative.</p>
<p>Those operating in conservative contexts should not only be expressing support for restraint in national, state or regional policy. They should also frame local sustainability initiatives in these terms. Athas explained<disp-quote>
<p>We want development, and we want it to be sustainable. … To me as a conservative, I don’t want the taxpayers to constantly have to fork over subsidies … Supposedly, the Tea Party people and I would be on the same page, we’re trying to protect the taxpayers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Planners and élites in conservative contexts should reduce their attention to the down-the-road costs of sprawl and talk more about the price that is paid up-front by all. As Pamela Blais explained<disp-quote>
<p>The focus of the debate has been on the cost of sprawl rather than on its price—that is, on what sprawl costs rather than on the price we actually pay for it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098012474698">Blais, 2011</xref>, p. 7).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In other words, communities may condemn sprawl when the metaphorical bill is explained. In another point that may appeal to conservatives, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098012474698">Blais (2011</xref>, p. 74) stated that Americans are facing the “double whammy” of paying for sprawl and for the costs of planning that does nothing to reverse it.</p>

<sec id="section9-0042098012474698">
<title>Point 4: Legislators and Planners Can Discuss Business-as-usual as ‘Crony Capitalism’</title>
<p>One McKinney activist stated in a memo “Value decreases when the use of land is determined not by the landowner or the free market, but by government bureaucracy”. When local activists frame sustainability plans as unwelcome intervention, they forget that government has long been involved in development with significant consequences. One area planner, hearing protests of a supposedly newfound regulatory posture, recalled the infamous adage of summer 2009: “Government get your hands off my Medicare”. For market-driven development, we have to look to the decaying mixed-use Main Streets of Texas, its few pre-zoning suburbs, or major downtowns where they are still intact.</p>
<p>However, even this oversight is not so surprising: the deference of the courts to local restriction of development choice in placing the burden of proof on landowners promotes the view that zoning protects private property rather than regulates economic activity and, in turn, the “view that current metropolitan development is governed more or less by the free market” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098012474698">Levine, 2006</xref>, p. 18). It may be useful to planners and élites in conservative contexts therefore to enter Tea Party affiliates’ conversations over ‘cronyism’. Rather than allowing themselves to get into defensive positions over perceived subsidies for bicyclists or green businesses, planners and élites should initiate conversation over current policies that constitute “the right to use public power for essentially unchecked private purposes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098012474698">Levine, 2006</xref>, p. 81) or arterial and utility expansions that constitute government givings to landowners.</p>
<p>Expanding suburbia does not only involve windfalls for some landowners, but peril for others. The means for Texans to continue current rates of water consumption is aggressive use of eminent domain. As of 2007, 381 square miles of land in Texas were ‘under the gun’ for reservoir designation and another similar-sized amount of land for mitigation areas, to the chagrin of rural landowners feeling undercompensated for long-term productivity losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098012474698">Texas Farm Bureau, 2007</xref>). The solution to the expected yearly water deficit of 1.1 million acre-feet per year by 2050—and that is only for the Dallas–Fort Worth area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0042098012474698">Weinstein and Clower, 2004</xref>)—remains unclear. A discussion on resources, transport and land use that frames current policy as the redistribution of private assets by government is one that may cause more conservatives to contribute constructively to discussions on urban development.</p>

<sec id="section10-0042098012474698">
<title>Point 5: Promoting Housing Choice Includes Praising the Single-family Home</title>
<p>Nurturing wider critique of development policy may be easier if it was not for so many Americans, in particular White suburban Americans, having benefited from it. It is undoubtedly important for planners and élites in conservative contexts to separate themselves from NIMBYs patrolling their communities for development impacts. A more complex scenario arises when the property rights activists are the ones patrolling their community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0042098012474698">8</xref></sup> In Texas, Tea Partiers’ anxieties seem oddly aggravated by the pro-development stances of conservative élites and planners.</p>
<p>Why? One Dallas area planner opined that hostility towards freer market performance was based in what that translates into<disp-quote>
<p>The demographic data is [<italic>sic</italic>] very clear about the changing characteristics of American households, and the really pent-up demand for other kinds of housing aside from single-family detached.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Activist Zack Maxwell of Arlington, in an October 2011 presentation to local Tea Party affiliates, defined the ‘American Dream’ as that of a man with a wife and two children, a house (to be seized for the creation of a conservation area), a green lawn (doomed by watering restrictions) and a car (threatened by emissions standards). The meeting’s attendants groaned at images of multifamily construction. Responding to renderings of a densely built-up downtown McKinney, Texas, one activist said: “Having a government-directed community that looks like a tenement will most definitely not inspire any pride”. It seems ironic that a group of self-described libertarians would dismiss the fact that Americans have diverse preferences or needs. This may be a symptom of antipathy towards non-traditional household types less likely to prefer a single-family house: educated urban professionals, co-habiting unmarried childless heterosexual couples, homosexual households, “overly entitled young people” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042098012474698">Skocpol and Williamson, 2012</xref>, p. 72) or other demonstrations of supposed urban decadence not included in their conception of the American ideal.</p>
<p>It is more likely that density is associated with another set of undesirables: the poor, non-White, and assumedly welfare-dependent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0042098012474698">9</xref></sup> Over 400 Arlington residents overwhelmingly White and at least middle-aged, Tea Party affiliates among them, attended a January 2012 Town Hall meeting concerning an overlay district allowing higher density (“new choices” as the planners put it) in North Arlington (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098012474698">Maxwell, 2012</xref>). Many voiced frustration over why more apartments should be built in Arlington, given that perhaps a quarter or half of apartment-dwellers in North Arlington receive assistance. In actuality, 3 per cent of households in the entire city receive housing vouchers, half of them elderly or disabled, and none live in public housing, with the Arlington Housing Authority reporting a “good general disbursement of the assisted households throughout the city of Arlington” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098012474698">Housing Authority of the City of Arlington, 2010</xref>, p. 16). A statement of the facts by a municipal official may have challenged one supposition, but is not likely to have altered the underlying feeling.</p>
<p>It may be easier to suggest that plans are about providing choices and that they can therefore co-exist with conservative values, if they appeared to do so. Garland’s 2012 plan contains strategies for achieving development not resembling what is currently in Garland. Single-family areas will be protected by conventional zoning, but the many renderings of high density mixed-use boulevards may tell a different story to the casual viewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098012474698">City of Garland, 2011</xref>). Participants in outreach emphasised the desire to revitalise existing neighbourhoods, although with limited emphasis on integrating commercial activities and jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098012474698">City of Garland 2008</xref>, pp. 42–43). The adopted plan, however, emphasises existing neighbourhoods’ compatibility with non-residential development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098012474698">City of Garland, 2011</xref>, p. 3-9). There is also a relative dearth of photographs of single-family homes, and one before and after comparison of a retrofitted single-family home from Tachieva’s <italic>Sprawl Repair Manual</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098012474698">City of Garland, 2011</xref>, p. 5-9). While in one instance the plan recognises all neighbourhoods as ‘vital’, in another a “vital neighborhood” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098012474698">City of Garland, 2011</xref>, p. 5-2) is identified as “one that provides a variety of housing types” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098012474698">City of Garland, 2011</xref>, p. 5-6). To the layman, the plan comes across as advocating an unfamiliar landscape and it does not give enough weight to preserving existing conditions in residential neighbourhoods, although workshops identified that as highly desirable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0042098012474698">
<title>Point 6: The Process of Planning Should Be Reconsidered</title>
<p>In north Texas, sustainability (specifically fiscal sustainability) had support from conservative élites. In Garland, the Council had a pre-determined interest in redevelopment as build-out and associated fiscal chaos approached. “Euclidian zoning handcuffs our future”, explained Athas. It may have benefited leaders’ to be open about fiscal problems, as opposed to selling redevelopment on “capturing regional growth”, which may be of questionable necessity, or promoting a “sense of community”, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098012474698">City of Garland, 2008</xref>, p. 9) which, when paired with images of unfamiliar density, can confuse. Visioning may do well everywhere to be more curt about problems, especially the fiscal ones that are important to conservative leaders and voters alike.</p>
<p>To those wary of government, the announcement of the need to address a supposed problem of community character sounds arbitrary and overreaching. Combined with planners’ eagerness to suggest remedies derived from distant examples, some conservatives perceive consensus-building as disregarding genuine local feeling. Freedom Advocates, for example, argue that: “It is very rare for community members to instigate the stakeholder ‘visioning’ process” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098012474698">Freedom Advocates, 2010</xref>, p. 12). This belief, perhaps not invalid, leads these activists to the conclusion that planning is about control and not empowerment.</p>
<p>Flint notes that defenders of conventional development view sustainability advocates as “elitists, driving with their tops down in their Saabs, drinking Chardonnay” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012474698">Flint, 2006</xref>, p. 182). The sense that planners’ priorities are inaccessible is not new (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098012474698">Pressman and Wildavsky, 1984</xref>) and lack of participation is a perennial problem, even in the days of social media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098012474698">Johnson and Graves, 2011</xref>). Garland’s plan featured an unprecedented outreach process, but right-wing disruptions did not arrive until planners released proposals. Indeed, it is not an uncommon phenomenon to see resistance only late in the planning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098012474698">Burby, 2003</xref>, p. 34).</p>
<p>In the context of the conservative backlash against sustainability plans, and in other scenarios, I would argue this is due to aloof and even deceptive language. An invitation to ‘envision’ or just ‘plan’ is less compelling, and more remote, than one to discuss private investments or government fiscal difficulties, which is what sustainability planning is about in north Texas. That invitations to discuss plan-making avoid identifying the reasons for intervention creates a precedent for distrust among some and fails to generate interest among many more. Would notifications to the public reading ‘Come to City Hall to talk about the future of your rights and investments’ solicit more interest than current pleas for ‘community visioning’?</p>
<p>Those who do participate see copious images of landscapes that planners find beautiful and necessary for economic development purposes, but that are also ‘other’ in low-density suburbs. Rosa Koire described visioning meetings as a process of “neutralizing enemies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012474698">Koire, 2011</xref>, p. 23), but in the details she is not inaccurate. If visioning is not dedicated to building a “manufactured consensus” around pre-determined outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012474698">Koire, 2011</xref>, pp. 110 and 127), the ready availability of outside examples and imagery could make it seem that way, and planners do bring their own visions too.</p>
<p>One Tea Party activist responded to calls for enhanced community character asking “Would it not be more appropriate for the first policy statements to be something like ‘the county shall work to protect the private property rights of its citizens’?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098012474698">Lamb, 2010</xref>). Such a blatant repoliticisation of planning is more genuine, could expand interest and lead to more effective outcomes.</p>

<sec id="section12-0042098012474698">
<title>Point 7: Citing Distant Best Practices and Using Jargon Are High-risk Activities</title>
<p>Planners’ engagement of local or ‘ordinary’ knowledge is lacking in plans pursuing sustainability, as has been the case with planning historically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098012474698">Burby, 2003</xref>). A Maryland activist explained<disp-quote>
<p>Sustainability invokes government power to enforce activists’ views of environmentalism. They want to replace farmers’, ranchers’ and other landowners’ concept of stewardship with government-centric control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098012474698">Simpson, 2011</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Shurtleff perceived an invasion of unelected technocrats citing global data and disrupting individuals’ ability to manage their businesses. Shurtleff opined that solutions should be locally motivated and not ‘internationally motivated’. One interviewee related that the fact that one Dallas suburb’s proposed storm water management system had also been pursued in Kenya set off accusations of global conspiracy in that city, even as the accusers agreed that something needed to be done about storm water. In McKinney, attendants at a September 2012 meeting expressed confusion as to how an out-of-town consultant engaged to aid in plan-making could be sensitive to the local context, while the presenting councilman Ray Ricchi called the outside planners’ approach generic.</p>
<p>Planners may prefer to think of opponents of Agenda 21 or all conservatives, as simply obstructionist, but this ignores testimony that they are “not against making certain issues a priority, such as mindful energy use, alternative energy sponsorship, recycling/reuse, and sensitivity to all living creatures”, if on different terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012474698">Koire, 2011</xref>, p. 12).<disp-quote>
<p>How can you be against clean air, public transportation, affordable housing and protecting the beauty of the natural environment? The idea is OK but the execution—BY DESIGN—is disastrous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012474698">Koire, 2011</xref>, pp. 137–138).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One Dallas-area planner’s quandary seems commonplace<disp-quote>
<p>It was interesting … because we talked to them about things they wanted to see … safer crossings for pedestrians, slower traffic. But the solution to get there, they didn’t like.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Athas reflected<disp-quote>
<p>We had one spokesperson for the local Tea Party come and talk to the Council and she said she was for sustainable, and for development, but against sustainable development.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In conservative contexts, what may serve élites and planners is new semantics—if fiscal sustainability also has environmental benefits, it may be best to emphasise the former. Certainly, jargon is of little use. The comments delivered at Garland’s April 2011 hearing on its draft comprehensive plan repeatedly demonstrated anxiety over jargon, including context-sensitive solutions, compact neighbourhoods, sustainability, mixed use, retail pruning and complete streets.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0042098012474698">10</xref></sup> Athas explained<disp-quote>
<p>The misunderstandings … showed that the document did not convey in concise terms why we were doing a new Comprehensive plan. People could read that document and understand that we were trying to put a new layer of regulation on top of an old layer. But it’s trying to replace the previous layer to make it more workable.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, the discussion should be local. Focusing interventions on local drought, flooding, energy costs, agricultural pests, smog or whatever other direct threat, and independently of any globalised rhetoric “may make more of a contribution to reducing climate change than a Congressional decree” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042098012474698">Wheeler, 2012</xref>, p. A14) or comprehensive sustainability planning for that matter. In the conclusion of Steven Moore, environmental preservation in Austin, although not an adequate challenge to dominant narratives of property use, is nevertheless as successful as it is because it is a product of “progressive populism that rejects domination by expert culture” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098012474698">Moore, 2007</xref>, p. 67).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0042098012474698">
<title>Point 8: Redevelopment Will Never Be Attractive to Everyone</title>
<p>Planners market sustainability across the country with photographs of pedestrian-filled streets and other atypical sights. Developers and elected officials also find these images attractive. Others may see attractive places in these images, but do not, correctly, see their lives as part of them. The redevelopment desired in the inner suburbs of Dallas will not have small, local property owners at the helm, and the final product is likely to exclude them via higher rents.</p>
<p>As a result, some downtown property owners see renderings of redevelopment schemes and ask: “Gee, what happened to the buildings that were there before? Who owns that land now?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012474698">Koire, 2011</xref>, p. 101). As with previous generations fighting the federal bulldozer, sustainability’s opponents in Texas and elsewhere include business or property owners in underperforming areas who consider that the blight findings used to pursue redevelopment are arbitrary, favour developers’ profit and harm the less financially equipped.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0042098012474698">11</xref></sup> They resent images of polished streetscapes photo-shopped onto their property that they cannot themselves achieve.</p>
<p>Koire paraphrased a hypothetical sustainability plan<disp-quote>
<p>Demolish the old mom and pop … rebuild to the new model with a Quiznos, Jamba Juice, Starbucks, Panda Express, Kinko’s and Payless Shoes with two or three stories of apartments above! Rents will go up! (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012474698">Koire, 2011</xref>, p. 49).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sustainability, according to Koire, is a corporate agenda. Blight may exist but its removal comes with some cost, as has long been known by critics pointing out the dearth of displaced businesses re-opening in post-redevelopment renewal areas. What faith these activists had in the courts to hold bureaucrats to certain standards was disrupted by <italic>Kelo v. New London</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042098012474698">Supreme Court of the United States, 2005</xref>). While post-<italic>Kelo</italic> legislation has limited eminent domain in many states, including Texas, what may be more encouraging is a primary focus on ground-up solutions such as business improvement districts, an effective strategy of no public cost which was only mentioned in regard to one of Garland’s existing business districts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098012474698">City of Garland, 2011</xref>, p. 4-21).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Can planners and local élites undertake sustainability planning in conservative contexts, even in the face of zealous and seemingly irrational opposition? The topics for conversation presented here do not represent an effort to coerce those unfavourable towards sustainability into passivity; nor do they represent a plea to planners to surrender their goals or favour a particular group. Genuine planning solutions exist here for achieving sustainability in conservative contexts and beyond for two reasons. First, because both élites and planners need to reframe their dialogue for the purpose of expanding public interest and buy-in and, secondly, because solutions to unsustainable practices may exist in incorporating a conservative approach to property rights and infrastructure—namely, in removing carrots rather than instituting sticks. Government intervention is after all at the core of the unsustainable spread of American cities. The conviction that conventional development is market-driven and that denser, sustainable development is a product of government intervention is understandable when we consider that planners often rectify planning’s past mistakes with more planning—and planning at that not grounded in local knowledge. More planning may not always be enough to rile fringe elements and imperil otherwise broadly popular efforts, but it also may not always be the best solution. Going forward, there already seems to be a significant body of anthropological research investigating how local knowledge and concerns may be harnessed to confront global problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042098012474698">Wheeler, 2012</xref>) and planning scholars can contribute with analysis of successful case studies.</p>
<p>Athas concluded<disp-quote>
<p>We’re at a huge turning point … and I can’t help but think that the Tea Party is the one that should be out there cheering the progress instead of working against it.</p>

<p>If there were a key to engaging them in a way that got past their dismissiveness of this panoply of issues that they regard as élites trying to shove their fancy ideas down their throats … a great deal of progress would have been made already with the Tea Party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042098012474698">Stephens, 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>Finding conversation on sustainability, if we can use the term, in conservative contexts may do more than get past dismissiveness: it is likely to achieve important aims including invigorating a broader public and finding alternative solutions.</p>
