<abstract>
<p>A major strength of the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) is its systematic assessment of response styles, including feigned mental disorders. Recently, Mogge, Lepage, Bell, and Ragatz developed and provided the initial validation for the Negative Distortion Scale (NDS). Using rare symptoms as its detection strategy for feigning, the usefulness of NDS was examined via a known-groups comparison. The current study sought to cross-validate the NDS by implementing a between-subjects simulation design. Simulators were asked to feign total disability in an effort to secure unwarranted compensation from their insurance company. Even in an inpatient sample with severe Axis I disorders and concomitant impairment, the NDS proved effective as a rare-symptom strategy with low levels of item endorsement that remained mostly stable across genders. For construct validity, the NDS was moderately correlated with the Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms–Second Edition and other PAI feigning scales. For discriminant validity, it yielded a very large effect size (<italic>d</italic> = 1.81), surpassing the standard PAI feigning indicators. Utility estimates appeared to be promising for both ruling-out (low probability of feigning) and ruling-in (high probability of feigning) determinations at different base rates. Like earlier research, the data supported the creation of well-defined groups with indeterminate scores (i.e., the cut score ± 1 <italic>SEM</italic>) removed to avoid high rates of misclassifications for this narrow band.</p>

<body>
<p>The Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191112451493">Morey, 2007</xref>) is extensively used to assess clinical syndromes, interpersonal issues, and treatment-relevant considerations. In addition, the PAI is designed to assess different response styles, comprised chiefly of inconsistent, defensive, and feigned responding. For feigned mental disorders, its detection strategies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073191112451493">Rogers &amp; Gillard, 2011</xref>) assess either rare symptoms (Negative Impression or NIM) or spurious patterns of psychopathology via two indicators: Malingering Index (MAL) and Rogers Discriminant Function (RDF).</p>
<p>In a recent meta-analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073191112451493">Hawes and Boccaccini (2009)</xref> reviewed 24 PAI studies of feigned mental disorders. They found much larger effect sizes for simulation designs than known-group comparisons; this disparity was most salient with the RDF (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>s of 1.69 vs. 0.31). They recommended the use of NIM and MAL with overall correct classifications (OCCs) ranging from .62 to .75. In their scholarly review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073191112451493">Sellbom and Bagby (2008)</xref> noted that the NIM and MAL were mostly effective at ruling-out feigned disorders than in their accurate classification. In a very recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073191112451493">Rogers, Gillard, Wooley, and Ross (2011)</xref> evaluated the feigning of disabilities using a within-subjects design on patients with extensive trauma histories; very high specificities (&gt;.95) were achievable on NIM, MAL, and RDF at the expense of sensitivities. Importantly, many classification errors for specific cut scores occurred in a narrow indeterminate range operationally defined as ±5 T points.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191112451493">Mogge, Lepage, Bell, and Ragatz (2010)</xref> created the Negative Distortion Scale (NDS) based on “eight of the clinical scales that most directly assess psychopathology” (p. 81). After removing inconsistent profiles, the PAIs from two inpatient groups (<italic>n</italic>s of 194 and 166) from a state hospital were examined for items with very low endorsement. Fifteen items with averages in the lowest 10% across the two inpatient groups were selected for the NDS. For construct validity with PAI feigning indicators, the NDS evidenced moderately high correlations with NIM (.75) and MAL (.64) but only modest correlation with the RDF (.39). Although negative correlations were expected with the PAI defensive indicators, the results were mixed: Positive Impression (PIM = −.57), Defensive Index (DEF = −.37), and Cashel Discriminant Function (CDF = .34). A second study was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191112451493">Mogge et al. (2010)</xref> on mostly male (89.0%) inpatients who were referred “due to treatment team concerns of potential malingering or due to suspicions of purposeful distortions raised by the results of the PAI” (p. 83). Using the original Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms (SIRS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1073191112451493">Rogers, Bagby, &amp; Dickens, 1992</xref>) in a known-groups comparison, 56 were categorized in the probable malingering group and 35 as genuine responders. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191112451493">Mogge et al. (2010)</xref> recommended a NDS cut score of ≥13 for likely feigning; it yielded a sensitivity of .82 and specificity of .71.</p>
<p>We were unable to find any additional studies of the NDS in PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and online advanced publications for leading assessment journals. Therefore, we sought to cross-validate the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191112451493">Mogge et al. (2010)</xref> results using further data analysis from a previous PAI investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073191112451493">Rogers, Gillard, et al., 2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1073191112451493">1</xref></sup> Our goals are threefold. First, we examine whether NDS items function as a rare-symptom strategy when tested on male and female patients with severe Axis I disorders. Second, we evaluate its construct validity in light of standard PAI validity indicators and the SIRS–Second Edition (SIRS-2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191112451493">Rogers, Sewell, &amp; Gillard, 2010</xref>). Third, we examined the effectiveness of NDS cut scores as a single point and with well-defined groups, removing too-close-to-call cases (i.e., ±1 <italic>SEM</italic> as the indeterminate category).</p>
<sec id="section1-1073191112451493" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The current investigation uses data from programmatic research on the PAI, SIRS-2, and two related measures under development (the SIRS Trauma and Disability Screen [SIRS-TDS] and the SIRS Trauma and Disability Interview [SIRS-TDI]). Although PAI data were used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073191112451493">Rogers, Gillard, et al. (2011)</xref>, the current analyses of the NDS scale—including its convergent validity with the SIRS-2—are completely original. The following section provides a concise summary of the materials and procedures. An in-depth description of the methods can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073191112451493">Rogers, Gillard, et al. (2011)</xref>.</p>
<sec id="section2-1073191112451493">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The initial sample consisted of 114 inpatients from Timberlawn Mental Health Systems, an inpatient psychiatric hospital. The participants were recruited from the Trauma Unit, which focuses on a multimodal treatment program (medications plus extensive group and individual therapy) for inpatients with extensive trauma histories.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1073191112451493">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The current investigation focuses primarily on the PAI and the SIRS-2. It also uses (a) the Miller Forensic Assessment of Symptoms Test (M-FAST; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073191112451493">Miller, 2001</xref>) to screen for patients who may be feigning and (b) the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1073191112451493">Sheehan, Janavs, Harnett-Sheehan, Sheehan, &amp; Gray, 2009</xref>) to describe provisional diagnoses. Other administered measures were not included in this investigation: the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) module of the Structured Clinical Interview for <italic>DSM-IV</italic> disorders (SCID-I; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1073191112451493">First, Spitzer, Gibbon, &amp; Williams, 1997</xref>), the Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule self-report version (DDIS-SRV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073191112451493">Riggs et al., 2007</xref>), Structured Inventory of Malingered Symptomatology (SIMS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1073191112451493">Widows &amp; Smith, 2005</xref>), and two measures under development (SIRS-TDI and SIRS-TDS).</p>

<title>Personality Assessment Inventory</title>
<p>The Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191112451493">Morey, 2007</xref>) is a multiscale inventory designed to measure patterns of psychopathology, interpersonal styles, and treatment-relevant issues. As documented in the introduction, its validity scales have been extensively researched with respect to feigned mental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073191112451493">Hawes &amp; Boccaccini, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073191112451493">Sellbom &amp; Bagby, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>The SIRS-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191112451493">Rogers et al., 2010</xref>) used more than 2,300 SIRS protocols in its general validation. An important focus was the new SIRS-2 classification rules with several new scales and indexes. The SIRS-2 evidences excellent reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191112451493">Rogers et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>The M-FAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073191112451493">Miller, 2001</xref>) is a 25-item screen for feigned mental disorders. The cut score recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073191112451493">Miller (2001</xref>; ≥6) was used to exclude any cases of possible feigning from the current investigation.</p>

<title>Design and Instructions</title>
<p>The study uses a between-subjects simulation design with inpatients randomly assigned to experimental (feigning instructions) or control (genuine instructions) conditions. To address issues of internal validity, participants were screened for possible feigning and a manipulation check addressed their knowledge of and adherence to the instructions. To further involve participants, the study also employed a realistic scenario and provided incentives that are recommended for simulation research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073191112451493">Rogers &amp; Gillard, 2011</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section9-1073191112451493">
<title>Feigning instructions</title>
<p>The feigning instructions asked inpatients to convincingly portray a total disability arising from their psychiatric condition that prevents them from full-time employment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1073191112451493">2</xref></sup> For successful feigning, both intrinsic (i.e., outsmarting the test) and extrinsic (i.e., $10.00 incentive and the reduction of fraudulent claims on the health care system) motivations were stressed. Finally, they were cautioned about the presence of feigning indicators.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1073191112451493">
<title>Genuine instructions</title>
<p>The genuine instructions stressed the importance of being open and honest about their current symptoms and psychological problems. They were provided with a $10.00 incentive for their adherence to the genuine condition. To increase motivation, the importance of this research (i.e., increasing access to services for genuine claims and reduction of costs due to fraudulent claims) was emphasized.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1073191112451493">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The study received ethical approval from the University of North Texas Institutional Review Board and administrative approval from Timberlawn Mental Health Systems. Potential participants were recruited via announcements at the beginning of morning group sessions. On an individual basis, they were screened for difficulties in communication and availability (i.e., conflicting appointments or being discharged that day). They were provided with written consent forms that were also reviewed orally. Those individuals providing informed consent were invited to participate in the study.</p>
<p>The research was organized into two sessions, with Session 1 being used to collect general information under standard (genuine) instructions. Participants were administered the MINI and SCID-I PTSD for clinical information and the M-FAST to rule out possible feigning (for further details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073191112451493">Rogers, Gillard, et al., 2011</xref>). At the end of Session 1, they were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control condition. To ensure adequate comprehension, each participant read the instructions aloud and was provided with an opportunity to have their questions addressed. For Session 2, another researcher—masked to results of Session 1 and the assigned condition—administered the following measures: SIMS, SIRS-2, SIRS-TDS and SIRS-TDI, and PAI. A manipulation check was administered to assess whether participants could recall their instructions and gave adequate effort in adhering to them. Following Session 2, the DDIS-SRV was the administered under honest instructions to all participants. It was placed at the end because of its detailed questions about participants’ traumas, which might produce emotions affecting their responses to other measures. The final step of the study included debriefing and compensating participants $10.00 for their “successful” involvement. To avoid any ethical issues (e.g., more impaired participants being less able to successfully feign), all participants were given the monetary compensation.</p>

<sec id="section12-1073191112451493" sec-type="results|discussion">
<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>The final sample was composed of 93 participants with comparable numbers in the feigning (<italic>n</italic> = 47) and genuine conditions (<italic>n</italic> = 48). Eleven participants were excluded because of (a) an inability to communicate that would affect informed consent and (b) conflicting appointments that would significantly disrupt the testing session. The final sample, with an average age of 41.75 (<italic>SD</italic> = 11.52) years, was predominantly female (73 or 76.8%) and European American (79 or 83.2%). A majority had educational attainment at or above the high school graduate level (83 or 88.3%). Most (87.4%) participants met diagnostic criteria for PTSD, with a high rate of comorbidity with major depression (57.9%) and dissociative symptoms (38.9%). As an indicator of their level of impairment, close to two thirds of participants were receiving disability benefits, while an additional 15% were unemployed without compensation.</p>
<p>The NDS scale was developed apparently without a systematic examination of potential gender disparities. To address this issue, the NDS individual items were systematically compared by gender (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1073191112451493">Table 1</xref>). Most items (13 of 15 or 86.7%) were generally comparable; the two exceptions (#130 and #303) were significantly higher in male than female patients, although the mean scores were still generally low (<italic>M</italic>s &lt; 1.10). In aggregate, the total NDS score is higher for male than female inpatients, but this comparison is not statistically different and represents only a modest effect size (<italic>M d</italic> = .28).</p>

<p>In keeping with the rare symptom strategy, individual items on the NDS scale should be endorsed very infrequently by patients with Axis I disorders responding genuinely. As summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1073191112451493">Table 1</xref>, NDS items average close to the ideal range between 0 (<italic>not true at all</italic>) and 1 (<italic>slightly true</italic>). Overall, the averages are below “slightly true” with 0.91 for male patients and 0.71 for female patients. Only two items (#212 for men and #315 for women) have averages exceeding 1.50, which places them closer to 2 (<italic>mainly true</italic>) than 1 (<italic>slightly true</italic>). For a severely impaired inpatient sample with an average of 4.45 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.53) PAI clinical elevations, these data provide strong evidence that NDS effectively uses a rare symptom strategy.</p>
<p>For construct validity (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1073191112451493">Table 2</xref>), NDS under the feigning condition evidenced a moderately high correlation with NIM (.70), which also uses a rare symptom strategy, and moderate associations with both MAL (.57) and RDF (.51). For inpatients responding genuinely, the correlations were much lower than found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191112451493">Mogge et al. (2010)</xref> but still in the expected direction. Although negative correlations were expected with the NDS and PAI indicators of defensiveness, only NDS and PIM yielded a significant negative correlation (−.41). Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191112451493">Mogge et al. (2010)</xref>, the CDF was positively related to the NDS. To put this finding in perspective, the CDF has sometimes been elevated for feigners in past research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191112451493">Morey, 2007</xref>). In summary, the data provide a generally positive picture of the NDS construct validity with substantially higher convergent than divergent correlations.</p>

<p>For a further examination of construct validity, we examined the NDS in relationship to the SIRS-2 scales among simulated feigners. In general, the NDS evidenced moderate correlations (<italic>M r</italic> = .43, <italic>SD</italic> = .09). Contrary to expectations, its correlation with the corresponding SIRS-2 scale was only in the moderate range (Rare Symptoms [RS] <italic>r</italic> = .41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Like RS, Symptom Combinations (SC) uses unlikely presentations, and it produced the highest correlation (<italic>r</italic> = .62, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Three other SIRS-2 scales produced moderate correlations: Blatant Symptoms (BL; <italic>r</italic> = .48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), Reported versus Observed Symptoms (RO; <italic>r</italic> = .48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and Selectivity of Symptoms (SEL; <italic>r</italic> = .47, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In summary, these correlations with the SIRS-2 provide general evidence of convergent validity but not specific support for the rare symptom strategy across measures.</p>
<p>For clinical and forensic practice, the most crucial issue involves discriminant validity. In examining effect sizes (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>s) and utility estimates, the usefulness of the NDS can be directly compared to other PAI feigning indicators. As summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1073191112451493">Table 3</xref>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1073191112451493">3</xref></sup> the NDS demonstrated a much higher effect size (<italic>d</italic> = 1.81) than the other indicators (<italic>d</italic>s of 1.24, 1.26, and 1.41). A comparison of effect sizes with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191112451493">Mogge et al. (2010)</xref> is not possible because these investigators did not report effect sizes or descriptive data for suspected malingerers to use in generating them.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191112451493">Rogers and Bender (in press)</xref> discussed a fundamental misassumption in the assessment of malingering, specifically the <italic>laser accuracy of cut scores</italic> with single point differences being used to classify completely different response styles. To address this issue, we examined the accuracy of cut scores by creating an indeterminate category. The <italic>SEM</italic> for NDS was calculated based on the total sample (genuine plus simulators) with an α of .85 and <italic>SD</italic> of 10.44. It yielded an <italic>SEM</italic> of 3.92. Using ±1 <italic>SEM</italic> as the criterion for “too close to call” cases, NDS scores within four points of each cut score were excluded. The remaining scores (i.e., those outside the indeterminate range) represent a “well-defined” group that minimize measurement error.</p>
<p>NDS cut scores can be used to rule-out (i.e., a high likelihood that the PAI is <italic>not</italic> feigned) and rule-in (i.e., a high likelihood that the PAI is feigned). For rule-out cut scores, high levels of sensitivity and negative predictive power (NPP) are required. With the indeterminate category excluded, NDS ≥ 15 produced an OCC of .90 with outstanding NPPs of .99 at 15% base rate and .98 at 25% base rate. In other words, very few feigners are likely to have NDS scores below 11 (i.e., cut score of 15 − 1 <italic>SEM</italic>). The current utility estimates using a simulation design appear to be generally higher than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191112451493">Mogge et al. (2010)</xref> using a known-groups comparison with the original SIRS as the criterion. Notably, the Mogge et al. study had two methodological issues<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1073191112451493">5</xref></sup> that potentially affected its utility estimates. First, it did not remove indeterminate cases from its external criterion (e.g., ≤4 SIRS primary scales in the honest range; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1073191112451493">Rogers et al., 1992</xref>, p. 24, Table 18). Second, it used single NDS cut scores without removing indeterminate cases. In light of Mogge and the current investigation, further research is needed to firmly establish the effectiveness of NDS cut scores across these research designs.</p>
<p>NDS cut scores can also be used to estimate the likelihood of feigning, when scores are markedly elevated. With the indeterminate category removed, an NDS ≥ 27 yielded perfect specificity in the current study. In other words, any scores at or exceeding 31 (i.e., 27 + 1 <italic>SEM</italic>) appear to have a very high probability of feigning. We suspect that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191112451493">Mogge et al. (2010)</xref> would also have a very high, if not perfect, specificity; its comparatively low NDS ≥ 18 yielded a high specificity of .91. As an improvement of standard PAI measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073191112451493">Rogers, Gillard, et al., 2011</xref>), the NDS ≥ 27 produces a PPP of 1.00 irrespective of the base rate, whereas the NPP ranges from .91 (15%) to .84 (25%) and .64 (50%).</p>
<p>Many practitioners are accustomed to using single cut scores without considering misclassifications for the too-close-to-call cases (i.e., the indeterminate category). Therefore, we examined the classification errors by calculating the false-positive and false-negative percentages for the indeterminate category (±1 <italic>SEM</italic>) at each of the cut scores reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1073191112451493">Table 4</xref>. As summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1073191112451493">Table 5</xref>, both false positives and false negatives varied widely. However, the overall error rate of 35.9% is much larger than the 20.0% found when well-defined groups are used.</p>

<p><italic>Note</italic>. NDS = Negative Distortion Scale.</p>

<fn id="table-fn6-1073191112451493">

<p>Scores in this range are excluded as too close to categorize.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Scores very close to the cut score are also vulnerable to measurement errors in addition to classification errors. Take, for example, the NDS cut score ≥15; the likelihood that the <italic>true score</italic> is below 15 can be calculated for close scores such as 16, 17, and 18. With an <italic>SEM</italic> of 3.92, estimates of classification errors (i.e., true scores below 15) would be 30.9%, 22.1%, and 15.4%, respectively. When such measurement errors are added to classification errors, the percentages easily exceed 50%. While the NDS error rates are better than those found with NIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073191112451493">Rogers, Gillard, et al., 2011</xref>), many practitioners would likely concur that estimates with worse-than-chance accuracy should be avoided. Therefore, the exclusion of an indeterminate category would appear to be prudent clinical practice for the NDS as well as other PAI feigning indicators.</p>
<p>In closing, we provide several comments on limitations and future directions. By using inpatients, many of whom are receiving disability benefits, the current investigation is a rigorous test of a simulation design in a severely impaired population. Nonetheless, patients without established disabilities could provide a very different perspective. As an important distinction, some of these patients may be novices to the disability systems (e.g., private insurance and social security disability), whereas others may have failed to qualify for disabilities. As recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191112451493">Rogers (2008)</xref>, the implement of known-groups comparisons with its emphasis on external validity would nicely complement NDS simulation studies with their focus on internal validity. More immediately, however, we encourage other PAI researchers to reexamine their feigning data to further test the NDS’ effectiveness across a range of clinical populations. We can easily envision a dozen or more empirical investigations rigorously assessing NDS cut scores with both single-point discriminations and well-defined groups that remove “too-close-to-call” cases.</p>

<p>We were unaware of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191112451493">Mogge et al.

Given the length and complexity of our 2011 article, Michael Bagby—Editor of <italic>Assessment</italic>—recommended that an investigation of the NDS scale be submitted to <italic>Assessment</italic> as a separate research report.</p>

<p>For inpatients on disability, the instructions were modified slightly; they were asked to assume that the insurance company had rejected their claim because they were not sufficiently impaired.</p>

<p>Estimated true scores are often reported when <italic>SEM</italic> is addressed rather than observed scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073191112451493">Glutting, McDermott, &amp; Stanley, 1987</xref>). We chose to report observed scores because they are used in both practitioner-based and automated PAI interpretations.</p>

<p>Higher base rates have been reported for feigned <italic>cognitive</italic> impairment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073191112451493">Mittenberg, Patton, Canyock, &amp; Condit, 2002</xref>), but these estimates used broadened category that includes “symptom exaggeration” (p. 1095). Other empirical studies of feigned cognitive impairment with high base rates often employ fatally flawed research designs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073191112451493">Rogers, Bender, &amp; Johnson, 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>Additionally, their Study 2 used possibly feigned PAI results as part of the inclusion criteria, which may limit the generalizability of their results.</p>
