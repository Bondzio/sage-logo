<p>Whilst the reorganisation of the College is undoubtedly at the forefront of many people’s minds, particularly as they have recently voted one way or another for changes, the importance of these changes trickling down through the structures of the College is paramount. We are an organisation that relies in largest measure upon the voluntary contributions of Fellows, and indeed even a cursory glance at the multitude of committees that underpin the successes of both the Board of Education and the Board of Practice and Partnerships is impressive. Unfortunately, committees can tend to proliferate, and one of the challenges of the reorganisation of the College is to not only simplify the structure from the top down but also to make sure that a bottom-up perspective on the structures and functioning of the various committees makes sense and flows relatively seamlessly.</p>
<p>The work of the College is undertaken by a host of volunteers, and within the structures of the Board of Education there are well over 300 Fellows who give of their time and effort in what is undoubtedly one of the most important functions of our organisation. It is important that these efforts not be lost because of inefficiencies and the reorganisation of General Council certainly is not the beginning and the end of this process. Whilst we have spent hours debating whether or not to directly elect a President and to directly elect the Board and what should be the composition of that Board, it is how this is put into practice and the way in which this appears to the general membership that will be fundamentally important.</p>
<p>Creating an organisation where the figureheads are seen as more responsive to the wishes of the membership is all well and good, but if these changes do not translate robustly through the organisation, then in my view the chance for fundamental change will be lost. Given all of the effort that has been contributed over the last two or three years, that would be a great pity.</p>
<p>In addition to the overarching governance changes, the College has also been involved in reorganising its education and training. These changes are complex, and for many have produced a degree of significant anxiety about the future of training and the ‘system’s’ ability to match up to expectations. The role of private practitioners in this has also come under some scrutiny and it would be a pity, to say the least, if all facets of the psychiatric workforce were not reflected in the education and training within the College.</p>
<p>It is important in my view that the changes in General Council and the direct election of the President and the Board of Directors be seen as but one element of the evolution of the College structure. We need to examine the complex committee structures that have evolved and which occupy so much of the Fellows’ efforts. Are these the best structures for the future? Do they take account of the sometimes onerous demands placed on people? Do we have clear guidelines, roles and expectations of those who put their name forward to serve on these various bodies? It behoves us as an organisation to make sure that Fellows’ contributions are not only relevant but that they are seen as valuable. If our Fellows feel that their contributions are lost in a myriad of red tape then we risk a degree of disillusionment which, after the substantial consultation about changes in the organisation, would be a tragedy.</p>
