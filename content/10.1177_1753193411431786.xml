<p>The publication schedule for the <italic>Journal of Infection Prevention</italic> means that I am writing this editorial while at the Mi2011 Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Convention in Adelaide, Australia. The theme of the Convention is Mission Impossible and brings together healthcare practitioners and scientists who share a mission (should they choose to accept it) of synthesising, translating and using evidence in practice. The evidence-based healthcare movement has gathered huge momentum since Sir Ian Chalmers founded the Cochrane Collaboration (CC) in 1993. The Joanna Briggs Institute, founded three years later by Professor Alan Pearson, focuses on evidence for nursing and midwifery practice and has a broader remit, seeking to improve global health through a network of JBI Collaborating Centres that focus on evidence synthesis, transfer, utilisation, and implementation science.</p>
<p>The Cochrane methodology for undertaking Systematic Reviews of Effectiveness (SR) is honed and polished, with well documented and transparent strategies for developing review questions, searching for evidence, assessing the quality of randomised controlled trials and synthesising results. While rigorous, some CC reviews are a methodologist’s dream and a practitioner’s nightmare. The whole purpose of SR is to provide practitioners, managers and policy makers with a transparent synthesis of research in a particular field of health care that can be used to guide practice and assist in the development of national guidelines. However, the language and format of CC reviews is often ‘dense’ and complex and may have evolved to the point that it limits practitioner uptake.</p>
<p>The JBI Comprehensive Systematic Review methodology allows other research designs to be included in reviews, in particular qualitative designs, which provide greater context to healthcare practice and treatment issues. In addition, the commitment to develop tools and approaches to translate evidence into practice, promote knowledge exchange and audit clinical activity and care, fill an important gap in the use of research in practice. This is what Professor Alan Pearson, the Executive Director of JBI describes as the ‘third gap’ in translational research (Pearson, 2001). The first gap exists between bench science and clinical application, the second between clinical application and therapeutic effectiveness and the third between clinical effectiveness and implementation.</p>
<p>It seems to me that it is this third gap that creates the most difficulty for us all. Implementation science is a relatively young discipline in health care, having emerged from the quality and safety agenda and gained momentum over the past decade. The work undertaken at the Institute of Healthcare Improvement in the USA and the Institute for Innovation and Improvement in the UK has been at the forefront of tailoring and using improvement methodologies that are largely derived from management literature and quality improvement frameworks used in industry. These tools include the ubiquitous Plan Do Study Act cycle for rapid improvement, Lean (with or without Six Sigma) and identifying the determinants of error through root cause analysis to name just a few. However our understanding of how these different approaches contribute to the whole, why they are successful in some circumstances and not in others and what is crucial to sustainability, is generally poorly studied and reported.</p>
<p>During the Mi2011 JBI Convention I have been struck by a recurring need for those practitioners who are filling the third gap to be systematic, meticulous and detailed in both their approach and recording of what they do, how they measure it, what happens and how it improves patient care, outcomes and experience. The methodologists in the audience yearn for neat, tidy designs that demonstrate effectiveness of implementation methods, but I am not convinced that this is a realistic or achievable goal in the complex and chaotic environment of healthcare delivery. Detailed recording of what works, for whom and in what circumstances is essential, however, if implementation science is to be synthesised and lessons learned.</p>
<p>In the publication guidelines for improvement and safety studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411431786">Davidoff et al, 2008</xref>) the authors acknowledge this conundrum.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘Unlike the “conceptually neat and procedurally unambiguous” interventions – drugs, tests and procedures – whose efficacy is traditionally studied in clinical research, improvement is essentially a social process. Its immediate purpose is to change human performance and is driven primarily by experiential learning. It is therefore inherently context dependent and, as noted, reflexive; it is unstable; and it generally involves complex, multi-component interventions. Although traditional experimental and quasi-experimental methods are clearly important for learning whether improvement interventions change behaviour, they do not address the crucial pragmatic (or “realist”) questions about improvement: what is it about the mechanism of a particular intervention that works, for whom and under what circumstances?’</italic></p>

<p>As infection prevention and control practitioners (IPCP) we need to be able to synthesise, transfer and use research in our everyday practice. The outcome competences for practitioners in infection prevention and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411431786">Burnett, 2011</xref>) include six competency statements across the four domains that relate to the evidence based health care (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193411431786">Box 1</xref>).</p>

<p>As you might expect as the Editor of <italic>JIP</italic> I want to focus on competency 13! Infection Prevention 2011 had a record number of abstract submissions for oral paper and poster presentations, almost double the number submitted in 2010. The majority of these submissions focused on service innovation and improvement and demonstrated the knowledge and skills of individuals and teams involved. However, presenting at conference reaches only a small number of colleagues. Disseminating your work in a systematic and detailed way through publication adds to the body of knowledge that underpins infection prevention and control practice and contributes to the cumulative evidence of what works, for whom, in what circumstances.</p>
<p>This takes a little bit of vision when the implementation process starts, and it requires a commitment to observe, measure, document and reflect on the complex contextual conditions that exist at an organisational, team and individual level. Implementation is only ‘Mission Impossible’ if we work like secret agents, undercover and in the shadows; it becomes ‘Mission Possible’ when we disseminate our successes and our learning to a wider audience. The editorial board look forward to receiving your ‘Mission Achieved’ reports in 2012.</p>
