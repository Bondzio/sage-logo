<p>Mark Wolery has probably done more than anyone else to remind the field that teaching children is the most important thing we do in classrooms and that we have research on what good instruction looks like. He certainly has been the most influential person on my understanding of teaching practices with young children. Despite the many things we agree on, such as the dearth of actual teaching, I have a different take on the new (although it began “a couple decades ago”) sweater that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1096250613492115">Wolery (2012</xref>, p. 41), in his Voices From the Field article, bemoans as the replacement of “purposeful direct instruction sessions.” That new sweater is naturalistic approaches.</p>
<p>A naturalistic approach to teaching is one where the instruction occurs in the context (time, place, people, materials) of the child’s engagement (i.e., what the child is doing or appears interested in). The antonym in Wolery’s article is “purposeful direct instruction sessions.” This implies that naturalistic approaches are not purposeful, that they are somehow indirect (perhaps in large groups), and that they don’t occur in sessions. It also implies that purposeful direct-instruction sessions are done one on one or in small groups, at scheduled occasions.</p>
<p>The heart of the issue appears to be the dosage of instruction children receive. Wolery calls the failure of adults to “take advantage of teachable moments at sufficient frequency” (p. 43) an underlying flaw of naturalistic approaches. This raises questions about how much teaching a child needs to acquire different skills and what kind of distribution of teaching moments (i.e., trials) works best for those skills at different ages of the child. We simply don’t know this, but it’s fair to accept the opinion of experts like Wolery. I happen to agree that the rate of teaching in many environments is too low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1096250613492115">Casey &amp; McWilliam, 2008</xref>). I’m just not convinced that you can run a fun, effective classroom by rotating children through purposeful direct-instruction sessions that results in more frequent instruction. All day long, you would need to have every child in a small group, getting this kind of instruction. What if the child isn’t interested in whatever the adult has planned for that group time? What if one child consumes much adult attention because of positioning problems, behavior problems, or excessive chattiness? What about the other children in the small group?</p>

<p>“The problem is not necessarily the naturalistic approach, therefore, but the functionality of goals being written for IEPs.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The question about the child’s interest leads to the other issue about purposeful direct-instruction sessions as an alternative to naturalistic approaches: the functionality or meaningfulness of the target behavior. In good as opposed to bad naturalistic approaches, most target behaviors will be related to the child’s engagement, which means the teacher is prompting the child to be engaged in behavior related to but more sophisticated than the original behavior. Adults need to organize the classroom environment (a) to promote the kinds of skills they want to teach and (b) to be interesting to children. Wolery states that the embedding studies rarely show enough trials on children’s Individualized Education Program (IEP) skills, but the dosage issue isn’t all that should be assessed. It seems to me that the functionality of IEP skills (i.e., target behaviors) is critical to the frequency of intervention: The more functional the skill, the more teaching occurs, at least in naturalistic approaches. The problem is not necessarily the naturalistic approach, therefore, but the functionality of goals being written for IEPs.</p>
<p>Instruction requiring a particular, adult-directed setting event (instruction to four children who sit together at a table) and a specific discriminative stimulus (task direction) limits the learning opportunities, which, by definition, decreases the amount of instruction the child is likely to receive. Equally as depressing as low-teaching-rate naturalistic classrooms are highly structured, often self-contained special education classrooms, where children lurch from one planned activity to the next. Two varieties of these classrooms exist, depending on the child–adult ratio. In one, instruction occurs for all the children, concurrently, in small-group or one-on-one sessions. This approach is extremely expensive and promotes dependence on adults. In the other variety, some children are in small-group instruction or at workstations with or without an adult, and the other children are essentially waiting for their turn for the real teaching to occur. This approach reduces instruction to the time when adults carry out their adult-planned, usually tabletop activities, so the rest of the time almost no instruction occurs. The two kinds of data we most need to resolve this debate are (a) how much instruction different types of children need for different skills or knowledge and (b) how much actual instruction occurs during the child’s everyday routines.</p>

<p>“We indeed need to improve the quality of teaching, and one place to begin is to ensure teachers are competent at using prompt procedures.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Good instruction can occur in the context of a naturally occurring routine (i.e., activity, event). Effective teaching is not confined to decontextualized, structured events. Our field has not understood that behavioral principles are at play all the time, especially when people are purposefully acquiring new content. The classroom, which is Wolery’s context of interest in his article, is full of stimuli of different properties on both sides of many child behaviors—the antecedents and the consequences. Many of those antecedents and consequences are natural: That’s how life works. Behavior, including learning, is shaped by the interaction of all these stimuli. So it doesn’t follow that we should count only direct instruction; learning by other means occurs, whether you want it to or not. It can comprise what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1096250613492115">Hart and Risley (1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1096250613492115">1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1096250613492115">1992</xref>) called incidental teaching. They used it for language instruction, but the general idea can be used across domains. The four main steps are (a) get the child engaged, (b) follow the child’s interest, (c) elicit more sophisticated behavior, and (d) ensure the interaction was reinforcing (i.e., close the learning loop or ensure it was a complete learning trial). The elicitation step is the one where advanced understanding of prompting procedures, as Wolery suggests, are helpful. Unfortunately, many early childhood teachers do not plan or execute well-designed prompts. Some get by with intuitive ways of getting children to move to the next level. We indeed need to improve the quality of teaching, and one place to begin is to ensure teachers are competent at using prompt procedures.</p>
<p>Children should learn (a) how to participate in everyday routines of the classroom, home, and community; (b) the knowledge and skills that exercise the child’s body and brain; and (c) the information that makes life interesting and sensible for the child. These are not three separate curricular areas—they are integrated in that they can all be taught in interesting (i.e., engaging) contexts. Sitting for a long time in front of a screen is not engaging enough to provide many learning opportunities—the engagement is too narrow (sitting, moving a mouse, receptive language maybe). Similarly, sitting in adult-directed small groups or one-on-one discrete-trial training sessions is not engaging enough. Adults naturally teach certain things, for better or for worse: naming colors, counting, coloring, names of familiar people and of pets, eye contact, eating, and drinking. We can increase the quality and quantity of this naturalistic instruction but we don’t usually need to change the contexts; if we do, it’s to improve them, not remove the child from them for teaching to occur.</p>
<p>We aim for children to be engaged, independent, social participants, not compliant special education students. One of the advantages of naturalistic approaches is that children with special needs learn to function in play-based environments, the way typically developing children are supposed to.</p>
<p>I have outlined four calls to action: (a) to IEP teams, to improve the functionality of goals; (b) to researchers, to study the dosage of instruction needed; (c) to teacher educators, to ensure teachers are competent at prompt procedures; and (d) to teachers, to improve contexts and the quality and quantity of naturalistic instruction. In conclusion, Wolery’s view about the quality or perhaps quantity of teaching is well founded, but the solution is not to put on the old tatty sweater knitted in artificial, experimental conditions but rather to darn the slightly newer sweater knitted in authentic, real-world conditions.</p>
