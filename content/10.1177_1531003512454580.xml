<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hepatic artery transection can occur as a consequence of a traumatic or iatrogenic injury, presenting a technical challenge in vascular exposure and reconstruction. In the setting of major trauma, injury to the hepatic artery is associated with severe concomitant injury and poor prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1531003512454580">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1531003512454580">2</xref></sup> The critically injured trauma patient may require life-saving maneuvers such as hepatic artery ligation without reconstruction, with successful outcomes reported in previous reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1531003512454580">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1531003512454580">3</xref></sup> Patients with underlying liver disease or those undergoing bile duct reconstruction are at a higher risk of complication and require formal arterial repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1531003512454580">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1531003512454580">5</xref></sup> Various options for reconstruction of the injured hepatic artery exist, including primary repair, interposition grafting, and arterial transposition. The rare nature of this injury makes comparative studies of reconstructive options difficult. In this brief report, we discuss the successful repair of an iatrogenic hepatic artery transection with a splenic artery transposition graft.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 71-year-old woman underwent an elective laparotomy and common bile duct resection for cholangiocarcinoma. During periaortic lymph node sampling, the hepatic artery was inadvertently divided near its origin with the Ligasure electocautery device. (ValleyLab, Boulder, CO). The injury was immediately recognized, and the patient remained hemodynamically stable with no significant blood loss occurring as a result of the arterial transection. Prior to the hepatic artery injury, an intraoperative decision to proceed with pancreaticoduodenectomy in addition to bile duct resection was made following the results of frozen section demonstrating positive margins at the distal common bile duct. As a routine step in pancreaticoduodenectomy, the right gastric and gastroduodenal arteries were divided. Collateral flow to the hepatic artery was determined to be inadequate, and thus, a decision to proceed with formal repair of the hepatic artery was made.</p>
<p>The branches of the celiac trunk and the distal hepatic artery were dissected and controlled, revealing classic arterial anatomy without any accessory vessels. The degree of tissue loss resulting from the common hepatic injury precluded primary repair. Inspection of the dissected splenic artery revealed adequate length for a transposition graft with numerous short gastric arteries available to perfuse the spleen. The patient was systemically heparinized and vascular clamps placed close to the origin of the splenic artery. The splenic artery was divided approximately 5 cm from its origin. The distal splenic artery was oversewn with a 5-0 Prolene suture. The proximal 5-cm length of splenic artery was rotated 180°, which provided adequate length for the transposition. After back bleeding the common hepatic and splenic artery transposition graft, an end-to-end anastomosis was created using a 6-0 Prolene suture. Doppler ultrasound confirmed a satisfactory arterial waveform within the splenic artery transposition, the hepatic artery and its branches, and within the distal splenic artery. To achieve negative bile duct resection margins, a right hepatectomy was performed in addition to the pancreaticoduodenectomy. The remainder of the operation was completed without complication, and the patient was extubated postoperatively. The patient was discharged home 1 month after the operation with the postoperative course prolonged by the development of an intra-abdominal collection, requiring percutaneous drainage, and new-onset atrial fibrillation. There was no clinical evidence of hepatic dysfunction, and follow-up imaging performed 1 month after the operation demonstrated that the arterial repair was patent with normal flow within the hepatic artery and its branches. There was no evidence of hepatic or splenic necrosis on follow-up imaging.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous articles have described ligation of the common hepatic artery without reconstruction in critically ill trauma patients following major hepatic injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1531003512454580">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1531003512454580">3</xref></sup> Hepatic function has been preserved in the majority of patients, although frequent elevation of liver enzymes is encountered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1531003512454580">3</xref></sup> A multicentered American study demonstrated hepatic necrosis in 22% of patients following hepatic artery ligation secondary to traumatic disruption. All the patients survived to discharge without known long-term hepatic dysfunction. In this series, the overall mortality rate for patients with hepatic artery injury was 68%, with a significantly higher mortality rate (86%) in those patients undergoing attempted hepatic arterial reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1531003512454580">2</xref></sup> In the damage control setting, ligation of the transected hepatic artery appears to be a safe option. Patients with preexisting liver disease and those undergoing biliary reconstruction are at greater risk of complications following hepatic artery injury and appear to benefit from arterial repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1531003512454580">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1531003512454580">5</xref></sup> Sarmiento et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1531003512454580">4</xref></sup> advocated hepatic artery repair if bile duct reconstruction is required because the blood supply to the remaining proximal bile duct will depend on hepatic artery flow. Leaving a ligated hepatic artery in the setting of choledochojejunostomy may predispose patients to a higher rate of bile leak. In our reported case, the patient underwent a combined bile duct resection and pancreaticoduodenectomy and therefore required a choledochojejejunomsty as part of the biliary reconstruction. The hepatic artery had been transected near its origin with the celiac trunk, and the gastroduodenal and right gastric arteries had been intentionally ligated as part of the resection; we therefore felt that reconstruction of the hepatic artery was justified to ensure adequate perfusion to the liver and our biliary anastomosis.</p>
<p>Options for management of the injured hepatic artery include primary repair, interposition grafting using either autologous vein or prosthetic conduits, and arterial transposition. Previous articles have described both primary hepatic artery repair and reversed saphenous vein grafts, with subsequent hepatic arterial thrombosis noted on early postoperative follow-up imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1531003512454580">6</xref></sup> The gonadal vein can be harvested without the need for an additional incision and has a favorable size match to the native hepatic artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1531003512454580">7</xref></sup> Arterial transposition using branches of the celiac axis has the benefit of a single vascular anastomosis and does not require a second incision. Previous reports have described the successful use of the gastroduodenal artery for transposition to a divided hepatic artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1531003512454580">4</xref></sup> In our case, the surgical team chose to avoid prosthetic material because of concern for potentially contaminated bile and gastrointestinal contents within the operative field. Because of the lack of a readily available saphenous vein and the potential added hepatic ischemic time associated with prepping the operative field for saphenous vein harvesting, the team elected to use a conduit from within the operative field. The gonadal and renal veins were considered for harvest and interposition grafting; however, because of the proximity of the hepatic artery injury to the celiac trunk and the length of splenic artery available for use as a conduit, the splenic artery was chosen. The splenic artery presented an autologous conduit with good size match to the common hepatic artery with the additional advantage over interposition grafting of a single vascular anastomosis.</p>
<p>Adequate perfusion of the spleen following splenic artery division has been described in patients who have undergone distal pancreatectomy without preservation of the splenic artery and vein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1531003512454580">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1531003512454580">9</xref></sup> Following ligation of the splenic artery, the spleen remains perfused via the short gastric arteries and the left gastroepiploic artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1531003512454580">8</xref></sup> Long-term follow-up of 10 patients following distal pancreatectomy without conservation of the splenic artery or vein revealed no incidence of splenic infarction or splenic atrophy at a mean follow-up of 92 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1531003512454580">8</xref></sup> We requested a CT angiogram on postoperative day 10, which confirmed patency of the splenic artery transposition graft and hepatic artery, with a well-perfused spleen supplied by the short gastric arteries.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Various strategies to manage a hepatic artery injury have been described, ranging from ligation to complex vascular reconstruction. In hemodynamically stable patients, able to tolerate reconstruction, arterial transposition using the splenic artery is a feasible method to ensure adequate arterial supply to the liver and biliary tract.</p>
