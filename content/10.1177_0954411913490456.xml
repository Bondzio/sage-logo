<abstract>
<p>It has been reported that posterolateral corner structures, including the lateral collateral ligament, the popliteus tendon, and the popliteofibular ligament, may play important roles in reducing external rotational and posterior translational instabilities. However, there are few studies focusing on the quantitative influence of posterolateral corner structures on knee joint stability, due to the difficulty of controlling experimental conditions. In this study, a knee model that included posterolateral corner structures was developed. It was validated by comparison to previous experimental studies using the posterior drawer test, dial test, and varus stress test. The posterior translation, external rotation, and varus rotation were then predicted in order to investigate the contribution of posterolateral corner structures to translational and rotational stabilities. Our results indicate that posterolateral corner structures, including the popliteofibular ligament and the popliteus tendon, could contribute to posterior translational and external rotational stabilities, as clinical observations had suggested. Therefore, the addition of posterolateral corner structures to knee joint models may improve the utility of such models.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>An understanding of knee joint biomechanics, such as bone kinematics, joint stability, ligament forces and stress, and contact pressures between knee joint components, is essential for the protection, diagnosis, surgery, and rehabilitation of knee joint injuries. Computational modeling technologies have been used to predict the kinematics and kinetics of the knee joint due to challenge of evaluating in vivo movement and the corresponding forces, pressures, and stresses on bones and soft tissues.<sup>

</sup> Quasi-static knee joint models, including bones, ligaments, and cartilage, were developed first,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411913490456">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411913490456">3</xref>

</sup> In these previous studies, ligaments were used as knee joint stabilizers. Four major ligaments, which are the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), and lateral collateral ligament (LCL), were conventionally included in the models. In addition, the medial, lateral, oblique politeal, and arcuate popliteal bundles of the posterior knee capsules were simulated in a recent study.<sup>

<p>It has been reported that the posterolateral corner (PLC) structures, including the LCL, popliteus tendon (PLT), and popliteofibular ligament (PFL), may play important roles in reducing the external rotational and posterior translational instabilities, because injuries of the PLC, commonly caused by athletic traumas, motor vehicle accidents, and falls, result in the translational or rotational instability of the knee joint.<sup>

</sup> There were also several cadaveric experimental studies that were performed to investigate the role of the PLC structures.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411913490456">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411913490456"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411913490456">16</xref>
</sup> The contribution of PFL to posterolateral (PL) stability was analyzed, and the functional role of the PLC structures in providing knee joint stability was investigated. However, to our knowledge, there are few studies to assess contribution of the PLC structures to joint stabilities with computational knee joint models. In this study, a three-dimensional knee joint model, which included the PLC structures (LCL, PLT, and PFL), was developed, and the model was validated by comparing to previous experimental studies of the posterior drawer test, the dial test, and the varus stress test. The contribution of PLC structures to the knee joint translational and rotational stabilities was then quantitatively investigated.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Three-dimensional models of the femur, tibia, and fibula were constructed based on computed tomography (CT) images of 26-year-old male subject. Solid shell models of the cartilage layer and meniscus between the femur and the tibia were also reconstructed. Commercial software such as 3D-Doctor (Able Software Co., USA), Rapidform 2004 (INUS Technology Inc., USA), and SolidWorks (SolidWorks Inc., USA) were used for the modeling process. The developed models were imported into the dynamic analysis software, RecurDyn version 7 (Function Bay Inc., Korea) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411913490456">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The viscoelastic contact between the femoral and tibial cartilages was estimated based on the elastic contact stiffness (500 N/mm) and damping coefficient (5 N s/mm) given in previous studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411913490456">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411913490456"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411913490456">19</xref>
</sup> The contact between the meniscus and these cartilages was also defined using the parameters (20 N/mm of elastic stiffness and 5 N s/mm of damping coefficient) obtained from discrete element analysis technique.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411913490456">20</xref>
</sup> The material properties of the cartilage and meniscus, such as Young’s modulus and Poisson ratio, were obtained from the literature.<sup>

</p>
<p>Lateral and medial meniscuses were attached to the tibial plateau by horn attachments, which can constrain meniscus motions. Each horn was modeled as two linear springs. In addition, the transverse ligaments were also included as spring–damper systems. The anatomical and material properties of the horn attachments and transverse ligaments such as attachment points, stiffness, and damping coefficients were available in the literature.<sup>

<p>The four major ligaments, ACL, PCL, MCL, and LCL, were included in the knee joint model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411913490456">Figure 1</xref>). The ACL and PCL were modeled with two bundles, while the MCL and LCL were modeled with three bundles.<sup>

</sup> Two bundles of deep capsular fibers in the MCL (aCM and pCM) were included.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411913490456">6</xref>
</sup> The medial, lateral, oblique popliteal, and arcuate popliteal bundles of the posterior knee capsule (CAPm, CAPl, CAPo, and CAPa) were also developed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411913490456">7</xref>
</sup> Finally, the PLT and PFL within PLC structures were modeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411913490456">Figure 1</xref>).<sup>

</sup> The origins and insertions of ligament bundles were decided, and each ligament bundle was modeled as a nonlinear spring with a damper based on previous studies.<sup>

</sup> The popliteus muscle force was included in the model. The force of 44 N was derived based on the cross-sectional area of the popliteus muscle and maximum muscle power.<sup>

</p>
<p>The models with 30°, 60°, and 90° of flexion were obtained by rotating the tibia with the soft tissue attached since the model was initially developed at extension, which supposed to be 0° of flexion. The tibia was flexed with 1° of increment with respect to its mechanical axis when the femur was fixed by minimizing the total potential energy and satisfying the mechanical equilibrium.</p>
<p>To validate the knee model, three typical test methods were considered: (1) posterior drawer test, (2) dial test, and (3) varus stress test. In the posterior drawer test, a posterior force was applied to the knee center, which was the midpoint of the transcondylar line.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954411913490456">27</xref>
</sup> In the dial and varus stress tests, an external tibial and a varus moment were applied to the tibial insertion site of the PL bundle of PCL. First, the posterior tibial translations of the intact and PCL-deficient knees in the posterior drawer test under 134 N at 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of flexion were compared to previous experimental studies. The models with 30°, 60°, and 90° of flexion were obtained by rotating the tibia with the soft tissue attached since the model was initially developed at extension, which supposed to be 0° of flexion. The tibia was flexed with 1° of increment with respect to its mechanical axis when the femur was fixed by minimizing the total potential energy and satisfying the mechanical equilibrium.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954411913490456">28</xref>
</sup> The dial test under 5 N m and varus stress test under 3 N m were performed for the sequential ligament sectioning study.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411913490456">16</xref>
</sup> The sectioning sequence was the PFL, the PLT, and the LCL in this order. When the PLT was removed, the simulated popliteus muscle force became inactive. The rotational angles of the tibia at 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of knee flexion were compared to values from the experimental study.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411913490456">16</xref>
</sup> In addition, the load responses (the ligament force/the applied moment) of the PFL, PLT, and LCL for the intact knee were compared to the previous cadaveric study.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411913490456">11</xref>
</sup> Finally, the posterior drawer test under 134 N, the dial test under 5 N m, and the varus stress test under 5 N m were simulated for the developed model, which had the PLC structures, and the model in which the PFL and the PLT were removed. In order to investigate the contribution of the PLC structures to the knee joint stability, the posterior translation, external rotation, and varus rotation were compared.</p>

<p>Although the PLC structures were considered together as the PL capsule or popliteus arcuate ligament complex in the initial studies,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411913490456">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0954411913490456">38</xref>
</sup> they were recently divided into the PFL, the PLT, and the LCL and observed separately. The roles of the PFL and PLT on stability were reported in previous in vitro studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411913490456">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411913490456">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411913490456">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0954411913490456">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0954411913490456">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0954411913490456">40</xref>
</sup> In addition, anatomical information about the PLC structures, such as the origin and insertion of bundles, physiological cross-sectional area, and material properties such as Young’s modulus and Poisson ratio, which are essential for the development of a knee joint model including the PLC structures, was reported.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411913490456">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411913490456">25</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Because it has been noted that the LCL is the primary stabilizer among the PLC structures,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411913490456">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411913490456">15</xref>
</sup> most knee joint models have included only the LCL. However, some sequential sectioning tests indicated that the PFL and the PLT also contribute to knee joint stability. In this study, a knee joint model, which included the PFL and the PLT, was developed. The model was validated by simulating the posterior drawer test, the dial test, and the varus stress test and comparing the test results to previous experimental studies.<sup>

</sup> The contribution of the PFL and the PLT to the translational and rotational stabilities was determined by using the model, which included the PFL and the PLT, and comparing its performance to a model in which they were absent.</p>
<p>The posterior drawer test results indicated that the posterior translations were in agreement with those reported in previous experimental studies for both intact and the PCL-deficient knees, regardless of the knee flexion angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411913490456">Figure 2</xref>). The sequential ligament sectioning results for the dial test indicated that the average rotational difference between our result and previous study’s results<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411913490456">16</xref>
</sup> was 18.5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411913490456">Figure 3(a)</xref>). However, it was only 9.4% if we did not include cases in which the PFL, PLT, and LCL were absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411913490456">Figure 3(a)</xref>). Because the anatomical information and the material properties used in this study were not the same as those in the previous study, both a 9.4% and 18.5% difference may be acceptable for validation of the developed model. Moreover, the sectioning results for the varus stress test also supported the validity of the model because the varus rotation was similar to the previous study results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411913490456">Figure 3(b)</xref>).</p>
<p>The maximum differences in load responses of the PFL, the PLT, and the LCL for the external dial test were 1.4 SD, 1.6 SD, and 1.0 SD, respectively, and the average values were 1.0 SD, 1.0 SD, and 0.9 SD, respectively<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411913490456">11</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411913490456">Figure 4</xref>). For the varus stress test, the maximum difference in load responses of the LCL was 1.3 SD, and the average value was 0.6 SD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411913490456">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, all the posterior translations in the posterior drawer test, the external rotations in the dial test, and the varus rotations in the varus stress test were fell within the ranges obtained from previous experimental studies regardless of the existence of the PFL and the PLT in the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411913490456">Figure 6</xref>). Therefore, it could be concluded that the validation of the developed model was established.</p>
<p>The posterior translations in the posterior drawer test, the external rotations in the dial test, and the varus rotations in the varus stress test were increased by an average of 38.4%, 26.3%, and 12.4%, respectively, when the PFL and the PLT were removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411913490456">Figure 6</xref>). These results suggest that the PFL and the PLT had greater influences on the posterior translation than on the external and varus rotations, which is in agreement with the clinical observation that both the PFL and the PLT are secondary stabilizers for posterior tibial translation whereas the PCL is the primary stabilizer. In addition, we confirmed that the PFL and the PLT also contributed to reduction of the external rotation, as clinical studies reported.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411913490456">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411913490456">15</xref>

</p>
<p>There are some limitations in this study. Only one young male subject was used to construct the model. Various subjects of different ages need to be studied to enhance the validity of the results, because results are also dependent on the geometry of the knee joint. The ligaments were simplified into only two or three bundles as nonlinear springs. Three typical virtual tests were performed to assess the translational and rotational stabilities. Since the dynamic analysis software was utilized, application of the kinematic information to the model using the motion capture technology can achieve a complex stability analysis during normal daily activities such as walking and jumping. Moreover, it is necessary to investigate the PFL and the PLT separately in future studies since the PFL and the PLT were considered together as the PLC structures in this study.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a knee model that included the PLC structures was developed and validated by comparisons to previous experimental studies of the posterior drawer test, the dial test, and the varus stress test. The posterior translation, the external rotation, and the varus rotation were then predicted to investigate the contributions of the PLC structures to the translational and rotational stabilities. Our results indicate that PLC structures, including the PFL and the PLT, could contribute to the posterior translational and external rotational stabilities, as the clinical observation suggested. Therefore, inclusion of the PLC structures in knee joint models might be helpful to improve the utility of the models. Moreover, the models may provide information to plan surgical options such as graft diameter or graft attachment site for the ACL reconstruction surgery because they can predict translational and rotational stabilities for several clinical tests.</p>
