<abstract>
<p>This article engages the debate about religion in Europe in two ways. It starts by setting out the factors that must be taken into account in understanding the present situation in Europe with regard to religion. It continues by reflecting on these changes in terms of three atypical cases: Ireland, the former East Germany, and Romania. The article concludes with an affirmation of the overall framework. Though distinctive, each of the three cases can be ‘contained’ in this approach.</p>

<p>This article is divided into two sections. The first is longer than the second and builds on previous writing relating to the nature of religion in modern Europe and the factors that must be taken into account if this is to be properly understood. The second section introduces three European societies that in one way or another invite reflection. These are the Republic of Ireland, which has experienced a late and very rapid process of secularization; the former East Germany, which is widely regarded as the most secular region of Europe; and Romania, which is an Orthodox, post-communist and notably religious corner of the continent. How should we understand these cases? Does the analysis set out in the first section help us to do this effectively?</p>
<sec id="section1-0021140013484432">
<title>Understanding Religion in Modern Europe: The Factors to Take into Account</title>
<p>There are six rather different factors, which—taken together—contribute to a better understanding of the place of religion in modern Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021140013484432">1</xref></sup> The crucial point to remember is that they push and pull in different directions. The six factors are:</p>
<list id="list1-0021140013484432" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>the role of the historic churches in shaping European culture;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>an awareness that these churches still have a place at particular moments in the lives of modern Europeans, though they are no longer able to discipline the beliefs and behaviour of the great majority of the population;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>an observable change in the churchgoing constituencies of the continent, which operate increasingly on a model of choice, rather than a model of obligation or duty;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the arrival into Europe of groups of people from many different parts of the world, and with very different religious aspirations from those seen in the host societies;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the reactions of Europe’s secular elites to the increasing salience of religion in public as well as private life;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a growing realization that the patterns of religious life in modern Europe should be considered an ‘exceptional case’ in global terms—they are not a global prototype.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Each of these factors will be taken in turn in the paragraphs that follow. They will be drawn together in a short conclusion to this section.</p>
<sec id="section2-0021140013484432">
<title>Cultural Heritage</title>
<p>The starting point reflects the undisputed role of Christianity in shaping European culture, bearing in mind that other factors (notably Greek rationalism and Roman organization) must also be considered. One example will suffice to illustrate this fact: the Christian tradition has had an irreversible effect in determining the most basic categories of human existence (time and space) in this part of the world. Both week and year follow the Christian cycle, even if the major festivals of the Christian calendar are beginning to lose their resonance for large sections of the population. They are nonetheless retained as a framework for public holidays. Sunday, moreover, remains distinctive even if the notion of a ‘day of rest’ has largely been discarded. The same is true of space. Wherever you look in Europe, Christian churches predominate, some of which retain huge symbolic value for the populations that surround them; and from the largest city to the smallest village, Europeans orient themselves with reference to religious buildings even if they seldom enter them for worship. This is not to deny that in some parts of Europe (notably the larger cities) the skyline is fast becoming an indicator of growing religious diversity. Europe is changing, but the legacies of the past remain deeply embedded in both the physical and cultural environment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0021140013484432">
<title>The Historic Churches</title>
<p>Physical and cultural presence is one thing; a hands-on role in the everyday lives of European people is quite another. Commentators of all kinds agree that, with very few exceptions, the latter is no longer a realistic aspiration for the historic churches of Europe. That does not mean, however, that these institutions have entirely lost their significance as markers of religious identity. The following terms are useful in understanding these ambiguities: first, the notion of ‘believing without belonging’ and, second, the concept of ‘vicarious religion.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0021140013484432">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the most striking features of religious life in contemporary Europe is the mismatch between different measurements of religiousness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0021140013484432">3</xref></sup> There exists, first of all, a set of indicators which measure firm commitments to (a) institutional life and (b) <italic>credal</italic> statements of religion (in this case, Christianity). These indicators, moreover, are closely related to each other in so far as institutional commitments—in the form of regular religious practice—both reflect and confirm religious belief in its ‘orthodox’ forms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0021140013484432">4</xref></sup> The believing Christian attends church to express his or her belief and to receive affirmation that this is the right thing to do. Conversely, repeated exposure to the institution and its teaching necessarily disciplines belief.</p>
<p>No observer of the current religious scene disputes the fact that these dimensions of European religion are interrelated and in serious decline. Fewer Europeans go to church than used to. As a result, the idea of a common narrative (of Christian liturgy or of Christian language and metaphor) becomes more and more tenuous almost by the day. What, then, are the consequences of this situation? The complex relationship between belief in a wider sense and practice is central to this discussion, for it is abundantly clear that a manifest reduction in the ‘hard’ indicators of religious life has not, in the short term at least, had a similar effect on rather less rigorous dimensions of religiousness. For the time being, the latter remain relatively strong (the data are clear on this point). Between two-thirds and three-quarters of Europeans assent to ‘belief in God,’ and roughly similar proportions touch base with the institutional churches at some point in their lives, often at times of crisis. It is precisely this state of affairs, which is captured by the phrase ‘believing without belonging.’ That said, the connections between emergent patterns of belief and the institutional churches are complex. Not only do the latter continue to exist, they quite clearly exert an influence, both direct and indirect, on many aspects of individual and collective lives—even in Europe. The notion of ‘vicarious religion’ is helpful in this context.</p>
<p>By vicarious is meant the notion of religion performed by an active minority but on behalf of a much larger number, who (implicitly at least) not only understand, but appear to approve of what the minority is doing. The first half of the definition is relatively straightforward and reflects the everyday meaning of the term ‘vicarious’—that is, to do something on behalf of someone else. The second half captures the legacy of the state churches of Europe and is best explored by means of examples. Religion can operate vicariously in a wide variety of ways. For example, churches and church leaders perform ritual on behalf of others (at the time of a birth or a death, for instance); if these services are denied, this causes offence—the more so amongst those who do not attend regularly. Church leaders and churchgoers believe on behalf of others and incur criticism if they do not do this properly. Once again it is, very often, the occasional churchgoer who articulates this disquiet most clearly, and the more senior the church leader, the worse the problem becomes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0021140013484432">5</xref></sup> Thirdly, church leaders and churchgoers are expected to embody moral codes on behalf of others, even when those codes have been abandoned by large sections of the populations that they serve. This is true particularly with respect to family life and is one reason for the widespread disgust that many Europeans (and indeed others) felt regarding the disclosures of child abuse among Catholic priests. Churches, finally, can offer space for the vicarious debate of unresolved issues in modern societies. If the latter were not the case, it is hard to understand the persistent scrutiny of their positions on a wide variety of topical issues, from changing views regarding the nature of sexuality to the difficult moral questions surrounding birth and death (which reflect in turn the meaning of life itself).</p>
<p>An alternative way of illustrating the nature of vicarious religion is to consider the place of religion and the continuing role of religious institutions in European societies when they face the unexpected or the tragic. The reactions provoked by the death of Princess Diana in August 1997 offer a revealing illustration: what happened in Britain in the week following the car accident in Paris cannot by any stretch of the imagination be described as either rational or secular, but nor was it conventionally religious. So what was it? One point is clear: a great deal of the improvised and markedly heterogeneous rituals that emerged among ordinary people at that time took place in the vicinity of centrally placed churches. It was these churches, moreover, that housed books of condolence and facilities for lighting candles—ordinary people queued for hours to make use of these resources—and it was the established church (the Church of England) that took responsibility for her funeral. Even more important, however, is the fact that the reactions to Princess Diana’s death (or any number of more recent equivalents) are simply ‘writ-large’ versions of what goes on in the everyday lives of individuals and communities all the time. People die, sometimes unexpectedly, and communities suffer, sometimes with little apparent justification. What is to be done on these occasions and who is to do it?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0021140013484432">
<title>From Obligation to Consumption</title>
<p>Where, though, does this leave Europe’s diminishing, but still significant churchgoers—those who maintain the tradition on behalf of the people described in the previous section? Here an observable change is clearly taking place, best summarized as a shift from a culture of obligation or duty to a culture of consumption or choice. What was once simply imposed on Europeans (with all the negative connotations of this word), or inherited (which has a rather more positive spin), becomes instead a matter of personal choice. Religiously active Europeans now go to church or to another religious organization because they choose to, sometimes for a short period or sometimes for longer, sometimes regularly and sometimes less so, but they feel no <italic>obligation</italic> either to attend that church in the first place or to continue if they no longer want to.</p>
<p>As such, this pattern is entirely compatible with vicariousness: the historic churches need to be there in order that Europeans may attend them if they so choose. Their nature, however, gradually alters, a shift that is discernible in both practice and belief, not to mention the connections between them. There is, for example, an easily documentable change in the patterns of baptism in the Church of England. The overall number of baptisms has dropped dramatically in the post-war period, evidence once again of institutional decline. In England, though not yet in the Nordic countries, or indeed in parts of southern Europe, baptism is no longer seen as a ritual associated with birth, but has become increasingly a sign of membership in a chosen voluntary community. In other words membership of the historic churches is changing in nature. They are becoming more like the growing number of free or independent churches that can be found all over Europe, though more in some places than in others. Voluntarism is beginning to establish itself <italic>de facto</italic>, regardless of the constitutional legacies of state churches.</p>
<p>A second point follows from this. What are the most popular choices of modern Europeans when it comes to religious attendance? The answers to this question are doubly interesting in the sense that they not only indicate the strengths and weaknesses of the present situation, but reveal that the predictions of an earlier generation (both scholars and church people) were largely incorrect. Specifically, in the current period Europeans are disproportionately drawn to two kinds of religious organization: charismatic evangelical churches, on the one hand, and cathedrals or city-centre churches, on the other. The former epitomizes firm commitments, strong fellowship, and conservative teaching, offset by the warmth of the charismatic experience. The latter allows a much more individual (even anonymous) expression of religious commitment: in ‘cathedral-type’ churches the appeal is often associated with the beauty of the building, the quality of the music, and the traditional nature of the liturgy. The important point to grasp is that in both cases there is a noticeable <italic>experiential</italic> element, albeit very differently expressed.</p>
<p>In the mid post-war decades, something rather different was envisaged. Conservative teaching was out of fashion and cathedrals were often classed as ‘dinosaurs’—less and less relevant to the modern world and very expensive to maintain. They are still expensive to maintain, but the data indicate that they are increasingly attractive to late modern populations, whether they come as regular worshippers, less regular worshippers, tourists or pilgrims—noting that the lines between these categories are distinctly porous.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0021140013484432">6</xref></sup> Conversely, rather more liberal forms of Protestantism, noticeably fashionable in the 1960s, have not fulfilled their earlier promise. There are, of course, important exceptions to this rule but, by and large, the purely cerebral has less appeal in the 21st century than many people thought would be the case.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0021140013484432">
<title>New Arrivals</title>
<p>The fourth factor in this sociological ‘map’ of religion in Europe concerns the growing number of newcomers in many parts of the continent, most notably west Europe. There are three stages in this process. The first was closely linked to the urgent need for labour in the expanding economies of post-war Europe, especially in Britain, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. The second wave of immigration occurred in the 1990s and included, in addition to the places listed above, the Nordic countries, Ireland, and the countries of Mediterranean Europe (Greece, Italy, Spain, and Portugal)—bearing in mind that many of these had until very recently been countries of emigration rather than immigration. Indeed the shift from one to the other was extraordinarily rapid and took almost everyone by surprise. A third stage can be found in the movement from the east to the west of Europe, which mostly took place after 2004 (or in some cases 2007), when the enlargements of the European Union permitted the easy movement of people from the countries formerly under communist domination to what is conventionally known as ‘the West.’ All three phases have been subject to economic change, not least the financial crisis of 2008, which has had a visible impact on the flows of labour in Europe.</p>
<p>None of these are primarily religious movements, but the implications for the religious life of the continent are considerable. The first point to grasp is that the consequences of this process vary from place to place and depend as much on the host society as on the new arrivals themselves. Britain and France offer an instructive comparison in this respect. In Britain immigration has been much more diverse than in France, both in terms of provenance and in terms of faith communities. Secondly, Britain is a country where ethnicity and religion criss-cross each other in a bewildering variety of ways (only Sikhs and Jews claim ethno-religious identities). Thirdly, Britain is more ready than many of her European neighbours to embrace diversity—a tradition that stretches back to a colonial past, where rule through local elite was the norm. The situation in France is very different: here immigration has been largely from the Maghreb, as a result of which France has one of the largest Muslim communities in Europe (an almost entirely Arab population). Rightly or wrongly, Arab and Muslim have become interchangeable terms in popular parlance in France. France, moreover, firmly rejects the notion of <italic>communautarisme</italic>, in the sense that French citizens are welcomed as such but their primary identity is to France, not to an intermediate group, be it religious or another. Once again the resonance with colonial policy is clear: French rule in the colonies meant direct rule from Paris.</p>
<p>Beneath these differences lies, however, a common factor: the growing presence of other faith communities in general and of the Muslim population in particular, is challenging some deeply held European assumptions. The notion that faith is a private matter and should, therefore, be proscribed from public life—notably from the state, from welfare, and from the education system—is widespread in Europe. Conversely, many of those who are currently arriving in this part of the world have markedly different convictions, and offer—simply by their presence—a challenge to the European way of doing things.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0021140013484432">
<title>Europe’s Secular Elites</title>
<p>The interactions described in the previous section raise, however, a further point: that is the extent to which the secular elites of Europe make use of these events to articulate alternatives (ideological, constitutional, and institutional) to religion. In order to understand this point fully, it is important to grasp two things: first, that such elites have re-emerged in European societies as a <italic>reaction</italic> to the renewed presence of religion in public debate (resurgent religion brings with it resurgent secularism); and, secondly, that these groups, just like their religious counterparts, vary markedly from place to place. As ever, the nature of the religious and the nature of the secular go hand in hand. Key in this respect is an appreciation of the secularization process: specifically, an awareness that this has taken place differently in different European countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0021140013484432">7</xref></sup> For example, what in Britain, and indeed in most of northern Europe, occurred gradually (starting with a de-clericalization of the churches from within at the time of the Reformation), became in France a delayed and much more ideological clash between a hegemonic, heavily clerical church and a much more militant secular state. The result was ‘la guerre des deux Frances’ (Catholic and <italic>laïque</italic>), which dominated French political life well into the 20th century. The legacies still remain in the form of a self-consciously secular elite and a lingering suspicion concerning religion of all kinds—the more so when this threatens the public sphere. The fact that these threats are no longer Catholic but Muslim does not alter the underlying reaction.</p>
<p>Norway offers a rather different illustration. Proportionally speaking, Norway houses a surprisingly large number of humanists. Many of these are members of the Norwegian Humanist Association, which campaigns for the separation of church and state and the full equality of all religions and life stances in Norway.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0021140013484432">8</xref></sup> Particular attention is paid to schools (including the place of religious education in the curriculum) and to young people—a separate youth organization was established in 2007. The Association becomes in fact a parallel institution to the state church and is, in many ways, similar to this. It is, for example, partly financed by the equivalent of ‘church’ tax (there is also an annual membership fee). Above all the tone of the debate, despite some sharp differences in opinion, is distinctively Norwegian—it is very different from the French case.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0021140013484432">
<title>Is Europe an Exceptional Case?</title>
<p>The final factor introduces a rather different perspective. Indeed, it reverses the essential question: instead of asking what Europe is in term of its religious existence, it asks what Europe is not. It is not (yet) a vibrant religious market such as that found in the United States; it is not a part of the world, where Christianity is growing exponentially, very often in Pentecostal forms, as is the case in the global south; it is not a part of the world dominated by faiths other than Christian, but is increasingly penetrated by these; and it is not for the most part subject to the violence often associated with religion and religious difference in other parts of the globe—the more so, if religion becomes entangled in political conflict. Hence the inevitable, if at times disturbing conclusion: that the patterns of religion in modern Europe, notably its relative secularity, might be an exceptional case in global terms.</p>
<p>This point is all the more crucial if we remember that the paradigms of social science emerge from the European Enlightenment and are very largely premised on the notion that modern societies are likely to be secular societies. It follows that the traditional, European-based understandings of social science may be markedly less suitable for the study of religion in other parts of the world. Indeed, they are not always helpful in terms of Europe itself, given the intricacies of religious life in the early years of the 21st century.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0021140013484432">
<title>Gathering the Threads</title>
<p>Each of the above factors merits careful consideration in its own right. One way of drawing them together, however, is to recognize that two things are happening at once in 21st-century Europe. On the one hand are the increasing levels of secularity, which lead in turn to an inevitable decline in religious knowledge as well as in religious belief. On the other is a series of increasingly urgent debates about religion in public life, prompted by the need to accommodate new populations in Europe, who bring with them very different ways of being religious. This largely unexpected combination is difficult to manage, both in the continent as a whole and in its constituent nations. This is hardly surprising in that European populations are losing their knowledge of religion (i.e. of vocabulary, concept, and narrative) just when they need this most—given the requirement, on an increasingly regular basis, to pass judgement on the rights and obligations of the very varied religious actors, individual and corporate, which currently cohabit in this part of the world. The consequent debates all too often are both ill-informed and ill-mannered, as Europeans re-open questions that they had considered closed and for which they are inadequately prepared.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0021140013484432">
<title>Three Vignettes</title>
<p>I have introduced the material contained in the previous section in many different parts of Europe. The presentation is almost always well received as those who are listening quite clearly recognize both themselves and the situations of which they are part. That said, the six factors resonate differently in different parts of the continent, depending, for example, on the degree to which a ‘market’ in religion has been able to evolve. This varies, as does the relative strength of the historic church in question. It is equally clear that the former communist countries of east and central Europe have been subject to emigration rather than immigration and, for the most part, have not been challenged by forms of religion coming from outside—i.e. from a different cultural heritage. Secular reactions are also different in that secular elites in this part of Europe have had a distinctive engagement with history. More often than not, they were associated with the imposition of communism; religion, conversely, became an important channel through which to express dissent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0021140013484432">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following vignettes are considered with this in mind. They are no more than pen portraits, but in visiting each of these places, I have been obliged to reflect on the appropriateness of the analysis presented above. Would this or would this not resonate for the audience in question? Different factors are highlighted in each case; the focus is necessarily selective and lies on the points most pertinent to the situation under review. The reasons for my visits can be found in the appropriate footnote.</p>
<sec id="section10-0021140013484432">
<title>The Republic of Ireland<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0021140013484432">10</xref></sup></title>
<p>Ireland is technically a secular state. The preamble to the Irish Constitution begins, however, with an invocation to the Trinity; it is a heavily Catholic text. More importantly it is abundantly clear that Catholicism in Ireland became inextricably bound up with the maintenance of Irish identity—a crucial factor in the long and at times tortuous struggle for autonomy as the Republic disentangled itself from its larger Protestant neighbour. Ireland, in fact, offers a classic example of the elision of national and religious identity; each reinforces the other to resist external pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0021140013484432">11</xref></sup> For this reason, Catholicism remained of central importance to the daily lives of Irish people for considerably longer than it (or its equivalent) did in most of Europe. Evidence for this can be found in the markedly high levels of belief and practice that persisted into the late 20th century and in a wide variety of institutional practices (secular as well as religious).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0021140013484432">12</xref></sup> Here, manifestly, was a Church that could still discipline the beliefs and behaviour of Irish people. Ireland, moreover, was a country of emigration rather than immigration. Wave after wave of Irish people left the island for economic reasons, taking their Catholicism with them. Significant numbers came to the industrializing cities of Britain; others went further afield to the United States and Australia.</p>
<p>A pattern which seemed likely to perpetuate itself for the foreseeable future changed abruptly in the 1990s. An economic boom, encouraged by Ireland’s membership of the European Union, turned a country of emigration into a country of immigration almost overnight. The shift was dramatic. Dublin, in particular, became a sought after place to live and work, attracting a wide variety of (often young) people, much less interested in the traditional ways of doing things. A heavily institutionalized Catholic Church was ill placed to respond given the speed of change, a situation that led in turn to a rapid decline in religious practice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0021140013484432">13</xref></sup> This is best described as a speeded-up version of secularization: the process that had taken several generations in most of Europe occurred extraordinarily fast in Ireland, just as it did in Québec in the 1960s. The parallels are very clear.</p>
<p>The point should not be exaggerated. Figures from the 2011 Irish census reveal that Ireland is still overwhelmingly Catholic (84%), though the number indicating ‘no religion’ has grown considerably (albeit from a low base).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0021140013484432">14</xref></sup> There is in addition a small but significant community of Muslims, bearing in mind that most of those arriving in Ireland in recent years have come from Europe rather than the Muslim world. Since 2004, moreover, the Europeans have included a sizeable number of Poles, who have brought with them a form of Catholicism that once again is strongly associated with national identity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0021140013484432">15</xref></sup> The economic boom that encouraged these arrivals was, however, short-lived. For a multiplicity of reasons, Ireland suffered disproportionately after 2008, generating new waves of emigration as livelihoods collapsed. Equally devastating, though very different, are the revelations that have emerged regarding the misconduct of Catholic priests over several decades. In Ireland, as elsewhere, this has shaken the confidence both of the Church itself and of the population that it is called to serve.</p>
<p>How then should we consider the factors set out above? That Ireland is culturally Catholic is indisputable; it is equally clear that the vicarious role of the Catholic Church remains strong. The status quo, however, is shifting noticeably as more and more people distance themselves from the Church and as the critical voices assert themselves. In little more than a decade, a situation that was almost universally taken for granted began to unravel. Ireland, in short, has become more like the rest of Europe; it is closer to the norm than it used to be.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0021140013484432">
<title>The Former East Germany<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0021140013484432">16</xref></sup></title>
<p>If the Republic of Ireland has been seen as one of the strongholds of religion in Europe, the former East Germany is just the opposite. Simply a glance at the comparative figures for belief, practice, and self-affiliation is enough to reveal the extent of secularization in this part of Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0021140013484432">17</xref></sup> The former DDR is one of the least believing and least practising places in the modern world. It is tempting to explain this situation as the direct consequence of two generations of communism. The reality, however, is more complex. East German secularity is result of a specific and long-term combination of factors. These include a Protestant rather than Catholic tradition, and a long rather than short history of secularization. To understand this better, it is important to pay attention to historians of religion as well as to sociologists, noting in particular the painstaking work of Hugh McLeod.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0021140013484432">18</xref></sup> Well before the advent of communism, the churches were significantly weakened, meaning that a downward spiral was already in train. It was hardly surprising that resistance to the regime was minimal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0021140013484432">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>It would be easy to conclude in this situation that the notion of vicarious religion is no longer relevant. Here is a society that is effectively living without religion. There are still signs of a Christian heritage in culture, landscape, and architecture (these are hard to eradicate), but the notion of an institution that carries a memory on behalf of a wider constituency is more difficult to sustain. Two facts, however, have caused me to question this interpretation. The first can be found in the critical months leading to 1989. It is quite clear that an important focus for resistance was located in the Lutheran Nicolaikirche in Leipzig, more specifically in the Monday meetings for prayer. These gatherings became larger and noticeably more political as the weeks passed, eventually spilling out into the streets—a protest that became bolder as the momentum grew. The story is well known, but the underlying question remains. Why was it that East German people of many different persuasions gathered here rather than anywhere else? The answer lies in the fact that the churches—though much-reduced, infiltrated, and under surveillance—were the only available space in which to express criticism of the regime. The following conclusion follows logically: that, when necessary, vicarious religion can maintain itself on pretty slim resources.</p>
<p>My second point is more speculative and would require the skills of both theologians and musical scholars to be fully explored. I was invited to the University of Greifswald in June 2012. My visit more or less coincided with the annual Bach festival, which has been held continuously since 1946. Plainly this was a major event in the Greifswald calendar. It is equally clear that a visit to the festival during communist times was prompted by political as well as musical motives. It was a way of signalling attachment to a distinctive set of values, which were not those of the regime. More profoundly, the continuing popularity of the music of Bach in this part of Europe should, I think, be seen in relation to a certain kind of Protestant piety—in itself such music becomes a carrier of religious identity even if the latter is rarely articulated.</p>
<p>I have had a similar impression during recent visits to Uppsala in Sweden, where a different annual event stands out. This is the requiem that is traditionally performed in Uppsala cathedral on All Hallows’ Eve. Technically speaking, this is a concert, in the sense that the public pay to go in, but the line between concert and liturgy is necessarily fine given the nature of the work and the time and place of performance. How then should we categorize this event? Given that the cathedral is normally full to capacity in a country in which churchgoing is notoriously low, it seems sensible to conclude that most people think they are going to a concert. But the ‘experience’ indicates otherwise. The latter interpretation is reinforced by the fact that the requiem takes place alongside what is clearly an ‘invented tradition’: that is the growing tendency for Swedish families to visit the graves of their family members over the same weekend. Together, they light candles and place them around the grave along with wreaths made of pine tree branches and cones. The combination is striking and sits uneasily alongside strong versions of the secularization thesis.</p>
<p>My point is the following. If we are to grasp the nature of vicarious religion in even the most secular corners of Europe, we will require a more developed sociological imagination than is frequently the case.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0021140013484432">20</xref></sup></p>

<title>Romania<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0021140013484432">21</xref></sup></title>
<p>Romania offers a different combination of factors. Like the former East Germany, it was part of the communist bloc, but unlike East Germany, religion has remained strong in this corner of Europe. Romania, moreover, is overwhelmingly Orthodox, a form of Christianity in which the notion of symphonia (a system of co-reciprocity) underpins the close relations between church and state. Such relations are considered normal in this part of Europe, where autocephalous churches lend themselves easily to national definition. It should not be assumed, however, that all Orthodox churches attract the levels of attachment that are found in Romania; Bulgaria, for example, is considerably more secular. The point to grasp is that each ‘story’ is distinctive and depends to a considerable extent on the history of the country in question.</p>
<p>The analysis presented in the early part of this chapter was initially worked out with reference to western (Catholic) Christianity. Would it apply in a part of Europe which has evolved rather differently? Specifically, Orthodox populations have not experienced the Renaissance, the Reformation, the scientific revolution, the Enlightenment and the Romantic revival, all of which are pivotal moments in the making of (western) Europe. Further east there has been an equally formative, but rather different evolution, within which the ebb and flow of Islam has been of greater significance. Its imprint can still be seen. In Romania, for example, there is a small but significant Muslim population in the Black Sea area, which has been there for centuries. It has nothing to do with recent immigration. Catholic and Protestant minorities also exist but are largely associated with ethnic groups (notably a significant Hungarian population, who found themselves inside Romania following the redrawing of national boundaries after World War 1).</p>
<p>The Orthodox churches of east Europe are nonetheless similar to their western counterparts in the sense that they are not only historically dominant but are territorially defined at every level of society. In Romania, this dominance continues. It is easily documented in terms of a comprehensive infrastructure and abundant personnel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0021140013484432">22</xref></sup> Both, moreover, are growing: new churches are under construction and the age-profile of Orthodox priests is markedly different from that discovered further west. The notion of vicarious religion is equally resonant. Relatively speaking, the Orthodox Church is a trusted institution in Romanian society, though less so than it used to be. Retrospective assessments of the role of the Church during the Cold War are central to this ambivalence, as is evidence of continuing corruption among the clergy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0021140013484432">23</xref></sup> That said, levels of belief and practice remain high by European standards. An additional element should also be noted: the cultural and artistic capital of the Romanian Church is not only well developed, but is (justly) a source of national pride.</p>
<p>Changes, however, are taking place. An open border since 1990 has meant the arrival of new forms of religious life, among them innovative forms of Protestantism. At the same time, existing forms of ‘dissent’ have been able to affirm their presence. A recent doctoral thesis looked in detail at the consequences of this situation in a small village in the South of Romania.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0021140013484432">24</xref></sup> In this village, the majority of the population are Orthodox, as expected. In terms of practice, however, the situation looks rather different. Approximately 400 Adventists attend church every Saturday in three separate congregations, as do approximately 200 Baptists on Sundays (in two congregations). This compares with the 200 or so people who regularly attend religious services in the two Orthodox churches. Interestingly, Ionete suggests that the relatively few Orthodox people who do practise their religion on a regular basis also regard themselves as a ‘minority,’ in the sense that their behaviour is distinct from their less assiduous co-religionists.</p>
<p>Such figures invite reflection regarding the norms of religious life in Romania. Equally thought-provoking are the attitudes of the local population to each other. A significant ambiguity emerges in this respect. At one and the same time, the Adventist minority evokes both mistrust and respect (as indeed do the Baptists). On the one hand, these individuals are closely watched; on the other, more is expected of them. Specifically, conduct (or more accurately misconduct) which is taken for granted in the wider population is carefully noted on the grounds that Adventists should know better. Hence the following paradox: members of minority groups set public standards of behaviour despite the fact that they are regarded with suspicion. Also worth noting is the readiness with which Adventists, in particular, have responded to post-communist economic life. The reason is clear: their insistence on observing the Sabbath (Saturday) during the communist period excluded them from any kind of ‘official’ employment. In order to survive, they were obliged to develop alternative, currently very marketable, skills.</p>
<p>It would be unwise to extrapolate from a limited case study in one village. This is only one piece in a complicated jigsaw. László Fosztó provides another, drawing on fieldwork undertaken in Transylvania, a very different part of Romania. The focus in this case is the conversion to Pentecostalism of significant sections of the Roma population—noting that Pentecostalism is now the fourth largest religious group in Romania.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0021140013484432">25</xref></sup> In an interesting contribution to a collected volume, Fosztó sets the religious choices of the Roma community against the long-term evolution of religion and power in Romania.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0021140013484432">26</xref></sup> Once again, his conclusions give pause for thought. There are undoubtedly signs of change in the religious profile of Romania, but the process is uneven. Religious minorities are growing, but they are also harassed, notably with respect to the ownership of buildings. And given the close (almost organic) relationship between the Orthodox Church and the Romanian state, alongside the ethno-religious identities of the Hungarian communities, it would be seriously misleading to describe the current state of affairs as a market in religion.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>What can be said in conclusion? It is abundantly clear that the patterns of religious activity vary considerably across Europe. This is so in the heartland of the continent as well as at the periphery. I would suggest, however, that the factors set out in the first section of this article cover the range of questions that need to be asked in each case. That the answers differ is not the principal point. Tellingly, even the more extreme examples set out in the second section are recognizably variations on the European theme. They ‘stretch’ the framework that I have elaborated, but they do not stretch it to breaking point.</p>

<p>In this respect, Ireland is very similar to Poland and to Québec. Polish identity was sustained by means of its elision with Catholicism at a time when Poland as a nation ceased to exist (in the late 19th century).
