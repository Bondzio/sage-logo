<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Preparing all teachers to meet the educational needs of diverse students has been termed a demographic imperative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538192711435561">Lowenstein, 2009</xref>). This need is especially manifested when one considers the growth of the Spanish-speaking Latino population in U.S. public schools and their well-documented academic underachievement. Currently, nearly 80% of emerging bilingual students<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1538192711435561">1</xref></sup> in U.S. K-12 schools speak Spanish as a first language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538192711435561">Kindler, 2002</xref>). While quite heterogeneous in makeup, it is noteworthy that 67% of those who identify themselves as Latinos in the United States are of Mexican heritage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538192711435561">Ramírez &amp; Cruz, 2002</xref>), with a significant number of the school-age Latino children being U.S.-born. In Colorado, where teachers in this study work and teach, the Latino population has grown 160% since 1987 and Latinos now comprise 28% of all students. Furthermore, 85% of Colorado’s second language learners speak Spanish as a native language. For obvious reasons, preparing Colorado teachers to meet the demographic imperative necessitates a focus on Spanish-speaking Mexican heritage students.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to explore teachers’ reactions and reflections to a cross-linguistic writing simulation held during a teaching and learning experience in México. This study is unique in that it was conducted on a diverse group of U.S. teachers who were participating in a Study in México Program as part of their master’s program in bilingual/English as a second language education (ESL) and, therefore, had the double effect of being sensitized to issues of cultural and linguistic diversity through both the in situ experiences of being in México and the simulation itself.</p>

<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538192711435561">Lowenstein (2009)</xref> suggests that teacher preparation programs need to include the following components if they are to address the demographic imperative. These are</p>
<list id="list1-1538192711435561" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Field-based experiences in diverse settings;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reflective teaching as an opportunity to express through dialogue and in writing their developing knowledge and skills related to teaching culturally and linguistically diverse learners;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A view that teachers are learners who bring a variety of resources to their work with diverse students and not deficient learners when it comes to studying issues of diversity.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Included in our definition of preparing teachers to teach Mexican heritage Spanish-speaking children is knowledge, skills, and dispositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538192711435561">Hoover, Klingner, Baca, &amp; Patton, 2008</xref>). There is a need for teachers to develop a knowledge and understanding of their own cultural, class, and linguistic identities and those of their students so they become responsive and competent educators of diverse learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538192711435561">Pray &amp; Marx, 2010</xref>). Teacher preparation programs must also help teachers to develop the skills to incorporate this knowledge base into the curriculum and pedagogy used with diverse learners. Finally, the preparation of teachers requires that they develop the dispositions to respect and affirm the cultural and linguistic capital that diverse students bring to the classroom and build on them to promote successful achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538192711435561">Hoover et al., 2008</xref>). Nurturing these dispositions should also enable teachers to advocate for their students and families as they learn to navigate the school system.</p>
<p>One venue for enhancing and improving teacher preparation for teaching Mexican heritage students is a study in México program. Research in general has established the value of international study for expanding teacher awareness, attitudes, and knowledge about diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538192711435561">Clark &amp; Flores, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538192711435561">Dantas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538192711435561">Escamilla, Aragon, &amp; Franquiz, 2009</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538192711435561">Ferrence &amp; Bell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538192711435561">Marx &amp; Pray, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538192711435561">Pray &amp; Marx, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538192711435561">Nguyen-Le, Hopewell, Escamilla, Aragon, &amp; Escamilla., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538192711435561">Quezada &amp; Alfaro, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1538192711435561">Stachowski &amp; Sparks, 2007</xref>). This is particularly relevant given the demographic imperative described above.</p>
<p>While the research is promising, there remains a need to understand how to structure learning opportunities within these international study programs to understand how these experiences are interpreted and given meaning by program participants and which experiences or combination of experiences are the most powerful in developing teachers’ ability to reflect, interpret, and dialogue about their learning and professional growth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538192711435561">Marx and Pray (2011)</xref> in a qualitative study examined White teacher educator students’ development of empathy while participating in a study abroad program in México that incorporated living with host families and coursework in English as a second language and Spanish for teachers. Teacher educator students were asked to reflect on their daily experiences through writing daily reflective journals. While the students levels of empathy for the challenges emerging bilingual learners encounter in the United States increased, the authors highlight the importance of ensuring issues of race, culture, and language be incorporated directly in the program, as opportunities to reflect through journals alone did not suffice to develop racial empathy for emerging bilingual learners. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538192711435561">Dantas (2007)</xref> emphasizes the importance of international experiences as such experiences extend teachers’ theoretical knowledge when they are provided with guided opportunities for reflection and examination of assumptions and beliefs about self and others, through socioculturally situated learning experiences and frameworks.</p>
<p>This study reports on the utilization of a simulation experience in the context of a Study in México Program. We were particularly interested in in-service teachers’ understandings of, reflections on, and responses to issues of teaching and learning a second language and multiculturalism. We used simulation as an instructional strategy to promote their reflection on those issues. We see simulation as an instructional tool that has the power of recreating aspects of reality for the purpose of “gaining information, clarifying values, understanding other cultures or developing a skill” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538192711435561">Cruz &amp; Patterson, 2005</xref>, p. 43). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538192711435561">Petranke, Corey, and Black (1992)</xref>, simulations provide three levels of learning through participation, debriefing, and reflecting through writing. <italic>Participation</italic> in simulations can effectively stimulate the development of multicultural and mulitlinguistic awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538192711435561">Cruz &amp; Patterson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538192711435561">Merryfield, 1995</xref>) as well as a better understanding of ourselves and one another. It may help in-service teachers to discover that they can best reach their students if they understand the challenges they go through in the process of learning a second language. <italic>Debriefing</italic>, a form of interpersonal negotiation, might afford students the possibility of grappling with issues of multiculturalism and second language acquisition. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538192711435561">Bruner (1986)</xref> explains, “if one is arguing about social ‘realities’ like democracy or equity [. . .], the reality is not the thing, not in the head but in the act of arguing and negotiating the meaning of such concepts” (p. 122). As students constructed meaning together through debriefing about their experiences in the simulation, we expected that they would also broaden their understandings about teaching and learning in diverse classrooms. We believe that <italic>written reflections</italic> might also be a valuable way in which students can add another layer of understanding to the events experienced during the simulation. Written reflections can be a space where students bring their thinking and theorizing about second language learning and multiculturalism together with instructional approaches. For this study, we were particularly interested in examining how the use of these three levels of learning during the simulation (participation, written reflection, and debriefing) enhanced students’ understanding of the complexities of teaching diverse learners in a variety of contexts, and in how these experiences affect their views of second language teaching, learning, and multiculturalism.</p>
<p>When conducting this study, it was hoped that the cross-linguistic simulation experience in México would provide the context for program participants to</p>
<list id="list2-1538192711435561" list-type="order">

<p>The program combines graduate-level coursework with a teaching field experience. The courses offered (Methods and Materials in Bilingual Education and Curriculum for Multicultural Education or Practicum in Multicultural, Bilingual, and ESL Education) give teachers a total of six units of graduate credit. All teachers participating in the study in México program are required to take the course “Methods and Materials in Bilingual Education.” Four weeks prior to the field experience in Mexican public schools, students begin their preparatory coursework while still in the United States. As part of their field experience in this course, teachers spend 1.5 hr per day in a public elementary classroom in México. In pairs and triads, teachers spend 45 min teaching English as a foreign language to students and they observe Mexican teachers teach the Mexican curriculum for the remaining time. Two times during the program, teachers are observed by a university professor who provides them with specific feedback about their teaching.</p>
<p>The program is designed to provide in-service teachers with the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to effectively teach emerging bilingual students, especially Mexican heritage students. The courses include different learning experiences that help students develop a strong knowledge base on theories and research related to best practices for teaching emerging bilingual students, engage in critical discussions about issues of structural inequities, discrimination, institutional racism, White privilege, and language program development, among others. For this study, we focus specifically on the responses and reflection generated among in-service teachers as a result of their participation in a cross-linguistic writing simulation.</p>
<sec id="section5-1538192711435561">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data collected include written responses to a Spanish writing prompt, written reflections, a transcription of the debrief session after they finished the writing tasks, and participant questionnaires. Teachers completed a questionnaire asking about their demographics, teaching position and experience, education, bilingualism, endorsements, and the content of professional development sessions they have attended. Triangulation of multiple sources of data enabled us to minimize bias in our findings and interpretations. Data were collected during the “Methods and Materials in Bilingual/Multicultural Education” class at the end of the 1st week of the program. Teachers had been in México for almost a week, had been teaching ESL lessons for 4 days, and had multiple opportunities to interact in Spanish, thereby creating an opportune time for a simulation. Many of the teachers were dealing with saturation point issues related to second language acquisition and cultural unfamiliarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1538192711435561">Saville-Troike, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Data collection procedures were as follows: Teachers were given oral and written directions (all in Spanish) to write to a prompt for 10 min. The prompt, <italic>Escribe sobre tu experiencia favorita en Puebla</italic> (Write about your favorite experience in Puebla), was written on the board of the classroom along with the following information: <italic>Nombre</italic> (name), <italic>10/6/10</italic> (date as written in Spanish), and the time the writing task was to begin and end. After the directions were given, one teacher asked in Spanish, <italic>Podemos escribir en inglés?</italic> (Can we write in English?). We answered, <italic>Como puedas</italic> (however you can). Another teacher asked, “Can I translate the instructions for my friends?” We answered, “No.” As the teachers wrote, we circulated around the room. After 10 min, writing samples were collected and teachers were asked (in English) to write a reflection about what happened and how they felt about it. We also collected these reflection papers. We then had teachers do a turn and talk for 5 min, reflecting on the simulation experience. Following, we facilitated a whole group debriefing about the simulation, which we videotaped and transcribed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1538192711435561">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed by two authors (Butvilofsky and Escamilla), using constant comparative methods of qualitative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538192711435561">Glaser, 1965</xref>). Analysis of data using this method involves a combination of “observing what is going on, talking in rather loose sharing fashion with people in the situation, and reading some form of document that they have written” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538192711435561">Glaser, 1965</xref>, p. 436). The constant comparative method allows for joint coding and analysis of data and, while inductive, it is designed for provisional testing and positing of hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538192711435561">Glaser, 1965</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538192711435561">2004</xref>). Comparisons in this method are between general ideas and concepts that lead to hypothesis formation but not necessarily to tightly grounded categories. We used open coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1538192711435561">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>) to tentatively describe the trends that emerged from students’ written reflections and the transcription of the debriefing session. Then, we grouped together similarly coded data to create more refined categories. Three main categories emerged from the data: affect and emotion; cognitive resources; and relation to school and teaching experiences. We discussed differences identified in our coding of the data until we arrived at an agreement based on the available evidence.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1538192711435561">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>To address how teachers responded to the simulation, writing prompt responses were first analyzed and coded for language use (Spanish and/or English) and second by what they chose to write about. Of the 57 written responses, 30 (52%) were written in English, and 27 (48%) in Spanish. Of the 27 teachers who chose to write in Spanish, 11 were Latino and 15 were White. Interestingly, four self-identified Spanish/English bilingual teachers wrote in English. By giving permission to write in English, we recognize that we quite possibly limited the number of written Spanish responses, but we chose to allow teachers to write however they could as a means of simulating the concept that languages not used for instruction, are resources, and not barriers to student participation.</p>
<p>To address how teachers reflected on the simulation, we analyzed and coded teachers’ written reflections and responses during the debriefing session. Three major themes emerged from the written reflections and the subsequent debriefing session: affect and emotion; cognitive resources; and relation to school and teaching experiences. The percentage of how often each theme was identified in the reflections is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1538192711435561">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1538192711435561">3</xref>. Because of the linguistic and ethnic diversity of the teachers, results were disaggregated by self-reported bilingualism (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1538192711435561">Table 2</xref>) and by ethnicity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1538192711435561">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Theme 1: Affect or Emotion</title>
<p>Emotional responses included how teachers felt when they were asked to write in a language that they did not know or that they did not know well, and it also included empathy on the part of Spanish/English bilinguals toward their monolingual peers who were asked to do this assignment and could not. Seventy-four percent of the teachers reflected on the discomforting aspect of the simulation. Some of the emotions aroused by the simulation included feelings of anxiety, fear, confusion, doubt, failure, and anger. When the data were disaggregated, 82% of the White teachers wrote about the emotional aspect of the simulation. Teresa<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1538192711435561">2</xref></sup> wrote, “I felt frustration, anxiety, and a lot of fear. I was also slightly angry knowing that 1/3 of the class did understand and they immediately began the assignment.” Anxiety has been found to have both a debilitative and facilitative effect on an individual’s affective domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538192711435561">Brown, 1987</xref>). One teacher experienced effects of anxiety that were physical: “I experienced immediate feelings and body responses associated with test panic: stomach-clutching, chest contractions.” For some of the teachers, the emotional response to the simulation undermined their performance on the task, as David wrote in his reflection: “My writing was terrible, because I could not think clearly. All I could think about was that I was doing the assignment wrong. I was unable to effectively convey meaning. Even to this moment I am still worked up.” Another teacher reported an inability to “Get the words out” and yet for another teacher, she resigned to the task as she wrote, “What’s the use in trying?” And yet for a few teachers, the simulation brought a sense of “challenge” as they reported the infrequency with which they are required to write in Spanish. As was made evident in the teachers’ written reflections and the debrief session, feelings of distress during academic tasks has the potential to limit learning and opportunities to demonstrate understanding.</p>
<p>While many Spanish/English bilingual teachers felt confident and successful in accomplishing the task in Spanish, they demonstrated a great sense of empathy for their monolingual peers. Veronica, a White bilingual, felt for her fellow classmates as she wrote,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I felt normal for the first couple of minutes. I understood the language and the task at hand. I started feeling bad for my partner though, because she does not understand Spanish. I began to tell her what to do, but was told to be quiet. Being unable to help, created a sense of frustration for me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Emotional and psychological aspects of second language acquisition are frequently down played in ESL methods classes but the simulation brought out these emotions from both monolingual and bilingual teachers. More importantly, through this lived experience, teachers engaged in a conversation and self-reflection about the effects of emotional aspects on second language learning</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1538192711435561">
<title>Theme 2: Cognitive Processes</title>
<p>Reflections coded as cognitive processes included those responses where teachers discussed the strategies they used to understand the task. These included looking for cognates (<italic>experiencia</italic>/experience, <italic>favorita</italic>/favorite); trying to understand unknown words in context (e.g., <italic>sobre</italic>/about); looking for gestures and other nonlanguage cues to understand the task; drawing on prior knowledge of similar experiences in the United States (doing and administering writing prompts); and seeking peer assistance by looking around to see what others were doing, trying to copy, asking for assistance (asking peers about the task to be completed in Spanish by using English as the language of communication), and in some cases, even being unsure as to what to do after consulting peers. All but three of the monolingual teachers mentioned using at least one of the cognitive strategies to assist in comprehending the simulation’s writing task. Catherine, a monolingual English teacher, described many of the cognitive strategies identified in the following written reflection:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . I guessed that I was supposed to write about my favorite experience so far in Puebla. I inferred that was the right thing to do, because <italic>escribe</italic> looks like scribe, and everyone around me was writing. <italic>experiencia</italic> looks like experience, and <italic>favorito</italic> looks like favorite, I knew Puebla, and <italic>tu</italic> is you in French, so I guessed it was the same in Spanish.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to the processes listed above, some teachers mentioned the importance of having experiences with test-like situations, in which learners are accustomed to writing to a prompt for a given amount of time in silence, as indicated in this teacher’s reflection during the debriefing session:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We have all this schema for something like this, because we have all done something like this before. But what if Alan didn’t even have that so he kind of knew like the routine of doing this but, I cannot even imagine someone that came from another country who didn’t do free-writes on a prompt, they would have reacted worse because they would not have schema. So, I knew when Gwen asked me a question about what she should be doing and I couldn’t answer her, I thought, “Well, she will be fine because she has done something like this in class before.” so, I just thought that was kind of interesting how we all knew because we have a common background.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section10-1538192711435561">
<title>Theme 3: Relation to Teaching</title>
<p>The third theme was a reflection relating this simulation experience to teaching either in México or the United States. Within this theme, teachers reflected on both the emotional and affective aspects of learning for their students and the importance of improving their instructional practices to ensure the emerging bilingual learners in their classes succeed.</p>
<p>With regard to teaching in the United States, teachers’ reflections on the simulation indicated a heightened awareness that their own students also “feel lost, confused, overwhelmed, and frustrated.” “It allowed me to empathize with ELL students in the U.S. I felt really bad for all the students in the U.S. who struggle to succeed and express themselves, because there is not enough being done to support them.”</p>
<p>The majority of teachers were able to make connections between the simulation experience and their own teaching practices. The following excerpt illustrates this finding:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Do I do a good enough job for my emerging bilingual students? It makes me think about being a teacher, making sure that I have the attention of all my students before I go into a lesson, makes me think about: “Am I demonstrating the correct way on how I want my students to do it? Even though they may not understand, am I doing a enough good demonstration for all my kids to understand?” And that was the question that when you had us debrief they asked, “What does it make you think about your teaching?” And it makes me really question my teaching. It really makes me think about what I am doing as a teacher. Is it effective for all of my students? No matter what their level is or their ability is I need to make sure that I meet the needs of all my students.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The simulation seemed to have an even greater impact on teachers because they experienced the double effect of the simulation within the transnational context of being in México. Such transnational learning experiences have the potential to have profound effects on teachers’ pedagogical beliefs and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538192711435561">Olmedo, 2004</xref>). This transformation is reflected in the writing of another teacher:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I have felt a lot of frustration today with not understanding the language while I was at my school and this activity actually raised my level of frustration. I am really starting to comprehend how difficult the lives of my ELL [English language learning] students can be.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Included in this theme were reflections that indicated that requiring emerging bilingual learners to do everything in English is likely not allowing teachers to see their full potential but also “their personality [and] writing style”. Allowing students to write in either language relieves some stress and allows students “to focus on the task rather than the language.” With regard to teaching in México, teachers reflected on the difficulty children encountered in understanding straightforward and simple directions given in English and the many challenges faced in language teaching not often discussed in language methods classrooms or in schools.</p>

<sec id="section11-1538192711435561" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We begin our discussion of the findings with some general observations of this simulation followed by more detailed interpretation of each of the findings. It is noteworthy that the majority of teachers who participated in the debriefing were White. In fact, the majority of the teachers who spoke or wrote about the psychological and emotional impact of the simulation during the debriefing were White. In our endorsement classes at the university, we emphasize that second language learning is a complex phenomenon that includes several aspects such as linguistic, cognitive, sociocultural, psychological, and emotional. While we read and discuss each aspect, emphasis is placed on learning methods and strategies with lesser attention to the fact that learning a second language is also an emotional and psychological experience. Textbook discussions of the emotional side of language learning, while informative, do not provoke the kind of reflection that the simulation in the context of a foreign study program can evoke. These findings are consistent with recent research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538192711435561">Dantas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538192711435561">Marx &amp; Pray, 2011</xref>). The simulation evoked emotional responses even in the teachers who were bilingual and who themselves learned English as a second language. We were struck by the final comment in the debriefing session during which time one of our teachers said, “You should have to take into consideration people for whom English is their second language and the expectations are exactly for us to perform equally or above other people.” He went on to say that he needs time to think and process in Spanish even as he writes the multitude of papers in English he is required to do for the master’s program. He reinforced the psychological and emotional daily demands of being a second language learner and the stress involved in having your intelligence and ability always judged in a language you are still learning.</p>
<p>The simulation also afforded teachers the opportunity to reflect on the cognitive strategies that they could access to help them understand and write in an unfamiliar language. They observed the power of cognates, of knowing the “schema of school,” of the use of peer assistance, and the use of sheltering techniques to make the simulation comprehensible. We had hoped for this outcome. More importantly, however, they also reflected on the limitations of these techniques. For example, even though the assignment was made comprehensible, it was not less stressful for them and still produced a fair amount of anxiety even though they knew it was a simulation. One teacher said,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was able to get the cognates in the sentence so I understood what you wanted . . . I came to the decision, “well I want to at least write something,” so I did it in English, but I was so concentrated on the fact that I was not doing the assignment correctly, it really affected my writing. I was scribbling out and having to reform sentences, I was not able to actually concentrate on what the task was.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another teacher said,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was a mess from the very beginning. I have been very happy in Puebla, practicing my Spanish and I was wicked excited when I could buy batteries without any translation help. And for just three seconds, when you were like talking in Spanish, I thought ok I’ll try this . . . I have been having fun and then you said, <italic>Escribe la fecha</italic>. (write the date), so I wrote 6/10/10, and then you wrote 10/6/2010 and from that point on I was done and I just didn’t understand. So, I had <italic>experiencia, favorita</italic>, (experience, favorite) and <italic>Puebla</italic>, then I was like, “What if <italic>sobre</italic> (about) means less favorite and I am doing the exact opposite of the assignment?” . . . I wanted to ask what <italic>sobre</italic> means but I wasn’t going to understand the answer anyways. . . . I never, not even for one second, did I think that what I was doing was remotely correct.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To restate, teachers were able to articulate that even with support such as sheltering, understanding and producing in a second language is challenging. Furthermore, the fact that they articulated their insecurities, potential misunderstandings, and frustrations is something they acknowledged that their emerging bilingual learners most likely feel but never have opportunity to discuss in their classrooms in the United States. Such situated learning experiences with guided opportunities for reflections demonstrate the potential in changing teachers’ “dispositions and assumptions towards culturally, racially, linguistically, and socioeconomic diverse students, families, and communities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538192711435561">Dantas, 2007</xref>, p. 77).</p>
<p>With regard to relating the simulation to their teaching environments in the United States, there was evidence that teachers were making these connections. We had hoped for this outcome, but added to our discussion, an event occurred during the simulation that led the debriefing in an unanticipated but most interesting direction. As we were giving the direction about writing to the prompt, one teacher asked if they could have permission to write in English. The response as stated above was to write “however you can.” While we know that this possibly affected our outcomes in that some teachers immediately abandoned writing in Spanish and did not even try to produce a sentence or a few words in Spanish, this might be considered a limitation of our study, but we would like to argue that in fact it was a significant finding. First, emerging bilingual learners in U.S. schools rarely ask and are almost never given permission to write in their first language when given a prompt in English. That the teachers in our class would even ask for this type of accommodation (one which they most likely would not give their own students) represents the exercise of a type of privilege that would likely not be asked for or granted to second language learners in the United States. We regret that in the process of debriefing this activity we did not pursue this issue from a more critical perspective. By allowing the teachers to write in English we acknowledged and valued that a first language is a resource and scaffold to second language acquisition and not a barrier. However, we did not use this opportunity to engage our teachers in a deeper dialogue about when and how we allow children to use their first language and when and how we gently but firmly encourage them to write in their second language. We take from this that we missed an opportunity for critical discussion and we will use this to improve our own skills at conducting this simulation in future Study in México classes.</p>

<title>Significance</title>
<p>The findings from this study are significant to the field of teacher education and bilingual education. Because of the demographic imperative in U.S. public schools, teacher education programs, universities, and schools must provide teachers with opportunities to develop the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to meet the needs of the increasingly diverse student population. One opportunity to develop these skills is a program such as the Study in México program described above. While some may see this type of program as effective but optional, we argue that we need to consider how we can make such program mandatory for teachers preparing to work with Latino students in the United States. At a cost of about US$2,500 per person (which was the 2010 program cost), the Study in México program is not prohibitive from a cost perspective and given the 2-week duration of the program, it is also not unreasonable in terms of time commitment on the part of teachers.</p>
<p>We would also argue, however, that the positive impact of this program is not simply its setting but its pedagogy. The simulation experiences, like the one reported here, in combination with a study in México experience is a promising teaching strategy to encourage teachers to reflect in critical ways about the challenges of learning a second language as well as to utilize, from a personal perspective, teaching methodologies to facilitate understanding and producing in an unfamiliar language. The simulation experience also helped teachers to recognize the benefits of using the native language as a resource for learning. The setting of the study enhanced the simulation and made it much more relevant than a similar simulation would have been in the United States.</p>
<p>Especially significant is the fact that the simulation appeared to have a greater impact (particularly in the affective domain) on the White teachers in the program. Given the preponderance of White teachers in the field of education and the national concern about how to help them be more reflective practitioners and more capable of understanding the challenges that emerging bilingual learners face, this type of simulation has a great deal of potential.</p>
