<p>The motivation of this research is to non-invasively monitor the wrist tendon’s displacement and velocity, for purposes of controlling a prosthetic device. This feasibility study aims to determine if the proposed technique using Doppler ultrasound is able to accurately estimate the tendon’s instantaneous velocity and displacement. This study is conducted with a tendon mimicking experiment consisting of two different materials: a commercial ultrasound scanner, and a reference linear motion stage set-up. Audio-based output signals are acquired from the ultrasound scanner, and are processed with our proposed Fourier technique to obtain the tendon’s velocity and displacement estimates. We then compare our estimates to an external reference system, and also to the ultrasound scanner’s own estimates based on its proprietary software. The proposed tendon motion estimation method has been shown to be repeatable, effective and accurate in comparison to the external reference system, and is generally more accurate than the scanner’s own estimates. After establishing this feasibility study, future testing will include cadaver-based studies to test the technique on the human arm tendon anatomy, and later on live human test subjects in order to further refine the proposed method for the novel purpose of detecting user-intended tendon motion for controlling wearable prosthetic devices.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Normal hand function can be disrupted by trauma or disease to the fingers or hand, which can result in a range of hand function impairment from total loss, to lack of mobility, to stiffness. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912445841">1</xref></sup> approximately 94% of all amputations (non-fatal) involve fingers. This amounts to approximately 30,000 finger amputations in the US annually, often the result of workplace or home injury due to machinery accidents. In some cases, if the limbs become injured or amputated, the body’s biological signals remain intact to various degrees, and could still be measured.</p>
<p>Researchers often investigate new ways to help injured patients improve their hand mobility with assistive or prosthetic devices, which are usually controlled through these residual biological signals. This work proposes a method to measure the remaining tendon motion within the lower arm/wrist of an injured person, for the new purpose of controlling a wearable assistive device or powered hand prosthesis. Many advanced multi degree-of-freedom (DOF) prosthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912445841">2</xref></sup> and exoskeleton systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912445841">3</xref></sup> have been developed; however, the inherent difficulty lies in controlling them, since multi-channel user intention is difficult to measure. Prostheses are typically controlled by surface electromyography (EMG) signals, but problems due to sensor crosstalk and spatial resolution limit surface EMG to measure one or two independent signals. Using the tendon displacement or velocity bio-signal from the natural body is an elegant solution to measure a person’s intention/desire to move the fingers in their hand, since tendons are attached to individual joints in the fingers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912445841">4</xref></sup> Measurement of tendon displacement and velocity also offers an interesting way to measure multiple independent motion signals (channels) from a user. The tendons responsible for flexion in the fingers are located in the same physical region and they pass under the wrist during motion with a maximum displacement in the longitudinal direction of the lower arm. Due to these physical characteristics, it may be possible to use ultrasonic measurements to simultaneously detect multiple flexor tendons in real time. This would allow for sensing of user intention in order to classify the desired hand grip, thus enabling the control of a wearable device. Recent studies have investigated alternative control methods for powered prostheses. In particular, Chen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912445841">5</xref></sup> have recently shown the feasibility of using a hybrid one-dimensional (A-Scan) ultrasound and EMG system to detect the thickening forearm muscle during contraction in order to control a powered prosthesis.</p>
<p>Other clinical researchers have measured the tendon’s residual displacements in the lower arm in order to assess the functional capabilities of the injured fingers and hands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912445841">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912445841"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912445841"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912445841"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912445841"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912445841">11</xref></sup> Their methods for this estimation of residual tendon displacement in the lower arm are done using an indirect method. This consists of measuring the joint rotation angles of the fingers while they are flexed and extended, and also by measuring various dimensional parameters of the finger joints, such as tendon-to-joint distances, joint thickness and joint-center to joint-center distances. All of this measured data is then used with one of three hand biomechanical models developed by Landsmeer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912445841">12</xref></sup> However, the applicability of the Landsmeer models has been debated and there is a lack of consensus on which model best predicts tendon displacement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912445841">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912445841"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912445841"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912445841"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912445841">10</xref></sup> The difficulty is that the Landsmeer models can only provide general estimations since the model is based on population averages, and may not correspond directly to the actual tendon displacement of a particular patient. Some researchers estimate patient hand parameters using calipers to measure around the skin surface of the intact finger joint, or used averaged data from other publications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912445841">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912445841">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912445841">13</xref></sup> Since hand anatomical dimensions are highly individualistic, such indirect estimates will affect the accuracy of the biomechanical models.</p>
<p>Other clinical researchers employ the use of an off-the-shelf commercial ultrasound scanner that features Pulsed-Wave (PW) Doppler and Color Doppler Imaging (CDI) functions, which can reveal information about tissues, organs and flow estimations. Unfortunately, the majority of affordable commercial Doppler ultrasound machines are factory calibrated for higher velocity targets such as blood flow. As a result, estimation of displacement and velocity for low velocity tissues, such as tendon motion, may have accuracy problems due to the signal filters used to calibrate for the higher velocities. Furthermore, many off-the-shelf ultrasound machines do not allow for any raw data access by users, which makes it difficult to capture and custom-process the received Doppler-shifted signals in real time. To address this issue, one research group has acquired the Doppler data at an earlier processing stage by altering an affordable commercial machine using an analog/digital (A/D) converter, and creating a signal processing algorithm in order to measure the total tendon displacement during finger rotation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912445841">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411912445841"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411912445841"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912445841"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912445841">18</xref></sup> However, their technique has shown issues with resolution which may be attributed to the frequency of the transducer used, noise from the A/D converter, as well as error accumulations from their choice of a zero-crossing signal processing algorithm. Although cost-effective, it has been reported that zero-crossing detectors (ZCD) have significant limitations when dealing with low velocities or a small sample region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411912445841">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411912445841">20</xref></sup> Furthermore, these non-invasive studies did not reliably compare their estimated tendon displacement to an external reference, i.e. an independent reference measurement technique that verifies their estimation method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411912445841">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912445841"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912445841">18</xref></sup> In one study, the estimated tendon displacement was indirectly compared to one of the Landsmeer models; however, for the reasons discussed above, such a comparison may not be accurate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912445841">18</xref></sup> The ideal techniques to directly compare an estimated tendon motion with an external reference are cadaver-based studies (since the cadaver tendon motion can be measured independently of the ultrasound method), or experiments that mimic human-hand tendon motion. In another experiment, a cadaver hand was imaged with an ultrasound scanner using the ZCD processing method, while the cadaver finger was passively rotated in order to collect tendon displacements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912445841">14</xref></sup> In another cadaver study using ultrasound, the tendon was actuated by a linear stage to measure the difference between the average peak velocity of the tendon and its surrounding synovial sheath, for the purposes of carpal tunnel research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912445841">21</xref></sup> The latter study relied on the on-board software of the ultrasound machine to estimate the average peak velocity. However, as previously discussed, the commercial ultrasound machine used was factory calibrated for higher velocity targets and may have accuracy problems due to the signal filters used to calibrate for the higher velocities.</p>
<p>This research is aimed at developing a direct ultrasound-based method to provide non-invasive and accurate estimations of the instantaneous velocity and displacement of a tendon. To our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate the instantaneous displacement, velocity and peak velocity using PW Doppler on a moving tendon. This method may be useful to objectify tendon malfunctions in clinical studies, as well as aid in pre- and post-operative tendon repair. However, our motivation is to use these estimations of tendon motion for the goal of controlling assistive prosthetics. Doppler-based methods and hardware for tendon tracking are better suited to minimize computational load, power consumption, hardware complexity, and overall size, which are important requirements for wearable prosthesis. We use a tendon-mimicking experiment for the feasibility study, because it is able to non-invasively compare our proposed technique to an external reference for verification. This is of significant importance because incorporating an external reference with a live subject would be difficult without surgically-invasive procedures, an extensive X-ray based reference, or an MRI reference. Alternatively, the use of a cadaver specimen is appropriate after a feasibility study is established. Therefore, our tendon mimicking experiment is an important pre-requisite in order to determine the proof-of-concept accuracy of our estimation technique. Subsequently, we will pursue studies involving actual human tendon motion detection on custom-built ultrasound hardware. Our feasibility study employs an off-the-shelf commercial ultrasound machine that features PW Doppler, combined with our custom algorithm, to acquire and process the data of a moving tendon. The inherent difficulty of obtaining accurate tendon displacements and velocities using a commercial off-the-shelf machine motivates our research, and the need to be able to acquire the Doppler-shifted signal at an early (pre-filter) processing stage within the architecture of the commercial system using a custom algorithm.</p>
<p>In this paper, we first describe the experimental set-up consisting of a mimicking lamb tendon actuated by a linear motion stage. We then describe our proposed audio-based Fourier analysis technique to estimate the time-series velocity and displacement curves, as well as the average peak velocity of the moving tendon. These estimated curves and velocities are compared to the motion of the linear stage (external reference motion) to which the tendon is securely attached. Additionally, the average peak velocity and the total displacement of the moving tendon are also compared to the estimates from the on-board software of the commercial ultrasound scanner used.</p>

<title>Experimental set-up</title>
<p>The experimental set-up consists of two sub-systems: the linear motion stage assembly, and the ultrasound transducer assembly as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912445841">Figure 1</xref>. The purpose of this mechanical set-up is to simulate the action of a tendon moving within the lower arm. It allows the human-mimicking lamb tendon to translate (move in its longitudinal direction) while under the ultrasound transducer, with a prescribed motion of the linear motion stage. A good analogy of the set-up is to think of a taut bow-string, where the tendon is like the string, and the bow consists of two clamps at either end keeping the tendon in tension. These two clamps, in turn, are mounted on the linear motion stage. As the linear stage and clamps move back and forth, the taut tendon (string) moves exactly with it. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912445841">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the linear stage assembly, which consists of: (d) one vice clamp fixed to the linear stage; (e) one vice clamp on two slider-rails; (f) the slider-rails; (g) the tendon-mimicking sample; (h) the digital force gauge; and (i) the tensioning screw rod. The tendon is tensioned by clamping the tendon at both ends using the two vice clamps, with their jaws lined with sandpaper. As the tensioning screw (i) is tightened, it pulls the digital force gauge (h) which, in turn, pulls the vice clamp on the slider-rails (e). Because one vice clamp is fixed to the linear stage, while the other slides on the slider-rails, the tendon becomes tensioned as the screw is tightened. The digital force gauge (American Weigh Scales) measures this tension since it is mechanically in series with the tendon, and displays the amount of tension in Newtons (N). For the experiment, the tendon is tensioned to a value of 2 N, which is a typical value in the human hand during free motion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411912445841">22</xref></sup> This was monitored during the experiment to ensure the tension did not change. In other works,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954411912445841">23</xref></sup> it has been reported that a tendon will stretch less than 1% of its load-free length at a tension of 2 N. It has also been reported that tendons can exhibit creep at constant loads applied for a duration of time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411912445841">24</xref></sup> Since we observed that our tendon tension was maintained at 2 N, it did not significantly stretch, or experience creep during the experiment. The linear motion stage is actuated by a stepper motor driving a lead screw with a 16 mm lead (4 start, 4 mm pitch, NSK). The stepper motor (model CRK 569BKP, Oriental Motor USA Corp.) is a micro-stepping system with a built-in controller and has the performance capability for our purpose.</p>

<p>The ultrasound transducer assembly consists of an adjustable holder assembly that holds the transducer while allowing for rotation and translation, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912445841">Figure 1</xref>. In addition, it has a gel pad holder that contains two solid gel pads (Aquaflex, Cone Instruments) through which the mimicking tendon slides. This is a sandwich configuration with a 2 cm thick solid gel pad on top, the tendon in the middle (lubricated with gel), and a 2 cm thick solid gel pad underneath. The transducer is set on top of the upper gel pad at an angle (cut within the upper pad) in order to ensure a good measurement angle between the tendon and the transducer. The mimicking tendons used in this experiment are a metal flat bar and a lamb tendon. The Doppler data acquired by this experimental set-up can reasonably represent the Doppler data collected from an actual human tendon sliding within the arm. This is because the typical Doppler data of a human tendon sliding within the arm uses an average speed of sound in tissue for its calculations, regardless of the tissue boundary dimensions (skin, fat, connective tissue and tendon). We employ a similar approach by using the average speed of sound in tissue, along with our gel pad tendon configuration to simulate the tendon sliding within the human arm.</p>
<p>The metal bar serves as a rigid reference, while the lamb tendon has been documented to most closely represent the properties of a human tendon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411912445841">25</xref></sup> The dimensions of the metal steel flat bar are 3 mm thick, 13 mm wide and 178 mm long with two welded cubes on either side for gripping ease within the clamps. The lamb tendon is 178 mm long with an average diameter of 6 mm, and was ordered especially from a local butcher. The tendon was first dissected from its adhering insertions to the leg bone and was then prepared and stored in a similar fashion as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411912445841">25</xref></sup> The tendon used is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912445841">Figure 3</xref>.

<title>The ultrasound machine</title>
<p>In order to acquire the Doppler-shifted signal from a moving tendon, a typical off-the-shelf PW Doppler ultrasound scanner, the LogicScan 128 by TelemedTM, is used. The LogicScan scanner is a stand-alone system that transmits and receives sound waves with a 12 MHz linear-array transducer, processes the signal, and displays the results on a PC via USB. Using the PC, Telemed’s on-board software (EchoWave II) can be accessed for spectral processing and displaying purposes. The exact nature of LogicScan’s pre-processing and spectral processing is unknown because it is proprietary and not disclosed by the manufacturer. However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912445841">Figure 4</xref> represents a typical description of the signal processing phases that would occur within the machine. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912445841">Figure 4</xref>, the ultrasound transducer transmits pulses of sound waves at the given 12 MHz carrier frequency, to the moving tendon between the gel pads. The signals are intercepted by the moving tendon, and reflected back to the transducer, as shown in box A of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912445841">Figure 4</xref>. These received (echo) signals are amplified and demodulated since the total received signal contains the Doppler shifted frequencies and the carrier frequency. Only the echo data from a desired region of interest (sample region) is needed, so the returning signal is ‘gated’. Gating refers to extracting only the received echoes that lie within a particular depth in the beam (or a particular range in time). The resulting pre-processed signal contains the Doppler-shifted frequency data of the moving sample region and is passed onto LogicScan’s EchoWave software for spectral processing and displaying phases (boxes C, D and E). Interestingly, the demodulated and filtered echo data from box B is simultaneously relayed to the PC’s speakers using the PC’s 2-channel soundcard (box F), since the moving tendon’s echo data is in the audible range. This is a traditional function of nearly all ultrasound machines, and has been used by doctors and technicians to ‘listen’ to heart motion or blood flow, as part of their patient examination. This audible signal output is important to the technique of this paper, as this is where we obtain the signal (box G). It is a direct representation of the Doppler shift frequencies, and can be displayed as a variation in amplitude over time. We describe how we use these Doppler shift frequencies in the next section. However, the LogicScan does not display the Doppler-shifted frequencies. Instead, the LogicScan software uses its spectral processing in order to find the frequency components of the signal in small time steps. The software then translates the Doppler frequencies into flow velocities using the Doppler equation</p>

<title>Proposed technique for data access and processing</title>
<p>To collect the data needed for this work, the demodulated and filtered audible output signal from the LogicScan is sampled by a sound card (SigmaTel) in the PC, at 44.1 kHz, as shown in box F in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912445841">Figure 4</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954411912445841">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954411912445841">27</xref></sup> The sound card has two channels, thus preserving the tendon’s flow-directional information moving towards or away from the transducer. This signal is transferred into Matlab™ and is first filtered with a 25-point moving average filter to reduce the noise by a factor of 5. Since a moving average filter alters the characteristics of the signal, discretion is used in choosing a suitable sample size. In order to determine the displacement of the moving object under the transducer, a Matlab™ script has been written to perform Fourier spectral analysis. This is accomplished by first separating the total acquired sampled signal into sections containing 512 samples each, and then applying a Hamming window to each section, to determine the Doppler shift frequencies in that section. As opposed to a rectangular window, a Hamming window is a type where the end data points in a window are tapered to zero in order to avoid discontinuities and reduce the mismatch with the next section of points. The number of Fourier transforms performed on each window directly affects the resulting frequency and time resolution on the spectrogram. Using the built-in Fourier transform function in Matlab<sup>TM</sup>, the script performs 4086 transforms per window using as given by</p>

<p>Because there are only 512 samples per window, the signal is zero-padded. In our case, this means that the 513th to the 4086th data points are zeros added to the end of the sampled signal in the window. This is done to ensure that we can obtain a higher frequency resolution in comparison to using only 512 Fourier transforms per window. The resulting frequency resolution is 10.8 Hz or, using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0954411912445841">equation (1)</xref>, the resolution is 1.38 mm/s. The velocity resolution is the minimum possible difference we can detect/resolve in the output velocity curves, based on our chosen parameters. It is also efficient to perform Fourier transforms based on a multiple of a power of 2 because it drastically reduces the number of computations performed. To improve the time resolution, each window is overlapped by 50%. Therefore, instead of the time resolution being 0.0116 seconds, the resolution becomes 0.0058 seconds.

<p>A low amplitude threshold filter can be used since there is mostly noise present in the range below –90 dB. A high-frequency threshold filter can also be used in the range 125–950 Hz, since the moving tendons Doppler frequency-shifted signal is in the lower frequencies of the audible range. This is evident when observing the spectrogram when the tendon was not moving. The resulting frequency spectrogram reveals the Doppler frequencies present at each time interval with a given PSD amplitude. These frequencies are converted to velocities using the Doppler equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0954411912445841">equation (1)</xref>). Only velocities over 25 mm/s (125 Hz) are used as previously discussed. This lower threshold is chosen because it is consistent with other reports that claim velocity measurements using PW Doppler ultrasound are not discernable from noise when the tissue speed is below 25 mm/s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912445841">21</xref></sup> We have also observed similar effects during our experiments. The frequency spectrogram also shows that there are several velocities present at each small time interval. These different velocities correspond to various things moving at different speeds within the sample region, such as other moving tissues, fluids, as well as the tendon. However, each of these velocity readings occurs with different ‘intensities’, where the intensity of a reading is a result of noise and the topography of the tissue and the tendon. What we require is only the velocity of the tendon, but we cannot be sure which of the several velocities present in each time interval best represents it. Therefore, the following assumption is made: since the tendon is such a large object, we presume that the signal generated by it is of relatively high intensity, whereas the signal generated by other smaller tissues, or moving fluids around the tendon, produce a much lower intensity. One good way in which to consolidate this information is to use a concept known as the intensity-weighted-mean-velocity (IWMV). The equation for IWMV is given as follows, and is applied to each small time interval</p>

<title>Experimental procedure</title>
<p><italic>Linear motion stage actuation</italic>, In order to perform the tendon motion experiment, the linear motion stage, carrying the clamps with the tensioned tendon, must be programmed to achieve the desired motion. The stage motion is controlled using a PC, which communicates with a hardware controller using a graphical terminal program (V1.92 Terminal, Braag). A program is written to command the motion stage to move back and forth a total of ten times (five times in each direction), with a prescribed acceleration, peak constant velocity, and deceleration. There is also a 0.25 s wait time between each change in direction. The stepper motor used has a torque considerably higher than that required for the motion of this experiment. Therefore, no skipping of steps will occur and the controller input velocity profile is assumed to be equal to the output velocity profile for the stepper motor.</p>
<p>The linear stage velocity profiles for acceleration, peak velocity, and deceleration are determined with basic physics using the available tendon length of 58 mm and the desired peak velocity values of 50 mm/s, 75 mm/s and 100 mm/s. These peak velocities were specifically chosen to represent typical speeds of motion for tendons in the human arm during gripping activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912445841">21</xref></sup> For example, the complete 10-cycle velocity profile for the 75 mm/s peak velocity experiment, is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912445841">Figure 5</xref>. The ten profiles show the back and forth motion of the linear stage, with the odd numbered profiles representing motion in the forward direction, while the even numbered profiles represent motion in the reverse direction.</p>

<title>Data collection procedure</title>
<p>Before collecting any data, the transducer must be properly positioned so that the sample region contains the mimicking tendon. Positioning of the transducer is done by moving the tendon under the LogicScan’s Color-Doppler function that highlights the moving areas on-screen using the EchoWave software. Once the proper position of the transducer is established, the experiment can proceed. For one experiment, the mimicking tendon is displaced by the linear stage through a 10-cycle motion profile, as described in the previous section. Six experiments were conducted with the two sample materials, representing a tendon. One group of experiments (A, B, and C) are done with the metal flat bar serving as a reference material. The other group (D, E and F) are done with a lamb tendon. This information is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411912445841">Table 1</xref>. As the linear stage is moved back and forth producing the 10-cycle motion profiles, the sound card simultaneously captures the Doppler-shifted ultrasound signal using a data acquisition script in Matlab™. This signal is a direct representation of the Doppler shift frequencies (and flow velocities), and is recorded as a variation in amplitude over time as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411912445841">Figure 6(a)</xref> for all ten profiles.

<title>Verification with the external reference</title>
<p>It is important to compare the estimates from the proposed technique against known reference values to test the accuracy of our technique. Since the tendon is a moving object that follows a velocity profile, the question becomes what values would serve as the best basis for comparison. We propose to compare: the peak velocity of motion, the time-series velocity (the velocity at each sample time interval), the time-series displacement (the displacement at each sample time interval), and the total displacement. For these experiments, the external reference is the linear stage motion profile, and hence, is referred to as the reference profile. The estimated velocity profile is obtained by processing the data acquired by the ultrasound transducer, using our proposed algorithm. Before the estimated profile can be compared to the reference profile, it must first be time synchronized with each other. The synchronization is done by calculating the time-shift difference at a given velocity value, between the estimated 10-cycle velocity profile and the 10-cycle reference profile.</p>
<p>To summarize the comparison results in a simple manner, we chose to use a ratio of the estimated values to the reference values. A ratio of close to 1 would represent a close match between the estimated profiles and the reference profiles for a given experiment number. The estimated average peak velocity in an experiment is also compared to the programmed peak velocity of the linear stage, as well as the estimated peak velocity from LogicScan’s on-board software. Also, the estimated velocity profile and reference velocity profile are integrated to find the displacement, and the ratios are obtained in a similar manner for comparison. The estimated total displacement for Experiments A, B and C from the metal tendon are also compared to the total displacement computed by the LogicScan’s ultrasound machine.</p>

<title>Peak velocity estimation for the metal flat bar</title>
<p>The first material tested using our proposed velocity estimation technique, was the metal flat bar. The estimated peak velocity for each profile in a given 10-cycle experiment is compared to the reference peak velocity from the linear stage. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411912445841">Figure 8</xref> illustrates an example comparison between a single estimated velocity profile (dotted black line) and a single reference profile (dotted blue line). The reference peak velocity is straightforward, since it is a flat line value of 75 mm/s corresponding to the peak linear stage speed, and occurs between time <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>3</sub> (pink bounding lines). However, the estimated tendon velocity varies over the same time interval. Therefore, we compute the average of the estimated tendon velocity between time <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>3</sub>, and refer to it as the estimated average peak velocity (APV). The reference peak velocity (RPV) and the estimated APV for forward and reverse motion are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954411912445841">Table 2</xref>. As can be seen from the table, the estimated APV is generally within 2 mm/s of the reference peak velocity. This shows that our estimate for the metal flat bar deviates from the reference value by 2.2% for Experiment A, 1.2% for Experiment B, and 2.3% for Experiment C.</p>

The results for the estimated average peak velocity are also summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954411912445841">Table 2</xref>. As can be seen, the estimated peak velocity deviates from the reference peak velocity by 1.8% for Experiment D, 3.8% for Experiment E, and 5.9% for Experiment F.</p>

<title>Velocity ratio comparison</title>
<p>It is important to determine how closely the estimated velocity curve (black line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411912445841">Figure 8</xref>) matches the reference velocity curve. We do this by comparing the estimated motion (velocity or displacement) to the reference motion from the linear stage, on an incremental basis. This is done by comparing the motion at each time interval, during a single motion profile. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954411912445841">Table 3</xref> illustrates data collected in this process, by providing an example corresponding to the data of the third profile of Experiment B, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411912445841">Figure 8</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954411912445841">Table 3</xref> shows the instantaneous velocity of the linear stage at each time interval, and the estimated velocity from our technique for the same time interval, for 17 time intervals from <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> to <italic>t</italic><sub>4</sub>. Also shown is the ratio (estimate/reference) for each time interval. The set of 17 ratios from <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> to <italic>t</italic><sub>4</sub> are then averaged, to create a single average velocity ratio (AVR) value for that profile. This average ratio is essentially a measure of how close the estimated profile is to the reference profile. This is repeated for all ten profiles in each experiment (A to F). The mean of the five forward AVRs, and the mean of the five reverse average velocity ratios for each experiment for the metal flat bar and the lamb tendon, can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0954411912445841">Table 4</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A tendon mimicking experiment was devised using two different materials. A metal tendon was used for comparison, and a lamb tendon was used to mimic a human tendon. Both were lubricated and sandwiched between two gel pads, and were actuated to move back and forth while under the LogicScan transducer. In performing these experiments, several results were obtained. Estimates of the tendon’s velocity and displacement were computed by first acquiring the Doppler-shifted frequencies as an audio-based output signal in real time, and then processing them using our algorithm. Also, estimates of the tendon’s velocity and displacement were obtained with the LogicScan system. The resulting estimates from our algorithm, and those from the LogicScan, were compared to an external reference (linear stage motion). The average peak velocity comparison results can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954411912445841">Table 2</xref>. Also, the mean AVR and mean ADR results were computed, which define how closely the estimated curve matches the reference curve, and are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0954411912445841">Table 4</xref>. Finally, the total displacement estimated by our method, the displacement estimated by the LogicScan system, and the external reference, were compared as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0954411912445841">Table 5</xref>.</p>
<p>In all experiments, it was found that the estimates of the peak velocity and the total displacement of our proposed technique were repeatable and closely matched with respect to the external reference. Also, the mean AVR and mean ADR in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0954411912445841">Table 4</xref> were relatively close to 1. This means that the estimated velocity curve and the estimated displacement curve closely match the linear stage velocity and displacement, respectively. In addition, our estimates were significantly more accurate than the LogicScan estimates, in general. Also, it was observed that our estimates of the metal flat bar material were better than those of the lamb tendon, using our technique. This is expected, since the metal flat bar is a wide solid object, and it completely filled the measurement region of the transducer. However, the lamb tendon is not as wide and solid, which allows the moving gel surrounding the tendon to be captured as part of the signal. This may explain the greater variability (standard deviation) of the values in the velocity profiles of the tendon, in comparison to those of the metal flat bar. Alternatively, a water tank could have been used instead of gel pads. However our transducer and other hardware were not waterproof, and thus could not be submerged. The returning Doppler signal was also stronger coming from the metal flat bar in comparison to the lamb tendon. The larger error found in the estimations of velocity and displacement when using the LogicScan machine, was likely due to the internal processing filters used by the LogicScan. As mentioned, the LogicScan is intended for the measure of fast moving flow such as blood in the arteries, and hence uses a high-pass wall filter which eliminates 2% of the lowest frequencies in the range. This would ultimately affect the outcome of the displacement estimation because there would be excessive weighting to the higher amplitude frequencies (or velocities). As shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-0954411912445841">equation (4)</xref>, the velocities are weighted according to the amplitude of their PSD. Using an inappropriate frequency (or velocity) cut-off would result in an inaccurate average velocity curve, velocity–time integral and thus, displacement. Furthermore, the LogicScan’s software was factory-calibrated to be used for many different applications, such as imaging deep and surface anatomical structures, fetal imaging and blood flow. However, the types of filters and approximations implemented for these uses were unknown because the software’s approximations and processing methods are proprietary.</p>
<p>On using our proposed algorithm we noticed the following limitations. Primarily, there was always a trade-off between time and frequency resolution when performing Fourier transforms. These resolution issues stem from the type of Fourier window chosen, the length of this window, the number of window overlaps, and the number of Fourier transforms performed. If these parameters are changed, the estimated average frequency or average velocity will change. The current values chosen work well, but we will investigate optimizing these values for different scenarios in future work. Secondly, when the frequencies determined by the Fourier transform were used to determine the velocities with the Doppler formula, the Doppler angle must be known. With higher Doppler angles, an uncertainty in the angle inherently presents a higher error when used with our Matlab<sup>TM</sup> script. In other words, if we can minimize the angle (i.e. closer to parallel) between the incident sound wave and the tendon motion direction, the uncertainty in the angle estimation would be lessened. It is possible that a speckle-tracking technique could be used to measure tendon motion, hence eliminating the angle dependence when estimating the Doppler velocities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954411912445841">28</xref></sup> However, since speckle tracking is computationally intensive, it may be difficult to implement for tendon velocities which are over 20 mm/s.</p>
<p>Additionally, since our research motivation is the control of a wearable assistive device, it is particularly important to be able to detect and measure the onset of tendon motion, since a disabled user may not have full tendon motion range. There is a range of possible amputation sites after a traumatic injury. The prospective patients who would potentially benefit from such a wearable assistive device will have to undergo a surgical intervention to reconfigure their injured tendon anatomy. This is because the injured tendon will no longer insert at their typical sites, and will also require resistance upon muscle contraction. Thus, patient selection, surgical intervention and device usage must be addressed in future work. Furthermore, the proposed wearable assistive device must be portable, and lightweight. This places restrictions on the hardware’s size, power requirements and functionality. This, in turn, affects the sensing system by requiring the sensor and controller to be small, portable and operational for long periods of time with minimized power consumption. These design requirements may not be possible to implement by using traditional ultrasound image-based tracking algorithms. Hence, additional future work must be done to determine which processing parameters and methods are more computationally efficient and cost effective for our purposes.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this paper, a feasibility study has been done to show that pulsed-wave Doppler can be used to estimate the velocity and displacement of a moving tendon in a mimicking experimental set-up. It also showed that audio signal data access from a commercial ultrasound scanner is feasible, and can be processed using our new Fourier analysis technique, to estimate tendon motion. Our technique has been shown to provide an accurate peak velocity and displacement estimation when compared to an external reference, and has even been shown to be more accurate than LogicScan’s own estimates. This work also documented a novel way to compare the estimated motion curve with the reference motion curve, using average ratios, instead of just total displacement or the peak velocity, as done in other studies. Hence, the contribution and novelty of this work is the ability to collect audio-based data and then process the data with our Fourier technique, to accurately estimate tendon peak velocity, velocity curve matching, and displacement. Since establishing a feasibility study here on using the PW Doppler technique to detect tendon motion, we can now extend this study to future work on cadaver and live specimens to better test our research. Specifically, the algorithm will be further developed to operate in a fully real-time mode using a human subject. The acquired estimations can then be directly tested to control external devices such as assistive tools or prostheses, to determine if the technique can accurately sense user intention. Although this method is intended for tendon motion estimation for control of assistive devices, it also has applicability to clinicians dealing with hand injuries. The proposed method may be implemented by hand surgeons or kinesiologists who can use this method with their existing commercial ultrasound hardware, in order to access low-speed tendon functionality.</p>
