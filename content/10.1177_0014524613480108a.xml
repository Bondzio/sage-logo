<p>From the outset, Kenneth Appold acknowledges that it is hard to envisage a ‘brief’ history of the Reformation. The history of the waves of Reform across Europe is complex and fraught with religious, political and social upheaval. Nevertheless, Appold has written a concise account of the Reformation that is informative, engaging and insightful. The book is divided into four chapters: the different paths of medieval Christianization; the Luther phenomenon; Reformation Reforms and, finally, the Reformation’s Establishment. The first chapter, on the whole, sets the scene very well by explaining the context for the Reformation. Appold outlines the rise of the papacy (and a centralised Church) and the intrigue of the power struggles with the princes of Europe. He charts the changes in the medieval economy, the self-interest of the adulation of wealth and the controversy between following the example of the poverty of Christ and the defence of private property. He captures the increasing sense of profound unease and dissatisfaction of the ordinary people faced with social and economic constraints and the imposition of some questionable quasi-religious practices. As the book progresses, Appold identifies key figures, contexts and events. The history of Martin Luther and his thinking is clearly written, as are the accounts of Zwingli and Calvin. Appold stresses the importance of the political support that Luther and Calvin received (and required) to develop their ideas and reforms. He discusses the pivotal role of the printing press and the wide and rapid dissemination of the new ideas in pamphlets and books. There are also helpful overviews of the Reformations in Scandinavia, Hungary and Iceland and the Catholic Reform and Counter-Reformation.</p>
<p>Appold is writing from within the Protestant tradition, and, on the whole, he tries to adopt a measured tone, avoiding the championing of key Reformation figures and the stereotyping and polarisation of positions. Inevitably, the broad sweep of the narrative lacks detail and nuance at times. Equally inevitably, as the book progresses, the author’s own positions and preferences do begin to emerge. Appold has a tendency to over-romanticise some groups and movements, especially those who pursue the life of Christian poverty. He seems impressed with Celtic missionaries and their lives of holiness, but is overly focussed on explaining transgressions and penance. He highlights Luther’s perceived betrayal of the ordinary people in the peasant’s revolt, and argues for a deeper understanding of Luther’s motives. He concludes that it could be understood as Luther defending property-owning principles that ultimately, and unwittingly, anticipates the private ownership values of the modern age that are shared by many contemporary Christians. This may appear a little speculative. Other historians may continue to focus on the more uncomfortable interpretations of: Luther’s support for the rulers; his anxiety about disorder and his concern to retain control of the Reformation.</p>
<p>Appold’s book succeeds in introducing the major figures, theologies and underlying themes and contexts of the Reformation This highly readable book is a very useful introduction to the Reformation and is a credible starting point for deeper study.</p>
