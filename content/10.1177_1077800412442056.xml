<abstract>
<p>As a researcher the author began to reflect on her role on a team project as she and her colleagues developed a research design and Letter of Intent (LOI) for submission to a funding agency. The area of research interest was interprofessional collaboration. The author and her colleagues intended to observe a team of health professionals collaborating in health care decisions. The research team had not worked together previously, which provided an ideal forum for observing their own collaborative development. The team’s observations and reflections might prepare them for observing the collaborative practices of other teams. However, they found collaboration difficult to put into practice. The reflection presented here is author’s alone. As the author pondered her role in the team, she found the economy of words in poetry forced her to explicitly think about and face, emotionally, the part she played in the team’s stilted collaborative efforts. As a team, the author and her colleagues continue to work at collaboration.</p>

<disp-quote>
<p>We answered a call for interest</p>
<p>Interprofessional collaboration was the theme</p>
<p>We gathered in a small boardroom, eager and keen</p>
<p>Brainstormed ideas and established a scheme</p>
</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>We read the literature gathered by the RA<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077800412442056">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Searched for additions and wrote résumés</p>
<p>Our ideas were many, our disciplines reflected</p>
<p>A research design was slowly collected</p>
</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>I drafted a proposal, its barebones not yet embellished</p>
<p>A gap in the literature still to be established</p>
<p>Placed on a wiki where we all could participate</p>
<p>A handful only prepared to collaborate</p>
</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>A few of us continued the wiki to complete</p>
<p>Early 2009 the full proposal to replete</p>
<p>A week set aside for team members to contribute</p>
<p>But few answered the call. Too busy, disinterested, in refute?</p>
</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>Two members of the team always responded</p>
<p>Apart from a few, the majority absconded</p>
<p>Whether time, disinterest or merely diffidence</p>
<p>Increasingly obvious was oblivious reticence</p>
</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>To publications you often referred</p>
<p>Yet inserting the information you always deferred</p>
<p>Please include your suggestions was my refrain</p>
<p>Your deference to do so, was it disdain?</p>
</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>On reflection I wondered whether my influence</p>
<p>Contributed to the lack of buy-in and continuance</p>
<p>Was I too obstinate and insistent?</p>
<p>Despondence set in, though I tried to resist it</p>
</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>Time went by, the proposal set aside</p>
<p>The LOI languishing as I began to deride</p>
<p>The process we had entered and were yet to examine</p>
<p>Ourselves perhaps a case of collaborative famine</p>
</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>Perhaps as the lead I had not heeded</p>
<p>The ideas of others but instead had superseded</p>
<p>My own thoughts in their place</p>
<p>Did the team feel displaced, replaced, unneeded?</p>
</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>What had I done, did I take control?</p>
<p>Did my patience wear thin? Thrust into the role</p>
<p>Of drafting the proposal, was it my lack and failure</p>
<p>To involve the team, displacing them with my sole labor?</p>
</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>Anger at first was replaced with despair</p>
<p>I had hoped and wanted with the team to share</p>
<p>Ideas, and design a robust yet complex proposal</p>
<p>But many, I noted, weren’t sure of my disposal</p>
</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>Was I the researcher who claimed this expertise</p>
<p>Or an imposter unable to achieve</p>
<p>A project so complexly designed?</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, the team was resigned</p>
</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>An expert from away came in to teach</p>
<p>The skills required for the team to reach</p>
<p>A confidence level that inspired a step forward</p>
<p>The project was abridged and we moved onward</p>
</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>Cohesion of the team though we noted was lacking</p>
<p>Were we moving forward with each other’s backing?</p>
<p>Or will the lack of working together</p>
<p>Overturn our project? Will we collaborate never?</p>

<title>Postscript</title>
<p>Collaboration involves being open to other disciplinary and professional ideas. Yet even within one discipline, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077800412442056">Richardson (1996)</xref> has so eloquently written, there can be debate as to what constitutes its subject matter. Furthermore, qualitative research is still subject to disparagement by those who take a more positivist approach. Where then, does poetry sit as a research method? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800412442056">Faulkner (2009)</xref> has suggested that providing criteria for evaluating verse can assist those who question its use as research, a point echoed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077800412442056">Lahey (2011)</xref> in relation to lyric philosophy. Anchored in criteria for evaluating both science and art, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077800412442056">Faulkner (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800412442056">2009</xref>) suggests that standards for assessing the quality of research poetry include artistic concentration, discovery, embodied experience, conditional, narrative truth, and new insight. My goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800412442056">Ellis, 2000</xref>) was to understand my experience as a member of the collaborative research team. I stumbled upon verse as a way to write. My attempts at prose lacked the depth of feeling I was able to better get at with the use of rhythm and alliteration. It was my embodied experience of working with the team I wanted to explore. Creating a poem forced a pensive dwelling-in-thought, which I have found absent in other forms of writing. Writing in verse facilitated an intense, reflective surfacing of previously inaccessible layers of tacit knowledge. The story encapsulated in the poem is partial and situated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077800412442056">Haraway, 1988</xref>); it is my story from my point of view, a sociologist and qualitative researcher on the team. The poem resonates with those who have read and reviewed it and, in another research project on collaboration, has identified for us those aspects of collaboration that are absent from the larger body of literature, namely, what is collaboration, and what are some of the difficulties in putting it in place? Lastly, as data generation, data analysis, and/or poetic transcription, poetry offers a new method of doing research that need not be a mere addendum to traditional research.</p>
