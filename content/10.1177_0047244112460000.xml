<p>It is a remarkable coincidence that the last two special issues of the <italic>Journal of European Studies</italic>, published a year apart, are devoted respectively to W. G. Sebald and to Claudio Magris, two European writers whom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047244112460000">Eileen Battersby in the Irish Times in 1999</xref> defined as fellow intellectual visionaries. At the time no one had yet so explicitly and publicly connected these two writers, whose primary focus on Austrian literature, whose cultural, national and spiritual liminal dimension, remarkable humanism and unease with postmodern literary predicaments, allow us to ascertain a kinship worthy of further critical exploration.</p>
<p>Claudio Magris is a Mitteleuropean intellectual, writer and cultural philosopher, born in Trieste, a border city that until 1918 had been the main port of the Hapsburg Empire. As a child he experienced the severing but fascinating effect of the Iron Curtain and, as a young man – by then a scholar of German literature – he devoted himself to the exploration of Austrian literature and to the myth of the disintegrated yet still mentally (even mystically) unifying empire. Since the 1990s Magris has apparently shifted his focus from literary criticism to fiction, only to reveal that these two aspects of his work have always been so indissolubly entwined as to constitute an ongoing productive cross-pollination which, together with the weak separation of literary genres that characterizes his prose, renders ‘ever more invisible the divide between documentary writing and fictional writing, or, if one prefers, between “live” history and rhetorical strategy’ and highlights ‘the mixed nature of his prose, [of] his perennial wandering between short story, autobiography, historical, geographical, anthropological, utopian essay’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047244112460000">Pellegrini, 2012</xref>: xl, translation mine).</p>
<p>Magris has been ‘genetically predisposed’ by historical and socio-political events to make the issue of identity the leitmotiv of his writing and has responded to this call with great originality, extraordinary richness and insight into one of the most productive dilemmas of contemporary life for Europeans and non-Europeans alike (a distinction more often than not quite difficult to establish). In his fiction, as well as in his essays and editorials, Magris abides by the precept of Pasternak’s Zhivago, who warns us not to turn the lights of the train of our conscience inwards. The consequence would be a sure loss of direction, with ensuing derailment and death. Magris’s prose consistently looks outward, in a close scrutiny of individual lives and of what lies behind the dioramas of history; in the process he unearths any relics or threads that allow him to embark upon the path of an archaeology of life with a besotted attention for what could easily be discarded, ignored or bypassed in favour of signs that only apparently carry a more ample meaning. His reflections on identity highlight the liminal, the uncertain, the transient, and at the same time provide a strong awareness of a point of departure, a rooted somewhere that can easily become a nowhere from which the travels of this Argonaut of contemporary Europe begin. Colum McCann’s definition of a nation as ‘a sort of intimate and fluctuating everywhere’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047244112460000">McCann, 2001</xref>: xiv) is therefore most fitting in Magris’s case, as it is his idea of Europe (for Magris mostly Central Europe) that ‘expands its lungs to become a continent, and then, when necessary, [it] shrinks back down to its individual components. The small colonises the large, and the large rebounds upon the small’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047244112460000">McCann, 2001</xref>: xv).</p>
<p>The essays collected in this issue were first delivered at a conference on ‘Europe in Its Own Eyes: Europe in the Eyes of the Other’, held at the University of Guelph in October 2010. The theme of European identity was the focus of three days of discussion among scholars from Canada, the United States, Western and Eastern Europe. Claudio Magris was a keynote speaker at the event and he has generously made his address available for publication. His coming to Canada in 2010 coincided with the translation of his latest novel, <italic>Blindly</italic>, by Penguin Canada, which has since been re-printed by Yale University Press. The text included here illustrates the making of the novel and provides an overarching reflection on the relationship between history, historiography and fiction, a core issue in all of Magris’s work. Nicoletta Pireddu’s essay investigates the concepts of home, belonging and displaced abode in Magris’s narrative, characterized by a sense of drifting among temporary – yet comforting – dwellings that constitute a warning against, and at the same time an antidote to what EÉ;tienne Balibar identifies as the danger of a new fragmentation and polarization of identities in a culturally splintered Europe. Andrea Ciccarelli elaborates on the concept of the border as a bridge and a barrier, and examines Magris’s own reflections on ‘the other side’ at the time of the war in the former Yugoslavia. Ciccarelli also surveys the author’s exploration of the Hapsburg Empire and its appeasement of often irreconcilable identities through continuously re-negotiated compromises. The relationship between Magris and postmodern narrative is the subject of Elena Coda’s essay, in which she unveils the writer’s problematic and often sceptical stance towards the postmodern, all the while reiterating the need for the search for a unifying meaning and a sense of totality even – and especially – in the continuous flux that characterizes our existence. Coda illustrates how Magris’s ethical message is always embodied in a process, never solely in a point of departure or arrival, and it is therefore comforting because of its transient yet ceaseless nature. Mark Epstein offers an appraisal of Claudio Magris’s and Franco Fortini’s intellectual standpoint towards identity and otherness (via Lukács and the Italian Germanist tradition) and, with a forceful sense of urgency, invites the reader, and Magris himself, to address the tectonic geo-political and cultural shifts that contemporary Europe confronts.</p>
<p>Unlike Sebald’s books, which have been fully appropriated by English readers as part of their own literary tradition (thanks also, but certainly not only, to Sebald’s long abode in the UK), the English world has embraced Magris’s work only belatedly. It is our hope that this publication will contribute to the knowledge of a most prominent European writer among and beyond English readers.</p>
