<p>In the context of rising global challenges to South Asia’s textiles and clothing (T&amp;C) sector in the form of reduced global demand, fierce competition in a post Multi-fibre Arrangement (MFA) environment, withdrawal of Generalized System of Preferences-plus (GSP-plus) schemes and other policy-related developments, the need to improve the region’s cost competitiveness in apparels has never been as critical as it is today. <italic>Potential Supply Chains in the Textiles and Clothing Sector in South Asia: An Exploratory Study</italic> is a timely attempt to explore the possibilities of developing regional supply chains and production linkages for South Asia in the T&amp;C sector as a means of enhancing cost competitiveness in the region. The study examines the T&amp;C industry in four major South Asian economies—Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The main thesis of the study lies in the conviction that expanded regional integration, beyond trade in goods, together with cooperation in developing supply chains has considerable potential for growth and development in the region. The book comprises of seven chapters, including an overview of the T&amp;C industries in each economy, a review of existing literature on supply chains and a discussion on the methodology and findings of the analysis.</p>
<p>While an abundant literature exists on the T&amp;C industry in South Asia and the potential for deeper regional integration, relatively little attention has been paid to exploring the possibilities for building supply chains in the region. What distinguishes this book from many other studies with similar coverage is its aim to ‘make the research useful to policy-makers and industries by looking at industry-specific dynamics rather than following a general and broad approach’ (p. 3). The underlying theme of the book is that cost competitiveness in the region could be improved as a whole by developing production supply chains in the region. This may enable South Asia to increase its share in global T&amp;C exports which would in turn benefit each of the countries in the region in terms of enhanced exports, output and employment.</p>
<p>Following an introduction to the study in the first chapter, the second chapter highlights some broad trends in South Asia’s T&amp;C sector and compares them with those of East and South-east Asia, one of South Asia’s leading supplying regions. The analysis highlights the fact that while South Asia experienced a rise in its global share of T&amp;C exports during the 2004–2007 period—almost double that of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (ASEAN)—there has been a rapid decline following the global economic downturn. This trend underscores the need for improving competitiveness in the region. Taking textiles and clothing separately, it appears that South Asia’s share in exports of textiles has grown much faster than its share in clothing.</p>
<p>An interesting observation that comes to the forefront is the fact that there is both demand for and supply of T&amp;C inputs within South Asia, with different countries specializing in the production of final products and inputs—Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have higher shares in clothing accessories in their global exports (more than 80 per cent), while India and Pakistan have higher shares in textiles (over 50 per cent). The study identifies that ‘this complementarity increases the potential for developing production supply chains within the region’ (p. 8).</p>
<p>A more detailed overview of the T&amp;C sectors in each of the four South Asian countries is given in Chapter 3. The importance of the sector for all of the economies in terms of exports, contribution to output and employment generation is emphasized, while the different competitive strengths in each economy are highlighted. Some of the data, however, have been adapted from country studies undertaken in different years—for instance, the overview of the Indian T&amp;C industry has been undertaken in 2007 and that of Sri Lanka in 2005. It would have been better if more recent data were presented, and also if data of the same years were given for all the industries in the different economies, for comparison purposes.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 presents a brief review of the literature on regional cooperation in the T&amp;C industry in South Asia. Studies which point to the important role played by intra-industry trade (IIT) in regional integration efforts, the growing trend of IIT in South Asia and the potential to increase it further are presented, as well as those that emphasize the importance of enchaining the collective export competitiveness of South Asian countries through cooperation rather than competition. The literature review shows that while some studies discuss the benefits in general of developing production supply chains in the T&amp;C sector in South Asia, there is a lack of studies examining specific supply chains that can be formed within the region, looking at which inputs can be imported by a country and what outputs can be exported. This is the gap this study attempts to fill, by identifying potential supply chains in the region using a product level input–output matrix constructed by the UNCTAD.</p>
<p>The methodology adopted for identifying potential supply chains is discussed in detail in Chapter 5. As described in the chapter, the premise for the methodology stems from a ‘simple logic’—identifying products for which both demand and supply exist in the region. In particular, the ‘three-stage supply chain’ identifies the final output globally exported by a country; two countries that can provide ‘Stage I inputs’ used in production of the final output and two other countries which can provide ‘primary inputs’ used in the production of Stage I inputs. Importantly, the study also reports export unit values of inputs of both South Asian countries and those of the current major global exporters of the product to the country, to take into account the possibility of obtaining cheaper inputs from outside the region.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 is perhaps the most interesting chapter of the book, where the findings of the three-stage supply chains are presented. The analysis is extensive, in that potential supply chains are evaluated based on three criteria: the number of times a country participates in different production stages, the number of three-stage supply chains formed by export of final product and the number of unique six-digit tariff lines of imports in the supply chains. According to the first criterion, India participates in the maximum number of stages (1,032), followed by Pakistan (795). In terms of the second criterion, the highest number of supply chains can be formed in Sri Lanka (363), followed by Bangladesh (212). When the number of unique tariff lines that can be imported by a country is considered, Pakistan leads with 117, followed by Bangladesh at 65. These findings suggest that the scope for building supply chains is high, with each country standing to benefit.</p>
<p>This chapter also points to another interesting observation: While analysis of existing trends show that many of the countries mainly source their imports from outside the region, Sri Lanka appears to import to a large extent from within the region. Regional imports in 24 out of 34 products make up over 10 per cent of total imports, which is indicative of the existing potential for regional imports for Sri Lanka. Moreover, none of the identified inputs are in Sri Lanka’s sensitive list in the South Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA).</p>
<p>An assessment of unit value prices of the products supplied by South Asian countries compared to other leading global suppliers also reveals that in many of the items, the former are lower cost suppliers. However, comparison based on price levels alone is not sufficient. As acknowledged in the study itself, an important limitation of the supply chain assessment is that ‘it has not been possible to take into account the quality variations across various suppliers’ (p. 113). This is a significant shortcoming, given that the quality of inputs are equally—if not more—important as prices in shaping a buyer’s decision. This is particularly true in the case of apparels, where importers provide strict specifications on the quality of inputs to be used and their preferred sources. Furthermore, recent research in the US apparel market—one of South Asia’s key export markets—suggests that consumers are now increasingly looking for brand names instead of lower prices. The focus on quality over prices could reduce the scope of regional sourcing as projected in this analysis.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 concludes and also discusses some important policy implications following from the insights gained from the study. A key conclusion coming from the analysis is that despite the potential for forming supply chains in the region, market forces alone have not been successful in developing these supply chains. The analysis attributes this to high tariffs and inclusion of products in countries’ sensitive lists, but more importantly to non-tariff barriers (NTBs). The study recommends stakeholder consultations to identify specific NTBs, while also implementing trade facilitation measures for improving the competence and competitiveness of the region. The concluding chapter also provides compelling arguments aimed at disputing current reservations against forming regional supply chains, such as the concern that regional supply chains could undermine individual countries’ efforts to develop their own domestic backward linkage industries, the possibility of regional supply chains leading to trade diversion and concerns about unequal distribution of gains among countries from regional supply chains.</p>
<p>In summing up, this study presents some important findings and policy implications, the most important being the significant scope for promoting unexploited intra-regional trade which can actually enhance the competitiveness of regional supply, in contrast to the generally perceived view of the lack of complementarity in South Asia’s T&amp;C sector. Its significance is manifest in the context of the increasing importance of value chains and production networks as a means of stimulating intra-regional trade. The straightforward methodology adopted in analyzing potential supply chains adds to the attractiveness of the analysis.</p>
<p>Several issues, however, can be raised regarding the analysis. While the study focuses on the four main economies in South Asia, the inclusion of Nepal, which also has a well-established T&amp;C industry, would have enriched the analysis, particularly in the context of looking at sourcing potential within the region. Another concern is that apart from stating the data source used, there is no further illustration or explanation of the data, which undermines to some extent the credibility of the analysis. From the reader’s perspective, proper illustration of the data would have assisted in grasping a better understanding of the analysis.</p>
<p>The study would also have been more comprehensive if the quantitative analysis was complemented by a qualitative analysis. Apart from considering quality differences between potential inputs from different sources, a more in-depth analysis capturing qualitative aspects such as the different stages and actors involved in the entire supply chain process, time/cost taken for inbound and outbound logistics, different governance structures relating to supply chains, would have added more value to the study.</p>
<p>Despite such limitations, <italic>Potential Supply Chains in the Textiles and Clothing Sector in South Asia</italic> is an important and valuable contribution, especially in respect of its ground-breaking analysis on the prospects for developing supply chains and production linkages in the T&amp;C sector in South Asia. The outcomes of the study are likely to be particularly useful to policy-makers and relevant stakeholders associated with the T&amp;C sector, and provide a good starting point for further in-depth research on forming supply chains, not only in the T&amp;C sector but also in other sectors in the region. This book will be of interest to students, scholars, researchers, industry stakeholders and policy-makers with an interest in international trade and regional integration issues, and is an essential reading for anyone interested in enhancing their knowledge of the subject.</p>
