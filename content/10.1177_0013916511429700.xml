<abstract>
<p>Beyond noise annoyance and voice problems, little is known about the effects that noise and poor classroom acoustics have on teachers’ health and well-being. The aim of this field study was therefore to investigate the effects of perceived noise exposure and classroom reverberation on measures of well-being. Data on self-reported noise exposure, job satisfaction, fatigue after work, and interest in leaving the job were obtained from 283 teachers at 10 schools in Copenhagen, Denmark. In addition, the schools’ acoustical working environment was classified as “low reverberation time (RT)” (3 schools, RT = 0.41-0.47 s), “medium RT” (3 schools, RT = 0.50-0.53 s), or “high RT” (4 schools, RT = 0.59-0.73 s). Significant associations were found between high RT and noise exposure, and, respectively, low job satisfaction, lack of energy after work, and interest in leaving the job. Noise exposure was also associated with lack of motivation and sleepiness. The results demonstrate the importance of good classroom acoustic conditions for teachers’ well-being.</p>

<p>There is increasing evidence that classroom noise and poor acoustic conditions contribute negatively to the learning environment in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013916511429700">Berg, Blair, &amp; Benson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013916511429700">Dockrell &amp; Shield, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013916511429700">Flexer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013916511429700">Klatte, Hellbrück, Seidel, &amp; Leistner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013916511429700">Picard &amp; Bradley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013916511429700">Shield &amp; Dockrell, 2003</xref>). The main problem is that high noise levels in the classroom and a reverberating environment interfere with conversations and discussions and make it more difficult for the children to hear what is being said. Indeed, young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013916511429700">Elliott, 1979</xref>), children with hearing impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013916511429700">Crandell &amp; Smaldino, 2000</xref>) or learning difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013916511429700">Bradlow, Kraus, &amp; Hayes, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013916511429700">Dockrell &amp; Shield, 2006</xref>), or children for whom English is an additional language are particularly vulnerable to the disturbing effects of poor acoustical conditions. A central parameter in expressing acoustical conditions in classrooms is the reverberation time (RT), which is defined as the time it takes for the reflected sounds from a sound source to decrease by 60 dB after the sound source has stopped. A high RT can create noticeable problems for speech communication—a cathedral may have such a high RT that visitors can hear echoes of speech and speakers learn to speak slowly, with pauses that allow the sound to fade. The studies cited above demonstrate that some schoolrooms suffer from similar challenges at a lower level of awareness. Consequently, many countries have introduced guidelines relating to the acoustics of classrooms: for example, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard S12.60 Acoustical Performance Criteria, Design Requirements, and Guidelines for Schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013916511429700">ANSI, 2010</xref>). This standard stipulates the limit for 1-hr average background sound levels of 35 dBA for classrooms ≤ 283 m<sup>3</sup> and a limit for RT of 0.6 s.</p>

<title>The Effects of Poor Classroom Acoustics on Teachers</title>
<p>The vast majority of studies on the effects of poor classroom acoustics have focused on the consequences for the children. It is also conceivable, however, that the previously observed impairment in children’s academic achievements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013916511429700">Shield &amp; Dockrell, 2008</xref>) is partly caused by teachers who underperform because of a poor acoustical environment. For example, if the teachers cope with such an environment by using strategies such as arriving late in the class, stopping lectures early, sickness absence, or quitting the job, the net result may well be poorer academic achievements. The question of how teachers cope with poor acoustical conditions lacks investigation but there is evidence that background noise at low levels (that is, so low that it is no threat to human hearing) is associated with increased sickness absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013916511429700">Clausen, Christensen, Lund, &amp; Kristiansen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013916511429700">Kristiansen, 2010</xref>). Also, voice problems in teachers seem to be associated with increased risk of sickness absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013916511429700">Åhlander, Rydell, &amp; Löfqvist, 2011</xref>). A related question is how acoustical working conditions affect teachers’ job commitment as well as their general satisfaction with their job. This question has never, to our knowledge, been addressed. Nevertheless, insight into this question is available from studies dealing with adjacent outcomes. For example, noise from external sources such as aircraft and road traffic have been found to be associated with annoyance, speech interference, and vocal efforts among teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013916511429700">Crook &amp; Langdon, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013916511429700">Ko, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013916511429700">Sargent, Gidman, Humphreys, &amp; Utley, 1980</xref>). Similarly, some studies have reported increased vocal efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013916511429700">Åhlander et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013916511429700">Pekkarinen, Himberg, &amp; Pentti, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916511429700">Pekkarinen &amp; Viljanen, 1991</xref>) and distraction and annoyance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013916511429700">Enmarker &amp; Boman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013916511429700">Kristiansen, Lund, Nielsen, Persson, &amp; Shibuya, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916511429700">Lundquist, Holmberg, Burström, &amp; Landström, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013916511429700">Lundquist, Holmberg, &amp; Landström, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013916511429700">Skarlatos &amp; Manatakis, 2003</xref>) related to internal noise sources and high RT. Thus, the available evidence suggests that poor acoustical working conditions have several negative effects on teachers, and although none of the studies provide direct evidence, there are reasons to believe that poor acoustical working conditions may have consequences for their job commitment and job satisfaction.</p>

<sec id="section2-0013916511429700">
<title>Well-Being</title>
<p>The concept of well-being is likely to play a central role in the further exploration of the effects of poor acoustical working conditions. In general, well-being can be considered as an integrated effect of perceptions and interpretations of several factors acting in concert. Hence, work-related well-being may determine teachers’ motivation and work commitment, influence the choice of coping strategies when they are dealing with stressors, and generally moderate the strength of the teachers’ connection with the workplace. For this study we chose job satisfaction, fatigue after work, and interest in leaving the job as indicators of well-being.</p>
<sec id="section3-0013916511429700">
<title>Job satisfaction</title>
<p>Job satisfaction can be defined as a positive emotional condition resulting from appraisal of job experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916511429700">Dormann &amp; Zapf, 2001</xref>). Job satisfaction has been widely studied in relation to productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013916511429700">Judge, Bono, &amp; Patton, 2001</xref>), and low job satisfaction has been shown to be associated with sickness absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013916511429700">Eshøj, Jepsen, &amp; Nielsen, 2001</xref>) and with psychological health problems such as burnout, depression, and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013916511429700">Faragher, Cass, &amp; Cooper, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0013916511429700">
<title>Fatigue</title>
<p>There is no generally accepted agreement on the definition of fatigue, but most instruments used to measure this symptom assess physical and mental dimensions. Presumably, fatigue has a negative influence on performance in activities at work as well as in the home setting. Long-term fatigue is also associated with increased sickness absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013916511429700">Duijts, Kant, Landeweerd, &amp; Swaen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013916511429700">Janssen, Kant, Swaen, Janssen, &amp; Schröer, 2003</xref>), and it is a predictor of work disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013916511429700">van Amelsvoort, Kant, Beurskens, Schröer, &amp; Swaen, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0013916511429700">
<title>Interest in leaving the job</title>
<p>The last indicator of well-being used in this study, interest in leaving the job, was chosen because leaving the job is a way to cope with poor well-being. Although this coping strategy may be successful for the individual teacher, it is costly for the organization because the teacher represents human capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013916511429700">Kohler, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of the study was therefore to explore the effect of noise and poor acoustical conditions on teachers’ well-being. As the effect of poor acoustics is to make teaching more mentally exhausting, the main hypothesis was that high RT and noise exposure are associated with increased levels of fatigue after work, lower job satisfaction, and an increased risk of considering leaving the job independent of other work conditions. Furthermore, with regard to fatigue, we hypothesize that high RT and noise exposure are associated with the mental aspects of fatigue but not with its physical aspects.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section7-0013916511429700">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Teachers in 10 public schools (with 6- to 15-year-old pupils) in the City of Copenhagen were invited to participate in the study. The selection and characterization of schools are described below. Of 419 potential respondents from 10 schools, 283 (67.5%) filled in a questionnaire on health, disturbance by noise, and other work-related items. Of the respondents, 89 were men (31%) and 194 women (69%), whose mean age (range) was 45 (21-65) years and 45 (25-66) years, respectively for men and women. The response rate ranged from 43% to 89% between the schools.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0013916511429700">
<title>Acoustical Classification of the Schools</title>
<p>Of 55 eligible schools in the City of Copenhagen, 25 schools were inspected and screened for classroom RT. The inclusion criteria for acoustical screening were (a) the absence of current plans for renovation of regular classrooms and (b) a high response rate (at least 50%) to a recent questionnaire survey conducted by the City of Copenhagen. In each school, regular classrooms were inspected and the acoustical quality of the room was assessed by two acousticians (P.M.N. and S.P.L.). The acoustician also assessed the extent to which the classrooms were acoustically similar within each school. This assessment was based on comparing the classrooms with respect to geometry and physical environment; for example, the type of ceiling and the presence of sound-absorbing material. To support the acoustical assessment of the schools, exploratory RT measurements were carried out in two to four classrooms in schools that were judged as potential candidates for participation in the study. The measurements were performed by impulse excitation and reverse integration of the impulse response, and were based on assessments of T30 from impulse decay, as described in ISO 3382-2, under the integrated impulse response method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013916511429700">International Organization for Standardization, 2008</xref>). The measurements were based on two different sound source positions at three different microphone positions in classrooms without pupils.</p>
<p>The RT was the primary determinant and, according to classroom evaluations, the schools received an overall classification of “low RT,” “medium RT,” or “high RT.” Based on the acoustical assessment, 10 schools were judged to have acoustically “homogeneous” environments (that is, classrooms with similar RT) and invited to participate in the questionnaire survey. They included 3 schools classified as “low RT,” 3 as “medium RT,” and 4 as “high RT.” After completion of the questionnaire survey, the exploratory RT measurements mentioned above were supplemented with additional measurements. The average RT (250-8,000 Hz) of the “low RT” schools was 0.44 s (range = 0.41-0.47 s), the “medium RT” schools was 0.51 s (range = 0.50-0.53 s), and the “high RT” schools 0.65 s (range = 0.59-0.73 s). There was very little effect of frequency on measured RT. Hence, the average RT for the octave bands 500, 1,000, and 2,000 Hz were 0.44 s, 0.50 s, and 0.69 s for “low RT,” “medium RT,” and “high RT’ schools, respectively. One “high RT” school was not measured because the Danish Work Environment Authority requested acoustical improvement of the school. The acoustical refurbishment was initiated after the questionnaire survey had been carried out but before RT measurements could be made. Otherwise, the RT measurements were distributed as follows. Two measurements were made in 2 schools, and 3 measurements were made in another 2 schools. In the remaining 5 schools, between 7 and 11 RT measurements were made. Statistical analysis (ANOVA) showed that the RT differed significantly between the three groups of schools in the order low RT &lt; medium RT &lt; high RT. Finally, it is important to note that the teachers were not informed about the acoustic classifications or of the measurements before responding to the questionnaire.</p>

<title>Self-Reported Measures</title>
<sec id="section10-0013916511429700">
<title>Noise exposure</title>
<p>Self-rated noise exposure was assessed by an item that read “Are you exposed to noise that disturbs you when you are teaching?” This item is intended to capture the core meaning of noise in the specific occupational context of teaching based on the definition of noise, which is that noise is unwanted sounds. A trichotomous outcome was constructed by combining the six response categories into never/rare (“never” and “rarely or very little”), a quarter to a half of the work time (“approximately a quarter of the time” and “approximately half of the time”), and ≥¾ of the time (“approximately three quarters of the time” and “almost all of the time”).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0013916511429700">
<title>Fatigue</title>
<p>A Danish translation of the Swedish Occupational Fatigue Inventory–20 (SOFI-20) was used to measure work-related fatigue in five dimensions: lack of energy, physical exertion, physical discomfort, lack of motivation, and sleepiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013916511429700">Åhsberg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916511429700">Åhsberg, Gamberale, &amp; Gustafsson, 1997</xref>). This instrument encompasses 20 items that are responded to on 7-point scales (score ranges from 0 to 6) with verbally anchored endpoints <italic>not at all</italic> and <italic>to a very high degree</italic>. Higher scores indicate more intense symptoms of fatigue. As this was the first time SOFI-20 had been used in Danish (to our knowledge), the fatigue dimensions suggested in the original work were confirmed in a factor analysis with varimax rotation. Using loading &gt;0.5 as a criterion, the analysis resulted in four dimensions. Based on the verbal content of the items that form them, the dimensions were named physical discomfort and exertion (six items: palpitations, stiff joints, aching, breathing heavily, gasping, and out of breath; Cronbach’s α = .84), lack of energy (four items: drained, spent, worn out, and overworked; Cronbach’s α = .93), lack of motivation (four items: passive, lack of concern, indifferent, and uninterested; Cronbach’s α = .89), and sleepiness (four items: sleeping sensation, sleepy, drowsy, and falling asleep; Cronbach’s α = .86). The items “‘sweaty” and “‘tense muscles” did not load significantly on any of the factors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0013916511429700">
<title>Job satisfaction</title>
<p>Job satisfaction was assessed by a single item that read “Are you satisfied with your job?” with response categories 1 = <italic>no or very little</italic>, 2 = <italic>little</italic>, 3 = <italic>somewhat</italic>, and 4 = <italic>very much</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0013916511429700">
<title>Interest in leaving the job</title>
<p>Teachers were asked whether they were thinking about leaving their job. Response options were “no” and “yes” and the latter response was divided into subcategories (“leaving for a position at another school,” “leaving the teaching profession altogether,” “retirement”). Respondents who were considering leaving owing to retirement were excluded from the analyses because it was assumed that retirement was likely to be determined by age rather than by noise exposure.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0013916511429700">
<title>Confounding and Mediating Variables</title>
<p>General confounders taken into consideration in this study were the age and gender of the teacher, self-rated health, self-rated hearing status, the presence of psychological pressure owed to factors outside work, and the average socioeconomic status (SES) of the area where the school was situated. Self-rated health was assessed by the item “In general, how do you rate your overall health?” A dichotomous outcome was constructed by combining the “good” and “very good” responses, and the “very bad,” “bad,” or “fair” responses. Self-reported hearing status was assessed by the single item “Do you regard your hearing as reduced?” with response options “no” and “yes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013916511429700">Sindhusake et al., 2001</xref>). Psychological pressure outside work was assessed by the item “Have you within the last year felt stressed or under psychological pressure owing to problems or demands outside work?”. The four response options were combined into a dichotomous outcome (“no, never” and “no, only a few times” vs. “yes, sometimes” or “yes, almost all the time”). As the school primarily serves the local community, the average household income in the geographical area defined by the school’s postal code served as a proxy for the average SES of the children in each school. The SES variable was dichotomized on the basis of the distribution within the 10 schools (median Danish kroner [DKK] 330 375). Overall, the average household income in the postcode areas of the schools was below the median household income in Copenhagen postal areas (range DKK 256 132 to 604 836, median DKK 373 499, <italic>n</italic> = 23; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013916511429700">Statistics Denmark, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Work conditions other than the acoustical factors may act as confounders of the acoustical factors and as mediating variables, that is, they may be located in the pathway from the acoustical exposure to the well-being effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013916511429700">Kraemer, Stice, Kazdin, Offord, &amp; Kupfer, 2001</xref>). It is of interest to know which work conditions are related to well-being because that knowledge can be used to improve the workplace. It is also of interest to know whether the acoustical factors are independent of each other as well as of nonacoustical work conditions. A number of other work conditions were therefore considered in this study, namely, the number of children in the class, the grade of the class, the working time, and annoyance owing to indoor factors other than noise. The latter was assessed by an item that read “Have you within the last 3 months been annoyed by the following conditions at your work?” with the 10 subcategories “draught,” “too hot,” “fluctuating temperature,” “too cold,” “stuffy or bad air,” “unpleasant smell,” “static electricity,” “inadequate lighting,” “light reflections,” and “dust and dirt.” The three response options were scored 1 = <italic>no, never</italic>; 2 = <italic>yes, sometimes</italic>; and 3 = <italic>yes, often</italic> (every week). A trichotomous outcome was constructed from the tertiles of mean score distribution (low, medium, high annoyance from indoor environment conditions).</p>

<sec id="section15-0013916511429700">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical computations were made with IBM SPSS version 19. Two-sided <italic>p</italic> values ≤ .05 were considered significant. Job satisfaction and fatigue were analyzed in multilevel mixed-model regression models with schools as a random factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013916511429700">Albright &amp; Marinova, 2010</xref>). The statistical analysis was carried out in two steps. The first step was intended to clarify if there were any associations between the acoustical factors and well-being indicators. In this part, the effects of acoustical classification and noise exposure on well-being indicators were analyzed in separate models without other workplace conditions but adjusted for the age and gender of the teacher, health variables, and socioeconomic characteristics of the school. The aim of the next step was to investigate if the associations found in the first part were independent of other work conditions. Acoustical classification, noise exposure, other work conditions, age, gender, health variables, and socioeconomic characteristics of the school were entered into the model. Nonsignificant variables were eliminated stepwise with <italic>p</italic> &gt; .20 as the criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013916511429700">Mickey &amp; Greenland, 1989</xref>). Results were expressed as differences in job satisfaction or fatigue score between high level and the reference level of the determinants, adjusted for the effects of other determinants. The risk of expressing interest in leaving the job was estimated in multiple logistic regression analysis and expressed as an odds ratio (OR). All effect estimates were adjusted for multiple comparisons where appropriate.</p>

Highest fatigue scores were observed for lack of energy after work (mean = 3.3, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.6), followed by sleepiness (mean = 2.7, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.4), lack of motivation (mean = 2.3, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.3), and physical distress and exertion (mean = 1.6, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.8). There were no significant gender differences, except that women scored higher with respect to lack of energy than men (mean = 3.5, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.7 vs. mean = 2.9, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.5).</p>

<title>Effect of Acoustical Work Conditions on Well-Being Indicators</title>
<p>The effects of acoustical work conditions on well-being without adjustment for other work conditions, but adjusted for gender, age, health and socioeconomic characteristics of the school, are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013916511429700">Table 1</xref>. High RT was associated with lower job satisfaction, lack of energy, and an increased risk of expressing interest in leaving the job. Being exposed to noise for at least a quarter of the work time was associated with lower job satisfaction, lack of energy, and lack of motivation. Exposure to noise for at least half of the time was associated with increased risk of expressing interest in leaving the job.

<p>The results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013916511429700">Table 1</xref> indicated that RT as well as noise exposure had an effect on job satisfaction, lack of energy, and interest in leaving the job, and that noise exposure (but not RT) also had an effect on lack of motivation and sleepiness.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the current study, statistically significant associations were observed between a poor acoustical working environment, as assessed by acousticians, and indicators of well-being in schoolteachers from 10 schools in the City of Copenhagen. As the acoustical classification of the working environment was assessed independent of the questionnaire survey, common method variance was ruled out as a possible explanation of the observed associations.</p>
<p>With respect to the effects of RT, most parts of our hypothesis were confirmed. We did not, however, find any effect of high RT on lack of motivation or sleepiness. The reason for this is not clear, but possibly the state of fatigue caused by teaching is better described by the lack of energy items than by sleepiness and lack of motivation items. In accordance with this notion, teachers scored higher in lack of energy than in the other fatigue dimensions. Also, the results obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013916511429700">Åhsberg (2000)</xref> suggested that lack of energy is a good descriptor of the fatigue perceived by teachers.</p>
<p>The sixfold increase in the risk of expressing interest in leaving the job associated with high RT is a new and noteworthy finding. This finding is corroborated by anecdotal evidence related to us by several teachers during the study in that acoustical conditions are an important determinant of job choice among teachers.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the significant effects are found for the high RT schools compared with low RT schools, but not for medium RT schools. As the high RT group corresponds to RT of 0.6 s and above, the results can be viewed as corroboration of the limit of 0.6 s stipulated by, for example, the ANSI standard.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis was also confirmed with regard to self-reported noise exposure. Interestingly, risk of expressing interest in leaving the job was significant before, but not after, adjustment for high RT. Thus, RT seems to be a better determinant than perceived noise exposure for this well-being indicator.</p>
<p>The results are in accordance with findings in previous studies where effects of poor classroom acoustical conditions on teachers have been investigated. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013916511429700">Enmarker and Boman (2004)</xref> found that well-being expressed by stress symptoms, which comprised tiredness, irritation, tenseness without obvious reason, headache, concentration problems, and sleeping problems, were predicted by noise annoyance in teachers and pupils and, furthermore, that noise annoyance was predicted by hearing status and noise sensitivity. The study of the effects of noise levels and RT in Greek schools by Skarlatos and Manatakis should also be mentioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013916511429700">Skarlatos &amp; Manatakis, 2003</xref>): These authors found a high correlation between noise discomfort and measured classroom noise levels among teachers as well as among pupils. The background noise levels in unoccupied classrooms (average 50 dBA) and RT in the classrooms (average 2.58 s) was relatively high, however, which limits the possibility of generalizing these findings to schools in other countries.</p>
<sec id="section26-0013916511429700">
<title>The Role of Other Work Conditions Than Noise and Classroom Acoustics</title>
<p>It is conceivable that the association between perceived noise exposure and well-being could be explained by general dissatisfaction with the physical working environment. In this case, we would expect that the effects of noise on well-being should be reduced, or even disappear, when annoyance with indoor factors other than noise is introduced into the statistical models. This was not the case, however. Instead, we found that annoyance with indoor factors other than noise was independently associated with physical fatigue and lack of motivation, and marginally with job satisfaction. This suggests that a general dissatisfaction with the physical environment does not explain the perceived noise exposure and well-being.</p>
<p>Interestingly, teaching classes with young children (Grades 0-3) was associated with a lower score for lack of energy and lack of motivation compared with teaching classes in Grades 7 to 10 after adjustment for teachers’ age and gender, among other factors. This suggests that teaching the older classes is more mentally exhausting, perhaps because the curriculum is more complex or the interaction with the students is more demanding.</p>
<p>Contrary to expectations, working 31 to 37 hr per week was associated with less physical fatigue compared with having fewer work hours (≤30 hr per week). Long working hours have been found to be associated with subjective fatigue symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013916511429700">Park, Kim, Chung, &amp; Hisanaga, 2001</xref>), impairment of cognitive functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013916511429700">Virtanen, Singh-Manoux, et al., 2009</xref>), and sleep problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916511429700">Virtanen, Ferrie, et al., 2009</xref>). The internal contrast with respect to working hours was small in the present study, however, compared with the contrasts investigated in the other studies mentioned. In addition, schoolteachers may have more influence on their working hours than workers in many other occupations; hence, teachers prone to experience physical fatigue may opt to reduce their working hours.</p>

<sec id="section27-0013916511429700">
<title>Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>The schools that participated in the study were selected in a procedure designed to ensure that teachers in the same school shared the same acoustical working environment. It should be noted that the assumption of homogeneous exposure within each school is a simplification of the real exposure situation because teachers are not in the same classroom all the time in a working day. Therefore, the procedure of assigning the same acoustical work condition to all teachers in the same school is likely to have caused misclassification of some teachers. As the misclassification is independent of the measured outcome, however, it should weaken the associations rather than cause bias. Another issue is the risk of the associations being confounded by socioeconomic factors. Yet it should be emphasized that the schools were recruited from the same municipality; that is, they share the same superior management. This is likely to reduce the risk that the different acoustical classifications assigned to the schools unintentionally correlate with differences in the schools’ general financial conditions. Moreover, we adjusted for the SES of the area where the schools are situated and although residual confounding cannot be excluded, there are some indications that this is a minor issue: First, the schools in this study did not differ very much with regard to SES and, second, this parameter did not obtain statistical significance in any of the statistical models.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we observed significant associations between poor acoustical conditions and several indicators of well-being among schoolteachers. The results are in accordance with the known negative impact of noise on children’s and teachers’ well-being in schools. All things considered, the results further strengthen the evidence for the importance of an optimal acoustical environment in school classrooms for learning and teaching.</p>
