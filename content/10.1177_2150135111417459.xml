<p>Background. The Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatrics is utilized at our center as a bridge to transplantation or bridge to recovery. This retrospective study reviews our results regarding the safety of long-term support and outcome. Methods. Between January 2008 and December 2010, 12 patients (6 females and 6 males) underwent implantation of a ventricular assist device. The median weight was 14.2 kg (range 4.2-51.6 kg) and the median age was 4.12 years (range 0.25-11.83 years). All patients were on inotropes, five patients required mechanical ventilation and three patients experienced cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Results. Eight patients received a left ventricular assist device and four patients received a biventricular assist device. Of the 12 patients, 8 were bridge to heart transplantation, in 2 patients explantation was possible, and 1 patient died on support. The median support time for these 11 patients was 151 days (range 4-488 days), with 2124 days of cardiac support. One patient is on support. Survival rate was 91.6%. Seven patients had a blood pump change once. Four patients had local signs of infection. There was no mediastinitis and thromboembolism. One patient had intracerebral hemorrhage. There was no death after heart transplantation or after explantation of the device. Conclusions. The Berlin Heart EXCOR is effective in bridging children of almost all ages and sizes to cardiac transplantation or myocardial recovery. Our experience proved that long-term support is possible with a low rate of adverse events.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Long-term mechanical circulatory support in children is still a difficult task for many reasons; an ideal device is missing. For patients with little chance for myocardial recovery in an era with dramatic organ shortage, safety during mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to transplantation continues to be a very important issue. We reviewed our results regarding long-term support and outcome in pediatric patients after implantation of Berlin Heart EXCOR system as a bridge to transplantation or bridge to recovery.</p>

<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-2150135111417459">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>In this retrospective, nonrandomized study, we present our experience with 12 consecutive patients who underwent implantation of a Berlin Heart EXCOR in our center between January 2008 and December 2010. The Institutional Ethics Committee did not require specific approval for this retrospective review.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2150135111417459">
<title>Operative Technique</title>
<p>A standard median sternotomy and mildly hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass were used in all patients. When a biventricular assist device (BVAD) implantation was necessary or in case of a patent foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect, two venous cannulae have been used. The atrial septal defect was closed at the time of implantation of ventricular assist device (VAD). Preoperatively, if no shunt was identified at the atrial level and only a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) was necessary, single venous cannulation has been employed. A left-sided heart vent was inserted through the right superior pulmonary vein in all patients. The apex VAD cannula for the left ventricle was inserted during cardioplegic arrest. In case of a small ascending aorta, the implantation of the standard Berlin heart EXCOR aortic cannula was also performed with the heart arrested. Right ventricular assist device (RVAD) implantation was achieved using right atrial and main pulmonary artery cannulation. The BVAD system was run in a synchronous operating mode.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2150135111417459">
<title>Anticoagulation</title>
<p>We start anticoagulation 24 hours after VAD implantation with intravenous infusion of heparin to adjust the partial thromboplastin time between 50 and 70 seconds. The activated clotting time in addition to partial thromboplastin time is not followed for anticoagulation. A value of higher than 70% is maintained for antithrombin III. After the removal of drainage tubes, the chronic anticoagulation regimen was initiated with oral warfarin in all patients to keep the international normalized ratio (INR) between 3 and 3.5. If there is a lapse in therapeutic INR, the patients are restarted on heparin. In addition, aspirin (3mg/kg per d) and dipyridamole (10mg/kg per d) are administrated according to thromboelastogram indications.</p>

<title>Patients Preoperative Data</title>
<p>Between January 2008 and December 2010, the Berlin Heart EXCOR system was implanted in 12 pediatric patients at the Center for Congenital Heart Disease HDZ in Bad Oeynhausen (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2150135111417459">Table 1</xref>
). There were 6 females and 6 males. The median age was 4.1 years (range 0.25-11.8 years) and the median weight was 14.2 kg (range 4.2-51.6 kg). In all the 12 patients, the etiology of heart failure was dilative cardiomyopathy. In four patients, this was secondary to acute myocarditis. Parvovirus B19 was identified in patients 6 and 9, enterovirus in patient 5, and human herpes V6 virus (HHV6) in patient 11. One patient (patient 12) had a chronic myocarditis due to the persistence of HHV6 virus infection. This last patient received previously a mitral valve replacement for important mitral regurgitation after surgery for partial atrioventricular septal defect.</p>

<title>Preoperative Status of the Patients</title>
<p>The median ejection fraction was 16% (range 12%-26%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2150135111417459">Table 1</xref>). All patients were on inotropes and five patients required mechanical ventilation before Berlin Heart EXCOR (BH) implantation. Patients 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 received dobutamine, epinephrine, and milrinone; patient 1 was on dobutamine, epinephrine, and levosimendan; patients 7 and 9 were on epinephrine and milrinone; patients 2 and 12 were on dobutamine and milrinone; and patient 10 was on epinephrine. There was no use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) prior of VAD implantation in this series. Three patients experienced cardiac arrest before VAD implantation. They were all ventilated. External cardiac compressions were needed for 7 minutes in patient 3, for 4 minutes in patient 8, and for 9 minutes in patient 10 until stable cardiac rhythm and arterial pressure could be observed. None of these patients received ECMO support during or after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. None of them underwent core cooling after cardiac arrest. Implantation of VAD was performed 2 hours after the episode of cardiac arrest in patient 3, after 17 hours in patient 8, and after 3 hours in patient 10. Clinical evidence of right heart failure as well as liver dysfunction (high level of alanine transaminase up to 100 times and prolonged prothrombin time) were present in patients 1, 2, 4, and 10. No patient required dialysis before surgery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-2150135111417459">
<title>Type of Device Implantation</title>
<p>In the majority of the patients, an LVAD implantation was necessary, and only 4 patients (33.3%) received a BVAD. The sizes of the pumps are depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2150135111417459">Table 1</xref>. Three of the BVAD systems have been implanted among the first four patients in this series and only one BVAD system in the last eight patients. For patients weighting up to 9 kg, we use the 10-mL pumps. For patients weighing between 10 and 29 kg, we use the 25-mL and the 30-mL pumps, respectively. For patients weighing more than 30 kg, we use the 50-mL and the 60-mL pumps. For patients with borderline weight according to the above-mentioned intervals, the choice of the pump size can be difficult. However, it can be presumed that a pump running at a higher rate would have less chance to develop a thrombus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-2150135111417459">
<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>Eight patients have been successfully bridged to heart transplantation after a median support time of 240 days (range 64-488 days). The Berlin Heart system was explanted in two patients after 49 and 102 days of cardiac support. One patient died on support four days after implantation due to nonresponsive vasoplegia. The median support time for these 11 patients was 151 days (range 4-488 days), with 2124 days of support. One patient is still on support (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2150135111417459">Table 1</xref>). Currently, 11 patients are alive (survival rate 91.6%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-2150135111417459">
<title>Follow-Up</title>
<p>Posttransplant survival has been 100%, with a median follow-up of 16.5 months (range 5-26 months). Patients 9 and 11, who have been explanted, are alive and doing well, with no signs of heart failure, nine and two months, respectively, after explantation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-2150135111417459">
<title>Adverse Events</title>
<p>There was no malfunction of the Berlin Heart EXCOR system. However, a series of adverse events during mechanical support has been encountered. Seven patients had a blood pump change once. The median support time up to pump change was 69 days (range 6-214 days) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2150135111417459">Table 1</xref>). In patients 2 and 4 who have been managed with a BVAD, the right sided pump needed to be changed. There was one reexploration for bleeding after device implantation (patient 3), and in two cases the chest was left open (patient 3 and patient 8). Patient 7 developed a pericardial effusion 13 days after implantation of the LVAD but no surgical reexploration was necessary. Intra-abdominal bleeding appeared in patient 1, 70 days after BVAD implantation. No bleeding source was found during the exploring laparotomy. There was no visceral or brain embolic event. An intracerebral bleeding was diagnosed in patient 9 using computerized tomography. The patient was successfully explanted and during the follow-up minor neurological deficit recovered. Superficial, entry site, cannula infection has been observed in four patients. Three of them received antibiotics according to the antibiogram. In one of these cases (patient 12), surgical drainage of a superficial abscess not related to the outflow cannula was needed. The superficial abscess was located between the entry site of the aortic cannula and the distal end of the median sternotomy. There was no mediastinitis. Patient 1 showed evidence of sensitization by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed by Luminex methodology. This patient required plasmapheresis after heart transplantation.</p>

<title>Comment</title>
<p>Mechanical circulatory support is a very challenging issue. There is a considerable experience with VADs in adults, some new devices proving enough safety to be used as a destination therapy. In pediatric population, especially in newborns, young infants, and small children, ECMO and centrifugal pumps represent the main circulatory support strategy. Unfortunately their long-term use was associated with many serious complications.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111417459">1</xref>
</sup> Implantation of pulsatile, paracorporeal VADs proved to be advantageous in many ways, from improving the tissue perfusion and reversing end-organ dysfunction to patient mobility.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111417459">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111417459">3</xref>
</sup> However, their use is not free of adverse events, some of them such as stroke or visceral thromboembolism being extremely serious.</p>
<p>In this study, BVAD implantation was necessary in four patients. Among the first four patients in our series, three received right and left ventricular support. There was only one case with BVAD in the next eight implants. Analyzing these data and the condition of the patients prior to implantation, we concluded that the decision to implant VAD was definitely too late in the first three cases (patients 1, 2, and 4), and this was the primary reason why these three patients finally needed BVAD implantation.</p>
<p>Patient 10 (the fourth patient with BVAD in our series) with dilated cardiomyopathy received a pacemaker implantation. Shortly thereafter, the patient experienced cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The patient was presented to the operating room in a state of cardiogenic shock. Although the BVAD implantation was performed successfully, the patient died four days later due to nonresponsive vasoplegia. Other groups reported the unresponsiveness of the peripheral circulation to alpha-stimulants as the cause of death.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111417459">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111417459">5</xref>
</sup> With a more aggressive approach with respect to the earlier device implantation, we successfully implanted only LVAD in eight patients. Timing of device implantation is critically important. A team decision is mandatory but the surgeon has a leading role.</p>
<p>Late implantation increases the stress on end-organs and the stress on the right ventricle with an increasing need for BVAD support. Time will change an LVAD candidate to a BVAD candidate and finally to an ECMO candidate because the patient ends in cardiorespiratory failure. All patients that have been supported with BVAD in our experience had right ventricular dysfunction despite inotropic support and clinical evidence of right heart failure. Patients that have been supported with LVAD had only mildly impaired right ventricular function with little or no evidence of clinical right heart failure under inotropic support.</p>
<p>Accurate surgical technique during VAD implantation is of paramount importance. Technical details can have important impact on outcome. Inadequate placement of the aortic cannula of the Berlin Heart EXCOR can impair the function of the right ventricle due to compression of the right ventricle cavity, of the right coronary artery, or both. As a consequence, this will result in the need for RVAD implantation. Inadequate decompression of the left ventricle after LVAD implantation also maintains the stress on the right ventricle because of the sustained elevated pulmonary pressure. There is the feeling that the function of the right ventricle may be preserved by not arresting the heart. In our experience, a short cross clamping time for LVAD implantation proved to be safe with regard to right ventricle function.</p>
<p>Anticoagulation management was previously described by Berlin group.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111417459">6</xref>
</sup> It has to be safe and effective, that means, ideally, no bleeding and no thromboembolism. Despite effective anticoagulation, thrombus formation was observed in five patients with LVAD and in two patients with BVAD. Anticoagulation was not interrupted in any of these patients. A total number of seven blood pumps needed to be changed. The thrombus was located inside the sinuses of the outflow tri-leaflet polyurethane valve in six blood pumps and inside the sinuses of the inflow tri-leaflet polyurethane valve in one blood pump. In the patients with BVAD, the thrombus was found on the right Berlin Heart ventricle, and thrombus was never found on the cannulae. Continuous observation of fibrin deposit and thrombus formation is mandatory to prevent embolic event. Our aggressive policy to change the blood pump when we observe fibrin deposit that will initiate thrombus formation could also be a reason why we have had no embolic event in our series. However, it is possible that at least some emboli may probably develop from the large ventricle that has stasis in many areas. Changing of the blood pump has a risk of cerebral air embolism that could be serious. Despite other reports,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111417459">7</xref>
</sup> we have had no complication associated with this procedure. The patient is sedated with propofol. We did not use inotropes for pump changes. We continuously monitored the heart rate and rhythm and measured the noninvasive blood pressure during the procedure. A dose of 100 units/kg of heparin is given. The new pump is filled with crystalloid and properly de-aired. Then the cannulae are clamped, the old pump is removed, the new pump is connected and the clamps are removed. This sequence usually takes about 20 seconds. All our patients tolerated this procedure very well.</p>
<p>We had one patient with minor neurological impairment due to intracerebral bleeding confirmed by computerized tomography. It was possible to explant the LVAD in this patient. On follow-up, recovery of the neurological deficit was noticed. In contrast to our experience, neurological complications have a significant incidence in other series, more than 25% of patients being clinically symptomatic.<sup>

<p>Meticulous hemostasis and leaving the operating room with the chest closed will allow an early extubation and dramatically decrease the risk of infection. The chest was left open in only two patients (patient 3 and patient 8). We have had no mediastinitis. Four patients had superficial cannula site infection. In one of these patients surgery was needed to evacuate a superficial abscess not related to the outflow cannula. Three patients with evidence of superficial infection have been successfully transplanted. During transplantation, no sign of local infection was identified on the other side of abdominal wall, in-growth scar tissue being present around the cannula. After removal of the cannula and excising the granulation tissue around its exit point, no local infection has been noticed postoperatively. This incidence of local infection (one third of the patients) is still of concern because of the risk of mediastinitis. Severe infective complications have been reported,<sup>

<p>We have a very low incidence of human leukocyte antigen sensitization despite our long-term mechanical circulatory support in most of our patients. Only one transplanted patient from our series had evidence of sensitization. Activation of the T-cell and CD40 ligand expression has been incriminated.<sup>

<p>Explantation of the VAD was possible in two patients, both having only an LVAD. Myocardial recovery is not always easy to be evaluated and prediction of outcome after explantation is even more difficult. Both our patients had evidence of acute myocarditis on biopsies. In our series, no patient with chronic dilated cardiomyopathy at the time of implantation experienced myocardial recovery during mechanical circulatory support. The criteria for weaning off VAD are not very well defined. We routinely check all the patients with VAD and if we observe improvement in left ventricle ejection fraction with increasing wall thickness during systole by transthoracic echocardiography, that patient will be a candidate for weaning procedure. The increase in systolic wall thickness should be more than 40%, taking the diastolic wall thickness as the reference value. We performed a test before weaning. Blood pressure, central venous pressure, and transthoracic echocardiogram are monitored. A dose of 100 units/kg of heparin is given. The device is turned to half of the current beat rate and then to two beats per minute for 5 to 10 minutes for safety reason. If there are no important changes observed in blood pressure and central venous pressure and the ejection fraction is greater than 45% (by transthoracic echocardiography), then the patient can be scheduled for explantation. Another test is done in operating room prior to the complete removal of the device and the left ventricle ejection fraction is assessed by transesophageal echocardiography. Immediately after explantation, the patient receives low dose of milrinone and epinephrine that are slowly reduced and discontinued after three to four days. It could be assumed that in face of signs of myocardial recovery, one will attempt to explant the device earlier, taking into the consideration the risks associated with mechanical circulatory support. With increasing experience and safety proved by long-term circulatory support in children, it could be presumed that a higher proportion of patient could be weaned off VAD, thus avoiding in some cases the need for cardiac transplantation, considering our current shortage of organ donors as well as the complications associated with immunosuppressive therapy and the limited long-term survival after transplantation in children. Due to a shorter duration of illness and higher regenerative capacity in pediatric population, bridge to recovery can represent a more frequent option in the future. Of course, this strategy has to be associated with an early implantation of a VAD. Early implantation is still a matter of concern due to complications associated with mechanical circulatory support.<sup>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The VAD Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatrics provides an effective means of bridging children of almost all ages and sizes to cardiac transplantation or myocardial recovery. In our experience, the Berlin Heart EXCOR system proved to be a safe VAD during long-term (2124 days) mechanical circulatory support in pediatric patients. The incidence of adverse events was low. Earlier implantation of the device combined with the better regeneration capacity of myocardium in children could increase the rate of myocardial recovery, thus avoiding the need for heart transplantation. Increasing the safety of the patient during support and providing mobility to the patient whenever possible can also open the way to destination therapy in instances when transplantation is not a valid option. This will dramatically improve the quality of life in these patients.</p>
