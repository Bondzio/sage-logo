<abstract>
<p>This article applies theoretical understandings of power relations within student voice work to two empirical examples of school-based student voice projects. The article builds on and refines theoretical understandings of power and participation developed in previous articles written by the authors. The first article argued that at the heart of student voice work are four core values: communication as dialogue; participation and democratic inclusivity; the recognition that power relations are unequal and problematic; and the possibility for change and transformation (Robinson &amp; Taylor, 2007); the second article focused on a theorization of power and participation within student voice work (Taylor &amp; Robinson, 2009). This article explores how power and participation manifest themselves within the operation of student voice projects and considers the micro-processes at play when implementing student voice work within schools. The article concludes by questioning whether student voice work provides a genuine means through which change in schools is initiated.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The aim of this article is to apply previously developed theoretical understandings of power relations within student voice work to two empirical settings in order to question whether or not student voice work can genuinely challenge the hierarchical power relations that exist in schools. Throughout this article, the term ‘student voice’ is used in accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1365480212469713">Fletcher’s (2005)</xref> definition which advocates that the meaningful involvement of students requires ‘validating and authorizing them [students] to represent their own ideas, opinions, knowledge and experiences throughout education in order to improve our schools’. The term ‘student voice’ is therefore a broad in definition and which refers to the wide variety of work taking place in schools which involves students having a say in aspects of their school lives which affect them. However, in addition to providing students with opportunities to communicate their ideas and opinions, student voice work is also about students having the power to bring about changes which will improve their experiences in school.</p>
<p>This article considers the role of the student researcher within two school-based students as researchers’ projects, how that role is enmeshed within practices of power and how those practices may limit what is practicable and possible within student voice work. The article draws on thinking from two previous articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1365480212469713">Robinson &amp; Taylor, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1365480212469713">Taylor &amp; Robinson, 2009</xref>). The first article explored the values underpinning student voice work and argued that at the heart of this practice are four core values: a conception of communication as dialogue; the requirement for participation and democratic inclusivity; the recognition that power relations are unequal and problematic; and the possibility for change and transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1365480212469713">Robinson &amp; Taylor, 2007</xref>). The second article focused on a theorization of two aspects of student voice work – power and participation – and explored how dialogue was enmeshed within both of these aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1365480212469713">Taylor &amp; Robinson, 2009</xref>). This theorization enabled us to argue the need for a more complex account of how the four previously identified values that underpin student voice practices are intertwined. In this article we build on these previous understandings. Through a detailed exploration of the relation between theory and practice, we consider how specific processes of power and participation manifest themselves within the operational aspects of student voice projects in schools. The article focuses on two examples of student voice projects, both of which took the form of students conducting research within their school settings. Both projects were embarked upon by schools with the explicit aim of empowering students to have a greater say about aspects of their school lives which they considered to be important. However, a detailed analysis of the complex micro-processes at play in the running of these projects reveals how, despite the best intentions, such projects may continue to replicate the dominant power relations present in other school practices.</p>
<p>This article adds substantive empirical evidence to the growing body of research that explores how student voice work is conditioned by dominant school agendas. It builds on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1365480212469713">Thomson and Gunter (2006)</xref> who acknowledge that student voice practices can be simultaneously transformative and oppressive, and it questions the extent to which student voice work in schools can initiate change which is genuinely transformative. The article’s aim is to analyse conventional ‘everyday’ forms of students-as-researchers work in order to develop a more robust theorization of those practices.</p>

<title>Policy context</title>
<p>Power dimensions within adult - child relationships have always existed and such power dimensions are often heightened further in schools where the adults involved hold posts of responsibility and authority in relation to pupils. In recent years, however, there has been a growing move in a number of countries including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and USA, for adults to listen purposefully and respectfully to young people in the context of formal schooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1365480212469713">Fielding, 2009</xref>). Consideration is now often given to learners’ perspectives and ‘voices’ on aspects of school-related issues and experiences, particularly those which affect their learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1365480212469713">Flutter, 2007</xref>). As this article is based on two UK-based student voice projects, we focus our consideration here on recent UK government legislation which has resulted in extending opportunities for young people to have a greater say in decisions affecting their lives and experiences generally, as well as their experiences at school specifically. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1365480212469713">DfES (2004)</xref> policy ‘Every child matters: Change for children’ set out a national framework for local change programmes to build services around the needs of children and young people, and this included an expectation that children, young people and their families would be listened to when assessing and planning service provision. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1365480212469713">2008</xref> the DCSF document ‘Working together: Listening to the voices of children and young people’ considered the importance, and significant benefits, of taking account of children’s and young peoples’ views and working with them, and advocated for the inclusion of children and young people’s voices and decisions as a means to increase their engagement in learning. These New Labour initiatives and policy changes have have contributed towards pupil voice work now becoming a widely recognized part of working with young people in schools. At the time of writing, there is uncertainty as to whether or not the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government will continue to prioritize the involvement of young people in decision-making around issues which affect them.</p>
<p>Alongside such pupil voice policy developments, and closely linked to them, is the notion of the ‘personalization of learning’, which was launched as a national policy in England in 2004. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1365480212469713">Milliband (2004)</xref> defined personalized learning as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>High expectations of every child, given practical form by high quality teaching based on a sound knowledge and understanding of each child’s needs. . . . It means shaping teaching around the way different youngsters learn: it means taking the care to nurture the unique talents of every pupil.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Personalized learning involves learning being ‘personalized’ to suit the learning needs of individuals, and includes learners having a say in how they would like to learn and to take on some responsibility for their own learning. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1365480212469713">Underwood et al. (2007</xref>, p. 13) it is a means of:<disp-quote>
<p>. . . tailoring of pedagogy, curriculum, and learning support to meet the needs and aspirations of individual learners irrespective of ability, culture or social status, in order to nurture the unique talents of every pupil.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What is relevant to our purposes here is that personalized learning in practice means that learners’ voices are given more weight in making decisions about their learning, that they may be given opportunities to work in ways they choose; and that learners are given greater freedom to exercise preferences over topics and areas of study.</p>
<p>These different but allied policies have led many schools in the UK to pay greater attention to eliciting the views of their young people. As a result, many schools in the UK are now ‘doing student voice work’ and listening to learners, however, the ‘doing’ of such work can look very different in different schools. These differences may arise, in part, because adults’ interpretations of what ‘giving pupils a voice’ means, and how to implement that in practice, vary enormously. Such differences may arise from normative expectations about when, where and how students’ voices should be heard, and the extent to which pupils are considered to be capable of voicing opinions, or of having adequate, appropriate knowledge of school-related issues to make their voices legitimate or meaningful. In some cases, student representation is merely tokenistic and is more about students being seen to be involved in school processes rather than being active partners of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1365480212469713">Thomson, 2011</xref>), while in others, schools make genuine attempts to involve students within decision-making processes. In what follows we focus on two case studies of recent student voice work in order to provide detailed reflection upon the processes involved and, from that, we analyse the ways in which issues of power and participation are ingrained within elements of school-based student voice practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1365480212469713" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>Both student voice projects took place within one Local Authority (LA) in the southwest of England which was keen to promote student voice work within both their primary and secondary schools. All mainstream primary and secondary schools within one area of the LA were invited to participate in the initiative, and five primary and four secondary schools indicated a desire to be involved. The LA funded one of the authors, Dr Carol Robinson, to support staff and students in these schools to develop and conduct student-led research projects within their schools. This involved visiting each of the schools on three occasions over two school terms to generate ideas specifically about: how to begin a student-led research project; how to analyse the data collected; and how to act on the initial research findings. She was also involved in ongoing email contact with the students when they had queries about the running of their projects. After working with the schools for two terms, the author engaged in discussion with the staff and students involved in the running of their projects. The aim of these discussions was to ascertain staff and students’ perceptions on a) whether the conduct of the Student as Researchers (SaR) projects provided genuine opportunities for students to voice their opinions; and b) whether the research outcomes enabled them to influence change within their schools. During these discussions, some interesting insights into the power relations within the school were articulated by staff and students, and it is from these reflections and from observations made by the author involved in the SaR projects, that this paper has emerged. The specific cases discussed in this article involve two schools, one primary and one secondary.</p>
<p>The work in both schools involved a group of students working on SaR projects. SaR projects constitute a particular kind of student voice work through their focus on involving students in ‘real life’ research practices. The primary goal of SaR work is to enable students to conduct research amongst their peers – and sometimes their teachers, parents and governors and the wider school community to produce knowledge based on students’ views and voices. SaR practices aim to feed into school change processes with the intention of improving students’ experiences. SaR involves students learning about research processes, developing their skills, enhancing peer communication, and improving student–teacher relations through dialogue. Various students have seen SaR as beneficial to team-working and developing pupils’ confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1365480212469713">Atweh &amp; Bland, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1365480212469713">Fielding, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1365480212469713">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1365480212469713">Kincheloe &amp; Steinberg, 1998</xref>). SaR shares the principles and values of student voice work but student voice is wider in its focus. Within this article, we treat SaR as a sub-set of student voice practice.</p>
<p>The empirical data are based on original case studies of the school-based SaR projects. As educational cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1365480212469713">Bassey, 2003</xref>) they have the benefit of offering a detailed exploration of how power and participation are effected through school processes, teacher practices and students’ experiences. Our cases offer insights into instances and, as such, they are bounded, specific, integrated and patterned examples of educational action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1365480212469713">Stake, 2003</xref>). In the next section we present a brief outline of each of the cases. This is followed by a detailed analysis of the power relations which impact on the work of the SaR group, and a discussion of how this affects pupils’ levels of participation within the SaR projects.</p>

<title>The Students as Researchers projects</title>
<p>During each of the three visits made by one of the authors to the schools, the SaR groups were taken out of lessons and worked on their SaR project with the author. In the primary school the class teacher was present on each of these occasions, and in the secondary school a member of the senior management team was present. In between visits the teachers supporting the projects met with the SaR group within their school on a regular, normally fortnightly, basis.</p>
<sec id="section5-1365480212469713">
<title>The primary school case: SaR project: How children learn best</title>
<p>The school caters for pupils in the 4–11 age range; it has approximately 230 pupils on roll and is situated in an urban area. According to the school’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1365480212469713">Ofsted Report (2007)</xref> the school is in an area of high social deprivation; well above average number of pupils are eligible for free school meals; nearly half of all pupils have been identified as having learning difficulties or disabilities; and a high number of pupils have statements of special educational need.</p>
<sec id="section6-1365480212469713">
<title>The conduct of the SaR project</title>
<p>At the outset of the SaR project, the class teacher responsible for taking the work forward in the school invited six students from her Year 6 class (10–11 year-olds) to be part of the SaR project. The teacher’s decision on which students to invite were based on ‘. . . <italic>trying to get a mix of abilities, I specifically chose pupils from different friendship groups and pupils who were not all ‘natural leaders’</italic> (Year 6 class teacher).</p>
<p>Once the SaR group was established, the class teacher asked the group to identify an area of their school life they would like to explore. Pupils were encouraged to develop their own ideas and the teacher, along with one of the authors of this article, purposefully tried not to steer the pupils’ discussions. Pupils discussed various ideas, such as whether the classroom layout should be altered and whether the toilets should be re-decorated. However, they finally chose to focus on learning, and entitled their project ‘How children learn best’.</p>
<p>Pupils chose to construct a questionnaire asking others about what helps their learning. The questionnaire included statements such as: Do you learn when you pair up? Do you learn on your own with a teacher or TA? Do you learn as a class with the teacher at the front? Do you learn in a group? To accompany each statement, the pupils included a photograph of each of the situations described. Learners were requested to indicate which of the options ‘Always’, ‘Sometimes’, Not very often’, ‘Never’ they considered most appropriate for each statement. For learners in Year 1 (5–6 year-olds), a similar questionnaire was written but they were requested to circle a smiley face, a ‘normal’ face or a sad face in response to each question. Questionnaires were administered with one class within each of Years 1, 4 and 6; in total 108 pupils completed the questionnaire.</p>
<p>After analysing the data, the SaR group concluded that there was no one dominant way in which learners within the school preferred to learn, and that some pupils considered they did not learn in some situations. The SaR group then spent time in each class within Years 3, 4, 5 and 6 asking learners what skills they thought were necessary for learners to possess in order for learning to take place in each of the given situations on the questionnaire. From the data collected during these discussions, the SaR group drew up lists of the skills needed when learning within different situations, for example, when working with a Teaching Assistant pupils needed to be able to ask questions, to listen carefully, to concentrate, and to allow others to speak. These lists were then displayed in each of the classrooms, and teachers made reference to the relevant lists to remind pupils of the skills needed in different teaching and learning situations. The author was contracted to be involved with the schools for two terms, at the end of this period the SaR group and their class teacher were in discussion about ways in which teachers could work to equip learners with the skills needed for each of the learning situations.</p>

<title>The secondary school case: SaR project: How to raise students’ aspirations</title>
<p>This school is a mixed urban comprehensive catering for pupils in the 11–16 age range with approximately 960 pupils on roll. According to a recent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1365480212469713">Ofsted Report (2008)</xref> the overall socio-economic circumstances of the students are comparatively disadvantaged; there are a greater proportion of students with behavioural, emotional or social difficulties than found nationally; and the number of learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities is above the national average.</p>
<sec id="section8-1365480212469713">
<title>The conduct of the SaR project</title>
<p>Six students in Year 10 (14-15 year-olds) were invited by one of the deputy principals to be part of a SaR group. She purposefully chose students who she considered were articulate, well behaved, popular and:<disp-quote>
<p>students who are likely to ‘stick’ at the project, we need students that others will respond to, so they’ve got to be popular and reliable but at the same time, I’m purposefully not choosing the ‘boffins’ because some students just won’t relate to them. (Deputy principal of secondary school)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At the first meeting of the SaR group, the deputy principal asked the group to consider what changes could be made within their school to improve their experience of school. Both the deputy principal and one of the authors were present during these discussions and both made a conscious effort to allow the pupils to decide on an area which they considered to be important to them, and only intervened when asked to do so by the pupils. The group finally decided to focus their research around exploring why so many pupils within their school appeared to have low aspirations and what could be done to increase the aspirations of learners. The SaR groups articulated their views of low aspirations as relating to, for example, the lack of respect a large proportion of learners showed towards teachers, other pupils and the school environment; the poor behaviour of a large number of pupils who ‘wasted time’ in lessons; and the general attitude of many learners who simply ‘couldn’t be bothered’ to complete set work.</p>
<p>The SaR group wrote a questionnaire which requested pupils to indicate if they agreed or disagreed with various statements relating to, for example, whether they: considered teachers placed high expectations upon them; felt respected by staff; respected staff; were usually happy at school; were bullied at school; and valued learning. Approximately 180 questionnaires were administered during tutorial time to approximately half of all tutor groups in Years 8, 9 and 10 (all groups were organized in mixed ability groupings). Teachers were also asked to complete the questionnaire to indicate how they thought the students would have responded to the questions.</p>
<p>The SaR group analysed the data and identified what they considered to be the main areas of weakness within the school that led to low aspirations, for example, teachers not placing high expectations on learners, and learners not paying attention in lessons. The author’s involvement with the school ended when the SaR group were at the stage of holding interviews with students from each of the year groups involved in order to try to determine students’ views on what could be done to raise students’ aspirations.</p>

<title>Reflections on, and insights into, the power dimensions at play in the conduct of the SaR projects: Overview</title>
<p>From discussions with staff and students involved in the SaR projects it became apparent that relations of power were a significant dimension at play in terms of decision-making in the conduct of the SaR projects. In both SaR cases, the local authority, the heads of the two schools, and the members of staff involved in schools were all committed to, and had a particular interest in, student voice work. They supported, valued and ‘believed in’ student voice as an educational practice. The commitment of the LA was evident in that they funded an advisor (one of the authors) to support the projects; the heads were willing to release a member of staff from teaching or other duties in order to take the work forward in school; and the members of staff endeavoured to implement the SaR projects fully at classroom level. However, even given these levels of commitment, the problematic nature of SaR practice, when analysed in relation to the dynamics of power and participation, became evident. Such dynamics of power are highlighted in the following discussion which draws upon the perceptions of staff and students involved in the SaR projects.</p>
<p>Having outlined the methods and procedures of SaR within the two cases, we now consider the data generated by discussions with staff and students and observations by the author involved in the projects, and turn to a specific exploration of the relations of power in SaR practice. We consider various theorizations of power in order to develop a deeper understanding of how endeavours to ‘give students a voice’ can be constrained by the power relations which underpin the dominant norms and processes which existed in the respective schools. The discussion focuses first on power as ‘overt’ domination and then power as ‘hidden’ domination.</p>
<sec id="section10-1365480212469713">
<title>Power as overt domination: Power by virtue of hierarchical authority, status and institutional role</title>
<p>The presence of power relations was evident in the initial setting up of the SaR projects. Taking power to refer to authority, where power is gained by virtue of position or by expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1365480212469713">Allen, 2000</xref>), power is clearly enmeshed within the relations which enabled the projects to commence. Power here is understood as overt authoritative power, where those in an authoritative position use their authority to empower or enable others in a less authoritative position to become legitimately involved in, and take forward, an aspect of practice. In our cases, the power of the local authority (LA) is evident in terms of the hierarchical position it holds vis-à-vis schools: the LA was a significant fund holder and was prepared to fund those institutions which had agreed to take on board an aspect of practice which the LA favoured. Thus, financial control enabled the LA to empower only those particular schools which agreed to operate within the boundaries it set on student voice work, and which complied with the advice and prescriptions given on how this aspect of practice should be taken forward in their schools. Allied to this, the LA approved of school-based SaR projects which in turn empowered those head teachers who wanted to be involved. The head teachers’ approval then served to empower members of staff and students within the school to be involved in the work. However, at the same time and alongside such empowerment, those members of staff who did not share the head teachers’ views or who were opposed to SaR projects, may have found themselves decisively disempowered. Staff involved in the running of the SaR projects commented that some staff within their schools were sceptical about increasing the level of student voice work in their schools as they were concerned that this may undermine the voice of teachers within the school. The authoritative position of the head teacher and their decision to introduce SaR work in the school, however, meant that the work would go ahead in schools, regardless of the opinion of those who were sceptical or disapproving of it. The deployment of power here may be understood as the ‘systematic and unreciprocated transfer of power’ between social groupings, and is a use of power that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1365480212469713">Young (1990)</xref> views as one of the five forms of ‘oppression’. Young’s argument is useful in cautioning against any understandings of oppression as structural or essential, and emphasizes instead (as we do in this SaR case) the contextual and local production of oppressive power relations.</p>
<p>At the level of the school, power held by members of staff in hierarchical authoritative positions manifested itself in their freedom to choose specific students to be involved in the respective SaR projects. During reflections on the selection of students for the SaR projects, staff and students from the secondary school commented:<disp-quote>
<p>It just came naturally to chose who to be involved, it’s what we do, we use our judgment to chose who we think is the most suited. (Secondary school teacher)</p>
<p>I suppose we didn’t really question the fact that staff chose us to be involved, that’s just what we’re used to in school. (Member of secondary school SaR group)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The fact that neither the staff nor the students questioned this act demonstrates the acceptability, indeed the ‘taken-for-granted’ nature of cultural norms relating to modes of authority (and domination) which infuse existing teacher–pupil power relationship. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1365480212469713">Lynch and Lodge (2002)</xref> acknowledged, power relations between students and teachers tend not to be problematized, but are taken as a hierarchical given. In addition, the fact that schools are organized in hierarchical terms, means that the ability to exercise degrees of power is associated both with formal roles and with particular status identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1365480212469713">Lynch &amp; Lodge, 2002</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1365480212469713">Harber and Mncube (2011)</xref> acknowledges that schooling can actively perpetuate authoritarianism, and the struggle to ensure that schools provide genuine opportunities as a safe, peaceful and democratic environment for learners continues. This also resonates with work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1365480212469713">Haugaard (2012)</xref> who argues that social norms create realms of legitimate authority that empower and disempower the social actors relative to each other.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1365480212469713">
<title>Power as ‘hidden’ domination: Power by virtue of perceived hierarchical positions</title>
<p>As described above, in each case study the process of identifying an area to research was conducted through discussions between members of the SaR groups in the presence of two adults – a member of staff and one of the authors. In each case, the discussions involved minimum adult intervention or steering, with the adults endeavouring to give students opportunities to discuss their opinions openly. While this is clearly good student voice practice, there are nevertheless still aspects of ‘hidden’ dominant power present. For example, there is the unstated assumption that certain aspects of school practice, such as the general structures of school organization, could not be challenged. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1365480212469713">Thomson and Gunter (2006</xref>, p. 854) noted in their study of pupils-as-researchers, students’ lives and selves are deeply embedded in discourses which position them as individualized ‘consuming children’. In our cases, such discourses could be seen as underpinning ‘hidden’ dominant power which constrained the focus of SaR projects, given that students have an awareness that their choice of subject had to be approved by the member of staff leading the project, as well as by the broader dominant network within the school. The detailed practices evident within our cases lend support to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1365480212469713">Lemke’s (1990)</xref> acknowledgement that unequal student–teacher power relations mean that teachers get to decide what counts as knowledge, and that this in turn influences the approach to research and restricts the feedback and opinions students give. Our cases draw attention to the micro, but nonetheless significant constraints which covertly attend the staff/pupil dialogues which took place within SaR group meetings and which influenced the SaR group’s choice of focus. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1365480212469713">Noyles (2005)</xref> rightly points out that power differentials between staff and pupils require careful negotiation and critique in order to allow pupils to shape such dialogues, this sort of critique was not evident in our examples.</p>
<p>The presence of members of staff, routinely seen by students as being authority figures within the school, is likely to have compounded students’ desires to focus on ‘safe’ areas they knew would meet the teachers’ approval. The reasons for this will be historical and various. Most obviously, there is the influence on students’ perceptions of the teacher as the one ‘in control’ of what is taught, how it is taught, when it is taught and the academic and behavioural expectations placed on them. When reflecting on their focus research areas, students commented that they found it difficult to finalize their focus area because <italic>‘we had to chose something that we could make a change to make our lives in school better’</italic>. Further discussion revealed that students within the secondary school considered that areas relating to pedagogy or to certain aspects of the school organization could not be within their remit in terms of developing a research project, as these are <italic>‘bigger things. . . that the head teacher and the governors sort out’</italic> (member of the secondary school SaR group). Similarly, in the primary school one student commented, <italic>‘It’s the teachers who decide about the lessons and Miss [head teacher] decides about what the teachers do, we don’t really make decisions in school.’</italic> This evidence indicates the subtle ways students automatically positioned themselves in relation to what they saw as the more powerful adults in the school. In doing so, they are embodying ways of being-in-the-world in which, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1365480212469713">Haugaard (2012)</xref> explains, require actors to reproduce specific meanings associated with authority positions. This example also demonstrates the power of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1365480212469713">Bernstein’s (1971</xref>, pp. 49–50) concept of ‘frame’ which refers to ‘the specific pedagogical relationship of teacher and taught’; his conception of framing as the ‘degree of control staff and pupils possess over the selection, organization and pacing of the knowledge transmitted and received in the pedagogical relationship’, has clear resonance with our cases. Framing, as an everyday pedagogic practice imbued with hidden dominant power relations, raises questions about the extent to which the topics suitable for discussion were in fact open to negotiation.</p>
<p>It seems likely, then, on evidence from these cases that students within the SaR groups were positioned as less powerful by the very SaR processes that the teachers were aiming to use to empower them, with the result that they only felt able to voice opinions which conformed to the limited remit which they knew in advance would be met with approval. In addition, the physical presence of a member of staff is likely to have summoned up notions of past relationships and the subtle modes of dominance which come with them which position the member of staff as the ‘knower’ and the students as ‘unknowing’. Following on from this, we argue that such knowledge processes involve much more than the transmission, acquisition or even negotiation of facts or ‘content’; they involve processes whereby students are disciplined to the norms expected by the staff and the school. By ‘disciplined’ we do not mean any form of overt or covert punishment but the everyday normalization processes which invoke established institutional and hierarchical norms and standards. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1365480212469713">Foucault (1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1365480212469713">1980)</xref> argues these normalization processes are a routine mode of governmentality and, as our example shows, they work to condition students’ identities, behaviours and expectations in a context of unequal teacher–student power relations.</p>
<p>Another significant factor is the presence of one of the authors as an ‘outside advisor’ who, as such, also occupied a position of power. All students and staff present were aware of the author’s belief in, and commitment to, the importance of ‘giving students a voice’. While this may have served to empower pupils to feel ‘safe’ in voicing their opinions in the knowledge that the ‘outsider’ present would approve of them voicing their perceptions of aspects of their school life, an alternative reading is that the author’s presence served to disempower both staff and students. As an ‘expert’ from a university, she brings with her the perceived legitimacy of elite modes of knowledge production as well as the status traditionally accorded to universities. For these reasons, her role may have created an imbalance in power relations from the start. One small but significant indicator of this is that the staff had relative difficulty in introducing the author to the students by her forename and without using her title of ‘Doctor’. Although the young people themselves appeared far more at ease with such informality, previous encounters in which a respected outsider is brought in to school, would doubtless have conditioned them to be ‘on their best behaviour’ and ‘to make a good impression’ in the presence of such a visitor. These factors could well have influenced the choice of topics pupils felt at ease to discuss, giving them even more reason to want to please the teachers leading the project and to identify research projects which they considered would be seen as ‘commendable’. Such caution concerning the extent to which student voice work can elicit the authentic voice of the student, especially in the presence of more powerful adults, is shared by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1365480212469713">Chadderton (2011)</xref>, who considers it naive to assume that where students offer a perspective it will give access to an essential unmediated self. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1365480212469713">Bhavnani (1990)</xref> also draws attention to the need to consider the power of researchers and their impact on contexts. While the forms of domination and control we discuss here are extremely subtle, almost ‘off the radar’, they do consistently work to regulate students’ (and teachers’) attitudes, expectations and behaviours.</p>
<p>The discussion so far has focused on institutional and pedagogic power relations, however, power is also implicated in all social relations, including between the students themselves. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1365480212469713">Alcoff (1992)</xref> points out, rituals of speaking are constituted by power relations of domination, exploitation and subordination. In our cases, power relations between students in the SaR group impacted on who spoke and who listened. For example, within the primary school SaR group, one of the boys demonstrated confidence in relation to the wording of the questions on the questionnaire with the outcome that the quieter pupils did not articulate their opinions. Similarly, in the secondary school SaR group some girls displayed a greater confidence in articulating their opinions, often silencing the views of others in the group.</p>
<p>The enduring problem of including/excluding certain voices has been raised consistently by feminist researchers on voice. The complexity of the problem is indicated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1365480212469713">Jackson (2003)</xref> who argues against any easy presumption that to include silenced voices is unproblematically emancipatory. Indeed, practices which aim for greater polyvocality and which are often presumed to represent more diverse practices of inclusion and participation are cautioned against by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1365480212469713">Bhavnani (1990)</xref>, who points out that the inclusion of hitherto silenced voices may itself be manipulative. This was certainly the case in our examples particularly in that it was the staff who chose SaR group members. Other powerful and broader forms of exclusion permeated the project in both schools: choosing some students meant excluding a significant proportion of the student body; while the process of administering questionnaires to only some of the student body served to exclude many others.</p>
<p>Having discussed some of the micro-practices of how power operated within the two chosen SaR case studies, we now broaden the discussion to review some theoretical understandings of power and what they may offer in understanding the transformative potential of student voice work.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section13-1365480212469713">
<title>Understandings of power and the transformative nature of student voice work in the context of SaR projects</title>
<p>The SaR projects discussed above explicitly aimed to empower pupils to voice their opinions on aspects of their school experience which were important to them, with a view to making changes to aspects of school practices, depending on the findings from their SaR projects. These aims resonate with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1365480212469713">Apple and Beane’s (1995)</xref> notions of democratic schooling. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1365480212469713">Beane and Apple (1999)</xref> in a democratic school, all of those directly involved in the school, including young people, have the right to participate in the process of decision making. However, they acknowledge that many schools silence the voices of those outside the dominant culture, ‘particularly. . . the young’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1365480212469713">1999</xref>, p. 15) and we see this working through in our examples. The positioning of students, both collectively as a student group and individually, in relation to the school’s dominant culture is of relevance here. Our understanding of the term ‘culture’ relates to the school’s organizational culture and broadly refers to a definition given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1365480212469713">Schein (2011)</xref> in which he defines ‘organizational culture’ as the ‘shared philosophies, ideologies, beliefs, feelings, assumptions, expectations, attitudes, norms and values’. Such beliefs, values and norms influence the way members think, feel and behave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1365480212469713">Lunemburg, 2011</xref>). Certainly, in our case study schools, particularly in relation to the choice of SaR topic, the dominant culture expressed itself through the ideologies and values of the head teacher and other senior staff, and it was evident that where students (or staff) do not strive towards enacting these ideologies, or where they display attitudes and behaviour which do not favour them, the dominant culture of the school works to actively or subtly work to silence these voices.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1365480212469713">Giroux’s (1981)</xref> consideration of how power operates in the classroom in both visible and not so visible ways resonates with the way power has been categorized in the above discussion of overt and hidden domination. According to Giroux visible power is manifest in hierarchical relations, top-to-bottom methods of communication, rigid time-schedules, rigid prescriptions about classroom behaviour, and inflexible modes of evaluation, all of which position the student as a spectator rather than a choice-making participant in educational interactions. Giroux’s concepts are useful to our SaR examples in that, although the students were consciously positioned as participants rather than spectators, the ‘choice making’ element of their role was heavily constrained by the over-riding visible (and in some cases, not so visible) power dimensions of the teacher–pupil relationship which, as we have shown, impacted on the students’ behaviour, and on the choice of topics discussed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1365480212469713">Freire’s (1972)</xref> view that an outcome of many of the processes present in schools result in some of the student body being left feeling oppressed, has some relevance here.</p>
<p>While these views from the field of critical pedagogy offer some important insights, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1365480212469713">Giddens (1979)</xref> offers an alternative view. He suggests that the unequal nature of power relationships derives from differences in access which individuals have to economic and authoritative resources, and he acknowledges that authoritative resources have the capacity to control the time, space and social interactions of others. Our examples have demonstrated how teachers have relatively greater access than pupils to such resources, and pupils accept that teachers control pupils in time and space through the curricular and pedagogical evaluative practices. Our study shows how the authoritative resources possessed by the adults in the school were apparent in many aspects of the SaR work for example, when staff ‘invited’ students to be part of the SaR groups, and when they requested that students attend a meeting at a time, for a set duration, and at a location decided on by the member of staff.</p>
<p>Foucault’s theories offer yet another useful perspective which illuminates other aspects of the working of power within the SaR projects. In his theorization, power is not something possessed by individuals, rather it is something which ‘circulates’ and individuals are ‘always in the position of simultaneously undergoing and exercising this power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1365480212469713">Foucault, 1980</xref>, p. 98). In his discussions of institutions as agents of social control he acknowledges that children in school are ranked according to age, gender and perceived ability and subjected to a range of practices which demarcate them as ‘other’ in their relations with adults in school. He sees discourse as a crucial practice in promoting and legitimizing such norms. Foucault’s understanding of power helps illuminate how not only overt but also how hidden forms of domination operate by, for example, working their way into our imagination and constraining the way we act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1365480212469713">Foucault, 1980</xref>). In terms of the SaR projects, we can see that power has worked its way into students’ imaginations, not only constraining how the student researchers act in the presence of teachers, but also conditioning the verbal and questionnaire responses of other students. For example, when responding to questions posed by the SaR group, other students gave responses which they knew would garner approval of the student researchers, who were now themselves positioned as institutionally, and thus legitimately, authoritative. The subtle presence of hidden domination within the circulation of power amongst pupil groups, as well as between teachers and students, has significant implications in terms of the transformative potential of SaR projects more broadly, not just in these particular cases.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1365480212469713">Bourdieu and Passeron’s (1977)</xref> notion of institutionalized forms of cultural capital adds an interesting dimension to understandings of school culture and helps explains the part played by schools in reproducing unequal economic and social structures and relationships. Bourdieu and Passeron see cultural capital as consisting of those informal academic standards which are also class attributes of the dominant class. In relation to the SaR projects, we can clearly see that the students’ ‘safe’ choice of research topic quite unquestioningly reproduces the school’s dominant cultural capital. In addition, we see Bourdieu’s (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1365480212469713">Giroux, 1981</xref>) contention that teachers relate to students differently as a result of the cultural capital students bring with them, at work in teachers’ processes of student selection. For example, the students in the SaR group were those who were known to adhere to school expectations concerning school uniform, completing homework, participating in lessons, arriving on time for lessons, and talking politely to teachers. In addition, the focus and shaping of both SaR projects supported the institutional cultural norms of the school in that both were easily allied to their school’s agenda for improving student achievement, enhancing performance and skills, and school improvement. We are not claiming that students were either consciously or overtly manipulated, as they clearly were not. However, the evidence from the cases indicates the subtle ways in which students’ ostensible empowerment through SaR is aligned with school institutional agendas, which help the school to enhance its normative, dominant institutional and cultural capital. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1365480212469713">Fairclough (1989)</xref> acknowledges, those usual institutional practices people draw upon without thinking, often embody assumptions which directly or indirectly legitimize existing power relations.</p>
<p>It is the case that both schools embarked on the SaR projects with a view to making changes as a result of the findings. However, as our analysis of these two cases shows, the processes involved in implementing the research projects, the topics researched and the changes made as a result of the findings were unlikely to take staff or pupils outside of their comfort zone or to challenge what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1365480212469713">Giroux (1981)</xref> refers to as the structural restraints in schools, that is, those ideas, values, norms and processes which serve to create and maintain pupils in their positions of relative powerlessness in most schools. From this, we would argue that the measures taken by the schools to give pupils a voice did not serve to challenge or re-define, in any significant way, the nature of existing forms of domination or the notions of power historically present within these particular school settings.</p>
<p>Concerns that student voice work may serve to reproduce the role of student as the less powerful in the student–teacher relationship have been documented over many years. Hart’s Ladder of Participation was used to consider ways in which children were listened to, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1365480212469713">Hart (1992)</xref> acknowledged that some forms of listening to young people was manipulative and tokenistic, while other methods were more child-initiated and involved shared decisions being made with adults. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1365480212469713">Lodge (2005)</xref> has explored student voice across a range from that which assumes a role of quality control to that which is based on open dynamic dialogue in which students ‘are viewed as active participants’ with listening and speaking being the twin responsibilities of all parties. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1365480212469713">Lodge’s (2008)</xref> asserts that such dialogic interactions require openness to differences as a foundation for a consideration of alternatives, and that this will enable changes to understandings, and actions to take place. Only partial elements of this practice were in evidence in the projects considered here, which perhaps accounts for the limited nature of the changes they entail.</p>
<p>It has also been acknowledged, however, that for the teacher–student power balance to shift in order that students become active participants in the teacher–student dialogue, this requires a major shift on the part of both teachers and students in ways of thinking about issues of knowledge, language, power and self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1365480212469713">Oldfather, 1995</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1365480212469713">Cook-Sather (2006)</xref> asserted that student voice work requires a cultural shift that opens up spaces and minds not only to the sound but also to the presence and power of students.</p>
<p>The above discussion has considered some of the ways in which power impacts in negative ways on participation in SaR practice. From this we argue for a need to recognize the power dynamics between adults and young people in their roles as students, and to take steps to shift these power imbalances. This may involve a recognition that power is productive, that it is a key factor in the formation of social identities, and opens the possibility for change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1365480212469713">Foucault, 1979</xref>). Part of the legacy of critical pedagogy that we may want to hang onto is that education is part of a struggle for a better world, and no doubt our case study schools engaged in student voice work as part of that struggle. While our analysis of the cases indicate that the micro-practices of SaR implementation radically condition its potentially transformative power, this does not mean we should give up on the potential for student voice to include more diverse voices and greater participation by students in the life of their schools.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1365480212469713">United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989</xref>, UN General Assembly resolution 44/25) gives children a right of participation, that is a right to express views, to be heard and to take part in decisions that affect them, and many schools are working towards giving young people a voice in schools. By focusing on the micro-practices of two SaR projects we have been able to critically examine the ways in which power conditions what is possible in SaR work. The article has considered various theorizations of power. The aim has been to use the analytical tools offered by these theorizations to draw insights out of the two case studies. Our focus on what they can offer gives us analytical purchase in explaining our cases.</p>
<p>The analysis provides fresh insights into ways in which the voices of students may be co-opted by dominant school agendas and incorporated within the power relations at play within schools. Through the cases, we have considered power in the context of the complex interactions between institutional structures and teacher–student relations, and considered how aspects of overt and hidden domination can impact on how individuals are able to influence others, and how such forms of domination can serve to curtail the actions and voices of some individuals. The cases considered lead us to question whether staff and students can meet as genuine partners with a shared undertaking of making meaning of their work together. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1365480212469713">Olitsky and Weathers (2005)</xref> acknowledge, while involving students as researchers can have some powerful benefits, including collaborative research which leads to mutual understanding, participants’ empowerment and positive change, they also acknowledge that such methods do not solve the problem of unequal power between the researcher and the researched.</p>
<p>The evidence from the two SaR projects discussed in this article indicates that the processes involved in the running of the projects, as well as the outcomes, have little impact on school hierarchies and that unequal power relations within the schools remain intact and unchallenged. Having said that, some small, positive changes did take place, such as teachers placing greater value on listening to learners. This may take us some small way in the direction of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1365480212469713">Apple’s (2011)</xref> idea of a democratic school; such ‘local’ transformations are important steps in changing the culture and the power relations within schools. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1365480212469713">Foucault (1980)</xref> reminds us, power in not static, and an ‘unsettling’ of existing power relations at the micro-level can impact on transformations in institutionally hierarchical teacher–pupil power relationships. We would like to see student voice practice become a more effective means of negotiating and contesting hierarchical power relations within schools, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1365480212469713">Fielding’s (2001)</xref> vision suggests it might. However, we are left, rather uncomfortably, with a series of concerns about the extent to which student voice may work, even if entirely unintentionally, reinscribes pedagogic and institutional control.</p>
