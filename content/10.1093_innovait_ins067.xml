<p>Strabismus (squint) is a commonly encountered eye problem in children. It affects approximately 4% of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-innovait_ins067">Donnelly, Stewart, &amp; Hollinger, 2005</xref>) and can cause visual and psychological disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-innovait_ins067">Menon, Saha, Tandon, Mehta, &amp; Khokhar, 2002</xref>). Although most cases are idiopathic, strabismus can indicate a more serious underlying problem, such as retinoblastoma or cataract. New onset strabismus in a school-aged child for example may warrant a neurological evaluation.</p>
<p>Therefore the early detection and management of childhood squint are crucial to aid successful visual development and provide best potential for binocular vision. The referring physician plays a pivotal role in this process as the allocation of hospital ophthalmology appointments relies on the information provided in the referral letter.</p>
<sec id="sec1-innovait_ins067">
<title>Standard</title>
<p>Good quality referral letters are part of good clinical care. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-innovait_ins067">The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (2011)</xref> states that adequate clinical information is essential to allow the hospital clinician to assess clinical need and urgency. This audit was undertaken to assess the adequacy and the reliability of clinical information recorded in letters from GPs sent to a tertiary paediatric ophthalmology department in London.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-innovait_ins067">
<title>Design</title>
<p>This article describes a prospective observational audit of GP referral letters for squint assessment received by Moorfields Eye Hospital paediatric ophthalmology department between November 2010 and February 2011. Exclusion criteria were re-referrals, patients initially seen by opticians and second opinions already seen by another ophthalmologist.</p>
<p>We assessed the content of the GP letters for the documentation of information that allows the ophthalmologist to determine if the referral was urgent or routine. We noted whether the following were recorded:</p>
<list id="list1-innovait_ins067" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>age</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>direction of deviation (convergent/divergent)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>duration or onset of symptoms</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>whether the squint was constant or intermittent</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>presence of visual concerns or other worrying symptoms</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>general health</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>development</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>attempt by GP to perform an ocular examination</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>red reflex examination</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>whether the GP deemed the referral urgent</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data. The agreement between the GP and the ophthalmologist regarding the urgency of the referral was analysed using the Kappa test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-innovait_ins067" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Over the 3 month audit period, 98 primary GP referrals for squint assessment were received. Of these, four were deemed urgent by the GP and two by the ophthalmologist. The agreement was good (Kappa = 0.657 and 95% confidence interval = 0.216–1.099). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-innovait_ins067">Table 1</xref> shows the percentage of referral letters that had the relevant information recorded.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, referrals for paediatric squint from GPs to ophthalmology services in the UK have not been reported in the literature. Our main findings were that only 1 in 25 paediatric squints referred by GPs were deemed to be urgent at the point of referral and that vetting ophthalmologists tend to agree with the urgency on the basis of the information in the letter. The information provided in the letter was patchy, with important details often omitted. Two of the referred cases were deemed urgent by the ophthalmologist on the basis of complete lack of information provided in the referral letter except for the patient's demographics. Comment on the red reflex examination was omitted in over 90% of cases.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of paediatric squints are caused by benign causes, with serious pathologies being rare. For example, retinoblastoma occurs with an incidence of about 40 cases/year in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-innovait_ins067">MacCarthy <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). In this situation, it is vital that important positive and negative features of the history and examination are included to allow an appropriate urgency of appointment to be allocated.</p>
<p>We consider the red reflex to be the single most important feature that can affect the urgency of the appointment. An absent red reflex is always worrying and, as retinoblastoma may present this way, requires urgent assessment. All GPs are trained to conduct red reflex examination as it is part of the 6 week baby check. However, only 8% of paediatric squint referrals in this audit contained information about the red reflex. Although there have been attempts at raising awareness of red reflex examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-innovait_ins067">Muen <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), clearly more work has to be done.</p>
<p>One feature that may be helpful in deciding urgency is speed of onset. The duration of the squint was not mentioned in 75% of cases. Benign squints can present acutely, but frequently, the history is of having noticed the squint ‘come on’ over a few months. Neurological squints, such as sixth (VI) nerve palsies, are often acute in onset. It is well known that acute onset squint in a child can be the first sign of a neurological malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-innovait_ins067">Dikici, Cicik, Akman, Kendiroglu, &amp; Tolun, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-innovait_ins067">Musazadeh, Hartmann, &amp; Simon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-innovait_ins067">Zweifach, 1981</xref>). Documenting the absence of other neurological concerns (reduced vision, headache, change in behaviour, and motor symptoms) is also therefore important.</p>
<p>Some of the details that were included more frequently in letters were the direction of deviation, and whether it was constant or intermittent. Although these are interesting features, they do not in themselves add any extra value in determining the urgency of the appointment needed, as both directions of squint can be due to serious causes, as can intermittently noticed squints.</p>
<p>It was positive to see that in nearly 40% of cases, an examination of the eye movements or the squint was made. This is to be encouraged, however, it rarely adds any further diagnostic or risk-assessment value. The exceptions to this are in detection of a VI nerve palsy or nystagmus. So documentation of ‘full abduction and no nystagmus’ is probably the most useful result of examining the eyes after the red reflex.</p>

<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>Various strategies can be employed locally to improve the quality of referral letters for paediatric squint. These include raising awareness of red-flag signs and improved training for GP registrars in the assessment of squint; however, we suggest that the most useful way of improving referrals would be the implementation of a proforma with tick-boxes for positive and negative features. Proformas have been shown to improve the quality of referrals in other specialities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-innovait_ins067">Djemal, Chia, &amp; Ubaya-Narayange, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-innovait_ins067">Imkampe, Bendall, &amp; Chianakwalam, 2006</xref>). We include our suggested form in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-innovait_ins067">Fig. 1</xref>, which we are now introducing, and plan to audit its effect on future referral letters in 6 months time.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>There is potential for increased GP education about the relevant information needed for paediatric squint assessment. As a result of this audit, we have implemented some guidelines to GPs in London for the initial assessment of squint and important clinical information to include in the referral letters in the form of a referral proforma in order to improve the appropriateness of referrals and better identification of potentially urgent squints. The impact of these guidelines will be audited in 6 months time.</p>
