<p>This article argues that the original name for the mountain on which Enoch made his offering in Eden was the mountain of incense (<italic>Jub</italic>. 4.25) and that it and the first mountain in 4.26 (the mountain of Eden/Paradise) are the same mountain. The second mountain in 4.26, the mountain of the east, is Mt Lubar where the ark landed at the end of the flood and where Noah lived until his death. All four mountains in 4.26 are places where God had or would specially reveal himself to chosen individuals and for that reason were holy to the Lord.</p>

<p>In the course of rewriting the early chapters of Genesis, the author of <italic>Jubilees</italic> names ‘four places on earth that belong to the Lord’ (4.26): ‘the Garden of Eden, the mountain of the east, this mountain on which you [Moses] are today—Mt Sinai—and Mt Zion …’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0951820712467877">1</xref></sup> Later, in 8.19, he again lists three of the four: the Garden of Eden, Mt Sinai, and Mt Zion, omitting the mountain of the east. The ways in which the writer speaks about these places and the contexts in which they figure have given rise to diverse interpretations. The present study examines two topics relevant to the four places in <italic>Jubilees</italic>: (1) the name of the mountain in <italic>Jub</italic>. 4.25—a name variously translated as the mountain of noon, the mountain of the south, or the mountain of incense; the choice one makes supplies some essential information for interpreting the list in v. 26; and (2) the list in 4.26, the relation of the mountain in v. 25 to it, and the identification of the mountain of the east. The two passages read as follows:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>He [Enoch] burned the evening incense of the sanctuary which is acceptable before the Lord on the mountain <italic>of incense</italic>. For there are four places on earth that belong to the Lord: the Garden of Eden, the mountain of the east, this mountain on which you are today—Mt Sinai—and Mt Zion (which) will be sanctified in the new creation for the sanctification of the earth. For this reason the earth will be sanctified from all its sins and from its uncleanness into the history of eternity. (4.25–26)</p>
<p>He [Noah] knew that the Garden of Eden is the holy of holies and is the residence of the Lord; (that) Mt Sinai is in the middle of the desert; and (that) Mt Zion is in the middle of the navel of the earth. The three of them—the one facing the other—were created as holy (places). (8.19)</p>

<title>1. The Mountain in <italic>Jubilees</italic> 4.25</title>
<p><italic>Jubilees</italic> relates that, at the end of his earthly career, the angels led Enoch into the Garden of Eden where he would record the events of human history in preparation for the judgment (4.23–24). The Ethiopic version of <italic>Jub</italic>. 4.25 reads: ‘He [Enoch] burned the evening incense of the sanctuary which is acceptable before the Lord on the mountain <italic>of incense</italic>.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0951820712467877">2</xref></sup> The first part of the verse presents him as a priest—a new role for him in Jewish literature of the second temple—and shows that his work paralleled that of Adam as he left the Garden of Eden. Adam had burned the morning incense offering (3.27); Enoch now makes the incense offering of the evening (see Exod. 30.7–8).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0951820712467877">3</xref></sup> So much is clear, and the reference to the sanctuary echoes the motif in ch. 3 that the garden is a sanctuary (3.12–13).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0951820712467877">4</xref></sup> The unclear element appears at the end of the verse where the Ethiopic text locates his sacrifice on the mountain of <italic>qatr</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0951820712467877">5</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Qatr</italic> means ‘midday, noon, noonday heat’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0951820712467877">6</xref></sup> As a result, the text actually says that Enoch burned his incense offering on the mountain of the noon—a surprising statement having nothing to do with the context or anything that precedes (or follows, for that matter) in <italic>Jubilees</italic>. As a result, experts have from the beginning made suggestions for reinterpretations or emendations. A. Dillmann, in the first translation of <italic>Jubilees</italic> into a modern European language, rendered it as ‘auf dem berge des südens’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0951820712467877">7</xref></sup> In his <italic>Lexicon</italic> he explained about <italic>qatr</italic>: ‘pro <italic>plaga meridioni</italic> usurpatum videtur’ (it appears to be used for the southern quarter).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0951820712467877">8</xref></sup> Quite understandably, other early translators of <italic>Jubilees</italic> followed the great scholar's lead: Littmann read ‘auf dem Berge des Südens’, and Schodde translated ‘on the hill of the south’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0951820712467877">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hermann Rönsch introduced a more convincing hypothesis into the study of the word <italic>qatr</italic> in <italic>Jub</italic>. 4.25.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0951820712467877">10</xref></sup> He wondered whether it had anything to do with ‭דטק‬, the Hebrew term for ‘incense’. To test his idea, he wrote to Dillmann who responded as follows: ‘<italic>Qatr</italic> sodann könnte als <italic>qetârě</italic> gelesen <italic>Räucherung, Rauchwerk</italic> bedeuten, da diese Wurzel allerdings auch in Aeth. vorkommt, aber ich sehe nicht ein, was damit gewonnen wäre’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0951820712467877">11</xref></sup> So, Dillmann did not accept Rönsch's idea but mentioned an alternative way of making the same point (though one in which he saw no advantage): rather than assuming a Hebrew word had survived in transliterated form through the translation of <italic>Jubilees</italic> from Hebrew into Greek and from Greek into Ethiopic, he raised the possibility that <italic>qatr</italic> was not the word for ‘noon’ but was related to another Ethiopic root: <italic>qtr</italic> II: ‘to fumigate, give off an odor’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0951820712467877">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>R.H. Charles diverged from his predecessors by rendering the latter part of v. 25 as ‘(even) sweet spices, acceptable before the Lord on the Mount’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0951820712467877">13</xref></sup> To arrive at his translation, he moved <italic>qatr</italic> from the end of the sentence to an earlier position<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0951820712467877">14</xref></sup> and understood it in line with Rönsch's suggestion. Regarding the translation of <italic>qatr</italic> as ‘south’, he wrote: ‘But this use of the word <italic>qatr</italic> is unexampled elsewhere. <italic>a</italic> [= ms. 12] omits it and writes the preceding word badabr. I have taken it as a corruption of qětârě = “sweet spices”. The words would point back to Exod. xxx.7 …’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0951820712467877">15</xref></sup> Moving the term to another place in the sentence seems unnecessary; at any rate, there is no manuscript support for the transposition. Otherwise, Charles simply adopted the suggestion that Dillmann had found unhelpful.</p>
<p>It might have seemed that with Charles’ explanation the position would have been established that <italic>qatr</italic> was a corruption or misspelling of <italic>qetārē</italic>, which means ‘incense’, and that <italic>Jub</italic>. 4.25 pictured Enoch as making his incense offering on the mountain of incense (dispensing with Charles’ change in word order as unneeded). However, with the publication of new textual evidence, the situation changed. In 1921 E. Tisserant isolated citations of <italic>Jubilees</italic> in a Syriac chronicle<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0951820712467877">16</xref></sup> and made the texts with translations of and comments on them available in an extended article. Among those sixteen citations is one that covers <italic>Jub</italic>. 4.25–26, and its different reading at the end of 4.25 introduced what seemed to be a confirmation of Dillmann's original intuition:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>He first offered the sacrifice of incense in the evening as a pleasing fragrance before the Lord on the mountain of the south. For there are four places that belong to the Lord: the mountain of the Garden of Eden, the mountain of the south, Mt Sinai, and Mt Zion. (4.25–26)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>So here the phrase is ‘the mountain of the south [<italic>tayměnāʾ</italic>]’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0951820712467877">17</xref></sup> Tisserant correctly observed that the presence of <italic>tayměnāʾ</italic>’ after ‘mountain’ supports the Ethiopic manuscripts that read a word here against ms. 12 which lacks one. In v. 26, where the Ethiopic copies refer to a mountain of the east, the Syriac again has ‘south’ (<italic>tayměnāʾ</italic>). Tisserant thought the two mountains in the Ethiopic manuscripts—the mountain of <italic>qatr</italic> and the mountain of the east—that are designated by the same name in the Syriac citation were actually one and the same mountain—a peak located toward the southeast, an area famous for its aromatic spices (see Gen. 10.30). He also referred to <italic>1 Enoch</italic> 29–31 where the patriarch journeys to the east to mountainous places filled with aromatic spices (ch. 31). Although he acknowledged that the original reading in <italic>Jub</italic>. 4.25 was uncertain, he thought a word for ‘incense’ appeared there and that the Greek or Ethiopic translator had found in it a name for a mountain to match with the other three in v. 26. The Syriac chronicler, who was no mere copyist, was familiar enough with exegesis to be able to designate the mountain of incense by its true name. So the chronicler did not hesitate to unify the divergent readings in vv. 25 and 26.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0951820712467877">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>With the availability of the Syriac evidence, it became clearer than ever before that the mountain in 4.25 should not be separated from those in the list in v. 26. André Caquot, following in the footsteps of Tisserant, associated the mountain of v. 25 with the mountain of the east in 4.26.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0951820712467877">19</xref></sup> He observed that in the Ethiopic Bible <italic>qatr</italic> regularly renders the LXX's μ∊σημβρια (‘noon’) but that in Dan. 8.4, 9 the Greek term translates ‭כגנ‬. From this he drew the bold conclusion that <italic>qatr</italic> means ‘south’ in <italic>Jub</italic>. 4.25; thus the Ethiopic and Syriac versions agree. After properly adding that the ‘authors’ of <italic>Jubilees</italic> made Enoch into the prototype of the legitimate priest, he addressed the issue of where this ‘mountain of the south’ was located. Here 4.26 came into play, with its list of four special places: the Garden of Eden, the mountain of the east, Mt Sinai, and Mt Zion. The Syriac citation has: the mountain of the Garden of Eden (literally: the mountain of Paradise), the mountain of the south (<italic>tayměnāʾ</italic>), Mt Sinai, and Mt Zion. Caquot thought the ‘gloss’ in v. 26 was inspired by a concern to place a mysterious mountain—the one of noon/south or of the east—on the same plane as the other three summits sanctified in scriptural history. Those three are named together and aligned with one another in <italic>Jub</italic>. 8.19: ‘He [Noah] knew that the Garden of Eden is the holy of holies and is the residence of the Lord; (that) Mt Sinai is in the middle of the desert; and (that) Mt Zion is in the middle of the navel of the earth. The three of them—the one facing the other—were created as holy (places).’ The passage suggests, according to Caquot, that Eden and Zion are on the same parallel and Sinai is on the same meridian.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0951820712467877">20</xref></sup> With Tisserant, he thought the mountain of the noon/south and the mountain of the east were the same; there is, consequently, no need to assume that a word for ‘incense’ appeared in the Hebrew original of v. 25. The Hebrew text could have used two names for the country— ‭ןמית‬ in v. 25 and ‭םרק‬ in v. 26 (see Gen. 10.30)—or the author may have wished to indicate through a double name that the mountain was located to the <italic>southeast</italic>. That peak was certainly part of the land of spices, since Enoch is the one credited with originating the liturgical use of incense. Caquot understood Enoch's voyage to the east in <italic>1 Enoch</italic> 28–30 as inclining in a southerly direction; from there the patriarch journeyed northward to reach Eden. Hence the region in question was to the southeast of Zion, a place where the mountains produce spices. Various non-scriptural traditions could have made the author of <italic>Jubilees</italic> familiar with this location and the nature of it—a place rendered holy by yielding incense employed in worship of the gods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0951820712467877">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Taking a slightly different approach, O. Wintermute rendered the end of 4.25 as ‘Mount Qater’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0951820712467877">22</xref></sup> In a note he gave the literal meaning ‘noon’ and added:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>it was originally the proper name of a mountain which was simply transcribed into Gk. and then Eth. just as Eden, Sinai, and Zion were. The Heb. root <italic>q⃛r</italic> is used to describe the burning of incense, and it is likely that some formation from that root was used to designate the place where Enoch burned incense. Mt Qater is undoubtedly to be identified with the mountain of the East in v. 26. The Syr. text uses the same word in both places, and its presence in both places proves that some designation of the mountain should be retained in v. 25. The Syr. name for the mountain could be read as ‘South’ or as ‘Taiman’. If it is read as ‘South’, then one would assume a corruption or confusion of a word for ‘East’. If it is read as ‘Taiman’, one might guess that it had reference to Taima in Arabia … As a center for caravans (Job 6:19), Taima was undoubtedly identified with the incense trade, and might be an appropriate place to locate Enoch's mountain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0951820712467877">23</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>He also thought <italic>tayměnāʾ</italic> in the Syriac represented the chronicler's attempt to identify the place with a mountain known in his day and that the original text merely referred to a mountain associated with incense.</p>
<p>In 1989 VanderKam defended the translation ‘mountain <italic>of incense</italic>’ and summarized some of the debate on the point.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0951820712467877">24</xref></sup> This appears to be a fairly widely accepted position today.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0951820712467877">25</xref></sup> The conclusion takes seriously the word found in the Ethiopic manuscripts (<italic>qatr</italic>), and it appeals to a term that is most fitting in the context where Enoch is burning the evening incense offering (<italic>qetārē</italic>). The reading in the Syriac citation arouses suspicion because it is repeated in v. 26.</p>

<sec id="section2-0951820712467877">
<title>2. The List of Four Mountains in <italic>Jubilees</italic> 4.26</title>
<p>Mention of the mountain on which Enoch offered the evening incense sacrifice triggers a list of the four places that in some special (and unexplained) sense belong to the Lord. In the Ethiopic copies they are: the Garden of Eden, the mountain of the east, Mt Sinai, and Mt Zion. As noted above, the Syriac citation phrases the names as: the mountain of Paradise, the mountain of the south, Mt Sinai, and Mt Zion.</p>
<sec id="section3-0951820712467877">
<title>a. The Relation of the Mountain in 4.25 to the Ones in 4.26</title>
<p>It seems only too obvious that the mountain of v. 25 (the mountain of incense) would be one of those in v. 26 because v. 26 is attached to v. 25 with the word ‘For [<italic>ʾesma</italic> in Ethiopic, <italic>m⃛l d</italic>- in Syriac] …’; that is, the mention of the mountain in v. 25 is causally related to the list in v. 26.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0951820712467877">26</xref></sup> Thus, the mountain of incense has to be one of the four in v. 26. One can immediately eliminate two of them as improbable: Mt Sinai and Mt Zion are not associated with Enoch in <italic>Jubilees</italic>. That leaves only the first two as candidates for Enoch's mountain: the Garden of Eden/the mountain of Paradise or the mountain of the east. A straightforward reading of the context heavily favors equating the mountain of v. 25 with the first one in the list in v. 26: the mountain of incense in v. 25 is the mountain of Paradise/the Garden of Eden. After all, Enoch is in the Garden of Eden as he makes his offering on the mountain (see <italic>Jub</italic>. 4.23–24), and Eden contains a mountain according to Ezek. 28.14, 16.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0951820712467877">27</xref></sup> The nature of the evidence has, nevertheless, given rise to several proposals regarding which of the four places in v. 26 is the one named in v. 25. Surprisingly, a number of experts have identified Enoch's mountain of incense as the mountain of the east.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0951820712467877">
<title>b. The Identification of the Mountain of the East</title>
<p>The second of the places/mountains mentioned in <italic>Jub</italic>. 4.26 is ‘the mountain of the east [Syriac: mountain of the south]’. Despite the clear implication of the Ethiopic text that Enoch's mountain is the first one in v. 26, a widely held position has been that the mountain of incense is actually the second one—the mountain of the east. Why have some scholars drawn this conclusion and what is the mountain of the east?</p>
<list id="list1-0951820712467877" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>The Mountain of the East = Mt Zion</italic>. At the outset one should reject a position that can hardly be correct. According to Eckhart Rau, <italic>Jub</italic>. 4.25 has Enoch make his offering on the mountain of the south, which is to be identified as Mt Zion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0951820712467877">28</xref></sup> He found it particularly important that Enoch is in this way compared with Moses: Mt Zion, where Enoch sacrifices, is the place where the eschatological sanctification and renewal of the luminaries take place (1.28–29; 4.26b; 50.5), while Sinai, where Moses resided during the revelation of <italic>Jubilees</italic>, is not mentioned in an eschatological context. It is very difficult indeed to see how <italic>Jub</italic>. 4.23–26 could be read as saying that Enoch was on Mt Zion when the immediate context explicitly places him in Eden (which can hardly be identified with Zion); as a consequence, Rau's entire point about Enoch's position as more important than that of Moses falls to the ground as baseless.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>The Mountain of the East = Mt Ephraim</italic>. Another implausible idea is that Mt Ephraim is the mountain of the east. In the earliest years of <italic>Jubilees</italic> studies, when the notion that the book was of Samaritan authorship was under discussion, S. Rapoport wrote an open letter to B. Beer,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0951820712467877">29</xref></sup> who had argued for the Samaritan origins of <italic>Jubilees</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0951820712467877">30</xref></sup> He thought Beer had omitted a telling argument in favor of his thesis—that the mountain of the east is Mt Ephraim, a clear pointer to the author's Samaritan connections. Both the suggestion that the author was a Samaritan and that the mountain of the east was Mt Ephraim have rightly been rejected as lacking supporting evidence. Mt Ephraim is hardly in the right location to qualify as the mountain of the east.</p>
<p>Here it should be added that Charles wavered between several identifications of the mountain of the east. He rejected Mt Ephraim because the author was not a Samaritan, and he also rejected the identification with Mt Zion since it appears later in the list. He was obviously attracted to the idea that it was Enoch's mountain, referencing the theme in the <italic>Cave of Treasures</italic> and the <italic>Book of Adam and Eve</italic> that Seth's descendants lived on a mountain near Eden, a mountain that could be described as the mountain of the east. Or, he thought, it could be the mountain of <italic>1 En</italic>. 18.6–9; 23.1–3—the mountain where God will sit enthroned when he descends for the final judgment. However, in the end he wrote: ‘What the Mount of the East is, I cannot determine’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0951820712467877">31</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>The Mountain of the East = Enoch's Mountain</italic>. The first expert to formulate a strong argument that the mountain of v. 25 and the mountain of the east are the same peak was Tisserant, and the basis for his thesis was that the Syriac citation uses <italic>tayměnāʾ</italic> as the name for both (see above for his arguments). The use of the same term in both places is textually and contextually suspicious, and Tisserant himself thought they were not identical in the original text of the book. On his view the chronicler or his source was responsible for the identification of the two, not the author of <italic>Jubilees</italic>.</p>
<p>The arguments of Caquot and Wintermute in favor of equating the mountain of the south/noon and mountain of the east have also been sketched above. It is fair to say that they did not adequately consider the context in <italic>Jub</italic>. 4.23–26 and the explicit connection of Enoch's mountain in v. 25 and the first one in v. 26 with Eden. That the mountainous area associated with spices for incense offerings was thought to lie to the east or southeast of Israel is true enough but does not entail that one should ignore the plain signs in the text of <italic>Jubilees</italic> associating Enoch's mountain with Eden. Eden was in the east, but not in the eastern region known for spices in the geography of <italic>1 Enoch</italic>. The mountain of the east is a puzzling entry in the list in v. 26, as it is not mentioned at any place before this point in <italic>Jubilees</italic> nor is it alluded to in the remainder of the book, but there is no warrant for identifying Enoch's mountain of incense as the mountain of the east, apart from the fact that the Syriac citation gives the two the same name.</p>
<p>J. Frey has adopted a slightly different position by equating the mountain of the south (= his understanding of the one in 4.25) with two of those in v. 26: the mountain of Paradise/Eden, and the mountain of the east are the same place. Consequently, he thinks the mountain of the east was in some location in the Arabian peninsula and was a mountain of incense.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0951820712467877">32</xref></sup> But nothing in the text leads one to think that the mountain of v. 25 corresponds with two, rather than one, of the mountains in v. 26. Moreover, it violates the explicit claim of the text that there were four (not three) places that belonged to the Lord.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>The Mountain of the East and</italic> ‭םדקה‬ ‭רה‬ <italic>in Gen. 10.30</italic>. It is natural to search for a biblical identification of the mountain of the east, and indeed Gen. 10.30 appears to supply it. For a long time expositors have been attempting to locate the places named in this verse that comes near the end of the list of Noah's descendants: ‘The territory in which they lived extended from Mesha in the direction of Sephar, the hill country [= mountain] of the east’. The verse follows the list of Shem's descendants (vv. 21–29), most immediately those descended from Joktan (vv. 26–29). If, as many commentators on the biblical text have suggested, Mesha and Sephar belong to the territory of Joktan, then Mesha and Sephar are places in the Arabian Peninsula.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0951820712467877">33</xref></sup> As early as 1746 John Gill argued that Mesha is likely the place Ptolemy and Pliny called <italic>Muza</italic> (modern Al Mokha), a port that played a key role in the incense trade on the southeast coast of the Red Sea. Merchants from Muza would obtain frankincense and myrrh from a city to the east, Sapphar, which was at the foot of the Climax Mountains. The modern place is Mt Redan in Yemen—at the site of historical Dhafar. Thus Dhafar would equal Sapphar/Sephar and could be the ‘mountain of the east’. Gill also noted an Islamic tradition associating Mecca with Mesha, and Medinah with Sephar, a ‘mountainous part of the region producing frankincense’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0951820712467877">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Gill's suggestion that the mountain of the east lay in the Arabian peninsula would seem to support the conclusions of Caquot, Tisserant, and Frey, at least insofar as they believe the mountain of the east is the mountain of incense. However, as noted above, these arguments do not adequately address the immediate context of <italic>Jub</italic>. 4.25. But the solution gleaned here from Gill does not necessarily require that these two are the same mountain; it entails only that Gill's mountain in Arabia could be called a ‘mountain of the east’. Given the incense-burning associated with Eden in Adam's incense offering in <italic>Jub</italic>. 3.27 and Enoch's in 4.25, Gill's location of the mountain of the east at Sephar, a place associated with incense, is suggestive. Yet, there are no other biblical references to events or people connected with Sephar, and it is therefore difficult to understand why <italic>Jubilees</italic> would elevate its status to one of the four places belonging to God. Moreover, the end of Genesis 10 does not necessarily refer to Joktan's territory alone; the ‘mountain of the east’ may not have been in the Arabian Peninsula but simply somewhere in Shem's territory. For these reasons, Gill's location of the mountain of the east is not helpful for identifying the mountain of the east in <italic>Jub</italic>. 4.25.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0951820712467877">35</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>The Mountain of the East = Mt Lubar</italic>. Rönsch had proposed a more likely alternative already in 1874, but it is an option that has not received the support it deserves. He thought that the mountain of the east was Mt Lubar, the peak in the Ararat range where the ark landed (<italic>Jub</italic>. 5.28).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0951820712467877">36</xref></sup> Rönsch noticed that the other three mountains in <italic>Jub</italic>. 4.26 were places where the deity revealed himself—places that played a pivotal role in God's dealings with his people. The mountain of the east should, therefore, fall into the same category. According to <italic>Jubilees</italic>, it was on Mt Lubar that Noah sacrificed after the flood (6.1) and where God entered into covenant with him and his descendants (in 7.1 he and his family are still at Lubar, whereas the covenant figures in ch. 6; in fact, Noah was buried on Mt Lubar [10.15]). If one identifies the mountain of the east as Lubar, then the events associated with the four holy places in <italic>Jub</italic>. 4.26 follow in chronological order: Eden, Lubar, Sinai, and Zion. Rönsch did have to deal with the problem that the mountain on which the ark landed might not have been in the east; it lay in a more northerly direction. He wrote regarding the issue: ‘Zum Gebirge Ararat gehörig and mithin eigentlich im Nordosten von Canaan gelegen, konnte der in der jüdischen Noahsage eine so bedeutende Rolle spielende Berg Lubar recht wohl κατ’ ∊ξoχην <italic>der Berg des Ostens</italic> genannt werden …’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0951820712467877">37</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>His identification of the mountain of the east in <italic>Jub</italic>. 4.26 with Mt Lubar is appealing, and, as he implied, the problem of direction may not be very important because the mountains of Ararat, while they are pictured as farther north than Israel, are also to the east. According to <italic>Jub</italic>. 8.17–21 the lot of Shem encompassed all four holy places: v. 19 names Eden, Sinai, and Zion, and v. 21 mentions the mountains of Ararat. They do seem to be in a northerly direction but also to the east of Israel. The point is clear from 8.21 where the mountains of Ararat appear after ‘Elam, Asshur, Babylon, Susan, and Madai’ and can be seen in graphic form on several reconstructions of <italic>Jubilees</italic>’ world map.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0951820712467877">38</xref></sup> The share of Shem is between that of his two brothers; in Shem's share, the area of Israel is in the far western portion, leaving everything else to the east of it, whether due east, northeast, or southeast.</p>
<p>Another reason for supporting the Lubar = mountain of the east equation is etymological. <italic>Lubar</italic> seems to be an Aramaic word reflecting the Hebrew ‭םדק‬, ‘east’ (as in <italic>Jubilees</italic>) or ‘ancient’. The mountain name is also mentioned in 1Q20 (1QapGen) 12:16, 4Q244 (1QpsDanb ar) 8:3, and 6Q8 (papGiants ar) 26:1. What does ‭רבול‬ mean in Aramaic? Richard Steiner points out the use of the word ‭רבול‬ in TAD 8:13, 14, 17.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0951820712467877">39</xref></sup> The fourth-century B.C.E. document contains a request to repair a boat with ‭רבול‬ ‭זרא‬ ‭יקע‬ (‘lubar cedar wood’) as opposed to ‭ןתדח‬ ‭זדא‬ ‭יקע‬ (‘new cedar wood’). Thus, ‭םדק‬ should be understood as ‘old’ in contrast with ‘new’ and cognate with Akkadian <italic>labiru</italic> (‘old/ancient’).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0951820712467877">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>If ‭םדק‬ can mean ‘ancient’, its Hebrew equivalent is perhaps ‭םדק‬ (‘east’, ‘ancient’).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0951820712467877">41</xref></sup> This is indeed the term in Gen. 10.30 where it could be interpreted as the place where Noah and his sons were after the flood. This understanding could also solve an old interpretive problem regarding Gen. 11.2. When the descendants of Noah left the region of Ararat, ‘[a]nd as they migrated from the east (‭םדקמ‬), they came upon a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there’. How could they set out from the east (i.e. from Ararat to the west) when Shinar is certainly not to the west of Ararat? Thus, ‘from the east’ as a translation for ‭םדקמ‬ is already uncertain.</p>
<p>Rashi, Steiner notes, suggested that the ‭םדק‬ to which Gen. 11.2 refers could in fact be the same as ‭םדקה‬ ‭דה‬ in Gen. 10.30.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0951820712467877">42</xref></sup> This verse need not refer only to the territory of the descendants of Joktan—to the Arabian Peninsula: it could just as easily refer to the area in which all of Noah's descendants listed in Genesis 10 resided. Such a reading makes it possible to understand the term as a location rather than the direction from which Noah's descendants moved. Steiner writes: ‘all of the descendants of Noah traveled from a place which was later to belong to Shem alone, and the southward direction of their journey is perfectly compatible with the phrase ‭םדקמ‬’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0951820712467877">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because Jewish tradition knew ‭ארוט‬ ‭רבול‬ (‘Mt Lubar’) as the ark's resting place, and as the mountain's name appears to mean something like ‘ancient’, the mountain in Gen. 10.30 may have been interpreted to mean something like ‘the ancient mountain’. This does not mean ‭םדקה‬ ‭רה‬ originally did mean ‘the ancient mountain’—only that it could have this meaning and could have been translated into Aramaic as ‭ארוט‬ ‭רבול‬. But if ‭םדקה‬ ‭רה‬ and ‭םדקמ‬ refer to the same place, how is the morphological change from ‭םדקה‬ ‭רה‬ to simply ‭םדק‬ possible? Steiner notes, again following Rashi, that other references to mountains in the Hebrew Bible do not always include ‭רה‬ before their name (i.e. ‭ןופצ‬, ‭ןויצ‬).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0951820712467877">44</xref></sup> Thus, ‭םדק‬ and ‭םדקה‬ ‭רה‬ are merely the name of the same mountain; in 11.2 Noah's descendants traveled ‭םדקמ‬ (‘from Qedem’). Therefore, because the Hebrew ‭םדק‬ (‘ancient, ‘east’) appears equivalent to Aramaic ‭רבול‬ (‘ancient’), Mt Lubar and the ‘mountain of the east’ in <italic>Jubilees</italic> likely reflect the same Hebrew background of ‭דרקה‬ ‭רה‬. Incidentally, a name for the mountain meaning something like ‘the ancient mountain’ could resolve Rönsch's concern that the mountains of Ararat were more northward than to the east.</p>
<p>If the mountain of the east is indeed Lubar (Hebrew ‭םדק‬), <italic>Jubilees</italic>’ author likely knew of an association between the two names, calling the mountain <italic>Qedem</italic> in 4.26 and <italic>Lubar</italic> elsewhere, reflecting Hebrew and Aramaic names for the same mountain. The Ethiopic ‘east’ could therefore render an original ‭םדק‬ in Hebrew <italic>Jubilees</italic>. The reading ‘east’ as a direction would then not be original; the nuance of ‭םדק‬ as ‘ancient’ was lost in the translation to Ethiopic. Again, this is not to say that ‭םדק‬ meant ‘ancient’ in the Hebrew text of Gen. 10.30 and 11.2—the LXX certainly reads ‘east’. Nevertheless, the particular Jewish tradition given witness by the Qumran fragments mentioned above (1Q20, 4Q244, and 6Q8) does seem to understand ‭םדק‬ as ancient, rendering the place as Mt Lubar. In any case, even if the biblical reading were ‘east’, Steiner's point remains very plausible—that ‭םדק‬ as ‘east’ or ‘ancient’ is simply a place name. Both readings, then, are in fact reflected in the Ethiopic of <italic>Jubilees—Lubar</italic> on the one hand, and ‘east’ on the other.</p>
<p>Yet if Lubar is indeed the fourth place that belongs to the Lord in <italic>Jub</italic>. 4.26, why would <italic>Jubilees</italic> not say anything about Lubar in the list of special places in 8.17–20? One possibility is that the knowledge relayed to the reader here in 8.17–20 is channeled through Noah (i.e. ‘[Noah] knew that the Garden of Eden …’). That is, Noah and his sons are already on Mt Lubar, making the mention of Lubar perhaps redundant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0951820712467877">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>Before concluding, it is worth summarizing what Mt Lubar has in common with the three other places that ‘belong to the Lord’, some features of which were already noted by Rönsch. First, Lubar, like the mountains in <italic>Jub</italic>. 8.19, lies in the territory of Shem. It is one of the mountains of Ararat (5.28) that in turn all belong to this favored son (8.21).</p>
<p>Lubar is, moreover, a place of some importance in that territory. Noah plays a distinctly priestly role in offering the first animal sacrifice and atoning for the earth's sins (6.1–3). Thus, any sacrifice in the temple on Zion is implicitly subsequent to or at least founded upon this one. Furthermore, Lubar, like Eden, Sinai, and Zion is a place of revelation: while no theophany per se occurs there, important basic dietary and ethical laws are revealed as part of the covenant established by God (6.6–10).</p>
<p>Indeed, Lubar's association with covenant is perhaps one of its most important traits. Noah's sacrifice is the reason for the establishment of the Feast of Weeks, which in <italic>Jubilees</italic> becomes a festival ‘to renew the covenant each and every year’ (v. 17). Likewise, the covenant's date is significant. Falling on the ‘first day of the third month’ (v. 1), Noah's covenant occurs in the same month as Abram's later covenant with God, which is explicitly said to be ‘like the covenant which we [the angels] concluded during this month with Noah’ (14.20). The author also explicitly links Noah's covenant on Lubar to the Sinaitic covenant vis-à-vis the restriction of consuming blood (6.10–12).</p>
<p>Finally, it might be pointed out that of all of the other mountains mentioned by name in the book of <italic>Jubilees</italic> (other than those in 8.19), Lubar is the most significant. The others—Hermon (29.10), Seir (28.18; 36.19; 38.9–10) and Teman (38.18)—have much smaller roles. Together, these points suggest that the importance of Lubar as a mountain is on par with that of Eden, Sinai, and Zion, and that Lubar is thus the most likely candidate for being the mountain of the east.</p>
<p>Conclusion: On the basis of the evidence presented above, one may conclude that the original name for the mountain on which Enoch made his offering in Eden was the mountain of incense (4.25) and that it and the first mountain in v. 26 (the mountain of Eden/Paradise) are the same mountain. The second mountain in 4.26, the mountain of the east, is Mt Lubar where the ark landed at the end of the flood and where Noah lived until his death. All four mountains in 4.26 are places where God had or would specially reveal himself to chosen individuals and for that reason were holy to the Lord.</p>
