<abstract>
<p>Canine osteosarcoma is an insidious disease with few effective treatment modalities; therefore, use of pharmacologic intervention to improve mortality or morbidity is constantly sought. The use of cyclooxygenase enzyme inhibitors has been an area of interest with limited efficacy based on retrospective examination of tumor expression and in vivo cell proliferation models. Recently, examination of dual cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors in human and canine oncology suggests that 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors may be an effective approach in vitro and during tumor induction in rodent models. Therefore, the authors decided to examine 5-lipoxygenase expression in primary canine osteosarcoma samples and have shown that approximately 65% of osteosarcomas label positive for cytoplasmic 5-lipoxygenase. Further examination of a cell culture and xenograft model shows similar 5-lipoxygenase expression. Surprisingly, a canine 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor (tepoxalin) significantly reduced cell proliferation at physiologic doses in vitro and diminished xenograft tumor growth in nude mice, suggesting that further investigation is needed. Traditionally, 5-lipoxygense leads to production of lipid mediators, such as leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> and 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid, which, when added back to the media of tepoxalin-treated cells, did not recover cell proliferation. The lack of nuclear staining in primary and xenografted tumors and the lack of response to eicoasanoids suggest that lipid mediator production is not the primary means by which tepoxalin acts to alter proliferation. Regardless of the mechanisms involved in retarding cell proliferation, future investigation is warranted.</p>

<p>Osteosarcoma (OSA) in dogs accounts for 85% of all skeletal malignancies.<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300985811432350">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300985811432350">3</xref>
</sup> Despite advancements in treatment, median survival times range from 3 months to 1 year, with less than 20% of dogs surviving &gt;2 years following diagnosis.<sup>

<p>Chemotherapeutic intervention, often used in conjunction with surgical intervention, involves combinations of several pharmacologic agents, including doxorubicin and/or the platinum analogues cisplatin, carboplatin, or lobaplatin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300985811432350">6</xref>
</sup> Palliative treatment for pain associated with primary and secondary lesions often consists of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). NSAIDs also have chemotherapeutic properties in slowing proliferation in certain human neoplastic diseases; for example, patients with colorectal cancer have shown either decreased incidence or increased survival time when administered aspirin therapy, and dogs with transitional cell carcinoma show increased survival time when administered the NSAID deraoxib as part of treatment protocol.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0300985811432350">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0300985811432350">37</xref>
</sup> NSAIDs function by decreasing the production of various inflammatory mediators through inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), of which there are 2 principal isoforms: constitutively expressed COX-1 and inducible COX-2. COX-2 has been implicated in proneoplastic behavior through the production of inflammatory prostaglandins, primarily PGE<sub>2</sub>, due to its promitogenic and prometastatic actions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0300985811432350">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0300985811432350">45</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>While the literature regarding expression of COX-2 in canine carcinomas is more numerous, the immunohistochemical expression of COX-2 in OSA exhibits a range of 23% and 77.3%, wherein the majority of cases demonstrated poor or minimal immunohistochemical staining for COX-2.<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0300985811432350">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0300985811432350">38</xref></sup> Furthermore, of the OSA cell lines examined to date, none show PGE<sub>2</sub> production, and expression of COX-2 does not correlate with enzymatic activity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0300985811432350">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0300985811432350">27</xref></sup> Hence, follow-up clinical studies using COX inhibitors have not been performed in OSA since their utility is questioned.</p>
<p>More recently, the idea of dual inhibition of COX and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) has received attention therapeutically, since 5-LOX has the ability to metabolize arachidonic acid much like the COX enzymes. Additionally, 5-LOX appears to be aberrantly expressed in human pancreatic, prostate, and bladder neoplasias.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300985811432350">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0300985811432350">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300985811432350">15</xref></sup> Some studies show that inhibition of 5-LOX prevents production of 5-hydroxytetraenoic acid, a precursor to the bioactive molecules 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) and leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> (LTB<sub>4</sub>) which may have promitogenic activities in certain neoplasms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0300985811432350">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0300985811432350">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0300985811432350">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0300985811432350">34</xref>
</sup> However, 5-LOX may have other cytoplasmic functions, and the use of 5-LOX inhibitors may exert antiproliferative effects via other mechanisms involving mitochondrial-induced apoptosis.<sup>

</p>
<p>In veterinary medicine the use of tepoxalin as a dual COX/5-LOX inhibitor is primarily for pain relief.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300985811432350">1</xref>
</sup> There is little investigation into the use of these dual inhibitors in OSA, let alone other companion animal neoplasms; yet, recent work from our laboratory shows that in vitro tepoxalin is efficacious at inducing apoptosis and decreasing feline squamous cell carcinoma proliferation at presumed clinically achievable concentrations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0300985811432350">44</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, a recent examination of nude mice with canine OSA xenografts showed that tepoxalin could decrease tumor size, but examination of the incidence of 5-LOX expression in various canine neoplasms is lacking.<sup>

<p>Here, we describe 5-LOX expression patterns in 60 clinically diagnosed canine OSA patients and the relative cytoplasmic versus nuclear expression pattern in both appendicular and axial OSAs. Additionally, 5-LOX expression was examined in 3 canine OSA cell lines with subsequent in vitro proliferation studies using the HMPOS cell line which overexpresses 5-LOX, to examine the in vitro efficacy of the 5-LOX inhibitor tepoxalin. Encouraging, in vitro results led us to perform nude mouse xenografts using the HMPOS cell line to induce tumors and examine their response or primary tumor growth and metastasis in response to oral tepoxalin treatment.</p>

<title>Case Inclusion Criteria, Histopathology, and Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Sixty canine OSA cases were identified from the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine anatomic pathology archives from 1996 to 2006. Thirty samples of each type, OSA of the appendicular or axial skeleton, were selected for sectioning. Histologic verification of tumor type and location were confirmed by a veterinary pathologist (JKP) after reviewing clinical history, gross description, and hematoxylin and eosin–stained tissue sections. All specimens were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin blocks. Paraffin-embedded tissues that had did not require decalcification were chosen and sectioned at 4 μm and mounted onto positively charged slides for immunohistochemistry.</p>
<p>A standard immunohistochemistry protocol was used based on previous work in our laboratory.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0300985811432350">44</xref>
</sup> Briefly, tissue sections were deparaffinized through a xylene and graded alcohol series. Endogenous peroxidases were quenched in 1% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10 minutes. Sections were rinsed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 30 minutes in 1:10 diluted goat serum for 30 minutes. Primary polyclonal rabbit anti-human 5-LOX antibody (H-120, epitope 106-225; Santa Cruz Biologics, Santa Cruz, CA) was used at a 1:100 dilution, and control slides were treated in parallel with an equal concentration of control rabbit antibody (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) and treated identically to 5-LOX immunohistochemistry slides, incubating for 3 hours at room temperature in a humid chamber. Sections were rinsed with PBS-0.1% BRIJ solution 3 times and then incubated with a biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody (IgG H&amp;L, BA-1000; Vector Labs) at room temperature for 30 minutes and then rinsed 3 times in PBS-0.1% BRIJ solution. Further incubation was performed in prediluted avidin–horse radish peroxidase solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 30 minutes, followed by 3 rinses in PBS-0.1% BRIJ and exposed to diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride for approximately 60 to 90 seconds per slide. Slides were then washed in distilled water, counterstained with Gill’s hematoxylin, and cover-slipped. A veterinary pathologist (JPK) then examined each slide and its control and provided an overall intensity score as well as positive cellular compartmental staining as cytoplasmic, perinuclear, and/or nuclear. Staining was assessed as either positive or negative staining for all sections. An overall labeling intensity score was provided for every positive neoplasm: 0, no staining; 1, weak staining; 2, moderate staining; 3, marked intensity. Positive sections were also categorized for relative percentage of staining in the neoplasm as negative (0) if less than 10% of neoplastic cells were positive, patchy (1) if 11% to 40% of cells stained positive, multifocal (2) if 41% to 70%, and diffuse (3) if over 70% of the neoplastic cells labeled positive. This scoring system was adapted from previously published criteria.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0300985811432350">12</xref>
</sup> Cell proliferation between the 2 groups was assessed through mitotic index (MI) scoring, counting cells only observed in prophase, metaphase, or telophase in 5 high-power fields (400×) and averaged. A χ<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300985811432350">2</xref>
</sup> analysis was performed to examine positive versus negative labeling proportions to determine significant differences in staining across the 2 categories of OSA, appendicular versus axial locations. Labeling intensity and relative proportion of the neoplastic mass labeling positive were assessed using Wilcoxon ranked sum testing to determine differences between appendicular and axial tumors with α set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. To determine if labeling intensity was associated with cell proliferation, the MI was correlated to intensity and examined using a Spearman nonparametric correlation for significance in the relationship between staining intensity and MI with α set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<title>Cell Culture</title>
<p>Growth medium consisted of RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) with 1% antibiotic and antimycotic solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for cell proliferation assays. OSA cells were obtained from 3 sources: OS 2.4 cells from Dr. Katrina Mealey at Washington State University, HMPOS cells from the Cornell University Comparative Cancer Program, and the D17 cell line from the American Type Culture Collection. NSAIDs were the 5-LOX inhibitor tepoxalin and the global COX inhibitor RWJ 20142 (tepoxalin active metabolite [TAM]; Schering Plough Pharmaceuticals, Kenilworth, NJ). All NSAIDs were reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 20 mM stock solution and stored at –80°C until used in vitro.</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300985811432350">2</xref></sup> Cell lysates were collected, and protein determination based on the Bradford technique was performed on each sample. Lysates were equilibrated to common μg/μl volume in lysis buffer and loading buffer. Western blot analysis was performed using 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, loading 30 μg of protein per well, followed by transfer to a polyvinylene difluoride membrane and immunoblotted. Lysates were immunoblotted for 5-LOX using a rabbit anti-human antibody (H-120, epitope 106-225; Santa Cruz Biologics) after membrane blocking with 10% nonfat dried milk, the cells were incubated with a primary antibody overnight at 4°C. Membranes were washed twice with TBST (tribuffered saline + 0.1% tween-20) and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour using a 1:5000 dilution of anti-rabbit (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). Blots were again washed 3 times with TBST and visualized using a Chemi-Doc XRS station and QuantiOne Software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). A second immunoblot was performed using similar techniques utilizing a primary β-actin mouse antibody (Sigma) at a 1:5000 dilution to examine relative loading equality between lysates.</p>

</italic> (nu/nu) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and irradiated with 1.4 Gy. Two days later, HMPOS cells, grown to 80% confluence, were trypsinized with 0.05% trypsin and immediately centrifuged at 2500 g for 6 minutes; the cells were then gently washed in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and re-centrifuged. Cells were then suspended in PBS and counted using a manual hemocytometer; cells were suspended to equate to 25 million cells per milliliter, and 0.3 ml of cells were injected subcutaneously into the right flank at the level of the hip and allowed to form tumors over the next 4 days. Day 4 postinjection mice were randomly divided into 3 groups of 4 mice. Group A received 0.2 ml of 0.9% sterile saline; group B received 1 mg/ml of solution at a dosing equivalent of 50 mg/kg of tepoxalin, while group C received 0.2 mg/ml of solution at a dosing equivalent to 10 mg/kg of tepoxalin. All treatments were administered via oral gavage every 24 hours between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. Powdered tepoxalin was solublized in 0.9% saline and frozen in aliquots at –80°C, and freshly thawed aliquots were used daily for treatments. Tumor measurements started from baseline (4 days postinjection) and were measured twice a week. Mice were euthanized if the tumor reached 2.5 × 2.5 cm or at the end of the 28-day protocol. The relative tumor volume was measured using calipers in 2 dimensions, and volume was assessed based on previous calculations by Kadosowa et al.<sup>

Due to the differences in growth between the three groups histologic assessment of the xenografted tumors were assessed for MI, which was done by counting the number of mitotic figures in 10 random areas of viable tumor tissue at 400×. The fields were then averaged for each mouse, and the mean and standard deviation of each group were determined. Slides were prepared with hematoxylin and eosin staining, and all tissues were examined by a boarded veterinary pathologist (JPK), assessing the tissues for toxicologic changes and the lung tissues (left lobe, right inferior lobe, and right superior lobe) for metastasis of the primary mass. All xenograft data from the 3 groups of mice was assessed using a 1-way analysis of variance and Tukey post hoc comparison at specific time points with a <italic>P</italic> value set at .05.</p>

</p>
<p>The relative expression of 5-LOX in canine or human OSA was unknown; therefore, we examined the expression of 5-LOX through immunohistochemistry on 30 appendicular and 30 axial OSAs. Results showed equal relative numbers, percentage of tumor labeling and intensity across the 2 anatomic locations, revealing just over 65% of canine OSAs labeled positive; however, this staining was only mild to moderate in most cases, making its overall relevance questionable. The pattern of labeling was primarily cytoplasmic, which might have biologic relevance, as nuclear localization of 5-LOX is necessary for production of the lipid mediators associated with pro-proliferative activities, such as LTB<sub>4</sub> and 5-oxo-ETE.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300985811432350">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0300985811432350">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0300985811432350">36</xref></sup> Previous literature has shown that human OSA cells do not secrete lipid mediators such as LTB<sub>4</sub> or 5-hydroxytetraenoic acid when overexpressing 5-LOX.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300985811432350">18</xref>
</sup> Only after treatment with calcium ionophores will 5-LOX localize to the nucleus and induce eicosanoid production from arachidonic acid metabolism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300985811432350">18</xref>
</sup> Further examination of the HMPOS cells in vitro suggests that 5-LOX is not metabolizing arachidonic acid into eicosanoids under normal growth conditions. Use of 5-LOX inhibitors in vitro has been associated with an increased apoptotic rate and slowing in cell proliferation in various cancer cell lines.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985811432350">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300985811432350">8</xref>
</sup> The underlying mechanisms are thought to be multifactorial and may include enhanced tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue function, induction of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptors and death receptor 5, and increased mitochondrial dysfunction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985811432350">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300985811432350">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300985811432350">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0300985811432350">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0300985811432350">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0300985811432350">47</xref></sup> Regardless, of the mechanism(s) involved, our results suggest that these nontraditional activities may be involved and should be fruitful areas of investigation based on our HMPOS, OS2.4, and D17 viability data.</p>
<p>Previous investigations into the viability of OSA cells with tepoxalin treatment or RWJ20142 (TAM) showed that even at high concentrations (above 100 μM) there was no measurable decrease in cell proliferation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0300985811432350">40</xref>
</sup> Our MTT proliferation assays demonstrated growth inhibition using tepoxalin concentrations ranging from 3.13 to 50 μM, with the low end of the concentration range being physiologically achievable when administered to dogs at 100 to 300 mg/kg of body weight daily.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0300985811432350">22</xref>
</sup> No inhibitory effects on growth were noted when RWJ20142 (TAM) was used in the same assays, further validating previous findings where meloxicam and deracoxib were unsuccessfully used on OSA cells at similar concentrations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0300985811432350">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0300985811432350">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0300985811432350">46</xref>
</sup> The disparity of our results using HMPOS cells versus the results of Sottnik and colleagues and their Abrams xenograft model of OSA are perplexing and might be related to the cell lines used in the experiments or possibly the growth conditions used in vitro. We typically use a very simple growth medium containing only 10% FBS and an antibiotic and antimycotic solution to maintain cells and perform experiments; however, Sottnik and colleagues use a high glucose solution, increased amounts of FBS, multiple buffers, and other amino acid and vitamin additives to promote growth that may mask the effects of tepoxalin or alter tepoxalin availability in the media. Additionally, the effects of tepoxalin on tumor growth appear to be more dramatic than in the previous study that used the Abrams OSA xenograft model, which may be due to multiple factors. These include differences in HMPOS cell sensitivity or overall increased aggressiveness (shorter study time due to rapid tumor growth) of our xenograft model.</p>
<p>We used the HMPOS cells in a xenograft model to confirm whether tepoxalin could slow tumor formation due to our viability results and the known 5-LOX expression, as well as it being established as a fast-growing metastatic model where we could examine relative growth rate and metastasis during tepoxalin treatment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300985811432350">17</xref>
</sup> Our dosing regimen falls within the safe dosing regimen where dogs showed no negative consequences during a 6-month toxicity study.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0300985811432350">22</xref>
</sup> However, it must be noted that the mice appear to metabolize tepoxalin much quicker than dogs or rats,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0300985811432350">40</xref>
</sup> achieving very high serum concentrations of the tepoxalin metabolite RWJ20142, a COX inhibitor. COX inhibition has been associated with a decreased metastatic potential in canine in vitro and xenograft studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0300985811432350">32</xref>
</sup> This disparity brings into questions whether our oral dosing and the decreased tumor size and MI was due to the 5-LOX inhibitory capability or the COX inhibitory capabilities. Due to the previous pharmacokinetic data in mice, we postulate that RWJ20142 could be the more important metabolite as it relates to tepoxalin treatment and may be the primary antiproliferative metabolite. Regardless of the mechanism of action, these positive xenograft the results are encouraging and warrant further investigation into tepoxalin as an antiproliferative drug. Use in dogs might deliver higher doses of tepoxalin to tumor tissue based on the species differences in pharmacokinetics, and the combination of tepoxalin and RWJ20412 may prove to be efficacious in retarding primary tumor growth, as well as potential metastasis.</p>
<p>To conclude, we have demonstrated expression of 5-LOX in a population of canine appendicular and axial OSAs, suggesting that 5-LOX may be a potential target for antineoplastic therapy; however, it does not appear that antiarachidonic metabolism is the primary means by which 5-LOX inhibitors influence neoplastic cell proliferation. We have yet to elucidate the exact mechanism for anti-5-LOX activity, but these inhibitors appear to be effective in decreasing cell proliferation at potentially clinically achievable concentrations. Further, we have shown that tepoxalin treatment using a canine OSA xenograft model is effective at retarding tumor growth. Thus, in an era of multimodal therapies, further examination of tepoxalin in OSA models and potentially even clinical patients is warranted.</p>
