<abstract>
<p>The article discusses critically the hermeneutical concept of the document “A Treasure in Earthen Vessels” by the World Council of Churches. I argue for a concept of an ecumenical hermeneutics of diversity instead of the former paradigm of unity and consensual ecumenism. An ecumenical hermeneutics, understood as a hermeneutics of difference and diversity, is not the continuation by other means of consensual ecumenical agreement as we have hitherto known it, but rather a critical corrective to it.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0040573611424329"><title>1. A treasure in earthen vessels</title>
<p>In 1998, the Standing Commission on Faith and Order published its draft of an ecumenical hermeneutics, entitled “A Treasure in Earthen Vessels.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573611424329">1</xref></sup> This document seeks to bring together previous discussions on the issues and the goal of ecumenical hermeneutics and to indicate prospects for further work on this topic. As with the concept of an ecumenical theology, in discussion of ecumenical hermeneutics, it is at first unclear precisely what the word “ecumenical” should mean in this context. What is ecumenical about ecumenical hermeneutics? The document “A Treasure in Earthen Vessels” says that ecumenical hermeneutics is a “hermeneutics for the unity of the Church.” The text explains how this is to be understood: “A hermeneutics for unity should aim at greater coherence in the interpretation of the faith and in the community of all believers as their voices unite in common praise of God;” “should make possible a mutually recognizable (re)appropriation of the sources of the Christian faith;” and “should prepare ways of common confession and prayer in spirit and truth” (para. 6). Generally speaking, a hermeneutics for the unity of the Church seeks “to manifest the integral unity of the Christian faith and community” (para. 6).</p>
<p>At the beginning, certainly, the ecumenical movement was not an experience of unity, but rather an experience of difference. Unity, visible unity or even full unity (full <italic>koinonia</italic>, para. 61 and 68), full realization of common life in Christ (para. 45) is the goal which the ecumenical movement set for itself, but this was not where it began. The document “A Treasure in Earthen Vessels” understands ecumenical hermeneutics as an instrument for moving towards this goal.</p>
<p>Compared to the classic doctrinal and consensual ecumenism, this document does try to focus more on the experience of difference and diversity. This effort is already expressed in its title, which quotes 2 Cor 4:7. The introduction speaks of “the ambiguities of human history and the challenges of daily Christian life” (para. 2). This is spelled out as follows: “Thus faith also relies upon human forms of expression and interpretation, dialogue and communication, all of which are fragile and all too often fragmented embodiments, none of which is completely adequate, of the mystery which has been revealed” (para. 2). The church itself is characterized as “a hermeneutical community” (para. 7), that is, as a community of interpretation, which is continually concerned with understanding the received texts, symbols and practices.</p>
<p>With the concept of unity comes the concept of coherence. Ecumenical hermeneutics, according to this document, is “a hermeneutics of coherence” (para. 6), “showing the positive complementarity of traditions” (para. 28). Evidently, the concept of coherence serves to integrate the experience of difference and diversity into the traditional concept of the visible unity of the churches. An ecumenical hermeneutics, however, should fulfil not only an integrative function, but also a critical one. The document therefore adopts the idea of a “hermeneutics of suspicion” (para. 28), which in turn is contrasted to “a hermeneutics of confidence.”
<disp-quote>
<p>To listen to the other does not necessarily mean to accept what other churches say, but to reckon with the possibility [of a] “<italic>hermeneutics of confidence</italic>”. A hermeneutics for unity should entail an ecumenical method whereby Christians from various cultures and contexts, as well as different confessions, may encounter one another respectfully, always open to a <italic>metanoia</italic> which is a true “change of mind” and heart. (para. 8)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The “hermeneutics of confidence” is obliged to seek the goal of visible unity: “Hermeneutics in the service of unity must also proceed on the presumption that those who interpret the Christian tradition differently each have ‘right intention of faith’” (para. 30).</p>
<p>I would add to that: the confidence which is the primary motive leading to ecumenical dialogue in the first place, and for continuing it, is founded on faith in the Triune God who acts through the history of the Church and of humanity. When such confidence is present, it must be seen as the work of the Holy Spirit, as the act of understanding itself has a pneumatological foundation in faith. Martin Luther, in his <italic>Small Catechism</italic>, one of the Lutheran confessional writings, said, in his interpretation of the third article of the Apostles’ Creed:
<disp-quote>
<p>I believe that I cannot by my own reason or strength believe in Jesus Christ, my Lord, or come to Him; but the Holy Ghost has called me by the Gospel, enlightened me with His gifts, sanctified and kept me in the true faith; even as He calls, gathers, enlightens, and sanctifies the whole Christian Church on earth, and keeps it with Jesus Christ in the one true faith.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040573611424329">2</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This is precisely the difference between a theological hermeneutics and all other hermeneutics, in that it points to understanding as the work of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Hence we have a first question for further work on the project of an ecumenical hermeneutics: What is the role of pneumatology in the hermeneutical debate? What relationship exists between hermeneutics and spirituality?</p>
<p>The document “A Treasure in Earthen Vessels” says: “Ecumenical hermeneutics is not an unaided human enterprise. It is an ecclesial act led by the Spirit and therefore it should be carried out in a setting of prayer” (para. 32). But how does the work of the divine Spirit, which is not at the disposal of any human power, relate to hermeneutical work, by which I mean methodically controlled work being undertaken by human beings? What are the attitudes of the various confessions and traditions to the ancient tradition of religious exegesis? How should we evaluate the hermeneutical potential of the charismatic movement, and of the many charismatic churches? Are there possibilities here for conversations? Or is there a massive conflict between charismatic Christianity and modern theological hermeneutics? What are the criteria for the work of the Holy Spirit? For instance, the African Church of the Lord (Aladura) practises a rite of purification which is unknown in other churches. This church claims a revelation from its founder and prophet, Dr. Josiah Olunowo Ositelu. What do other churches think about this?</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0040573611424329"><title>2. What is hermeneutics?</title>
<p>The document “A Treasure in Earthen Vessels” has been sharply criticized by some. The Lutheran theologian Ingolf U. Dalferth honours it as an effort to move forward “from a pre-modern doctrinal ecumenism to a modern, methodical ecumenism.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040573611424329">3</xref></sup> But he criticizes it for what he considers a false idea of the visible unity of the Church. As long as the ecumenical movement does not give up its “ecclesially-centred perspective of a visible unity of doctrine, ministry and church,” he says, one cannot speak of the “ecumenical movement as having arrived in the modern era in this regard.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040573611424329">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Dalferth’s critique leads us to the fundamental question of what the ecumenical movement actually understands by hermeneutics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040573611424329">5</xref></sup> The document “A Treasure in Earthen Vessels” focuses on asking about the meaning of the word “ecumenical” in the framework of an ecumenical hermeneutics. The answer in the document to this question is the concept of “hermeneutics for unity,” which is at one and the same time also a hermeneutics of coherence, a hermeneutics of suspicion and a hermeneutics of confidence.</p>
<p>Ecumenical hermeneutics, as the document “A Treasure in Earthen Vessels” understands it, is not limited to the interpretation of texts, but also includes “symbols and rites, stories and practices” (para. 2).
<disp-quote>
<p>Ecumenical hermeneutics—as every hermeneutical task—is therefore a dynamic process concerned not only with written sources but also with oral tradition. In addition to textual and oral tradition, meaning is conveyed through non-verbal symbols: Christian art and music, liturgical gestures or colours, icons, the creation and use of sacred space and time, Christian symbols or signs are important aspects of the way in which the various dialogue partners understand and communicate their faith. (para. 35)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus the document suggests a wider understanding of hermeneutics which means more than only interpreting texts.</p>
<p>However, it is striking that the word “hermeneutics” itself is never precisely defined anywhere in the document. One is told vaguely that “in recent years the definitions of hermeneutics have multiplied in philosophy and theology, and the scope of the term has been widened beyond giving principles for the interpretation of Holy Scripture“(para. 5). In para. 5 it is simply stated that: “In this text we take the term hermeneutics to mean both the art of interpretation and application of texts, symbols and practices in the present and from the past, and the theory about the methods of such interpretation and application.” However, the document does not give its own definition of hermeneutics. This is a fundamental deficiency which makes further work on the topic difficult. Without a clear theory of hermeneutics and its methods, there can be no progress in the ecumenical dialogue.</p>
<p>The document “A Treasure in Earthen Vessels” puts a high value on the role of experience, as opposed to any mere theory. The church is characterized as “a hermeneutical community,” in which hermeneutics is not just a matter for specialists.
<disp-quote>
<p>Hermeneutics, perhaps especially ecumenical hermeneutics, is not the work of specialists. Ecumenical hermeneutics, in the pursuit of visible church unity, is first and foremost the work of the whole people gathered in believing communities in diverse contexts. Believers, pastors, theologians, and biblical exegetes, each have distinctive gifts to bring to the hermeneutical task. These gifts are most appropriately brought together and exercised within the various settings in which the Church carries out its work as an hermeneutical community. (para. 50)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>However, it must be clearly stated that hermeneutics as a doctrine of understanding (“<italic>Kunstlehre</italic>,” Friedrich Schleiermacher) must be distinguished from simple processes of understanding. Understanding is certainly not only a matter for experts. There is no life without understanding. “But that does not mean that we all ‘exist hermeneutically,’ that we are permanently engaged in the work of explicit interpretation, and are occupied at every moment in the infinity of the hermeneutical understanding of something as something as something.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040573611424329">6</xref></sup> The need for hermeneutics as a <italic>theory</italic> and the <italic>teaching of a method</italic> of understanding arises from the experience of not understanding and not being understood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040573611424329">7</xref></sup> Friedrich Schleiermacher, the founder of modern hermeneutics, distinguished between two views of the hermeneutical task: “The more lax practice of the art assumes that understanding comes of itself, and expresses its goal negatively, ‘Misunderstanding is to be avoided.’ ”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0040573611424329">8</xref></sup> “The stricter practice assumes that misunderstanding comes of itself, and that understanding of any point must be desired and sought after.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0040573611424329">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The situation of ecumenical dialogue may be described in the same way. Understanding does not come of itself at all, but must be desired and sought after, while on the other hand, misunderstanding between confessions and traditions, and between their individual adherents, happens by itself. Thus, like all hermeneutics, an ecumenical hermeneutics must be a theory of understanding and of its methods, reflecting both the conditions for successful understanding and the reasons why understanding fails.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is also true that understanding within ecumenical dialogue, as in other areas of life, does not lend itself to prescription and standardization. Neither can it be unanimous, the object of a consensus and written down for all time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0040573611424329">10</xref></sup> The document “A Treasure in Earthen Vessels” addresses this problem:
<disp-quote>
<p>A practical application of ecumenical hermeneutics occurs both in the production and reception of ecumenical documents. It is important to recognize, however, an important difference between these two spheres. Ecumenical documents are <italic>written</italic> jointly in the context of active discussion during which the dialogue partners may question each other with regard to respective interpretations, challenging each other’s positions and developing insights that point to convergence. On the other hand, ecumenical documents are <italic>read</italic> by people who must enter into the dialogue without having been part of the initial discussion and who did not have the opportunity to present their own views in their own terms or to check their perceptions of the views being presented by others. Moreover, ecumenical documents are often produced through multilateral dialogue, whereas these documents are normally read from the point of view of a single tradition. Consequently, it is crucial that special care is taken by those who produce ecumenical documents to ensure that meaningful exchange is facilitated at all levels by adequate attention to those dimensions of ecumenical hermeneutics that result in accurate communication and reception. (para. 66)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This accurate analysis certainly makes evident the problems with the thesis that ecumenical hermeneutics is a “hermeneutics for unity.” I agree with Dalferth that no hermeneutics, including theological hermeneutics, should be tied to a program for unity and made to serve an ecclesiastical purpose. As soon as this happens, any hermeneutics has lost its critical function, which is also of concern to the document “A Treasure in Earthen Vessels.” “Hermeneutics, it must be strongly emphasised, in the face of all ecumenical tendencies to have hermeneutical reflection serve a purpose, has only and exclusively to do with <italic>understanding</italic>.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0040573611424329">11</xref></sup> Understanding cannot be manufactured or regulated, but always includes the freedom to understand something in another way. Consequently, it is also true of any ecumenical hermeneutics that commonalities may occur in the result of understanding something, but not in the process of understanding.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0040573611424329">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to “A Treasure in Earthen Vessels,” an ecumenical hermeneutics “should prepare ways of common confession and prayer in spirit and in truth” (para. 6). But every common confession, just as much as every liturgical act, is subject to the unending process of individual understanding and of understanding differently. Therefore, it must be clearly said that if the prerequisite for common confession, and for common celebration of worship including Communion, is to be seen in multilateral consensus texts which also want to set the standard for their own reception, that is, for the way they are understood, then the ecumenical movement will never reach its goal.</p>
<p>The Christian faith itself may indeed be characterized as a way of understanding. To believe means to understand, as we are understood by God (cf. 1 Cor 13:12). Thus, faith is different from a normalizing set of doctrinal rules. It includes the freedom of the individual to understand differently, that freedom in which the work of the Holy Spirit unfolds: “Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom” (2 Cor 3:17, <sc>nrsv</sc>). An ecumenical hermeneutic is therefore, in my understanding, not a hermeneutics of unity but a hermeneutics of diversity, grounded in God as the source of life in all its fullness.</p>
<p>Here again I am in agreement with Dalferth: hermeneutics is not a theological instrument for consensus-building and for overcoming church divisions (splitting, separation), because the existence of a consensus, or the lack thereof, can only be diagnosed methodologically—and that means hermeneutically—but cannot be manufactured.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0040573611424329">13</xref></sup> An ecumenical hermeneutics, understood as a hermeneutics of difference and diversity, is therefore not the continuation by other means of consensual ecumenical agreement as we have hitherto known it, but rather a critical corrective to it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0040573611424329">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The traditional object of hermeneutics is the understanding of texts. Schleiermacher broadened the scope of hermeneutics and began a development which continued through Dilthey, Heidegger and Gadamer to the concept of a universal hermeneutics and hermeneutical philosophy.</p>
<p>The document “A Treasure in Earthen Vessels” takes its place in this development, since it says specifically that, alongside texts, symbols, rites and other practices related to living one’s faith may be objects of an ecumenical hermeneutics. Even textual hermeneutics, especially the exegesis of biblical writings, has to take many factors into consideration which do not occur in the form of texts. Paragraph 23 of “A Treasure in Earthen Vessels” says on this:
<disp-quote>
<p>Nevertheless ecumenical hermeneutics cannot be reduced to the use of exegetical tools and methods isolated from the fullness of the experience of the interpreting community. A variety of factors are woven into that fullness, and these compose the hermeneutical locus within which Scripture is interpreted. These factors include oral tradition, narratives, memories and liturgies, as well as the life, teachings, and ethical decisions of the believing community. Thus, many dimensions of the life of the community are part of the context for interpreting the scriptural texts. Scripture emerges from episodes of life, a calendar of feasts, a scheme of history, and the witnessing account of the living people of God. In addition, Scripture becomes alive once again as it engages the life, feasts, history, and witness of faith communities today. From this perspective, the praxis of the Christian communities and people in different particular cultural and social contexts is itself a reading and an interpretation of the scriptural texts and not simply a position from which to approach the texts.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>With this I basically agree. The problem of a universal hermeneutics which follows the Heidegger school is actually that the understanding of the world and of one’s own existence is oriented to the paradigm of text and interpretation, while the opposite is true for the understanding of texts itself—they are conceived of as analogous to oral dialogue, in a question and answer pattern. Ultimately, the concept of universal hermeneutics still works according to the ancient view that putting language into writing is only a substitute for oral communication, and is deficient compared to living speech. The characteristic of living speech is immediacy; writing it down causes this immediacy to be lost, and is therefore a form which alienates the Spirit. In the discussion of ecumenical hermeneutics the danger could exist that other immediacies will be asserted, that is, that people will appeal to experience outside language, for example an immediate experience of the holy.</p>
<p>For further discussion, I would like first of all to call attention to two points. The first point has to do with the qualitative hermeneutical difference between oral and written communication, the second with the connection between hermeneutics and language.</p>
<p>The difference between the conditions for understanding and the complications of written and oral communication is a central topic of recent hermeneutical discussion. The different variations of post-structuralistic text theories converge at the point where they take hermeneutics back to Schleiermacher’s limited hermeneutical concept, that is, in analysing the specific conditions and rules for the interpretation of texts. The concept of hermeneutics is thus reduced again to its basic technical understanding, compared to the philosophical broadening which it underwent in the hermeneutical philosophy after Heidegger.</p>
<p>For textual interpretation, this means fundamentally taking into account the fact that we are dealing with material artifacts, which constitute a separate form of communication from the oral form. Peter Szondi accordingly developed a program for literary hermeneutics, which differs from Schleiermacher’s philological hermeneutics in that the aesthetic character of texts is not made secondary to the object of investigation, but instead is declared a premise of the interpretation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0040573611424329">15</xref></sup> A literary hermeneutics accordingly calls for attention to be paid to different kinds of texts (genres) and to use text-specific methods of interpretation.</p>
<p>Literary hermeneutics turns the attention of the author and the production of the text towards the reader and to the act of reading as reception of the text. This aspect of written texts and works of literature is investigated, in various formulations and different ways, by the so-called aesthetics of reception.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0040573611424329">16</xref></sup> Using the semiotic conceptualization of Charles Morris, it can be said that the aesthetics of reception analyses literary texts from a pragmatic viewpoint and develops pragmatic text models which make use not only of the author’s categories, but also those of the reader, in the interpretation process.</p>
<p>A fundamental recognition of literary hermeneutics and the aesthetics of reception, or of post-structuralistic text theories, is that of the autonomy which a text acquires over against its author as a consequence of being written down. Roland Barthes pointedly calls this process of autonomy the death of the author: “The voice loses its origin, the author enters into his own death, the written word begins.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0040573611424329">17</xref></sup> Umberto Eco similarly reminds us: “The author must pass on, after he has finished writing, so as not to disturb the text in its own movements.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0040573611424329">18</xref></sup> And Paul Ricœur declares: “What the text means no longer coincides with what the author wanted to say. The literal meaning, that which has become text, and that which is thought to be or which is psychologically the meaning have different destinies from now on.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0040573611424329">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Only thanks to this process of autonomy do the reader and his or her act of reading gain a fundamental significance not only for the understanding of understanding, but for the presence of any meaning and significance at all in a text. The meaning of the text is not substantively and ontologically inherent therein, but is always created anew through the act of reading.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0040573611424329">20</xref></sup> Texts call for work from the reader if the meaning is to appear.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0040573611424329">21</xref></sup> The meaning of a text, in other words, constitutes itself anew in each act of applying it. Texts are, in Eco’s words, “machines for generation (!) of meanings.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0040573611424329">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The text is autonomous over against both the empirical author and the empirical reader. Thus, the meaning of the text is not identical with the intention of the real author in writing it. The category of the aesthetics of production to which the author’s intention belongs is in any case psychological. Unlike deconstructivist textual theories, however, I follow Eco in assuming the meaning of a text is not identical with the <italic>intentio lectoris</italic> either, that is, with the meaning that the empirical reader claims to see in it. Instead, I agree with Eco that besides the <italic>intentio auctoris</italic> and the <italic>intentio lectoris</italic>, one must also assume that an <italic>intentio operis</italic> inhabits the text.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0040573611424329">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>In other words, the <italic>intentio operis</italic> is an idea which regulates interpretation, changes the model of the hermeneutical circle and is meant to protect the text from being taken over by the reader. The potential number of possible meanings is far beyond any one individual interpretation. Each act of reading is an act of selection from the multitude of possible meanings/references. However, the idea of the <italic>intentio operis</italic> validates, <italic>via negationis</italic>, the distinction between the variety of possible interpretations and those which are obviously overinterpretations; without this distinction, every interpretation would degenerate into pure arbitrariness and every intersubjective effort at understanding and making the text understandable would be called into doubt. “Between the unfathomable intention of the author and the disputable intention of the reader lies the transparent intention of the text itself, as the stumbling block for untenable interpretations.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0040573611424329">24</xref></sup> The category of the <italic>intentio operis</italic>, however, is not to be understood as though ideally only one interpretation would be correct. Instead, the capacity for multiple meanings of a text—especially in the case of certain genres, such as poetic texts—is a constitutive part of the <italic>intentio operis</italic>.</p>
<p>What all this means for ecumenical hermeneutics is that it, too, must learn to distinguish between literary hermeneutics and other types of hermeneutics. The document “A Treasure in Earthen Vessels” does not make any practical suggestions in this regard.</p>
<p>In concluding this section, I would like to speak briefly about the connection between hermeneutics and language. On the one hand, the hermeneutical problem should not be limited to the understanding of, or failure to understand, what is expressed in language. It is also true that the interpretation or application of traditions takes place not only through the language of words, but also in all forms of art, of celebration and liturgy. When the Protestant theologian Gerhard Ebeling called church history the history of the exposition of the Holy Scriptures,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0040573611424329">25</xref></sup> he did not aim to reduce church history to the history of Bible commentary or of Christian preaching. Works of arts, rituals and examples taken from everyday life are also forms through which the biblical witness to the gospel is interpreted. To be sure, Ebeling said, in consequence of more recent hermeneutics since Hans-Georg Gadamer, “The primary problem in understanding is not the understanding <italic>of</italic> language, but rather understanding <italic>through</italic> language.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0040573611424329">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>In different Christian traditions we find examples of a communication of the Gospels in the form of rites and symbols. But we have to be aware that these forms of communication themselves can only be reflected through the medium of language. Religious experiences which people have through the media of rites, gestures, signs and symbols, in the encounter with pictures, music or architecture, only acquire their specific significance and clarity of meaning in the context of a tradition in the form of language.</p>
<p>The question is whether there exists an understanding not only through language but also through images, symbols and rites. John of Damascus says to the function of the icon, “What the book is to the literate, the image is to the illiterate. Just as word speak to the ear, so the image speaks to the sight; it brings us to understanding.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0040573611424329">27</xref></sup> It seems to be an understanding not only of symbols and rites but through symbols and signs. But if we want to clarify the meaning of understanding we have to use verbal language. Hermeneutics of coherence: this means also that non-linguistic forms of communication are embedded in a particular linguistic construction of the Christian faith. The medium of language, in any case, remains central to Christianity’s communication of the gospel.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0040573611424329"><title>3. Symbols and signs</title>
<p>According to the document “A Treasure in Earthen Vessels,” texts, symbols, rites and practices are objects of ecumenical hermeneutics. What is to be understood by each of these terms individually is not specified. In 2004, a consultation on the issues of ecumenical hermeneutics, organized by Faith &amp; Order has taken place in Vienna. The letter of invitation to the Vienna hermeneutics consultation gave the following working definitions: a symbol “is a visible entity that both points toward and participates in a reality beyond itself.” For rites and practices, a more open definition is given, according to which a “‘rite’ would be an institutional liturgical action, whereas ‘practice’ could include personal piety/private devotion, a form of ministry or any tradition which falls outside the context of corporate or prescribed worship.”</p>
<p>Let us take the definition of symbols first. It follows the use of the concept by Paul Tillich and Paul Ricœur. Tillich distinguished between symbols and signs. “[W]hile the sign bears no necessary relation to that to which it points, the symbol participates in the reality of that for which it stands. The sign can be changed arbitrarily according to the demands of expediency, but [not] the symbol.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0040573611424329">28</xref></sup> Certainly for Tillich, symbols are not only non-linguistic, meaningful, images, for example, but also symbolic language, words such as “God,” “Christ,” or even “sin.”</p>
<p>Tillich’s concept of symbols presupposes the idea of the <italic>analogia entis</italic>. According to this, the fact (issue, content) that is expressed and the inner linguistic structure with which it is expressed should be analogous with one another. Only in this way can the symbol participate in that reality which it represents. To clarify this, Tillich borrowed John Randall’s concept of the “representative symbol.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0040573611424329">29</xref></sup> Representative symbols are found “not only in religious language, but also in poetry and the arts, in history and in community life.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0040573611424329">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Tillich gave as characteristics of symbols:
<list id="list1-0040573611424329" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Symbols characteristically “point beyond themselves.” They “transcend” the “symbolic material” which they use, and are thus ultimately the expression or indication of the transcendence which is the “ultimate Ground of Being,” Being-itself or God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0040573611424329">31</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Symbols participate in the reality of that to which they point.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Symbols “cannot be invented arbitrarily.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0040573611424329">32</xref></sup> This distinguishes them from signs. Symbols, to use the language of imagery, are born and can die. Above all, they only become symbols when they are accepted, unconsciously or consciously, by a community. Without such recognition, a symbol becomes merely “a metaphor or a poetic image.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0040573611424329">33</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Symbols have the power to “reveal power and dimensions of reality which are usually hidden due to the dominance of other dimensions.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0040573611424329">34</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Symbols are ambiguous. They can exercise a “constructive, organizing” or a “subversive, destructive power.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0040573611424329">35</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>This concept of symbols runs into particular difficulties, though, when applied to religious expressions. Here Tillich distinguished between primary and secondary religious symbols, between religious symbols of first and second rank, as it were.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0040573611424329">36</xref></sup> The problem with Tillich’s theory of symbols, as seen especially by the philosopher Max Horkheimer,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0040573611424329">37</xref></sup> arises from Tillich’s thesis that God can only be spoken of by means of symbols. One may agree with this, as Horkheimer conceded, because ultimately all human ideas of God are inadequate. But that brings up the difficulty that we no longer know exactly what religious symbols are pointing to. In order to use symbols correctly, we have to know their meaning. It must be possible to give information about them by non-symbolic means. In the case of God, however, it seems that this is not possible.</p>
<p>Tillich tried to disarm Horkheimer’s objections by putting in the place of the God concept the concept of the holy, which he borrowed from Rudolf Otto.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0040573611424329">38</xref></sup> Tillich tried to approach the holy on the one hand through phenomenology and on the other hand through ontology. For Tillich, linguistic expressions are religious concepts for us, for the answer as well as for the question of the meaning of being.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0040573611424329">39</xref></sup> The religious answers, however, are neither true nor false in a formally logical sense, “but are rather authentic or not authentic with regard to their origin; they are adequate or not adequate with regard to their power of expression; they are divine or demonic with regard to the ultimate Ground of Being.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0040573611424329">40</xref></sup> Criteria for the value of religious symbols are therefore authenticity, adequacy and theonomy (the state of being governed by God).</p>
<p>Tillich’s concept of symbol is closely related to his understanding of sacrament. Sacrament and symbol, for Tillich, relate to one another as do myth and cult. The sacramental, the participation of the finite in the infinite, is present in the symbolic by virtue of the <italic>analogia entis</italic>, so that all that is symbolic can also be described as sacramental.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, the usefulness of Tillich’s concept of symbol depends on whether one can speak of God only symbolically, or non-symbolically as well. At this point, Tillich betrayed some uncertainty. For example, he first said, “The statement that God is Being-itself is a non-symbolic statement. It does not point beyond itself.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0040573611424329">41</xref></sup> But he later had to give up this thesis, and declared that the only non-symbolic statement about God is the statement “that everything we say about God is symbolic.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0040573611424329">42</xref></sup> This is certainly not a statement about God, but rather about the word “God.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0040573611424329">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the end, Tillich’s concept of symbol does not hold up to Horkheimer’s objections. What possibly goes further than Tillich’s concept of symbol is the recent discussion of metaphor, but there is not time to go into this here.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0040573611424329">44</xref></sup> However, it is necessary to look at the concept of signs and the importance of semiotics for contemporary theology. Tillich distinguished between sign and symbol, as did Paul Ricœur. For Ricœur, “the revealing power of symbols” makes them the opposite of technical signs, which are only of a formal nature and can be reduced to the object of a calculation. Of symbols, on the other hand, Ricœur said that they “<italic>give</italic> what they say.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0040573611424329">45</xref></sup> Thus, a symbol is not an object; for Ricœur it has the character of a subject. And, as in Tillich, we find also in Ricœur the idea that through symbols we participate in a reality which points beyond the symbol.</p>
<p>However, this is where the semiotic critique of Ricœur comes in. His symbol theory threatens to ignore the tie between the sign and the human subject, in favour of an ontologically loaded concept of symbols which hypostatizes symbols into mysterious beings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0040573611424329">46</xref></sup> Tillich, on the other hand, made a point of symbols being received by an interpreting community. However, of him, too, the question may be asked, how valid is his distinction between symbol and sign, since in the end it also operates with an ontologically loaded concept of symbol and uses the metaphor of participation.</p>
<p>The insights of semiotics should also be brought into the discussion of ecumenical hermeneutics. From a semiotic viewpoint, the distinction between signs in general, and symbols as a class of signs which have a particularly “holy” quality, cannot stand. Signs and so-called symbols function, as a matter of principle, in the same way. Theologically, one should also consider the fact that the word “symbol” occurs nowhere in the entire biblical tradition. But the Bible does speak of signs (<italic>sēmeion</italic>), about 150 times all counted.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0040573611424329">47</xref></sup> The biblical word “sign” covers symbols as well, and miracles. But it is first of all a purely formal concept which is open to signifying different things, both religious and non-religious.</p>
<p>The word “symbol” (<italic>symbolon</italic>), in the early church as well as later on, designated the confessions of faith of the early centuries. In theology, “symbolism” originally referred to a sub-discipline of dogmatics, which had to do with the doctrine of the faith and the differences in doctrine between the individual confessions. The way the concept of symbol is used today, which is also that assumed by the document “A Treasure in Earthen Vessel,” goes back to modern philosophy and religious studies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0040573611424329">48</xref></sup> It has no genuine theological origin.</p>
<p>The concept of signs plays a central role throughout the history of theology. It is a key concept for every theory of religious language, for every form of doctrine of the faith and every form of the theory of truth. One need only recall the quarrel over the so-called doctrine of Universals in the Middle Ages. The distinction between <italic>signum</italic> and <italic>res</italic> plays an essential role not only in the doctrine of God, but also in the doctrine of sacraments. The concept of signs thus makes a connection between symbols and rites, of which the document “A Treasure in Earthen Vessels” speaks.</p>
<p>With their distinction between signs and symbols, Tillich and Ricœur are certainly drawing attention to an important perspective, which should be kept in mind despite all criticism of their concepts of symbols. I mean the potency of signs and actions with signs. Recent Protestant theology has been intensively concerned with John L. Austin’s theory of the speech act, especially his theory of the performing speech act.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0040573611424329">49</xref></sup> Both preaching and sacraments can be interpreted as speech acts in this sense, when speaking becomes the same as an action. However, the effect of the words or signs depends on the context. Tillich pointed out that a symbol must be accepted by a community in order to be effective as a symbol. We may say that actions by means of either language or signs offer people the healing presence and love of God. And they call on people to believe, to trust in what is offered. Seen in this way, it is true what Ricœur says, that symbols give what they say. But this giving takes place through communication among people, and depends on the meaning being understood.</p>
<p>For an ecumenical hermeneutics of signs, the insights of modern semiotics are highly enlightening. The various semiotic theories agree that signs possess not two, but three logical facets. Older theories of signs, for example the traditional theories of the sacraments, distinguish only between signs and things indicated by the signs. Recent semiotics includes, as a third entity, the person who interprets a sign as a sign. Signs only function as signs when they are pointed out as such by an interpreter, and thus are related to a certain reality. This process of interpreting signs is called “semiosis.” Charles Morris, one of the founders of modern semiotics, explains: “A semiosis is…an indirect taking-notice-of. The conveyors are sign-carriers, the notice-taking is the <italic>interpreting</italic>, the actor in the process is the interpreter, and that of which notice is taken is the <italic>designate</italic>.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0040573611424329">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>For our topic, the insight is important that signs are not signs in themselves, but only become signs or function as signs in relation to subject and context. The process of semiois is always an act of interpretation, which requires a subject making the interpretation. Semiois is always an open-ended process. In Christian churches, dogmatics has the function of regulating this open-ended process, so that the openness of semiosis in Christian confessions is not unlimited. The diversity of confessions, however, and the pluralism within the churches show that even within the Christian faith, the process of semiosis is fundamentally incapable of being closed off.</p>
<p>The goal of semiosis in Christianity is faith. The signs are intended to arouse belief. This is also the decisive theological criterion for signs: Do they awaken and strengthen faith, or do they lead people away from faith? Furthermore, in the New Testament, signs have a prophetic or eschatological character. They point to the in-breaking of God’s kingdom, which Jesus proclaims.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0040573611424329">51</xref></sup> Thus, they do not stand for transcendance in an unspecific religious sense, but rather point to that transcendance that we can call the coming of God into this world, or the nearness of God who became a human being in Jesus Christ.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0040573611424329"><title>4. Rituals, language games and ways of life</title>
<p>The concept of signs, I said earlier, creates an immediate connection between symbols and rites. The semiosis of Christian signs, however, does not take place only in a liturgical context, but also in the context of a comprehensive way of life. Thus, there is an internal connection between Faith and Order and Life and Work.</p>
<p>To describe this connection in a theoretical way as well, it is good to make a connection between semiotics and the language game theory of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. From him we can learn that religions or confessions do not crystallize around single words or isolated symbols, but rather create language “games” which have inner coherence, and which are always part of a particular way of life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0040573611424329">52</xref></sup> This way of life in turn cannot exist without its particular word “game.” Like the way of life of a particular religion or Christian denomination, the language games which structure it are highly compulsory for the practitioners of the religion. Here I would like to point out the formulation in “A Treasure in Earthen Vessels” which calls the Church “a hermeneutical community.” The Church, or the individual churches, are the communities of interpretation in which “language games” educate people for a particular way of life.</p>
<p>The individual words or signs—words, too, are signs—receive their meaning only within a particular language “game,” that is, on the basis of a particular grammar. The process of semiosis takes place always within a particular language game, or in Wittgenstein’s words, “The meaning of a word is its use in the language.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0040573611424329">53</xref></sup> One and the same word or sign can thus have quite different meanings within different language games, just as the same game counters can be used in different games and according to different rules.</p>
<p>This is also true for Christianity. In the New Testament, we can already see how concepts and images have different meanings as used by the various writers. The same goes for confessions. They distinguish themselves from one another by presenting coherent, but different, overall interpretations of the Gospel witness of the New Testament. The same signs and words can therefore have different meanings. And, depending on the topic, different signs and words can have equivalent meanings.</p>
<p>The Lutheran theologian Edmund Schlink pointed out what significance this can have for an ecumenical theology. For him,
<disp-quote>
<p>the task is not only to translate from one language to another. Doctrinal statements which have been made on different historical fronts, using different conceptual systems, in fundamentally different forms of theological utterance and on the basis of different anthropological prerequisites for knowledge, cannot be directly compared with one another, but must be translated from the one historical front, conceptual system and message structure into the others, if there is to be true recognition of agreement and difference and of the true weight of the difference.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0040573611424329">54</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For further work on the project of an ecumenical hermeneutics, we can formulate the following question: How do the churches as hermeneutical communities deal with the open dynamic of semiotics, its open-endedness and plurality? Can they accept and legitimate it theologically? What are the function and the purposes of doctrinal teaching of the Church? Does it encourage the dynamic of semiotics, or will it try to reduce its plurality and to finish semiotics as an open-ended process?</p>
<p>The systems of signs in different confessions each have a different grammar. It is this which distinguishes confessions and denominations from one another. The task for an ecumenical hermeneutics is to compare not only the different signs, but also the different grammars. Thus, theology is the grammar of the Christian faith.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0040573611424329">55</xref></sup> As is true of all languages, the grammar of the Christian faith, or of the various Christian confessions, will be found not to be a static, closed set of rules, but rather a dynamic one. The biblical texts are the living source from which the language of the faith is continually being reborn. The science of languages includes the concept of a generative grammar or a generative poetics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0040573611424329">56</xref></sup> In the best case, an ecumenical hermeneutics can be such a generative grammar, which gives rise to new forms of language and expression which can cut across confessions or bring them together.</p>
<p>The document “A Treasure in Earthen Vessels” uses the concept of coherence as well as that of unity. Theology, as grammar, already looks after coherence within confessions and their language “games.” But what about coherence between confessions? Here I would like to replace the concept of visible unity of the churches, which in my estimation is questionable, with Wittgenstein’s concept of family resemblance. Different language games and their grammars show a relatedness which Wittgenstein calls a family resemblance. What he says in general about language games is, in my estimation, also an accurate characteristic of the Christian ecumenical movement. “We see a complex network of resemblances which overlap and criss-cross one another, in matters both great and small.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0040573611424329">57</xref></sup> However, despite all likenesses, the differences among confessions, their systems of signs and their grammars should not be denied. One can say that the Christian confessions form a family, in theological terms, the family of God.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s concept of family resemblance has the great advantage that it allows us to speak of a coherence among confessions which is not hierarchical, and does not consist of a lowest common denominator on which everyone has to agree. In explaining his family resemblance concept, Wittgenstein compares it to a thread. For example, we extend the concept of the number
<disp-quote>
<p>the way in which, in spinning a thread, we twist fibre together with fibre. The strength of the thread does not depend on any single thread which runs all the way through, but rather on the overlapping of many fibres. If one should say, “All these images have something in common—that is, the disjunction of all these points in common”—I should reply: you are only playing with one word here. One can just as well say there is a Something which runs all the way through the thread, and that is the overlapping, without any gaps, of these fibres.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0040573611424329">58</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>We can use the concept of what is Christian, or of what is ecumenical, in the same way. In my view, setting the goal as the visible unity of the churches depends on a fundamental misunderstanding of what unites Christians and churches. To use Wittgenstein’s image, there is no red thread which ties Christians and churches together, no substance which goes all the way through, not even the ministry in three parts, a confessional text or a particular liturgy. What ties us together is, instead, a process, that of the solid overlapping of the different strands of Christian tradition, the history of which shows not only continuities but also discontinuities, divisions, breaks, and new starts. The solid overlapping of the threads only takes places through the work of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit’s work creates that coherence of the ecumenical community which is constantly undergoing a dynamic and eschatological process.</p>
<p>In this sense, I would like to take up the formulation from “A Treasure in Earthen Vessels” which says an ecumenical hermeneutics is “a hermeneutics of coherence.” Ecumenical hermeneutics is not an instrument for implementing or enforcing a program for unity of whatever kind. It is rather that art which helps us to discover and to understand better those complex and dynamic family resemblances which bind the confessions together regardless of their differences. Such discovery and understanding is certainly, once again, a process of interpretation, an open-ended semiotic process. We can also say that it is a leap of faith.</p></sec>
