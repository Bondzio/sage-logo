<p>Recently, my son came home from school, eager to show me his new soprano recorder. He plopped down next to me and said, “Dad, listen to this!” then proceeded to play a rendition of “Hot Cross Buns” only a father could love. Eager to show me all he had learned about the new recorder, he continued, “Dad, here is what you do.” As he spent the next moments showing me the recorder fundamentals learned in school, I found myself, as a parent, wishing that a guide or tutorial would have been sent home, something I could use as reference to reinforce the recorder skills he had learned.</p>
<p>In this column, I offer a recipe for making attractive, informative tutorials that can be sent to students and parents via e-mail or posted on a school website. Although tutorials are often included with software, many are either too complex or too rudimentary to directly address music educators’ unique needs. My recipe will focus on the following four operations: (a) editing and arranging video clips, (b) adding audio overdubs and adjusting sound levels, (c) adding titles, and (d) outputting your finished product in an appropriate video format. The software tool used is iMovie ’11 (Version 9.0.8), a software title included with Apple Macintosh computers at no additional charge.</p>
<sec id="section1-1048371313476036">
<title>Editing and Arranging Video Clips</title>
<p>After importing video clips to the computer from a camera, individual clips will appear for editing in the Event Browser. Each clip will be displayed as frames marked with various time points in the clip; the intervals between the clips can be adjusted using the “slider” under the right edge of the Event Browser. Typically, editing clips involves either trimming video from the beginning or end of a clip or excising multiple portions of video from within an individual clip. Both methods of editing share the same goal—creating “smaller chunks” of usable video to appear in your tutorial.</p>
<p>Accustomed to other high-end video-editing programs, I did not find how to edit video clips with this program immediately apparent. After viewing a brief non-Apple tutorial on YouTube about editing clips in iMovie ’11, however, the straightforward process became apparent. To trim unwanted video segments from a clip, follow this procedure:</p>
<list id="list1-1048371313476036" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Hover the cursor over the video clip and move it to the point where the edited clip should begin.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Click hold and drag the cursor to the point where the edited clip should end.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>You should now have a yellow box enclosing your selected video portion. The cursor will turn into a hand, which may then be used to lengthen or shorten the box.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>With the hand cursor hovering over the yellow box, drag the edited portion of the clip to the Project Window—the window located on the upper left of iMovie ’11.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In iMovie ’11, arranging clips occurs in the Project Window, the window to the upper left of the screen. The individual clips initially edited in the Browser Window should now be appearing in this window, and are ready to be arranged in the order needed to appear in your movie. The sample movie I have created for this column consists of three clips: one demonstrating good posture while playing the recorder (Clip 1); another showing the student fingering the notes B, A, and G (Clip 2); and the third demonstrating the kind of steady breath needed to create a beautiful tone on the instrument (Clip 3). (Watch Example 1 for the unedited clips.) Initially, I thought this would be a useful sequence for the three clips, but then I changed my mind. Deciding that the final sequence for the movie tutorial should be Clips 1, 3, then 2, necessitated making changes. To change the order of individual video clips, use the following procedure:</p>
<list id="list2-1048371313476036" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>In the Project Window, hover the arrow cursor over the third of the three clips (the arrow cursor once again changes to a hand, and a yellow box appears around the entire clip).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Click-hold and drag the third clip to the space between the first and second clips (a vertical green line appears between the clips, indicating that moving the third clip between the first two is permissible).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Releasing the mouse button inserts the third clip between the other two clips.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>You can watch the video of the new sequencing of the clips in the Viewer Window by moving the cursor to the beginning of the first clip—a vertical red line indicates the point where play begins—and pushing the space bar.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Numerous other adjustments, too many to note in this brief column, can be made to video clips in iMovie ’11. In my experience, however, these two procedures—editing the length of video clips and rearranging the order in which they appear in a final movie—remain the most important.</p>

<title>Adding Audio Overdubs and Adjusting Sound Levels</title>
<p>One must know two procedures to create a tutorial file similar to the one created for this article: (a) how to overdub your voice on a video clip’s audio track and (b) how to adjust the overall sound level of your movie. Both procedures are straightforward in iMovie ’11. The “overdubbing” procedure adds a narration track over the sound recorded with a video track so that the overdubbed track is louder than the original soundtrack, which is still present but reduced in volume; we are familiar with overdubbing through its use in radio, as well as television news and documentaries. To overdub your voice onto the video segments in the Project Window, use the following procedure:</p>
<list id="list3-1048371313476036" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>With your Project open in the Project Browser, click on the Voiceover button (the button just below the Viewer Window displayed as a microphone icon).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Voiceover window opens. Select the microphone you want to use from the Record From pop-up.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Speak at the approximate volume that will be used when recording your narration. Set the slider so that the audio meters register green and yellow, but not red, during your speaking.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In the Project Browser, hover the cursor to the frame where you want the voiceover to begin and click once. You will hear three beeps, then the audio recording begins.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Click anywhere in the project, or push the space bar, to end recording. A purple “soundtrack” appears underneath the video clip, indicating your sound was recorded.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Click X to close the Voiceover Window.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Finally, double click on the purple soundtrack, which opens an “Inspector” window. Select Audio at the top of the window, then click on the box to enable “Ducking” and listening to your project. Adjust the volume level of the video soundtrack when your voiceover track occurs to create a composite soundtrack that includes some or none of the original sound recorded by the camera.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>There are two ways to adjust the audio track levels in your project. (Note: The levels of the soundtrack recorded with the video and the level of the overdubbed soundtrack can be adjusted independently.) The first method is to command the computer to adjust a soundtrack’s volume level automatically, a process called “normalizing.” When the computer normalizes a soundtrack’s volume, it raises the volume level of the entire soundtrack to a degree that the loudest sounds on the soundtrack are boosted to 0 dB full scale—that is, the loudest point in digital parameters before distortion occurs. Use the following procedure to normalize the volume of a soundtrack:</p>
<list id="list4-1048371313476036" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>With the cursor hovering over a video clip in the Project Browser, double click on the clip to open the Inspector Window.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>At the top of the Inspector Window, click on Audio.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Near the bottom of the Inspector Window, there is a button labeled “Normalize Clip Volume.” Click on it. That particular clip’s audio track has now been normalized.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The second method to adjust a soundtrack’s volume is to “manually” adjust the volume. To do so, use the following procedure:</p>
<list id="list5-1048371313476036" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>With the cursor hovering over a video clip in the Project Browser, double click on the clip to open an “Inspector” Window.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Click on Audio near the top of the “Inspector” Window.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>While listening to the clip play back, adjust the Volume slider at the top of the “Inspector” Window.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Other types of adjustments that can be made to audio in iMovie ’11, such as equalization (changing a sound’s timbral quality) and adding audio effects (reverb, echo, delay, etc.). These adjustments are easily made in the Audio Inspector Window and—best of all—identified using terminology a non–audio specialist can understand. (Watch Example 2 for the completed sample tutorial.)</p>
<p>Video tutorials are an excellent tool for extending and reinforcing classroom learning into students’ homes, allowing students and parents to view them repeatedly. General music teachers can create any number of tutorials containing basic concepts in learning to play instruments such as recorder, guitar, and Orff instruments. Videos containing overviews of rhythms and terms could include the following: clapping rhythms while providing the board work examples from that day’s lesson; noting musical score symbols and directions while also providing a musical example of a “ritardando” or “accelerando.” Applied music teachers could create an entire video series over a period of a few years that illustrate—to a detailed degree—essentials of singing or playing a particular instrument or achieving a particular effect on an instrument. Ensemble conductors, having recorded a single rehearsal or series of rehearsals, could isolate particular passages for the ensemble, and use “overdubbing.” Overdubbing allows the teacher to narrate places needing improvement and make suggestions for improvement or, by way of comparison and contrast, to illustrate and praise the ensemble for improvement on a passage by combining previous rehearsals with a current rehearsal. The technological means for documenting classroom music experiences, and for offering students reinforcement and extension of those classroom experiences, are available now in even the most basic video editing programs. These programs are stable, feature laden, and—with respect to their basic features—easily learned and quickly mastered. In no time at all, you will “mix up” your own “recipe,” allowing you to offer even more instruction, remediation, and enrichment for your students.</p>
