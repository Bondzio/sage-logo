<body>
<p>Emerging from recognition that medical treatment alone did not meet the complex needs of people with severe mental illness, the original clubhouse named “Fountain House” was established in 1948 by a group of ex patients from a New York psychiatric hospital.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213492235">1</xref></sup> The methods at Fountain House have since been developed into the “clubhouse model” of psychiatric rehabilitation, which is currently used at over 300 sites, across more than 27 countries worldwide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213492235">2</xref></sup> including eight in Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213492235">3</xref></sup> The International Centre for Clubhouse Development website indicates there are four in Queensland, two in NSW, one in South Australia and one in Tasmania.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213492235">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>While engaged in psychiatric rehabilitation, clubhouses have also been at the forefront of developing “recovery-oriented services”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213492235">4</xref></sup> According to Oades et al., recovery-focused mental health services often struggle to describe their model of care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213492235">5</xref></sup> The clubhouse model is an exception, with 36 clearly articulated accreditation standards guided by the following four core principles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213492235">3</xref></sup>:</p>
<list id="list1-1039856213492235" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A right to a place to come;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A right to meaningful work;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A right to meaningful relationships;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A right to a place to return.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Using a social franchise approach reliant on both government and philanthropic funding, each clubhouse is organized as an independent center linked to Fountain House via a tri annual accreditation fee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213492235">2</xref></sup> Typically open Monday to Friday, modern clubhouses offer a broad range of programs designed to provide a safe environment, supportive relationships and employment opportunities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213492235">6</xref></sup> The following vignette is used to illustrate some of the potential advantages of the model (all identifying information has been removed).</p>
<p>Vignette: ‘Susan’ had a complex history including developmental disability, drug abuse and paranoid schizophrenia. She was referred to a local clubhouse by her government disability support pension caseworker. Through regular involvement, she started to feel more comfortable in the setting, forming friendships and engaging in prevocational skills-building activities that boosted her confidence. With the encouragement of members and staff, she soon began spending 3–4 days per week at the clubhouse, reducing social isolation which improved her self-esteem.</p>
<p>Managing Susan’s symptoms of paranoia and auditory hallucinations remained challenging due to her poor organizational skills, lack of disposable income and impulsivity. Two years after commencement at the clubhouse, her disability support pension caseworker was reviewing her file. She asked why Susan had been able to attend the clubhouse regularly but had been unable to find paid work in the competitive job market?</p>
<sec id="section5-1039856213492235">
<title>Overview</title>
<p>Like Susan, people seeking to overcome mental illness often cite improved social support as crucial to their recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213492235">7</xref></sup> In the clubhouse model, participants are referred to as “members” rather than patients or clients in an effort to engender shared ownership and involvement. Pursuing a satisfying life is preeminent, with a strong emphasis on identifying personal strengths rather than focusing on clinical symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213492235">8</xref></sup> Members commonly cite increased confidence, acceptance, empowerment and hope through the opportunity to engage in supportive relationships with others who share their experience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213492235">9</xref></sup> Alongside supportive relationships, a wide range of rehabilitation programs are offered, typically including case management, social advocacy, housing assistance, psycho-educational and employment activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213492235">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Relevant to Susan’s involvement in confidence-building prevocational activities are the model’s employment programs, which have been shown to be effective in randomized controlled trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213492235">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213492235">11</xref></sup> The model’s foundational prevocational program is an activity schedule referred to as “the work ordered day”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213492235">2</xref></sup> This follows the timetable of a typical working week, whereby instead of presenting for a time-limited appointment or therapeutic group, each day members are given the opportunity to work alongside paid staff. In this way, members build skills and relationships, while also assisting the function of the clubhouse, including reception and administration, meal preparation and building maintenance activities, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213492235">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>A second prevocational program offered by clubhouses is referred to as the “transitional employment program”. This provides short-term job placement positions brokered between individual clubhouses and local businesses, designed to provide a confidence-building stepping stone towards paid employment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213492235">10</xref></sup> Finally, the model provides a “supported employment program”, which offers assistance and ongoing support to acquire and maintain work in the competitive job market.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213492235">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The multifaceted nature of modern clubhouses appears to have made them challenging for researchers to study and describe with consistency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213492235">13</xref></sup> For example, the clubhouse has been described as a “prevocational program”,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213492235">14</xref></sup> a “multi service program”,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213492235">10</xref></sup> a “self help group”,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213492235">15</xref></sup> and an “intentional recovery community”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213492235">16</xref></sup> The apparent risk is that descriptions which focus on discrete clubhouse programs without acknowledging their place within the model’s wider context may lead to unfounded appraisal and false comparison.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856213492235">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>While the model’s complexity has proved challenging for researchers, it appears to have been viewed as a strength by people with severe mental illness who “vote with their feet”, averaging a daily attendance exceeding 160 participants per site at North American clubhouses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213492235">14</xref></sup> Indeed, the model has proved so popular amongst consumers and families in North America that it is now mandated in several states, and Hinden and colleagues suggest further programs should be developed through improved engagement and education of the children and families of members.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213492235">15</xref></sup></p>

<title>Criticism</title>
<p>As suggested by Susan’s experience in the vignette, accessing regular psychiatric review is often challenging for people with complex mental illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213492235">16</xref></sup> A major gap in the clubhouse model is its failure to provide consistent access to on-site psychiatry clinics. With a few notable exceptions in North America,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213492235">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213492235">18</xref></sup> this generally leaves members to organize their own access to psychiatric care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856213492235">19</xref></sup> Relevant is research demonstrating that improved access to psychiatry leads to improved life satisfaction and higher rates of paid employment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856213492235">20</xref></sup> There appears to have been an attempt to remedy this situation in recent times, with proponents such as Aquila and colleagues writing enthusiastically about the importance of providing improved access to psychiatry for clubhouse members.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213492235">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another criticism may be found in the literature on models of supported employment, such as the Individual Placement Support (IPS) program which is recognized for its fast job placement of people with mental illness and provision of long-term clinical support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1039856213492235">21</xref></sup> These studies often focus on comparing the IPS program with clubhouse’s two prevocational programs. Similar to Susan’s experience with her center link officer, concern is expressed in this research that members may become overly reliant on the relationships and activities within clubhouses, breeding a form of institutional dependence which compromising movement towards paid employment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1039856213492235">21</xref></sup> If prevocational programs were all that clubhouses offered, then this criticism may be partly valid (notwithstanding the literature supporting the clubhouse’s value in the employment area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213492235">18</xref></sup>). However, while IPS is clearly an employment-focused program, the clubhouse model has multiple foci, emphasizing provision of a safe environment, social networks, educational and employment opportunities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213492235">3</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1039856213492235" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Implications and conclusion</title>
<p>The literature suggests that the modern clubhouse is a valuable model of psychiatric rehabilitation, providing a multifaceted mix of social, educational and employment programs that attract large numbers of people to over 300 sites worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213492235">2</xref></sup> Opportunities to improve the model exist, and one example is the inclusion of onsite psychiatry clinics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213492235">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The model’s complexity provides a challenging mixture of programs to describe and evaluate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213492235">13</xref></sup> Due to their applicability in complex healthcare settings, mixed methodological research approaches might be useful in future.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856213492235">22</xref></sup> Broad service evaluation paradigms such as recovery-orientated service measurement tools capable of adequately grasping the complexity of the clubhouse model might also be worth considering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1039856213492235">23</xref></sup></p>
