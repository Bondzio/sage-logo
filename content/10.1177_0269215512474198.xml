<p>One of the many interesting aspects of editing this journal is reading and learning about disorders, assessments and treatments that I have never heard of. And one of the potentially important benefits of printed journals is the serendipitous reading about something that may influence one, but one would never look for. For example this issue has an <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra1-0269215512474198" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512450521">evaluation</related-article> comparing two breathing techniques for asthma - Buteyko and Pranayama breathing techniques; I have never heard of either. It seems that the Pranayama technique may be better than Buteyko, and both may be better than none. Nor would it have occurred to me that exercise might reduce <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra2-0269215512474198" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512450522">asymptomatic bacteriuria</related-article> in people with complete spinal cord injury – but it seems that it may do so. And I had never heard of <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra3-0269215512474198" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512448381">‘re-investment’</related-article> in the context of psychology and movement control (rather than financial), a concept from sports science that may be relevant in rehabilitation. Finally I had not heard of <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra4-0269215512474198" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512448388">‘platelet-rich plasma’</related-article>, let alone its injection into tendons or muscles. But it may help patients with rotator cuff disorder. Some papers in this issue cover more traditional topics. A small, <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra5-0269215512474198" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512448382">pilot trial</related-article> (n = 43) on patients with Parkinson’s disease suggests that following the guidance for occupational therapy in the Dutch Guideline on managing people with Parkinson’s disease is beneficial, though a larger trial is still needed. Another <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra6-0269215512474198" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512448256">study</related-article> on 40 patients with joint pain attributed to hormonally-based treatment of breast carcinoma found that hydrotherapy reduced pain. This is one of an increasing number of studies published in this journal and elsewhere supporting the use of hydrotherapy, a treatment that had a minimal evidence base some 10 years ago. A third <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra7-0269215512474198" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512453061">investigation</related-article> of the benefits of exercise in this issue concerns children who have severe limitations on mobility due to cerebral palsy; 35 children were studied, and exercise seems to help them. As the investigators conclude, a larger study is warranted and is needed. Many readers may have seen the report in the BMJ from the ACT NoW trial of speech and language therapy after stroke. In this issue we publish a further, <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra8-0269215512474198" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512450042">qualitative analysis</related-article> from the study investigating which aspects of intervention were appreciated by patients. This should influence how patients with aphasia after stroke are managed. There are many studies that investigate, retrospectively the factors associated with falls but there are few prospective studies. In <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra9-0269215512474198" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512452880">a paper</related-article> published in this issue two measures of factors previously shown to be associated with falls were measured in 146 nursing home patients. Their predictive value was low. Finally there is a <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra10-0269215512474198" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512452879">study</related-article> comparing two measures of sitting balance and trunk control: the Sitting Balance Scale and the Trunk Impairment Scale. They seem similar.</p>
