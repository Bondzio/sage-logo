<abstract>
<p>Women with genital human papillomavirus (HPV) experience considerable stress and uncertainty as a result of the diagnosis; however, little is known about the sources of uncertainty in HPV. Given that uncertainty creates stress, which might be linked to the pathogenesis of cervical cancer, research on these sources of uncertainty is warranted. To this end, we completed semistructured interviews with 25 women living with HPV, and identified seven sources of uncertainty: The meaning of the diagnosis, the potential for disease progression, finances, the source of the infection, disclosure, sex and reproduction, and the HPV vaccine. In the discussion we articulate the relevance and importance of study findings to research, theory, and practice.</p>

<p>Virologists have identified more than 120 types of the human papillomavirus (HPV), approximately 30 of which are sexually transmitted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311424404">Maggino et al., 2007</xref>). Although the majority of those infected with HPV through sexual contact will experience no symptoms, some types of the virus cause genital warts, and others can result in cancers of the cervix, anus, penis, vagina, and vulva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311424404">Daley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732311424404">Waller, McCaffery, Forrest, &amp; Wardle, 2004</xref>). To aid in early detection and diagnosis of HPV-related cancers, researchers have classified the types of HPV based on their oncogenic risk (Maggino et al.). Fifteen high-risk forms of HPV have been identified, but two types (16 and 18) account for 70% of all cervical cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311424404">Bertram &amp; Magnusson, 2008</xref>). As such, HPV infection is widely recognized as the primary cause of cervical cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311424404">McCaffery &amp; Irwig, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>With incidence rates of 5 to 6 million per year, HPV has surpassed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpes as the most common sexually transmitted infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311424404">Daley et al., 2008</xref>). Although approximately 20 million people in the United States have been diagnosed with HPV, a majority of those individuals will not develop HPV-related cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311424404">Coker, Bond, Madeline, Luchok, &amp; Pirisi, 2003</xref>). The relatively low incidence of HPV-related cancers compared to the high incidence of HPV infection has been attributed to preventative measures and the transitory nature of most HPV infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311424404">Bertram &amp; Magnusson, 2008</xref>). Viral persistence, however, has been linked to the development of genital warts and cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732311424404">Waller et al., 2004</xref>). Given that viral persistence is largely a function of the host’s immune response, researchers have postulated that individuals infected with high-risk HPV whose immune systems are compromised by stress or disease are at increased risk of developing genital warts and cancers (Coker et al.).</p>
<p>Considerable effort and attention has been devoted to primary HPV prevention (in the form of an HPV vaccine); however, secondary prevention efforts have received comparatively little attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311424404">Maggino et al., 2007</xref>). With a significant portion of the population already infected with HPV, secondary prevention efforts designed to combat additional infections and the negative consequences of infection are of equal or even greater importance than primary prevention efforts and issues. This study was designed to inform these secondary prevention efforts by examining the uncertainty experienced by women living with HPV. The following sections review the small but growing body of literature on the psychosocial impact of HPV, as well as the theoretical underpinnings and contributions of the present investigation.</p>
<p>Research on the psychosocial impact of HPV indicates that the diagnosis is associated with an array of negative psychological and social outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732311424404">Waller et al., 2004</xref>). Initial reactions to the diagnosis range from embarrassment and shame to fear and uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311424404">Taylor, Keller, &amp; Egan, 1997</xref>). In addition to damaging one’s self-concept, HPV can have a negative impact on moods and relationships. Common psychological sequelae of HPV infection and diagnosis include depression and anxiety. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311424404">Maissi et al. (2004)</xref> documented high levels of state anxiety (temporary, situational anxiety) and depression in women living with HPV, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311424404">Maggino et al. (2007)</xref> found that women diagnosed with HPV experienced intrusive thoughts and psychological distress. Relational issues and concerns compound these psychological effects of HPV testing and diagnosis. Women living with HPV report a range of relational problems, including a lack of social support, fear of disclosure and rejection, fertility and transmission concerns, and sexual problems (Waller et al.).</p>
<p>These negative psychological and relational effects, though troubling in and of themselves, are of particular concern given their potential impact on the persistence and progression of HPV. Research on the history and etiology of cervical cancer is suggestive of an association between psychosocial factors such as depression, anxiety, and social support, and the pathogenesis of cancer. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311424404">Dodd et al. (2009)</xref> found that women with depressive symptomalogy had greater odds of presenting with cervical neoplasia than women who were not clinically depressed. In a longitudinal investigation of the association between stress and cervical cancer pathogenesis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732311424404">Pereria et al. (2003)</xref> concluded that “higher life stress increased the odds of developing progressive/persistent squamous intraepithelial lesions by seven-fold” (p. 427). The occurrence and recurrence of genital warts and cervical cancer also have been linked to pessimistic attitudes and a lack of social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732311424404">Goodkin, Antoni, Helder, &amp; Sevin, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The possible link between psychosocial factors and cervical cancer has not gone unnoticed by researchers and interventionists, who have turned their attention to identifying the root causes of psychological distress in women living with HPV. Although few, if any, researchers have examined HPV-related uncertainty, several scholars have cited uncertainty as a source of stress and distress for women living with HPV. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311424404">Daley et al. (2008)</xref> found that the uncertainty surrounding the transmission, prevention, and treatment of the infection contributed to the stress and anxiety experienced by women living with HPV. Other frequently cited stressors include confusion and concern about the source and course of the infection (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311424404">Linnehan &amp; Groce, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311424404">McCaffery &amp; Irwig, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311424404">Cothran and White (2002)</xref> also stressed the importance of uncertainty management for women with HPV, arguing that even low-risk types of HPV “require that the patient cope with uncertainty” (p. 312).</p>
<p>Although researchers have argued that uncertainty is part and parcel of living with and managing HPV, the sources of that uncertainty are not well documented. Given the potential for uncertainty to create stress for women living with HPV, and the possible link between stress and the pathogenesis of cervical cancer, examining these sources of uncertainty is of great practical value. For example, interventions aimed at reducing the stress and negative consequences of HPV infection hinge on these expanded research efforts. In addition to its practical value, a study of the sources or causes of HPV-related uncertainty promises to advance research and theory in nursing and allied health disciplines. Uncertainty is a focal construct in health research; however, the management of uncertainty has garnered far more attention than the causes or sources of uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311424404">Hurley, Kosenko, &amp; Brashers, 2011</xref>). This study of the sources of uncertainty in HPV answers the call for additional research on the creation and construction (as opposed to the management) of uncertainty.</p>
<p>This study also builds on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311424404">Mishel’s (1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311424404">1990</xref>) theory of and research on uncertainty in illness. In the 1980s, Merle Mishel developed a theory to explain one’s experience of and responses to uncertainty, defined as “the inability to determine the meaning of illness-related events” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311424404">Mishel, 1988</xref>, p. 225). Some criticized Mishel’s theory of uncertainty in illness, arguing that it only applied to acute illnesses (i.e., those with a rapid onset and short course). In response, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311424404">Mishel (1990)</xref> developed a theory of uncertainty in chronic illness (i.e., a long-lasting or recurrent medical problem, such as HPV infection). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732311424404">Mishel and Clayton (2003)</xref>, the theory of uncertainty in chronic illness consists of three main components: antecedents, appraisals, and coping. Antecedents to uncertainty include the stimuli frame, which consists of symptom patterns, event familiarity, and event congruence; cognitive capacity, which refers to the individual’s ability to process information; and, structure providers, defined as resources that can assist with the interpretation of the stimuli frame. According to the theory, incongruence between one’s expectations and experiences (i.e., event congruence), novel or unfamiliar events (i.e., event familiarity), and complicated or inconsistent symptom patterns contribute to uncertainty in illness. One’s ability to process information and his or her available resources, in the form of credible authorities, social support, and education, impact the stimuli frame and, thus, one’s experience of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Mishel and other scholars have applied and tested the theories in various illness contexts, including prostate, breast, and gynecological cancer (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311424404">Bailey, Mishel, Belyea, Stewart, &amp; Mohler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732311424404">Mishel &amp; Sorenson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732311424404">Wonghongkul, Moore, Musil, Schneider, &amp; Deimling, 2000</xref>), HIV (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311424404">Brashers, Neidig, Reynolds, &amp; Haas, 1998</xref>), and atrial fibrillation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732311424404">Kang, Daly, &amp; Kim, 2004</xref>). Although the antecedents to uncertainty are rarely the focus of these investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732311424404">Wallace, 2005</xref>), a handful of studies have explored the causes or sources of uncertainty in illness. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311424404">Brashers et al. (2003)</xref> found that individuals living with HIV attributed their uncertainty to medical (e.g., complex treatment regimens), personal (e.g., conflicting roles), and social (e.g., unclear relational consequences) issues. In a study of the uncertainty associated with organ failure and transplantation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311424404">Martin, Stone, Scott, and Brashers (2010)</xref> noted that the sources of uncertainty differed depending on one’s transplant status. For instance, those waiting for an organ transplant experienced uncertainty related to unknown organ availability, whereas those who had received a transplant reported concerns about complex medicine regimens and organ rejection. Taken together, these studies demonstrated that “specific illnesses have unique qualities that produce different types of uncertainty” (Martin et al., p. 193). Given that uncertainty is context specific and that few, if any, studies have been focused specifically on uncertainty in the context of HPV, the following research question was posed: What are the sources of uncertainty experienced by women living with HPV?</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732311424404" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>In a review of the research on her theory of uncertainty in chronic illness, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311424404">Mishel (1999)</xref> concluded, “Since the theory depicts a nonlinear process, it is best suited to qualitative studies” (p. 273). As such, we designed and conducted a qualitative study of the sources of uncertainty in HPV. The following sections describe the procedures followed and the sample recruited for this study.</p>
<sec id="section2-1049732311424404">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>After securing the approval of the North Carolina State University Institutional Review Board, we began recruitment efforts. We posted study announcements in community centers, libraries, restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores, and buildings on college campuses in cities across the southeastern United States. In addition, we distributed study announcements via social networking Web sites (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://facebook.com">facebook.com</ext-link>), electronic bulletin boards (e.g., craigslist.org), and online support groups. Recruitment materials contained a description of the study (i.e., “one-on-one, face-to-face interviews”), its purpose (i.e., “to learn more about the stress and coping of women with HPV”), and inclusion criteria (i.e., women aged 18 or older who had been diagnosed with HPV). Potential participants contacted the lead author (Kosenko) via email or telephone, and interviews were arranged with those who met the study criteria. Participants selected the time, date, and location of the interview, and all were offered $15 for participating.</p>
<p>We began the study with an interview guide (a list of topics to be covered), which we used in a series of pilot interviews (<italic>n</italic> = 3). Based on the data derived from these brief (14 to 20 minute) interviews, we developed our research question and interview schedule (a list of interview questions and possible prompts). All participants, including those interviewed during the pilot data collection stage, read and signed an informed consent document and completed a brief demographic questionnaire before beginning the interview. The research team member conducting the interview began by describing its purpose and requesting permission to audiotape the discussion. The interview schedule used for each interview contained three main sections. The first set of questions focused on the uncertainties experienced at the time of diagnosis (e.g., “How did the diagnosis make you feel? Did you experience any uncertainty? What were you uncertain about?”). The second set of questions centered on the uncertainties associated with the treatment and management of HPV (e.g., “Since the diagnosis, has HPV caused you any stress? Have you felt any uncertainty? What makes you feel uncertain?”), and the final section of the interview schedule contained questions about uncertainty management (e.g., “How do you deal with the uncertainty? Do you have any strategies for coping with the uncertainty or questions you have?”). In this article we focus on participants’ responses to the first two sets of questions, and draw on all interviews, including the ones conducted during the pilot data collection stage.</p>
<p>Our approach to data collection and analysis was informed by grounded theory methods. For example, we collected and analyzed data simultaneously, which allowed us to assess emerging themes and refine the interview schedule to pursue particularly fruitful lines of inquiry. These procedures are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732311424404">Glaser’s (1978)</xref> description of theoretical sampling: “The analyst jointly collects, codes, and analyzes his data and decides what data to collect next and where to find them, in order to develop his theory as it emerges” (p. 36). Concurrent data collection and analysis also helped us determine when we had reached theoretical saturation, the point at which “no new insights, codes or categories are produced even when new data are added, and when all of the data are accounted for in the core categories and subcategories” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311424404">Cohen, Manion, &amp; Morrison, 2007</xref>, p. 494). Data analysis involved the use of constant comparative and latent content analytic techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311424404">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311424404">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1998</xref>) and proceeded in stages. We began with open coding, in which “concepts are identified and their properties and dimensions are discovered in the data” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311424404">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>, p. 101). This stage involved each author independently reviewing the transcripts to identify and categorize the sources of uncertainty in HPV. Once each author had completed the open coding process, we met to compare and compile the findings. In the second stage, each author returned to the transcripts to complete axial coding, which involved “relating categories to subcategories” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311424404">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>, p. 124). After independently reviewing the transcripts, we met once more to discuss the findings and reach consensus on the categories and subcategories identified. During both open and axial coding, we continued to interview participants to test and refine our categorical system; interviews proceeded until they produced no new information or insight. We distributed a description of the categories and subcategories, along with illustrative quotations, to a small subset of participants, who assured us of our categorical system’s accuracy and completeness. These member checks with 5 participants gave us confidence in the validity of our findings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049732311424404">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Twenty-five women living with HPV completed interviews, which ranged from 14 to 72 minutes in duration. Thirteen (52%) participants identified as White, 7 (28%) as African American, 2 (8%) as Latina, 2 (8%) as Asian American, and 1 (4%) as biracial. The ages of participants ranged from 19 to 56 years (<italic>M</italic> = 28.84; <italic>SD</italic> = 8.56), and the majority of participants (68%) were single. Six (24%) participants were married, and 2 (8%) were divorced or separated at the time of the interview. Time since diagnosis ranged from 1 to 17 years, with a mean of 4.84 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.74).</p>

<sec id="section4-1049732311424404" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>For participants, living with HPV meant coping with uncertainty. Women described being uncertain about a range of issues related to their HPV status. Questions and concerns about the meaning of the diagnosis, the potential progression of the infection, finances, the source of the infection, disclosure, sex and reproduction, and the HPV vaccine were frequently voiced by participants. In the following sections we detail each of these sources of uncertainty. To protect participant confidentiality, names referenced in these sections are pseudonyms.</p>
<sec id="section5-1049732311424404">
<title>The Meaning of the Diagnosis</title>
<p>According to the theories of uncertainty in acute and chronic illness, uncertainty results from various antecedents, including the stimuli frame, cognitive capacity, and structure providers; however, “the major pathway to uncertainty is through the stimuli frame variables” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732311424404">Mishel &amp; Clayton, 2003</xref>, p. 32). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311424404">Mishel (1999)</xref> argued that insufficient information about one’s diagnosis and prognosis reduces the clarity and definition of stimuli frame variables, thereby contributing to one’s illness-related uncertainty. Comments from women with HPV supported Mishel’s contention that a lack of information contributes to uncertainty in illness. Although some women knew about HPV prior to their diagnosis, most described a lack of familiarity with and knowledge of the virus. This lack of knowledge contributed to the women’s confusion and uncertainty about the meaning of the diagnosis. Eileen related her questions about her diagnosis:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I had gone in for my yearly Pap [Papanicolaou] smear, and I noticed that they hadn’t sent me anything in the mail. So I called them and they said it came back HPV, and I was like, “Well what’s that?” I thought it was like herpes; I was freaking out. I called my boyfriend and was cussing him out, and then he was freaking out. And then he’s like, “What did the doctor say?” I told him she said that it was HPV, and he was like, “That’s not herpes.” I was like, “Yes it is!” We had to sit down and look it up on the Internet and, of course, it’s not.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mia expressed similar confusion about the meaning of her test results:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The doctor was very blunt, like, “Yeah, you have HPV,” and did not explain anything of what that was to me or what it meant. What it was gonna be like later on. Was I going to be able to have kids or not? And, these are questions you don’t know, and maybe the STD [sexually transmitted disease] that I’ve heard most about is AIDS [acquired immune deficiency syndrome]. It’s so foreign. So, you start to make that association that everything’s like that, because that’s what you know. It was really horrible.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Unfamiliar with HPV, both Eileen and Mia assumed it was like other sexually transmitted infections, such as herpes and HIV, and these associations and assumptions bred confusion and uncertainty. Olivia also described having little knowledge about HPV prior to her diagnosis:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I didn’t even know what HPV was. I didn’t know if I was going to have cervical cancer. Was I going to have this forevermore? I didn’t know where it came from, what it was, or anything like that. . . . I definitely felt like I didn’t know how long it was going to last, what the treatment was, what types of symptoms I was going to have. I didn’t know what to expect.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Olivia indicated that her ability to form expectations regarding HPV (i.e., part of event familiarity in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311424404">Mishel’s theory; 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311424404">1990</xref>) was compromised by insufficient knowledge and information about the virus. Jean echoed Olivia’s comments, stating, “It’s hard to know what to expect when you have no idea what you’re dealing with.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732311424404">
<title>The Potential Progression of the Infection</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732311424404">Mishel and Clayton (2003)</xref> identified “the erratic nature of symptom onset and disease progression” as “the major antecedent to uncertainty in chronic illness” (p. 35). Women with HPV also characterized the potential progression of the infection as a major concern. Not knowing if the virus would lead to genital warts or cervical cancer caused stress and anxiety for these women. As Meredith explained, “It’s just the ‘Oh my God, I might have cancer and there’s no definitive yes or no.’ The not knowing—that’s what’s caused me the most stress.” Taylor also worried about developing cervical cancer. She commented, “It’s always a risk, and you don’t know if that’s going to happen to you or not. When you’re in the position where it could happen to you, you worry a lot.”</p>
<p>Women diagnosed with high-risk forms of HPV seemed particularly concerned about the potential progression of the infection. For example, Amy, who had been diagnosed with HPV types 16 and 18, described being “extremely stressed.” When asked about the source of her stress, she explained,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is because number 16 and 18 are the worst parts of the HPV virus. First, they were having me come in every three months. Now, it’s every six months to get checked. And not knowing—okay how long does it take to form a cancer cell? When is it going to pop up? When am I going to hear those words, “You’ve got cancer?” And the other ones are more warts than anything else, but this is a lot harder to live with, ’cause I don’t want to hear those dreaded words.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Kelly voiced similar fears:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was getting abnormal Pap smears every six months, and they would do colposcopies. It was very stressful to think that I am in my twenties and I could very well be getting a phone call saying, “You have cervical cancer.” That was unbelievably scary, and there’s no way to really deal with that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For women infected with high-risk forms of HPV, uncertainty about the course of the infection caused considerable stress.</p>
<p>In addition to wondering if and when HPV would progress to cervical cancer, participants questioned why some women with HPV developed warts and/or cancer whereas others experienced few or no symptoms. For example, Eileen tried to understand why she and her friends had such different experiences with HPV:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know what it is. Maybe it’s their health. They drink; they smoke more. I take vitamins; I try to eat organic. I’m not that stress free, but they have kids, where I don’t. That’s the only explanation I can think of for why they’ve had a reaction and I’ve never had a reaction.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite receiving the same diagnosis, Eileen and her friends experienced different symptom patterns. This incongruence between Eileen’s and her friends’ experiences contributed to Eileen’s uncertainty about the course of her infection. Jean described a similar experience:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When I got it, I thought, “Well, at least there’s Christine. She’s got it, too.” I tried to talk to her about it, the HPV, but she’s got it so much worse—the cancer. And, seeing her with cancer makes me wonder: Is this what’s gonna happen?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Jean identified her friend, Christine, as a potential source of peer support; however, Christine’s experience with HPV and cervical cancer created uncertainty and anxiety for Jean, who wondered if she, too, would develop cervical cancer. Traci also mentioned processes of social comparison:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The doctors say they don’t think it’s anything to worry about. That’s what they always said, or that it looked good, and I’m like, well, if it looks good, why’s it not coming up clean on the Pap smear? That’s what I think. ’Cause, you know, people my age die from cancer every day. Why am I the one not dying from cancer?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Like Eileen and Jean, Traci tried to make sense of her experience by comparing it to the experiences of others living with HPV. Variable symptom patterns and disease trajectories complicated this social comparison process and contributed to the women’s uncertainty and anxiety about the potential progression of the infection.</p>
<p>Waiting for test results also exacerbated cancer-related fears and uncertainty. For many participants, living with HPV meant enduring procedures such as Pap smears, colposcopies, and biopsies, and waiting for the results. For Megan, a cervical cancer survivor, this waiting period proved to be particularly stressful:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I can usually put it out of my mind, but every time I go into the GYN [gynecologist] my heart races and it’s just horrible. So every four months I’m stressed out. Then, I’ve got to wait for the results. That’s like ten days, and it is horrible. That is the worst ten days of my life.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Kelly also lamented the wait:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We’d do a colposcopy every year, which is very scary, but nothing ever happened. The colposcopies would come back normal, but that in-between feeling of getting the abnormal Pap and wondering what was abnormal about it. . . . That time in between is scary, very scary, because you do hear about people in their twenties getting diagnosed with cancer.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Megan and Kelly, frequent procedures and the lengthy wait for test results heightened the stress and uncertainty of HPV.</p>

<sec id="section7-1049732311424404">
<title>Finances</title>
<p>Participants reported financial concerns similar to those described by individuals living with HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311424404">Brashers et al., 2003</xref>) and people waiting for and living with a donated organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311424404">Martin et al., 2010</xref>). These financial woes added to the stress and uncertainty experienced by women with HPV. Without insurance, some wondered how they would afford cancer treatment, if needed. Jean stated,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t have insurance, so I don’t get my Pap smears. I know I should, but I don’t even want to know, you know? ’Cause I can’t afford it if I got cancer. I can’t do anything about it. Why bother?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Eileen related the story of a friend with a similar experience:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>She has no insurance, and basically she went to the clinic, got the prescription for the ointment, but hasn’t gotten a Pap smear or been back since. . . . She’s like, “If I do have it, I can’t afford the treatment. So, why bother?” That’s basically what she sums it up to. I’m like, “Okay, you’ve got an eight year old and a three year old. Who’s going to take care of them?”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similar to Jean, Eileen’s friend seemed to view Pap smears as futile diagnostic exercises. Unable to afford treatment if diagnosed with cancer, Eileen’s friend abdicated appointments with gynecologists. Traci worried that going without insurance and Pap smears for a year compromised her health:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Going that year without insurance—I think to myself, “Could that have really made it worse that I didn’t go for like a whole year?” But, I mean, I just couldn’t afford it. . . . So, that’s probably the most stressful part—not knowing if I’ll have insurance, or have to come up with money from who knows where.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Traci described uncertainty about her financial future as a significant source of her stress. For women with HPV, financial concerns, usually involving insurance issues, contributed to the stress and uncertainty of life with a chronic illness.</p>

<title>The Source of the Infection</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732311424404">Mishel and Clayton (2003)</xref>, illnesses of unknown or unclear etiology undermine event familiarity, thereby creating uncertainty. For participants, not knowing the source of the infection contributed to HPV-related uncertainty. Although some women knew how they contracted the virus, most were uncertain about who infected them. Olivia explained,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There’s no way to find out. So, I have no idea if it was him or if it wasn’t him or if it was the person before. That actually did lead to us breaking up. Because I thought that he was a slut, but I don’t know.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Not knowing who infected her, Olivia assumed that her current boyfriend was to blame and ended the relationship. Questions about the source of the infection also confounded Rachel:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The stressful part is I honestly don’t know where it came from. That’s one thing that would really put me at ease a little bit, if I knew how I got it. That would really put some questions to rest.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Rachel, not knowing who infected her or how it happened caused stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>Uncertainty about the source of the infection also complicated disclosures to past partners. As Meredith explained,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s hard to know when I got infected, so, it’d be kind of awkward to go back to my boyfriends from high school and be like, “Hey! I’ve got HPV now; maybe you have it.” You know, seven years later. But, you know, it’s kind of hard to go back and tell, because you don’t know where it happened.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Jean voiced a similar concern:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s not like I had tons of partners, but it really could’ve been any of them. I don’t know when, I don’t know where, I don’t know who. I don’t know who I’m supposed to tell, ’cause none of them ever told me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For women living with HPV, uncertainty about the source of the infection created confusion and anxiety and complicated disclosures to past partners.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732311424404">
<title>Disclosure</title>
<p>In a study of the sources of uncertainty in HIV, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311424404">Brashers et al. (2003)</xref> found that individuals living with the virus experienced disclosure difficulties and uncertainties. Disclosure also was chief among the concerns of women with HPV. Participants felt obligated to inform their current and prospective sexual partners, but uncertain about how to approach the subject and how people might respond. As Mia explained,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I worry about how I’m going to be perceived by society. This is why it’s still really hard for me to talk to other people who I’m not as close to. I have a lot of close friends that don’t know that I have it. . . . I have to be more open, but I have to be secretive about it. I can’t just go up to anyone and tell them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mia experienced a tension between her fear of social rejection and her desire to disclose. Jean expressed similar fears:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>People think if you’ve got HPV, then you must be a slut. But, you only, my doctor said you can be a virgin and get HPV. But, people don’t know that, and I don’t go telling people because of that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similar to Mia, Jean wondered what others would think of her if she disclosed her test results.</p>
<p>Participants also wondered about disclosure strategies. For example, Mary expressed her uncertainty regarding the timing of HPV disclosures:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s always in the back of your head. You know, “Is he going to ask me back to his place? If he does, should I tell him?” It was just, “When do I tell him?” Because I don’t want it to be like I was trying to deceive him or something, and I didn’t want to say it too late or early. So, it was very much like, “What’s the best timing?” . . . It was a lot of planning and stressing out and asking my friends, “Do you think I need to tell him?”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Alicia described disclosure much in the same way: “The thought of having it, deciding when to do it and how and what to say—it was extremely stressful.” Status disclosures served as a source of stress and uncertainty for women living with HPV.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049732311424404">
<title>Sex and Reproduction</title>
<p>Insufficient information about the implications of infection for sex and reproduction also undermined the ability of women with HPV to achieve event familiarity, part of the stimuli frame. Uncertainty regarding how the virus might impact sexual partners created stress and relational dilemmas for participants. Eva described her dilemma:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Another stress that I’ve been stressing about more recently is that my husband was diagnosed with an immunodeficiency, and it’s basically a disease where your cells don’t know to create antibodies to fight off infections. So, he’s mostly susceptible to bacteria more so than viruses, but he is more susceptible to things like cancer. So, that stresses me out because I don’t want to cause any medical issues for him on top of this disease he already has. So, like, for having oral sex, for instance, it’s something that I enjoy, but I’m like, “Honey, I don’t want you to do that because I don’t want you to get throat cancer.” And, there’s really no research, because it’s only like 1 in 50,000 people [who] have this thing. So, nobody has a study out there on the effects of herpes or HPV. . . . So, that’s been stressful for me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Traci also wondered about the risks posed by oral sex:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think it can lead to, if you have oral sex, to mouth cancer, too. I thought I read that somewhere or heard that from somebody. So I’m like, God, now I can’t even have oral sex! I don’t have oral sex either way, giving or receiving, because of that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Unclear consequences of infection for sexual partners contributed to the stress and uncertainty reported by participants.</p>
<p>Women also described concerns about the implications of infection for reproduction. For example, Eileen worried about transmitting the virus during childbirth:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Will I pass it on to my kid [child] if I have a natural childbirth? That’s why I’d want to go ahead and just have a c-section to cut down any risks. I wouldn’t want to pass it on because, if I could catch it, I could give it to my daughter.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Eileen wondered if HPV and natural childbirth posed risks to her future children. Other women feared that they would not be able to have children as a result of HPV infection and treatment. Meredith expressed her concerns:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was concerned with things like fertility and, you know, what that would mean for the rest of my—because, you know, I’m only twenty-two, well, at the time I was twenty-one—so I was nervous that I’d never be able to have children.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Taylor worried that HPV treatments might compromise her ability to carry a child to term:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Some of the treatments can have a negative effect when you’re trying to get pregnant and have children, and it can weaken the lining of the cervix and all this stuff if they go in and remove all the abnormal parts. So, I’m like, I don’t want to have to do that. And, what if it’s really bad and then I have to have these parts removed, and then later on when I want to have kids then I have problems? So, all of those things kind of run through your head.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Both Meredith and Taylor expressed uncertainty about the impact of HPV infection and treatment on fertility. For participants, questions about sex and reproduction contributed to the uncertainty and stress associated with HPV.</p>

<title>The HPV Vaccine</title>
<p>In her reformulated theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311424404">Mishel (1990)</xref> described medical aspects of illness, such as complex medication regimens, as potential sources of uncertainty. Although women with HPV did not take medications to manage the infection, they did wonder about the safety and efficacy of the HPV vaccine. These questions about the vaccine served as another source of uncertainty for participants. Jean said,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know about that Gardisil vaccine. I think it could help me, but I’m not sure. I mean, I’ve already got HPV, so I wonder. Maybe if I get the vaccine I won’t get infected again? I don’t have insurance, so I can’t ask my doctors these things.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although already infected with the virus, Jean wondered if the vaccine would help guard against other infections. Megan also questioned the efficacy of the vaccine:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I got that shot. That “one less shot,” but it came out too late for me. I don’t know what the studies are on that, but I got it. I think it was too late for me, but I’m hoping it will help.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to questioning the vaccine’s efficacy, women with HPV wondered about its safety. Krista explained,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know if it’s a good idea. I mean, a vaccine is, well, I think it’s like they inject you with the virus and that way you are immune. But, why, I don’t know if I should be putting more of that in my body, you know?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Jean, Megan, and Krista, the Gardisil vaccine represented another source of uncertainty in HPV.</p>

<sec id="section12-1049732311424404" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To participants, living with HPV meant coping with uncertainty. Women with HPV attributed this uncertainty to various aspects of the illness experience. For example, questions and concerns about the meaning of the diagnosis, sex and reproduction, the potential for disease progression, finances, the source of the infection, disclosure, and the Gardisil vaccine contributed to women’s uncertainty and anxiety. The development of effective stress and uncertainty-management interventions for this population will require additional attention to these sources of uncertainty. Each of these sources of uncertainty in HPV and their implications for research and practice are discussed in turn.</p>
<p>Although some participants had previous knowledge of HPV, most lacked information about the virus and its effects. As a result, some women confused HPV with herpes, and others assumed HPV was similar to HIV, a far more familiar sexually transmitted infection. In addition, lack of knowledge about HPV and its effects contributed to women’s concerns about sex and reproduction. For example, women wondered if they could transmit the virus during childbirth or oral sex, and questioned if they could conceive or carry a child to term. These findings complement and extend previous research on HPV knowledge and information. Researchers in several large-scale studies have documented limited knowledge of HPV within the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732311424404">Friedman &amp; Shepeard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732311424404">Yacobi, Tennant, Ferrante, Pal, &amp; Roetzheim, 1999</xref>); however, few researchers have explored the phenomenon in or its consequences for women with HPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732311424404">Koshiol, Finney Rutten, Moser, &amp; Hesse, 2009</xref>). Although the findings from this study indicate that a lack of knowledge about HPV contributes to confusion about the diagnosis, as well as transmission and fertility fears, additional research is needed to determine the causes and consequences of a lack of knowledge and information about HPV in this population.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of research on the causes and consequences of this lack of knowledge and information about HPV, critical health communication research offers a compelling explanation for these findings. Scholars have documented a protectionist discourse surrounding HPV “in which the link between sexual behavior and cervical cancer is suppressed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732311424404">Waller et al., 2004</xref>, p. 75). In addition, newspaper and television reports on HPV contain factual errors and little information about transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311424404">Anhang, Stryker, Wright, &amp; Goldie, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732311424404">Calloway, Jorgensen, Saraiya, &amp; Tsui, 2006</xref>). Press coverage of the HPV vaccine is also laden with inaccuracies, and tends to downplay the link to sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311424404">Kelly, Leader, Mittermaier, Hornik, &amp; Cappella, 2009</xref>). Given the skewed and inaccurate media representations of HPV and the HPV vaccine, it is not surprising that women with HPV lack knowledge and information about the virus and its transmission. Primary and secondary HPV prevention efforts must contend with (and in some cases, combat) this discourse and its potential impact on women infected with or at risk for HPV.</p>
<p>In addition to questioning the meaning of the diagnosis and its impact on sex and reproduction, women with HPV worried about the potential progression of the infection. Echoing findings from previous research on the psychosocial impact of HPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311424404">Linnehan &amp; Groce, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311424404">McCaffery, Waller, Nazroo, &amp; Wardle, 2006</xref>), women in this study voiced concerns about developing genital warts or cervical cancer as a result of HPV infection. These fears seemed most acute for those with high-risk types of the virus and those waiting for test results. In addition, those who knew others who were negatively impacted by the virus appeared to experience a heightened sense of anxiety and uncertainty. Although social comparison processes are not discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311424404">Mishel’s (1990)</xref> theory of uncertainty in chronic illness, previous research in this theoretical tradition points to the importance of social comparison in uncertainty management. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311424404">Brashers, Neidig, and Goldsmith (2004)</xref> found that for individuals with HIV, others with the virus served as a source of support and uncertainty. Seeing others who were sick or dying from HIV/AIDS created stress and anxiety for those whose infection was less advanced. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732311424404">Adelman and Frey (1997)</xref>, in an ethnographic study of a residential facility for individuals living with HIV/AIDS, observed a similar social comparison process. For the healthy, sick and dying individuals served as a mirror, reflecting the suffering yet to come. Women with HPV described affected others in a similar fashion, and these social comparison processes seemed to exacerbate cancer-related fears and uncertainty.</p>
<p>Financial concerns also added to the stress and uncertainty experienced by women with HPV. Some women worried about finding and maintaining health insurance to cover medical expenses; others abdicated health care because it was cost prohibitive. These effects of financial insecurity and uncertainty on patient adherence are of particular note. Women who lacked health insurance reasoned that they could not afford cancer treatment if it became necessary and, as a result, they stopped getting Pap smears and follow-up care. Given that watchful waiting is key to cervical cancer prevention in women living with HPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732311424404">Waller et al., 2004</xref>), these effects of uncertainty on health care utilization and treatment adherence warrant further consideration. Future research on uncertainty in illness should attend to the possible impact of financial concerns and the potential effects of uncertainty on patient adherence and health care utilization.</p>
<p>Participants also expressed uncertainty about the source of the infection and disclosure to past, current, and prospective partners. Although some women were able to determine the source of the infection, others questioned how (and by whom) they were infected. This uncertainty about the source of the infection complicated women’s efforts to disclose to past partners. Although physicians recommend and some states mandate partner notification for those diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311424404">Galletly &amp; Pinkerton, 2006</xref>), uncertainty about the source of the infection made it difficult for women with HPV to follow these recommendations and mandates. Disclosure to current and prospective partners was equally difficult. Women expressed uncertainty about partners’ reactions to the disclosure, as well as confusion about the disclosure process. For example, some wondered about the appropriate timing of HPV disclosures. This disclosure-related uncertainty might account for low HPV disclosure rates documented in the literature. In a study of HPV disclosure rates and intentions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732311424404">Keller, von Sadovszky, Pankratz, and Hermsen (2000)</xref> reported, “Only 23% of respondents indicated a belief that they needed to disclose HPV to all future partners” (p. 294). Future research efforts should attend to the potential role of uncertainty in HPV disclosure decision making.</p>
<p>For women with HPV, the Gardisil vaccine, which guards against certain strains of the virus, was a source of confusion and uncertainty. Some women wondered if the vaccine was advisable for someone already exposed to the virus; others questioned its efficacy. These findings complement and extend work on public perceptions of the HPV vaccine. Despite research suggesting widespread acceptance of the HPV vaccine, some studies point to potential barriers to vaccination, including skepticism about its effectiveness and side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311424404">Scarinci, Garcés-Palacio, &amp; Partridge, 2007</xref>). Women in this study expressed similar concerns. Interventions aimed at increasing vaccination rates and/or reducing barriers to vaccine acceptance should attend to women’s uncertainty about the safety and efficacy of Gardisil. Interventions for women with HPV hinge on expanded research efforts that acknowledge women’s uncertainty about the HPV vaccine, disclosure, the source of the infection, finances, the potential progression of the infection, sex and reproduction, and the meaning of the diagnosis.</p>
<p>The practical and theoretical implications of these findings are many and varied. First, study findings underscore the importance of patient education and counseling. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311424404">Mishel’s (1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311424404">1990</xref>) theories of uncertainty in illness, health care professionals can serve as structure providers, helping the sick individual make sense of the illness and manage uncertainty. As such, health professionals are uniquely positioned to assist with the uncertainty-management efforts of women with HPV. This study indicates that health professionals might aid in these efforts in various ways. For example, providing information about the disease and its implications for sex and reproduction might mitigate questions and concerns like those voiced by the women in this study. Addressing issues such as the potential for disease progression and the safety and efficacy of the HPV vaccine also might allay some of the anxiety that accompanies HPV infection and diagnosis. Finally, informing women about services available at no or reduced cost might alleviate some of the financial burden of HPV. By attending to these common sources of confusion and concern in initial and follow-up appointments, health care professionals can facilitate the coping and uncertainty-management efforts of women with HPV.</p>
<p>In addition to the edification of health care providers, study findings could be used in the development and testing of interventions for women with HPV. For example, discussion of HPV-related uncertainty and its sources could be integrated into intervention activities. This information also could be incorporated into print materials given to intervention participants. Moreover, study findings could be used in an uncertainty-management intervention for women with HPV. Although few if any such interventions exist for women with HPV, uncertainty-management interventions have been developed and implemented in other illness contexts. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732311424404">Brashers, Rintamaki, Peterson, Goldsmith, and Neidig (2008)</xref> demonstrated the effectiveness of an uncertainty-management intervention for individuals with HIV, and Mishel and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311424404">Bailey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732311424404">Braden, Mishel, &amp; Longman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732311424404">Mishel et al., 2005</xref>) developed several successful interventions based on the theory of uncertainty in chronic illness. An uncertainty-management intervention modeled after these successful interventions also could be effective for women with HPV. Additional research on uncertainty in HPV is needed to inform these intervention efforts.</p>
<p>Finally, this study builds on existing research and theory in various ways. For example, study findings support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311424404">Martin et al.’s (2010)</xref> argument concerning the contextual basis of uncertainty. Similar to people living with HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311424404">Brashers et al., 2003</xref>), women with HPV experienced uncertainty as a result of disclosure difficulties, insufficient information about the virus and its transmission, and concerns about the progression of the infection. Although significant overlap exists between the sources of uncertainty in HPV and HIV, this study suggests that women with HPV experience some unique forms of uncertainty. For instance, the fertility fears and questions about the HPV vaccine reported by participants represent sources of uncertainty unique to women with HPV. Further research is needed to determine if additional antecedents to uncertainty are experienced by and unique to women with HPV. In addition to its implications for research on uncertainty, this study suggests possible revisions and extensions to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311424404">Mishel’s (1990)</xref> theory of uncertainty in chronic illness, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311424404">Brashers and colleagues’ (2003)</xref> typology of the sources of uncertainty in illness. Participants described social comparison processes and financial woes as part and parcel of their experience of uncertainty in HPV; however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311424404">Mishel’s (1990)</xref> theory does not account for these factors. In the future, researchers should consider additional antecedents to uncertainty than the ones specified in Mishel’s theory. Although the typology developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311424404">Brashers and colleagues (2003)</xref> adequately captured the sources of uncertainty in HPV, definitional issues made application of the typology difficult. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311424404">Brashers et al. (2003)</xref> used the typology to describe the “causes” of uncertainty in HIV, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311424404">Martin et al. (2010)</xref> focused on the medical, personal, and social “forms” of uncertainty across the organ transplantation trajectory. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311424404">Stone and Jones (2009)</xref> employed the typology to describe “sources” of uncertainty related to a parent’s Alzheimer’s diagnosis. Further examination of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311424404">Brashers and colleagues’ typology (2003)</xref> is necessary to determine if it captures forms, causes, or sources of uncertainty in illness.</p>
<p>Several study limitations should be acknowledged. First, difficulties recruiting women with HPV necessitated snowball and convenience sampling; however, the sample represents a diverse group of women of different ages and ethnicities. Men were not recruited for this study, and represent an understudied group in the literature on HPV. Although the lack of appropriate and effective testing procedures for men complicate research efforts with this population, future research must attend to the psychosocial impact of HPV infection and diagnosis on men. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732311424404">Waller et al. (2004)</xref> argued, “It is perhaps time to reframe cervical cancer as a problem that should concern women’s sexual partners, or the wider community, and not just women themselves” (pp. 74-75). Finally, qualitative methods, though recommended for use with uncertainty in chronic illness theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311424404">Mishel, 1999</xref>), cannot speak to the prevalence of uncertainty in this population, or possible mediating or moderating variables. Additional quantitative research is needed to test and validate the findings from this study, and to determine their implications for theory and practice.</p>
<p>In summary, women with HPV attributed their uncertainty to seven sources: the meaning of the diagnosis, the potential progression of the infection, finances, the source of the infection, disclosure, sex and reproduction, and the HPV vaccine. These aspects of living with and managing HPV infection contributed to the stress and anxiety experienced by women with HPV, and thus should be the focus of secondary prevention efforts. Additional research is necessary, however, to inform interventions designed to reduce the stress of HPV infection and diagnosis, and thus the likelihood that the infection will persist and progress to cervical cancer.</p>
