<abstract>
<p>In England, there have been 40 years of area-based initiatives (ABIs) involving strategic national government intervention in local authority areas with significant regeneration needs. Whilst they have been examined individually, less consideration has been given to the layering and legacy of ABIs. Uncertainties include whether local authorities have institutionalised new ways of operating or whether layering complexities have acted as significant barriers. Focusing on Wolverhampton, in the West Midlands, this paper examines recent ABI experiences and discusses why support for City Challenge (1992–98) appeared stronger than the more recent New Deal for Communities programme (2001–11). Important ABI legacies include greater diversity of neighbourhood structures, anxiety towards ABIs where property markets are depressed and the realisation that, whilst partnership working has intensified, traditional exclusionary aspects remain. Achieving the most effective governance structures to facilitate urban regeneration remains an on-going challenge, including within emerging Coalition government policy frameworks.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In England, area-based initiatives (ABIs) represent strategic national government policy interventions in locations requiring regeneration. In conjunction with their designation, time-limited funding is allocated on top of mainstream public-sector expenditure. ABIs can fall within local authority areas (LGAs), coincide with local council boundaries or cross local authority jurisdictions. They have predominantly been designated within deindustrialising urban areas and have formed a key pillar of urban policy over the past 40 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098011415432">Lawless, 2006</xref>). During this period, ABIs have attracted strong criticism, not least for their limited success in transforming national patterns of deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098011415432">Imrie and Raco, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0042098011415432">Robson, 1999</xref>). Explanations have included that the scale of ABI funding is too small to offset the structural inequalities created by uneven patterns of economic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011415432">Chatterton and Bradley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011415432">Edwards, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0042098011415432">Oatley, 2000</xref>). From this perspective, ABIs could be considered a policy measure to ‘moderate’ rather than drastically transform the worst instances of deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011415432">Batty <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>, p.10). The prevailing criticism of ABIs, however, risks prematurely downplaying variation in their spatial and temporal achievements. Furthermore, the broad-brush treatment of ABIs can overlook alternative insights, including important institutional and governance perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098011415432">Cochrane, 1999</xref>). With the onset of the international economic crisis and a period of national financial austerity, it is a timely point to evaluate the impact of past ABIs.</p>
<p>In undertaking such a review, it is necessary to examine the relationship between the design of ABIs nationally and their implementation locally. Nationally, ABIs have evolved from Urban Development Corporations (UDCs, 1981–98, 2003-), to City Challenge partnerships (CCs, 1992–98), to the Single Regeneration Budget (SRB, 1994–2007), to the most recent, New Deal for Communities programme (NDC, 1998–2011). Other ABIs have occurred during this policy sequence, including action zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042098011415432">Painter and Clarence, 2001</xref>), although they have been smaller in scale and fall outside the breadth of this paper. Within this timeline, ABIs have varied in funding, length, area size, eligibility and desired governance arrangement. The conceptual underpinnings of individual ABIs have been critically investigated, with authors questioning whether partnership working or community-led regeneration represents the panacea that government policy suggests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098011415432">Dinham, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011415432">Edwards, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0042098011415432">Wallace, 2007</xref>). At a local scale, ABI programmes have been examined individually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011415432">Davoudi, 1995</xref>) and as part of broader comparative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011415432">Batty <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011415432">Coaffee and Deas, 2008</xref>). Research methods have included questionnaires to interpret whether households have been involved in and benefited from ABIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098011415432">Lawless, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0042098011415432">Rhodes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) and interviews with stakeholders inside and outside partnerships to determine who was involved and why, reasons for outcomes and future improvements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011415432">Davoudi, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0042098011415432">Wallace, 2007</xref>). There is also evidence of reviews feeding back into national ABI design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098011415432">DETR, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098011415432">DTLR, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042098011415432">JRF, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0042098011415432">Rhodes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Evidence of policy learning must, however, be examined within a wider context of significant transformation in ABI policy formulation. Reasons include changes in national political party and/or ministerial control and national reinterpretation of the scale and nature of urban problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098011415432">Atkinson and Moon, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098011415432">Florio and Edwards, 2001</xref>). Commentators have thus highlighted how national ABIs have gone ‘full circle’ in terms of whether an economic or social focus dominated, whether local authorities were integrally involved and whether ABI funding was fragmented or unified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0042098011415432">Robson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0042098011415432">Wilks-Heeg, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In recognition that the national narrative on ABIs is infused with evidence of institutional learning, as well as changing priorities, there remains significant uncertainty about the implementation and effectiveness of ABIs within specific LGAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011415432">Coaffee, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098011415432">Coulson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098011415432">Florio and Edwards, 2001</xref>). In 2003, the House of Commons Select Committee on the ‘Effectiveness of Government Regeneration Initiatives’ concluded that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We recommend that some places be selected for evaluation of outcomes taken over the 30 and more years of proactive urban policy, with a view to determining more closely the appropriateness of different categories of scheme for different types of place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042098011415432">House of Commons, 2003</xref>, paragraph 23).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Through longitudinal research, the local interpretation and actual implementation of specific ABIs can be examined and ABIs can be compared and contrasted in terms of their relative impact and/or effectiveness. National narratives about the evolution of ABIs can also be differentiated from local experiences, in ways that avoid assuming that the most recent initiative must be the most effective. Longitudinal research can further help in identifying broader legacies associated with a succession of ABIs. Potential examples include local authorities institutionalising different ways of operating, such as new forms of community engagement and/or partnership working, where ABIs have spurred new creative approaches. Where identifiable patterns are absent and urban governance appears disjointed and disconnected, then understanding why is equally important in terms of future policy developments. Conclusions must be drawn carefully for reasons including the influence of key individuals, the prevailing economic context facing specific ABIs and the impact of parallel policy initiatives.</p>
<p>The section that follows acknowledges that, whilst ABIs provide additional funding on top of main stream allocations, the extent to which new styles of governance have emerged remains uncertain because of the potential for resistance to change and because of the complex way in which different ABI formulations have been layered over time. The second half of the paper focuses on the City of Wolverhampton within the West Midlands urban conurbation. Wolverhampton represents a ‘shrinking city’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0042098011415432">Mace <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) which has experienced ABIs through the Black Country UDC, Wolverhampton CC, SRB funding and a NDC programme. After briefly introducing these programmes and their achievements, attention focuses on local experiences of and attitudes towards their layering and legacy. The research identifies stronger support for CC as compared with NDC for reasons including the level of local authority involvement. Limitations with CC are identified including the extent to which CC addressed area deprivation and the ease with which lessons learnt were transferred. Reflecting more broadly across the time-period under evaluation, the results highlight growing tension in terms of neighbourhood management and frustration towards the ability of ABIs to address strategic city-wide priorities. Somewhat contradictorily, the Wolverhampton case reveals how local authorities remain integral to the effective delivery of ABIs, yet potentially also slow to embrace alternative forms of urban governance. The paper therefore builds on research acknowledging anxiety towards the layering of urban policy where there is limited change in levels of local authority openness and inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011415432">Coaffee, 2004</xref>). Conclusions are drawn with reference to emerging policy frameworks from the Coalition government (2010– ).</p>

<title>Conceptualising the Legacy and Layering of ABIs</title>
<p>The period stemming from the mid 1960s is associated with the rise of urban policy in England. As the extent of deindustrialisation and inner-city problems intensified during the 1970s, so did the need for more interventionist forms of urban policy. Various ABIs have been introduced in the period since to target areas of deprivation. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011415432">Table 1</xref> introduces four key ABIs: UDCs, CC, SRB and NDC. What is particularly notable is that ABIs have changed significantly in response to national priorities, but also the lessons learnt from past initiatives. Thus, as they have evolved, changes have been made to strengthen area outcomes including support for holistic forms of regeneration, lead-in times, exit strategies and community empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098011415432">DETR, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098011415432">DTLR, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042098011415432">JRF, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0042098011415432">Rhodes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Despite policy reformulations and adjustments, area-based regeneration initiatives have had limited success in fundamentally altering the spatial pattern of urban deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098011415432">Imrie and Raco, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0042098011415432">Robson, 1999</xref>). Recent government policy has therefore given greater support to building a stronger sustainable community ‘legacy’ where area change is occurring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098011415432">DCLG, 2009</xref>). Rather than a forward-looking objective, ‘legacy’ is more commonly used to highlight how society has inherited a negative legacy, such as a legacy of overspending or industrial urbanisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098011415432">DCLG, 2008</xref>). It remains premature to conclude that a key legacy of past ABIs is scepticism about their future achievement, without carefully considering the broad range of potential legacies. In terms of area-based regeneration, attention often focuses on the built environment as physical projects represent the most tangible reminder of past interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0042098011415432">Searle, 2002</xref>). In contrast, less consideration has been given to other legacies, such as stronger community organisations, continuing community programmes or new forms of urban governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0042098011415432">Smith and Fox, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0042098011415432">Taussik and Smalley (1998)</xref> provide support indicating the need to look beyond the transformational impact of ABIs to broader and subtler forms of success, including a stronger sense of commitment, co-operation and partnership. In addition to new styles of collaboration between local authorities and outside interests, the potential exists for changing relations between local authorities and local residents. The latter might include a reinvigoration or a strengthening of democratic forms of accountability. Negative legacies remain possible including strengthened criticism about the effectiveness of urban policy, or growing frustration by local interests towards how ABI funding is utilised.</p>

<p>Compared with mainstream public-sector expenditure, ABIs are amenable to study because of their area focus, dedicated funding stream and inclusion of contemporary government ideas about societal responsibilities and the relationship between different actors and institutions. One aspect that remains uncertain is how local authorities interpret the role of ABIs. They could, for instance, be viewed as the product of a national government meddling in local affairs, including prevailing governance structures. Examples exist of local authorities resisting ABI designations, or of community groups applying for funding because of local authority reluctance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098011415432">Harding <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098011415432">Henderson <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). These cases aside, commentary often presents a somewhat ‘pragmatic’ response by local authorities in terms of accessing available funding, for reasons including dependency on national redistribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098011415432">Cole and John, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0042098011415432">Quilley, 2002</xref>). What remains less well established is how a local authority that successfully obtains ABI funding then engages. Is it simply another funding stream secured, which might be very small in a well-populated local authority, or does ABI funding create the opportunity to approach challenging deprivation issues in new and innovative ways? If experimental governance approaches are required by funding structures and/or adopted by local authorities, then further questions remain about how experiences and lessons flow into future decision-making structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098011415432">Healey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Alternatively, to what extent have ABIs contributed to broader academic conceptualisations about the contemporary transition from government to governance-style decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098011415432">Goodwin and Painter, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042098011415432">Kearns and Paddison, 2000</xref>)?</p>
<p>Local–central government relations have been a long-term policy and academic focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0042098011415432">Wilson, 2003</xref>). Strong forms of municipal government during the 19th and early 20th centuries gave way to state paternalism in the post-World-War-I period, with sub-national government gradually becoming a stronger and more dependent delivery arm for national policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098011415432">Baston, 2000</xref>). Up until the 1990s, urban local authorities were the provider of a wide range of homogeneous services, with important decisions often reached behind closed doors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098011415432">Gyford, 1985</xref>). As the national economy declined during the 1970s and public funds decreased, local authorities were criticised for being too large, inward-looking, bureaucratic, centrally dependent and lacking the competence to respond. In urban areas, local authorities tended to be Labour party controlled and were labelled antagonistic towards enterprise at a time when economic activity needed to be stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011415432">Deakin and Edwards, 1993</xref>). UDCs, as one of the earliest ABIs, were thus imposed on selected LGAs to fast track a strategic national response. Exceptions of varying scales to this generalised picture existed, including councils who were identifying local assets that could play a role in reshaping their futures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098011415432">Henderson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098011415432">Harding <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042098011415432">Imrie and Raco, 1999</xref>). By the 1990s, national urban policy had rediscovered the importance of local government, especially in terms of the softer, social side of regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0042098011415432">Robson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>), and was also embracing the free market by turning ABI funding into a competitive bidding process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011415432">Davoudi, 1995</xref>). Local authorities were in turn prompted to create (CC and SRB) partnerships that brought together local interests into more co-ordinated approaches.</p>
<p>Whether a new era of creative collaboration resulted has been critically reviewed, with commentators pointing to short time-frames, central government managerialism and uncertain assessment criteria as contradictory dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0042098011415432">Whitehead, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0042098011415432">Wilks-Heeg, 1996</xref>). Reports have also pointed to strategically selected partnership arrangements and to declining involvement over time as bidding priorities evolved into council-orientated patterns of implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098011415432">Harding <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098011415432">Atkinson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011415432">Davoudi, 1995</xref>). Following sustained criticism that the most deprived communities were not benefiting from the competitive approach to ABIs and that resident engagement remained tokenistic, the newly elected Labour government (1997–2010) designed the NDC programme to target selected LGAs. With local communities to play a stronger role in decision-making, local councils were to be relatively less influential or dominating. NDC would also need to be integrated with and supported by a broader programme of local government modernisation. The Local Government Act 2000 placed a general onus on local authorities to meet the economic, environmental and social needs of their residents and to do so in a way that was more transparent and inclusive. Policy changes included the creation of local strategic partnerships (LSPs) to stimulate engagement with interests outside local authorities and stronger neighbourhood committees to help identify local needs and to encourage broader accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098011415432">Dabinett <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098011415432">DETR, 1998</xref>). The extent to which LSPs built on previous partnership approaches and encouraged a new era of more holistic and inclusive approaches to area-based regeneration remains underexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011415432">Coaffee, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098011415432">Lawless, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042098011415432">Kearns and Paddison (2000</xref>, p. 847) urban governance is “an attempt to manage and regulate difference and to be creative in urban areas which are themselves experiencing considerable change”. An outstanding question is therefore whether ABIs have provided additional funding streams around which local stakeholders could engage in new, more creative ways. Different perspectives can be drawn. One perspective suggests that, if different stakeholders acknowledge varying interpretations of future environments, then it can become a focus for interactive discussions, including action plans which pool individual resources to secure mutually acceptable outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098011415432">Evans and Jones, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098011415432">Healey, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098011415432">Healey (2004)</xref> further acknowledges that there often exists an artificial dualism between local government and creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098011415432">Healey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Looking beyond, strong traditions of central government control and dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098011415432">Carley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0042098011415432">Wilson, 2003</xref>) and underbounded and underpowered cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0042098011415432">While <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) research points to the potential for local government innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098011415432">Cole and John, 2001</xref>). From this perspective, there exists a significant breadth of local resources and opportunities that could be accessed if a council was willing to engage more outwardly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0042098011415432">Rhodes, 1981</xref>), including with the local business sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011415432">Bassett, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0042098011415432">Porter, 1995</xref>). Reshaping institutional approaches, however, takes time, especially where meaningful collaboration requires trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011415432">Coaffee, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0042098011415432">Stewart, 2003</xref>), and trust between separate interests requires shared experience. The time-limited nature of ABIs may render them ‘here today, gone tomorrow’ and therefore insignificant. In contrast, the way that ABIs have been layered over time may therefore enhance their influence.</p>
<p>In contrast, a second perspective highlights the importance of historical conservatism and institutional resistance, such as past conflicts and tensions between stakeholders, which are unlikely to be easily resolved within new partnership structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098011415432">Cowell and Martin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0042098011415432">Ward and Jonas, 2004</xref>). Recent research has thus directed attention to how and, in a relative sense, where decisions are reached. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042098011415432">Jones and Evans (2006)</xref> employ the concepts of proximity and distance to help interpret contemporary processes of urban change. They indicate that placing decision-making processes beyond or being ‘positioned’ further away from a local government, but still being able to access government powers can be critical in the effective delivery of urban regeneration. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098011415432">Cole and John (2001)</xref>, independent partnerships provide a forum for resolving conflicts and building trust; however, they must be at arms length from traditional political processes. Indeed, underpinning the transition from government to governance is a desire to shift the locus of decision-making power further away from local authorities. Achieving the appropriate degree of distance remains difficult in a policy sense, with past commentary describing how UDCs were positioned too far from local government, in the sense that council services needed to be better integrated if more holistic outcomes were to be achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011415432">Deakin and Edwards, 1993</xref>). Other insights relating to ABIs point to the illusion of partnership working, perhaps to secure grant funding, or the potential for partnerships to appear to be operating at arms length from a local authority, but to remain controlled from within (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011415432">Coaffee, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011415432">Davoudi, 1995</xref>). Reasons include the existence of deprivation outside designated areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0042098011415432">Raco, 2003</xref>) and pressure to re-allocate mainstream funding to spread rather than focus scarce resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011415432">Davoudi, 1995</xref>). For local councillors, relinquishing control to outside partnerships may be viewed as diminishing the strategic role they were democratically elected to undertake, plus also a threat to their and their political party’s re-election prospects. Council officers may equally resist shifting responsibilities outside a local authority where it is viewed as an attack on their own effectiveness, ideological position and potential career achievements. Reflecting on west Newcastle, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011415432">Coaffee (2004)</xref> thus points to increasing levels of community frustration because of the reluctance of the local authority to release control during a succession of ABIs.</p>
<p>A third perspective questions whether the way in which ABIs have been layered over time encourages or detracts from new creative urban governance approaches. For example, rather than representing discrete periods, followed by short spells of review prior to the next initiative, ABIs have tended to be overlapping in time. Nationally, SRB had entered its fifth round before an evaluation of CC was complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098011415432">DETR, 2000a</xref>). Additional complexity comes from growth in the number of overlapping ABIs, including multiple SRB programmes, the broadening of lead agency under SRB and the expansion in initiatives that occurred during the early years of the Labour government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098011415432">Carley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042098011415432">Painter and Clarence, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0042098011415432">Robson, 1999</xref>). Significant variation in policy formulations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011415432">Table 1</xref>), may also encourage variation in local authority involvement, not just because of national government preferences, but also where particular initiatives are deemed less strategically important. Reports have, however, indicated that, through a sequence of ABIs, local authority skills have been developed in project bidding (including exaggeration; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0042098011415432">Wilks-Heeg, 1996</xref>) and financial monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098011415432">Florio and Edwards, 2001</xref>). In this sense, we might consider ABI competitions, including failed ABI bids, as building local capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098011415432">Fordham <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042098011415432">Oatley and Lambert, 1998</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098011415432">DTLR (2002)</xref>, for example, highlighted that one of the legacies of CC and SRB was an enhanced capacity to compete for European programmes and Lottery funding. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0042098011415432">Taussik and Smalley (1998)</xref> suggest that CC encouraged both small-area and city-wide thinking, which assisted in targeting SRB towards strategic needs. What remains more uncertain is the extent to which governance lessons, rather than simply bidding lessons, have been transferred between ABIs and whether lessons learnt have been adopted more broadly in urban governance approaches.</p>
<p>In summarising, whilst ABIs have directed additional resources into local authority areas, what remains uncertain is whether ABIs have provided funds around which new forms of creativity co-operation have emerged, the intensity of co-operation and the extent to which more traditional forms of urban decision-making continue to dominate. Of additional uncertainty is whether the lessons learnt from past initiatives have encouraged new governance styles to be adopted, or whether the complexities associated with the layering of ABIs are reflected in local forms of fragmentation and disconnection. To reach a better understanding of how these different influences interact requires detailed research within selected LGAs. The following section introduces Wolverhampton as an appropriate location to begin such research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0042098011415432">
<title>Wolverhampton</title>
<p>Wolverhampton is a LGA located in the north-west of the West Midlands urban area (WMUA). The WMUA, with a population of 2.6 million, centres on the regional centre of Birmingham (approximately 1 million) and extends outwards to include Solihull, Coventry and the Black Country sub-region (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098011415432">Figure 1</xref>). The ‘Black Country’ describes a geographical area that has its origins at the start of the industrial revolution in the mid 18th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042098011415432">Jones, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0042098011415432">Wood, 1976</xref>). As a term, it first appeared in written records from the mid 19th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0042098011415432">Skidmore, 2003</xref>). From a geological perspective, the Black Country reflects that part of the South Staffordshire coal seam which came within manual excavation depth of the earth’s surface. From an industrial perspective, the Black Country reflects a territory Blackened by the smog of industrial processes (such as iron production). Whilst historically fragmented into a series of towns and villages, through the mid to late 20th century local government boundaries were reformed and what were initially town councils merged into larger borough councils; also historical parts of the Black Country were joined onto neighbouring market towns (for example, Bilston was added to Wolverhampton). By 1974, the administrative area now known as the Black Country consisted of the four local authorities of Dudley, Sandwell, Walsall and Wolverhampton. Collectivly, the population of the four local authorities was approximately 1.1 million people in 2001.</p>

</fig>
<p>Wolverhampton, as a traditional market town, benefited from its proximity to iron and steel production in the Black Country. During the 18th century, Wolverhampton began its transformation into an industrial town, initially in terms of lock production, but more recently during the early 20th century from the manufacturing of a diverse array of emerging technologies, with transport being a particular strength. As a LGA with traditions of large factory-based forms of employment, Wolverhampton council has tended to be Labour party controlled. From the 1970s onwards, Wolverhampton, like other parts of the Black Country, has experienced ongoing economic restructuring. In Wolverhampton’s case, this has resulted in the twin problems of deprivation and population loss. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042098011415432">Nevin (1993</xref>, p.106) indicates that between 1981 and 1987 Wolverhampton lost more than 23 per cent of its manufacturing employment. Between 1991 and 2001, the borough’s population fell by 10 000 to 238 000. The continuation of problems during the 2000s was reflected in Wolverhampton’s decline from the 35th to 27th most deprived local authority in England between 2004 and 2007, according to the national index of multiple deprivation (IMD).</p>
<p>During this period, Wolverhampton did experience significant growth in public-sector employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098011415432">GHK, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0042098011415432">WMRO, 2010</xref>); however, deprivation remained concentrated and levels of prosperity in surrounding commuter-belt local authorities increased (adjoining South Staffordshire District Council rose from 265 to 269 according to the IMD over the same time-period). In addition to being a ‘shrinking city’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0042098011415432">Mace <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) with among the highest levels of unemployment in the West Midlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0042098011415432">WMRO, 2010</xref>), Wolverhampton has strategic importance as the north-western city within the WMUA, a status granted in 2000. Wolverhampton Council (WC) thus changed from being a metropolitan borough council (MBC) to a city council. As the only city in the Black Country, its regeneration remains critical in terms of the sub-region addressing a below regional and national average per capita output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0042098011415432">WMRO, 2009</xref>). Because of its decline during recent decades, Wolverhampton has been eligible for national ABIs. In the period since 1987 the former industrial town has experienced regeneration funding through a UDC (Black Country Development Corporation, BCDC), Wolverhampton CC, four SRB programmes and a NDC programme (All Saints and Blakenhall Community Development, ABCD). Relevant ABIs with sub-local authority area boundaries can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098011415432">Figure 1</xref>. As a result of this sequence, Wolverhampton provides a relevant case study to investigate ABIs in terms of their layering and legacy.</p>
<p>To review Wolverhampton’s experience of ABIs, local stakeholders were formally interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Whilst interviews broadly focused on Wolverhampton’s experience of industrial decline, area-based regeneration and local governance structures, they were also tailored to the specific background and experience of individual interviewees. Notable methodological limitations include securing access to key informants, time-limited interviews and reliance on people’s memories. Where interviewees were involved in multiple initiatives, these problems were compounded. Responses included interviewing widely, follow-up interviews and carefully synthesising commentary and written documentation into a coherent description. Drawing on desk-top research and snowballing between mid 2007 and late 2009, 46 people were interviewed who had either been involved in the management and operation of ABIs, or who in an occupational and/or representative capacity were engaged in shaping Wolverhampton’s future. Conservative government (1979–97) ABIs were examined first, prior to the most recent NDC initiative. Interviews were conducted with: local authority officers (<italic>n</italic> = 6), lead councillors (4), the LSP (1), regeneration professionals (5), business, property and economic development interests (14), education and training interests (4), community leaders (6), social and voluntary group interests (4), a local Member of Parliament (1) and the West Midlands government office (1). Council officers and councillors aside, 11 interviewees had some level of involvement with one ABI and six interviewees had connection to two or more. Interviews were conducted face-to-face, lasted one to two hours and were recorded for later transcription. Six interviewees declined to be interviewed and four were interviewed twice for reasons including time constraints. The analysis begins by briefly summarising recent ABIs in Wolverhampton.</p>

<title>Black Country Development Corporation</title>
<p>The Black Country Development Corporation (BCDC) was created in 1987 and operated through until early 1998. It was geographically centred on Sandwell MBC (73 per cent of the land area; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042098011415432">Nevin, 1993</xref>), but extended into Walsall and Wolverhampton. Its imposition reflected not only the state of industrial decline, but also the difficulty of co-ordinating strategic action within and across Black Country local authority boundaries. The 12-person board was dominated by property and business-minded members who were appointed by the national government. The board also included the lead councillor from each of the three councils. Sandwell was the main focus of BCDC, as is symbolised by the path of BCDC’s most significant legacy, the (£107 million, 23 per cent of total expenditure) Black Country New Road (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042098011415432">Nevin, 1996</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098011415432">Figure 1</xref>). As an infrastructure-led regeneration project, the dual carriageway enhanced the connectivity of a large area of industrial land. Through land assembly, land reclamation and the sale of development opportunities plus speculative building, BCDC helped to attract economic investment (approximately 25 000 new jobs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042098011415432">Nevin, 1996</xref>). Improved accessibility also limited BCDC’s impact on Sandwell as it encouraged in-commuting and the local relocation of businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042098011415432">Nevin, 1996</xref>). Programmes to encourage local employment were limited in both design and impact, such that Sandwell continues to experience significant deprivation (14th most deprived LGA nationally). Three areas of development opportunity within Wolverhampton were added to the initial BCDC designation, with suggested reasons including the election of a Conservative MP in North East Wolverhampton in 1987. Local property and business representatives tended to look favourably towards BCDC, whilst recollections from within WC were less positive. For WC, it was an organisation that was tolerated, with interviewees critical about the loss of planning powers. Negative legacies included the stock-piling of contaminated land, plus planning permissions that were granted for a decentralised retail complex in east Wolverhampton. Additional criticism was directed at BCDC for taking control of the vacant Low Level (railway) Station site, which the Council had been promoting, but for then failing to progress. Nearby BCDC sites did proceed during this period including a major new Royal Mail postal facility and a new edge-of-centre hotel. Reports of stronger local authority engagement towards the end of the programme need to be viewed carefully as a key objective was securing BCDC’s remaining assets.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0042098011415432">
<title>City Challenge</title>
<p>Wolverhampton CC commenced part way through BCDC. It spanned a five-year period between 1992 and 1998, and totalled £37.5 million. The focus was on two residential areas north of the city centre, Low Hill and Whitmore Reans, which totalled approximately 22 000 people. The initiative was viewed favourably for the way in which it delivered important physical projects of city-wide importance (for example, a new science (employment) park (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098011415432">Figure 1</xref>), plus a refurbished football stadium, race course and athletics centre), in addition to various community projects and programmes. It also expanded the scale of economic development, which had previously included using national Urban Programme funding to transform an edge-of-town-centre industrial building—the Chubb (locks) building—into a creative industries centre (the Light House) which opened in the early 1990s. There remained limitations in terms of CC’s achievements, especially in the extent to which physical projects reduced levels of deprivation within the designated area. Difficulties included creating links between the local labour force and the work of external contractors, and the sustainability of local apprenticeships. Continued economic restructuring during the 1990s, including job losses at local businesses (for example, Goodyear’s tyre factory), further reduced the impact of adopted employment initiatives. More controversially, the closure of an inner-city high school in Whitmore Reans was viewed as contradictory to the objectives of CC, as were promised new bus routes that never eventuated. The time-limited nature of CC negatively impacted on the longevity of a number of community buildings (for example, a health facility, youth housing development) which proceeded without strong forms of community ownership or partner agency commitment. More disparaging recollections about CC were that it included ‘off the (council) shelf’ projects and that it lacked creative thinking. Practical constraints in terms of meeting bid deadlines were identified by officers working within WC. The most frequently cited legacy was the Wolverhampton Science Park, partly because of its expansion as an employment node in the period since (currently a diverse mix of 100 small and medium-sized occupiers), but also because it symbolised a strengthened relationship between the local university—the University of Wolverhampton (majority owners of the Science Park)—and the local authority. Other reported legacies of city-wide significance included the realisation that WC could operate an agency at arm’s length and deliver a regeneration programme. As CC evolved, it was described as becoming more community-orientated, particularly as it started to focus on community development themes which had been less well developed in the initial bid. Community board members identified local legacies, such as community leaders, a credit union, an arts centre, an adult teaching and learning centre and housing improvement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0042098011415432">
<title>SRB</title>
<p>Wolverhampton secured four of the six SRB rounds that occurred during the 1990s. The two most significant in terms of funding were SRB1 (£16.5 million, 6 years) and SRB3 (£18.8 million, 6 years). Both were local-authority-wide in terms of their focus and included a diverse array of smaller projects and programmes. SRB4 (£5.3 million, 7 years) was notable for being managed by Wolverhampton College, although WC remained the accountable body. A key reason for positioning the management structure outside the council was that the (interim labour market) programme focused on supporting people into employment and thus overlapped with college responsibilities. SRB5 (£2.2 million, 7 years) was smaller in terms of size and focused specifically on economic activity within Wolverhampton’s Black and minority ethnic communities. The main difference between City Challenge and SRB (1 and 2) was that the locus of decision-making within SRB was more strongly focused within WC. As a result, external agencies recalled significant battles with the council over how to design SRB bids, or the lasting memory of meetings being little more than rubber-stamping exercises. The layering of SRB programmes, plus the absence of a strong strategic focus, left commentators uncertain about which SRB rounds Wolverhampton obtained and what was achieved from those that it did. Identified legacies included heritage building refurbishment in the city centre (St Johns Urban Village) and All Saints Action Network (ASAN) as a self-funding community enterprise. The legacy extending from SRB4 was questioned because of the level of resources required to support individuals into employment and the absence of longitudinal research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0042098011415432">
<title>ABCD</title>
<p>Following the election of the Labour government in 1997, WC was invited to bid for a NDC programme. Funding totalling £53.5 million over the period 2001–11 was obtained for a designated area lying south of the city centre. The geographical focus for the initiative was on Blakenhall, but was also extended eastward into All Saints and Parkfields. Combined, it totalled approximately 4000 households and was entitled All Saints and Blakenhall Community Development, or ABCD. The arm’s-length initiative faced considerable problems from an early stage. Difficulties stemmed from the government’s early commitment to community-led regeneration which resulted in significant community infighting, plus resistance to outside interests and agencies. WC was eventually instructed by the Government Office to intervene or risk losing the funding. Changes followed, including a new chief executive officer (CEO), an independent chairperson and a new extended management structure. ABCD’s offices were also symbolically located outside the designated area. Ongoing community protests, followed by a WC scrutiny report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0042098011415432">WCC, 2005</xref>), prompted the independent chair to stand down and a preferred community representative to be appointed. Stability during the middle of the programme saw several projects and programmes realised through ABCD support and investment, including a new primary school, an eco-housing development, a community and leisure centre, business workspace and improved park infrastructure. Five tower blocks were demolished as part of the process of creating a proposed mixed-use Blakenhall neighbourhood centre. Partnership working with public-sector agencies resulted in several successful programmes targeting community and health concerns (for example, prostitution, mental health, culturally sensitive services). Progress was slowed in the late 2000s by economic recession. Strategic development sites that were included within the designation, such as Blakenhall’s new mixed-use housing and retail centre, housing renewal in All Saints and the abandoned Royal Hospital site, remained undeveloped. With ABCD facing a difficult start and a problematic final few years, commentators questioned whether a legacy of longer-term significance would result (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098011415432"><italic>Express and Star</italic>, 2010a</xref>)</p>

<sec id="section9-0042098011415432">
<title>An Assessment of the Layering and Legacy of ABIs within Wolverhampton</title>
<p>The most notable conclusion from Wolverhampton in terms of layering was the contrast that existed between CC and ABCD. Whereas Wolverhampton CC was reported to be one of the more successful programmes nationally, ABCD has been labelled as one of the less well performing NDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042098011415432">Marrs, 2010</xref>). Recognising widespread variation between NDC programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011415432">Batty <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011415432">Coaffee and Deas, 2008</xref>), local factors have played a key role in shaping Wolverhampton’s experiences. Explanations for CC’s perceived effectiveness included the leadership provided by its Chairman (the then Leader of WC), CC’s CEO (a former WC economic development officer) and the then Chief Executive of WC. As a result of high-level council support, partnership officers indicated that: “we weren’t battling to get anything done, there was just a very co-operative environment”. The breadth of the 17-person board was also described positively (local authority (<italic>n</italic> = 4), local community (4), local economic interests (4), independents (4), plus the CEO). The Leader of the Council strongly supported positioning the board structure outside the local authority and involving the local community. Two community forums were established through which a chairperson plus two board representatives were selected. Additional support for CC came from its more inclusive and holistic approach, and the way it differed from BCDC. Whilst CC’s chairman, who was also a member of BCDC’s board for part of its duration, was adamant that CC had not learnt anything from BCDC, the advantages of operating at a distance from councillor scrutiny and infighting were acknowledged during interviewing, especially when the funding came from external sources. CC was reported to have occurred within a context of commitment and respect, with community representatives appreciative of public- and private-sector leaders for taking an interest in their community.</p>
<p>Further adding to the local contrast between CC and NDC, was the SRB programme. What was notable was the extent to which lead councillors were critical of SRB for its limited impact and even reported being informed by officers that it was not their responsibility. That SRB somewhat marginalised local councillors was further reflected in commentary from external voluntary-sector and employment-sector representatives involved in and frustrated by the programme. SRB was therefore largely viewed as a pot of money to deliver projects rather than necessarily strategic city-wide thinking—perhaps not surprising, given national recession and budgetary cuts during the early-to-mid 1990s and a reluctance to radically restructure public-sector services. Spreading SRB funding widely would help to ease the burden (and pace) of change. The complexity of the layering process also meant that CC was at the same time advancing a number of strategic city-wide projects. The local authority-wide focus of SRB nevertheless brought together selected local partners and helped to pave the way for a partnership structure orientated towards co-ordinating burgeoning national Labour government initiatives prior to the LSP’s formal launch in 2002.</p>
<p>The subsequent emergence of NDC nationally was, from the outset, contradictory: whilst it was designed to learn from CC (for example, time length, lead in time before money arrived), at the same time, it was community-led and significantly different. Although WC continued to be accountable financially, it did not have the same level of control it had over CC and SRB. From an early stage of ABCD, a key concern was the willingness of WC to engage. Various reasons were identified. First, the community-led nature of NDC was reinforced by the national government which instructed senior WC officers to step back in terms of their involvement. For some commentators, WC felt unjustifiably sidelined, and therefore stepped back too far, as if waiting for its anticipated collapse. Adding to this was the conclusion by lead councillors that NDC was simply the next round of politically driven, project-orientated funds. WC officers themselves pointed to a lack of logic in terms of which ABI designations Wolverhampton had obtained in the past, while broader commentary highlighted influences such as newly elected MPs, the need to shock Birmingham into a more pragmatic approach or a regional strategy of distributing funding towards (and thus away from) particular local authorities. Furthermore, because NDC was to be community focused, it also lacked broader strategic significance. Accordingly, the emphasis was towards local Labour councillor involvement rather than the leader or deputy leader providing direction. The limited involvement of lead councillors and officers from an early stage had implications for how the project evolved in its first few years, because it provided the context in which intra-community conflict could emerge and limitations in government policy could become apparent (i.e. assumptions about latent community leadership; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0042098011415432">Wallace, 2007</xref>). Whilst reports indicated that local authority engagement strengthened during the life of many NDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011415432">Batty <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), in Wolverhampton the level of council involvement remained a concern throughout, including after national scrutiny of the NDC programme was reported to have dwindled (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042098011415432">Marrs, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Because the local authority stepped back from NDC, there was evidence of lessons from CC either not flowing into ABCD, or being adopted belatedly. Examples included a board structure that was dominated by community representatives (19 in total in 2006—resident representatives (9, including the chair), councillors (4), council officers (1), public sector (3, including PCT, Police, LSP), Chamber of Commerce (1), other (1)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098011415432">ABCD, 2006</xref>), an ineffective political-administrative structure (for example, decisions being overturned), the early absence of themed discussion groups (i.e. that might have enabled the upskilling of community representatives) and a diminished emphasis on linking local programmes to city-wide objectives. From the outset, structured guidelines for allocating grant funding were notably absent. Community groups would therefore come forward with project ideas and funds would be allocated without rigorous assessment. In addition to the local authority stepping back, the designated community was from an early point seeking to safeguarding ‘its’ money, which included constraining the size of the management team and limiting WC’s involvement. By the time an enlarged partnership structure did emerge, which included employees from the earlier CC team, tension followed the introduction of a more evidence-based approach to expenditure. Regeneration consultants also acknowledged the difficulty involved in encouraging the community to move beyond short-term gains to long-term strategic opportunities. Other early oversights included the absence of investment in physical security that would have helped to build a sense of positive change across the designated area and a sense of momentum. When ABCD did attempt to advance larger projects, there was the quick realisation that they were more dependent on WC than they had appreciated.</p>
<p>Following a difficult early period, ABCD, like other NDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011415432">Coaffee and Deas, 2008</xref>), saw the initial CEO dismissed and a new CEO employed. What was true in Wolverhampton, and common nationally, was that neither CC CEO became an NDC CEO. Interviewees argued that early NDCs partnerships attracted people interested in (bottom–up) community development, rather than broader, more network-minded CEOs. The difference is significant in terms of the ability and willingness of ABIs to engage with partners outside the regeneration area and to join funding streams. Whilst ABCD did establish links beyond the council to the Primary Care Trust (PCT), other local and sub-regional agencies indicated their frustration, including economic development interests, training providers and the local voluntary sector. Intense community infighting played its role in strengthening inward-looking mindsets, as did rigorous national monitoring programmes. NDC officers, for example, indicated the need to account for the impact on individual students living in the designated area where funds were directed towards external schools—the irony being the importance of school improvement in supporting the longer-term attractiveness of neighbourhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0042098011415432">Mace <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Similarly, the limited availability of mainstream funding and resources from other national government initiatives (such as Neighbourhood Renewal funding) acted to reinforce a sense of isolation and fragmentation. Although interviewees pointed to the withdrawal of funding streams during (and after) earlier ABIs, it appeared particularly prevalent in the case of ABCD and thus reinforced a sense of how WC, in addition to other agencies, stepped backwards. This has particular significance given that NDC was orientated towards using small amounts of funding to lever in more substantial investments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011415432">Batty <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), and the potential for continued out-migration in the absence of comprehensive change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098011415432">Lawless, 2006</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section10-0042098011415432">
<title>Small-area Governance</title>
<p>To further interpret the layering of ABIs in Wolverhampton, it is necessary to reflect on broader reasons why the community was viewed positively in CC, but considered more problematic in the case of ABCD. For commentators, what was significant in the case of CC was the strength of community leaders. Within the Low Hill area there had been earlier initiatives, including a General Improvement Area (GIA) in the early 1970s which, as a top–down process of housing improvement, had conflicted with the desires of particular households and resulted in resistance. Local activists also gained experience through their participation on city-wide housing committees, and through their involvement in establishing local tenants’ associations. CC itself stimulated future community representatives when the early action plan proposed housing demolition in the northern part of Low Hill. Community board members were described as passionate about improving the quality of the local area, even to the extent of approving expenditure beyond the designated area (for example, schools, public realm improvement). In contrast, support was less strong for some of the key city-building projects because they tended to fall outside neighbourhood areas, because it was felt that the private sector should have been investing on its own and because of their more imposed nature. Representatives nevertheless rationalised that such projects remained limited in scale and that substantial funding remained for community investment. Despite being limited in number, a key theme that emerged was that representatives from local businesses (for example, from Goodyear’s tyre company, Beatties department store) played a key role in building the confidence of community representatives and demonstrated a willingness to side with the community on particular issues (for example, credit unions). Uncertainty about how to build a positive future legacy was apparent in the decision to create a CC-wide community structure. With the two communities divided in terms of ethnic mix and housing tenure, and physically separated by the main northern road leaving Wolverhampton, they quickly returned to their own community networks. Whilst less strong or united than they were during CC, the networks continue to exist.</p>
<p>Like Wolverhampton CC, ABCD was an artificial creation. It was also a more complex structure, such that ABCD officers, included those who worked on both initiatives, commented: “we don’t have any natural communities here, there just aren’t”. The final configuration of the boundaries went through various stages. Blakenhall formed the largest part of ABCD. The area coincided with the northern part of a predominantly labour-voting electoral ward, which experienced significant housing and social problems. To achieve the numerical requirement, other areas were bolted on. The All Saints area was added, despite having previously benefited from ABIs, because of housing quality concerns and the former Royal Hospital redevelopment opportunity. Compared with Blakenhall, All Saints represented a smaller area, but one which crossed two significantly larger council wards. Destabilising pressure was exerted from Graisley to the west to be included, or at least for benefits to flow in their direction because people moved between Blakenhall and Graisley to use services. In the early days, the NDC programme was therefore confusingly labelled ‘ABCD with benefits to Graisley’. At the behest of the Government Office, ABCD was extended to include a local high school and in doing so incorporated part of Parkfields, as well as opportunities for parkland improvement and brownfield development. ABCD’s boundaries remained exclusionary in their inclusiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0042098011415432">Raco, 2003</xref>), with nearby areas of deprivation omitted (for example, Rough Hills). From this perspective, funding was directed towards a large Labour-voting territory south of the city centre without necessarily a strong early vision of what might represent well-governed, stable, inner-city neighbourhoods after the programme ended. In this sense, there was limited learning from or building on CC.</p>
<p>Compared with CC, ABCD was also less well balanced from a governance perspective. The absence of strong community leaders before and during the ABI, as identified in CC, was acknowledged. Local residents also exceeded other board members, in a way that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098011415432">Lawless (2006)</xref> describes as problematic. Whilst ABCD’s boundaries included over 500 businesses, which made the programme distinctive nationally, there was a notable absence of local business representation on the board—thus reinforcing residential community orientation of the NDC programme. City-wide business interests also left in response to community in-fighting and the decision to remove the independent chair. Although All Saints had experienced an earlier GIA designation, community governance in the form of ASAN emerged later and notably included professional officers. With the inclusion of All Saints, ABCD overlapped an area which had benefited from SRB funding. Rather than a positive sense of layering with ASAN providing knowledge about how a social enterprise initiative might underpin an exit strategy, evidence pointed to a state of tension with ABCD officers acknowledging a sense that they were an unwanted imposition (for example, “the whole foundation of this has been incredibly difficult”). From the opposite perspective, there was the potential for ABIs to be viewed as public-sector organisations operated by (9am–5pm) employees who were less aware of the constant survival challenges confronting community enterprises. Underpinning this tension was the question of future area leadership and the relative importance of councillors as opposed to alternative forms of community leadership. Blakenhall’s history of being a stronghold for Labour councillors thus conflicted with All Saints community enterprise orientation.</p>
<p>The dilemma confronting ABCD reflected a wider set of questions facing WC in terms of urban governance. Building on the community network legacy of past ABIs, such as Whitmore Reans in Partnership, Low Hill Community Forum and ASAN, the Wolverhampton Network Consortium (WNC) had been established in the late 1990s as a uniting body. In addition to the neighbourhood networks themselves, WC was involved. A key objective was to apply for European funds (three programmes since obtained) and other grants for which the local authority was ineligible. With a focus on community capacity and empowerment, WNC expanded as the number of bottom–up neighbourhood networks increased across the city. The Consortium also benefited from WC funding to be able to offer a small grant scheme for neighbourhood areas. Running in parallel from the late 1990s, the national local government modernisation agenda and the neighbourhood renewal strategy (and funding) resulted in the search for coherent neighbourhood areas within which new community forums would be established. After an initial pilot programme, 15 local neighbourhood partnerships (LNPs) were created across Wolverhampton, aligned to the LSP. Whilst LNPs might play a role in identifying local environmental and crime problems, their ability to shape and the willingness of the local authority to allow a more fundamental critic of service delivery was considered unlikely. A lack of area prioritisation (for example, locally defined ABIs) was also acknowledged at a city-wide level, as was a reluctance to switch from a focus on local authority delivery and dependency to community empowerment and self-help. For example, there was little suggestion at the time of interviewing that forums would own community assets. Further criticism followed the imposition of what were described as overfunded public-sector structures that spread resources too thinly, officers taking over from community volunteers and the desire of local councillors in some LNPs to remain in control. At same time, LNP boundaries were described as lacking rationale as they varied significantly in terms of size and relationship to existing ward boundaries (of which there are 20). Tension was also prevalent about how these boundaries related to those within the WNC and what role bottom–up networks would therefore play. Until the WNC successfully obtained a big lottery grant in 2008, the hope was that WNC would merge into the LSP. In this sense, a key legacy stemming from ABIs was a number of bottom–up community networks which did not sit easily with local authority and LSP thinking about small-area governance. From this perspective, the decision of WC to step back from ABCD was not just about sending a message to the national government, or the perception that NDC lacked strategic importance; arguably it also reflected a local authority that was hesitant about engaging with the community empowerment underpinnings of the programme.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0042098011415432">
<title>Local Authority Priorities</title>
<p>A further question relating to the layering of ABIs is why, within the context of a 10-year NDC programme, WC did not intervene more quickly. Although particular council departments were identified as supportive, other parts of the local authority were described as reluctant to provide resources to assist ABCD’s investment. In other instances where local issues were particularly challenging, such as housing renewal in the All Saints area or the (Tesco’s-owned) Royal Hospital site, the council was labelled slow to respond. Accordingly, some of the key problems and opportunities included within the designated area were not addressed within the programme’s time-frame. This reflects a more significant problem, as property development in the city was generally described as difficult and the local planning authority was portrayed as having historically restricted the speed of development and the interest of property developers. A key focus of the local authority during the 2000s was therefore stimulating property-led regeneration. WC accordingly bid for SRB6 funding in the late 1990s to kick-start canal-side regeneration adjacent to the eastern edge of the town centre. At the same point in time, the decision was made to focus what was seen as the less strategically important NDC programme on the ABCD area. Funding for SRB was not forthcoming because, following the transfer of SRB funding from the West Midlands Government Office to the Regional Development Agency (RDA, Advantage West Midlands (AWM)), lead councillors reported that a key regeneration focus of the embryonic agency was directed towards Sandwell and Stoke-on-Trent as two of the most deprived LGAs in the West Midlands. Frustration within WC built up during this period because Wolverhampton received NDC funding rather than SRB, the national government decided against having SRB7 and a lack of momentum followed the millennium city designation.</p>
<p>With a view towards encouraging property development, WC lobbied for an urban regeneration company (URC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098011415432">DETR, 2000b</xref>). Commencing in late 2007, shortly before the national property market crash, the Wolverhampton Development Company (WDC) combined regeneration professionals, regional property and investment companies, Wolverhampton Chamber of Commerce, lead councillors and the University of Wolverhampton. Although the WDC had an area focus that included the city centre and a corridor extending northwards, it was not comparable with early ABIs as it lacked project funding. AWM, which was also represented on the board, and WC provided joint finance for its administration. WDC was significant because it was an arm’s-length organisation, and was a designation that the council pushed the WM Government Office to obtain. WDC built on past ABI experiences in that it was an attempt to distance councillors from intensive scrutiny of the resources required to establish a professional local economic development unit able to court investors with a new developer-friendly image. At arm’s length from the council, it was described as operating outside the national Labour government’s rigorous local authority monitoring structures (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0042098011415432">Wilson, 2003</xref>), where there was the opportunity for greater freedom and creativity. Unlike BCDC, planning powers remained with the council. Other lessons from recent ABI experiences were absent, such as the commitment to public participation that underpinned CC. Aligned to Wolverhampton’s SRB experience, there were mixed levels of commitment from council officers to externalising council and/or personal responsibilities. From the outset it was imposed in a straightjacket as its boundaries excluded key flagship developments that local authority officers had been working towards commencing. Initially advocated by lead Labour councillors, and then continued by a new Conservative–Liberal coalition from mid 2008, WDC was not a fixed-term initiative, such that with the onset of public-sector finance cuts, it was wound up in mid 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098011415432"><italic>Express and Star</italic>, 2010b</xref>). In summary, despite significant levels of property investment nationally, and the rising interest in property development within Wolverhampton, the decade in which NDC operated is marked by limited change in terms of Wolverhampton’s built environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098011415432">GHK, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0042098011415432">Wainwright, 2011</xref>). Some brownfield residential development occurred and a start was made on the low-level station site; however, key flagship projects dating from the 1990s, including a city-centre shopping centre, a major regional employment park to the north (i54), an urban village in Bilston and a major train station redevelopment, either did not proceed or were slow to commence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098011415432">Henderson, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>During the mid 2000s, WC, like other authorities (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0042098011415432">Vigar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), focused on property-led regeneration in the anticipation that it would lead to social and economic benefits and to fill the void in urban economic development policy identified nationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098011415432">Goodwin, 2004</xref>). Lead councillors and officers were adamant that ABIs will only deliver short-term impacts unless wider urban property markets were buoyant. The fixation on securing property development also encouraged policy fragmentation that detracted from WC’s interest in ABCD. WDC’s boundaries reinforced the local authority’s historical interest in the centre of Wolverhampton, as well as the economic potential of a northern transport corridor heading out of the city and the Black Country. ABCD officers therefore pushed for the northern part of the initiative to be included in an extended WDC boundary (and a position on the board). Local forms of fragmentation were reinforced by regional influences with AWM responsible for economic development, and NDC, as well as the LSP, the responsibility of the West Midlands Government Office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098011415432">Coulson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098011415432">Goodwin, 2004</xref>). WDC also emerged from within the council, such that members of the LSP employment sub-group were not part of the early discussion about whether the URC was required and what role it would play. What was notable therefore was that both business groups, as well as the local voluntary sector who expressed their frustration towards SRB for being local authority in orientation, continued to be critical of the LSP in terms of the level of WC control and selectivity. The implication was that the layering of ABIs within Wolverhampton had not led to a fundamental shift in the local authority’s approach to city-wide issues. CC and SRB were instrumental in encouraging stronger public-sector collaboration, with the PCT CEO the chair of the LSP and the local university playing a leadership role in Wolverhampton’s Education Action Zone (2000–05). Public sector growth, plus national government scrutiny, during the past decade further reinforced the need for greater public sector co-ordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0042098011415432">WMRO, 2010</xref>). Yet at the same point there appeared to be resistance to engaging more openly with other local interests. Commentators thus acknowledged that the employment sub-group lacked impetus, that a concise city vision was absent and that the council, via the LSP, was responding to national monitoring by selecting (Local Area Agreement, LAA) indicators that could be improved or controlled, rather than necessarily the most difficult issues confronting the city or the NDC area (for example, private rented housing, alcoholism).</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>By 2010, urban LGAs in the UK had experienced 40 years of urban policy. This has resulted in a mosaic of local experiences and narratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011415432">Batty <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011415432">Coaffee and Deas, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098011415432">Cochrane, 1999</xref>), such that care is required in drawing conclusions from single case studies. Broad generalisations can nevertheless be made about how individual local authorities respond to local issues, including the extent to which new forms of urban governance are emerging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011415432">Coaffee, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0042098011415432">Wallace, 2007</xref>). Focusing on the City of Wolverhampton, this paper has reviewed 25 years of ABIs. Local legacies have been identified in relation to specific programmes, including employment-orientated land uses and neighbourhood facilities. Evidence of enduring physical legacies, however, provides only part of the narrative, as key opportunities have remained undeveloped and some investments have proved unsustainable. A programme’s recognised legacy can thus hide as much as it reveals, including the continuation of high levels of deprivation. Each ABI attracted criticism in terms of whether it represented the creative use of an additional funding stream. Partly this reflects national government policy formulations, such as bidding time-frames and the hasty inclusion of a mix of community- and/or property-orientated opportunities into designated areas. It also reflects a centralist approach rather than evidence of broader, more holistic, forms of local governance, and the early creation of an inclusive urban vision (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0042098011415432">Vigar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) towards which future funding streams might be aligned. Further criticism was directed at the governance of ABIs, with particular attention focusing on the extent to which regeneration partnerships operated beyond the influence and involvement of WC. BCDC was described as too private-sector driven; SRB was labelled as too in-house; and NDC was identified as too distant for reasons including community resistance to local government intervention and that WC took a significant backwards step. In contrast, CC was viewed relatively more favourably, despite also having limitations. Commentary pointed to charismatic leadership, a balanced board structure, the involvement of lead councillors and a commitment towards board autonomy at a high level within the council. The strength of community involvement and influence also increased over time, thus helping to alleviate the uncomfortable co-existence of partners reported in other CC programmes (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011415432">Davoudi, 1995</xref>). Such conclusions reinforce the difficulty of where to position ABIs in relative space, the complex layering of significantly different ABI formulations over time and the continuing relevance of lessons drawn from earlier initiatives.</p>
<p>In comparing and contrasting individual initiatives, what was noticeable was the difference between CC and NDC within Wolverhampton, and the growing frustration towards ABIs for failing to meet the city’s regeneration needs. Thus, whilst CC empowered WC in terms of both strategic developments and community regeneration, the fragmentation of initiatives and responsibilities during the past decade (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098011415432">Coulson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098011415432">Florio and Edwards, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098011415432">Goodwin, 2004</xref>) resulted in WC demonstrating varying levels of commitment to individual ABIs and a growing sense of frustration towards ABIs generally. The potential for urban policy to overlook the regeneration needs of urban areas beyond the core English cities has been identified elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042098011415432">House of Commons, 2003</xref>). Because of pressure from the national Labour government to stand back from NDC, and because the initiative was deemed less able to respond to the city’s regeneration priorities, WC stepped backwards and lessons did not flow easily between initiatives. The absence of early attention to key projects and to longer-term community structures was therefore apparent. Wolverhampton thus differs from research in other NDC locations where the “inability of local authorities to ‘let go’” has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011415432">Coaffee, 2004</xref>, p. 455; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0042098011415432">Wallace, 2007</xref>). As symbolised by the WDC’s early boundaries, Wolverhampton’s economic future was closely aligned with the city centre and a northward corridor extending past Wolverhampton Science Park to regional and national motorways and motorway junction opportunities beyond the historical Black Country. ABCD was thus initially disconnected from the city’s pragmatic view of where property development was likely to occur. Attempts by the local authority to kick-start a market-driven property development approach, however, failed to materialise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098011415432">Henderson, 2011</xref>). Reasons included Wolverhampton’s inability to break free of the image of industrial decline that engulfs the Black Country by obtaining city status and a perceived lack of support for development from within the local planning authority (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098011415432"><italic>Express and Star</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Looking across the time-period under review for particular legacies, what was noticeable was that CC and SRB did bring different local interests together, especially in terms of the public sector, and this fed into a partnership that was created ahead of the top–down requirement for LSPs. Through neighbourhood renewal funding, new neighbourhood forums were introduced. Whilst collectively this suggests a strengthening of local governance, especially as it also brought the local voluntary and business sector into a formal partnership arrangement, the extent to which new more collaborative governance approaches have emerged within Wolverhampton, as well as in other local authorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098011415432">Harding <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098011415432">Davies, 2002</xref>), must be subject to on-going critical review. Two key concerns in Wolverhampton were the degree of openness within partnership structures, as reflected in the somewhat frustrated involvement of the voluntary and business sector, and the tense relationship between new top–down neighbourhood structures and community networks, including those stemming out of past ABIs. As reported elsewhere, the strength of top–down national government approaches, as well as local forms of ‘institutional inertia’ and/or ‘historical conservatism’, can constrain the degree of movement from government to more collaborative forms of local governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098011415432">Cowell and Martin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0042098011415432">Stewart, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0042098011415432">Wallace, 2007</xref>). A gap may therefore exist between the rhetoric of partnership working and the reality as experienced by different partners. The relevance of this conclusion also extends beyond local residents disenfranchised by city-wide strategies (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011415432">Coaffee, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011415432">Coaffee and Deas, 2008</xref>) to other local stakeholders sitting outside the public sector who are interested in city-wide futures. In this sense, continuing to investigate centralised forms of urban policy, local governance structures and the interrelationship between the two remains an important research agenda.</p>
<p>By way of conclusion, local authorities are key players in the delivery of ABIs and the transfer of lessons learnt; yet, somewhat contradictorily, the intensity of new open forms of governance can be resisted and particular ABI formulations may not only limit from above, but may also discourage active local authority involvement. Achieving a stronger level of integration between national interpretations of urban requirements and inclusive local understandings of what is required locally remains an inherent policy challenge. Into this context, the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government, since taking office in May 2010, has advocated a stronger ‘localism’ agenda and delivered substantial budget cuts. Whilst policy precision will continue to emerge, including the extent to which policy changes are driven by ideology and/or budgetary responsibility, what is noticeable is the removal of the regional tier of government within England, including RDAs, and a rescaling of emphasis towards local government—local business-sector relations at a sub-regional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042098011415432">HM Government, 2010</xref>). Somewhat confusingly, localism looks set to manifest at the community, local authority and sub-regional levels, with complex interrelationships within and between these scales, such as between bottom–up community structures, city-wide neighbourhood structures and councillor-orientated forms of democracy, as identified in this paper, and between local authorities and sub-regional local enterprise partnerships (LEPs). Support for a Black Country LEP will require WC, along with the other Black Country boroughs, to strengthen relations with the local business sector (including to advance their own cause) and to reconfirm their commitment to the Black Country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098011415432">Black Country LEP, 2010</xref>). In WC’s case, this will require local business relations to move beyond the piecemeal connections encouraged by recent ABIs and the LSP. Doing so will involve challenging long-held understandings of business motives, overbureaucratic processes and the perception that civically minded business leaders are in decline, perhaps because of the international ownership of manufacturing companies or the concentration of business leaders in Birmingham as the regional centre.</p>
<p>Outstanding questions about emerging governance structures, include the degree of local authority involvement (for example, councillors and council officers), the selection (or election) of representatives from a fragmented business sector, the level of participation of other parties, including the voluntary sector, the community sector and the remnants of the public sector, and above all the locus of decision-making within relative space. Further uncertainties relate to the distribution of scarce national government resources (for example, the competitively allocated Regional Growth Fund) and the ability of the Black Country LEP to prioritise sub-regional business and property development opportunities across local authority boundaries. Despite the rhetoric of localism, state selectivity is at the core of emerging governance structures. Up-scaling from the Wolverhampton example, a key challenge will be to strengthen emerging Black Country future visions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098011415432">BCC, 2005</xref>), including ensuring that recent planning exercises incorporate business viewpoints and the creation of shorter-term implementation plans (for example, locating the coalition government’s recently announced Black Country Enterprise Zone). Future bids can then be aligned with collaboratively determined frameworks, rather than simply chasing national government funds through local interpretations of national policy objectives. Without a coherent and inclusive Black Country platform, there remains the potential for disengagement and fragmentation, including contradictory forms of local authority regeneration and/or disconnection from local needs (such as education and skills budgets). An additional future variable will be the willingness of the coalition government after dramatically reducing public expenditure to adopt future ABIs to moderate the worse instances of area-based deprivation, perhaps following social protest. Given historical ‘full circle’ swings in ABI governance structures and focus, uncertainties remain about future policy formulations and the role and responsibilities of local authorities. Inevitably, the timing and availability of the next layers of national government policy will play a key role in shaping local governance arrangements, including the intensity of commitment to more locally creative and collaborative decision-making structures in Wolverhampton, the Black Country and other areas of spatial governance.</p>
