<p>Whereas New Testament criticism has tended to focus on historical and literary and dimensions of each evangelist’s account of Jesus’ baptism, this evidently important Gospel narrative became a crucial vehicle of specifically Trinitarian thought in the patristic period. The present brief ‘think piece’ explores the potential for a correlation between the baptism story in its historical context of Jewish renewal and its highly theological impact in patristic interpretation. The enormous exegetical import of this episode may be said to derive from its function as the ‘super-sacrament’ of Israel’s and Adam’s redemption (cf. J. Macquarrie).</p>

<p>The story of the baptism of Jesus dramatically opens all three Synoptic Gospel narratives, and is evocatively implied in the Fourth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040571X11430891">1</xref></sup> But what might this prominence mean? Does anything of theological importance really hang on it?</p>
<p>New Testament scholarship has tended to mine this story either for primarily historical or primarily literary purposes, usually yielding fairly modest ‘pay dirt’ for our understanding either of the historical Jesus or of the theology of the Gospels. The former line of inquiry discloses something of Jesus of Nazareth’s historical proximity to the Jewish renewal movement of John the Immerser, perhaps along with the acute importance of visionary experiences for his self-understanding – sometimes construed as marking the point of his ‘conversion’ (e.g. by Paul Hollenbach).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040571X11430891">2</xref></sup> Literary or narrative questions have tended to find here primarily the evangelists’ discrete exercises in disclosing Jesus’ messianic anointing and identity: the baptism in Mark, in Matthew, in Luke; the Baptist’s testimony to Jesus in John; etc. One of the most prolific contemporary writers about both baptism and Christology concludes a recent discussion of this narrative, ‘All we can say is that in the formulation of the Jesus tradition, from the earliest days, so far as we can tell, the disciple story-tellers had no doubt that Jesus had been anointed by the Spirit at Jordan and was cherished by God as son from that time or earlier.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040571X11430891">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>By contrast, early Christian theologies especially of the patristic period tended to locate in this narrative the encapsulation of profound theological and Christological conviction. So too it appears, for example, in both the Orthodox and the Arian Baptisteries at Ravenna, both of which place this episode at the theological and architectural centre of their reflection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040571X11430891">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this short ‘think piece’ about the properly theological import of that story, I wish to ask if the requisite exegetical and historical questions may somehow be galvanized into a more credally significant dialogue. Might there be benefit in reading Jesus of Nazareth’s baptism more explicitly in the light of the Son who is revealed in that baptism, and vice versa?</p>
<sec id="sec1-0040571X11430891"><title>The origin of baptism</title>
<p>As Christianity approaches the two-thousandth anniversary of the gospel events, the origins of its most widely practised sacrament remain widely unknown and misunderstood. Baptism or immersion is Christianity’s sole surviving Jewish purity ritual, indeed perhaps its only Jewish ritual. Although generally ignored by much of Christian tradition, that fact is contextually clear in the Synoptics and explicit in the Fourth Gospel. John the Baptist was of priestly descent on both sides of his family, and immersion a key ritual practice that had assumed great religious importance in Temple piety at Jerusalem, among the Dead Sea sectarians and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Before turning to consider the baptism of Jesus proper, therefore, a few biblical and Jewish texts may usefully highlight the meaning of immersion in its biblical and Jewish context. Washing before one enters into the cultic presence of God is a well-established custom in the Old Testament (Exod. 30.19–21; 40.12; cf. Lev. 14—17, etc.), understandably required above all for priests. The prophets and the Psalmist recognize the need for washing away the defilement of sins (Ps. 51.2, 7; Isa. 1.16; Jer. 2.22; 4.14). The whole notion of sin as defilement comes to fuller development in post-biblical Judaism (documented e.g. by J. Klawans),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040571X11430891">5</xref></sup> and it constitutes an important frame of reference for the New Testament phenomenon of baptism. Later Jewish practice distinguishes more carefully between the washing of hands and feet for ordinary pollution and full immersion of proselytes as well as after childbirth, menstruation and defilement by other bodily discharges. In Second Temple times, however, the most important reference for full immersion remained its practice by all Jews preparing to enter the Temple; orthodox Jews later continued this practice by immersion before Yom Kippur and other major festivals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040571X11430891">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Biblical and post-biblical Jewish texts, like the Synoptic accounts of John the Baptist, oscillate on a plane defined between the two axes of (a) sin vs. impurity and (b) corporate vs. individual reference. This makes improbable any construal of John’s baptismal praxis as narrowly concerned with (e.g. post-Augustinian) understandings of repentance from individual sin; in that sense it is worth considering if the long history of dogmatic soul-searching about Jesus’ personal sinlessness in this context may be rather overdone. At the same time, it does not seem exegetically called for to speak here of a subjective ‘conversion’ of Jesus, expressing his interior state in a way distinguishable from the repentance and baptism of ‘all the people’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040571X11430891">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Biblically, a particularly powerful and germane illustration of this preceding observation may be found in the instructions about priestly purification in Leviticus 16. In the course of the great sin-defeating ritual of Yom Kippur, Aaron the High Priest must ‘make atonement’ for himself, for his household and even for the Holy Place itself and for the Tent of Meeting, ‘which dwells with them in the midst of their uncleannesses’ (16.16), and to immerse himself twice, once before the ritual (16.4) and again preceding the sin offering that follows the expulsion of the scapegoat bearing the sins of Israel into the desert (16.24).</p>
<p>In chronological, intertextual and theological terms, perhaps the passage most cognate to John’s undoubtedly distinctive baptismal practice is Qumran’s <italic>Community Rule</italic>, with whose setting he may indeed have had some acquaintance. Here we find that those who turn to the community of the covenant and the laws of God in penitence are cleansed of all their sins by the Holy Spirit, as their flesh ‘is cleansed by being sprinkled with cleansing waters and being made holy with the waters of repentance’ (1QS 3.7–9 par. 4QS<sup>a</sup> frag. 2; cf. 5.13–14). Those who reject the covenant in stubbornness of heart, in contrast, walk in darkness and cannot be justified or ‘purified by the cleansing waters’ or by ‘all the water of the ablutions’. They remain defiled all the days they spurn the decrees of God (1 QS 2.25—3.5).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0040571X11430891"><title>John and baptism</title>
<p>We turn next to the New Testament context. First, the teaching of John about baptism. Luke agrees with Mark (1.4–5) and Matthew (Matt. 3.1–6) that John appears in the wilderness around the Jordan, ‘proclaiming a baptism’ (not of general inclusion and affirmation but specifically) ‘of repentance for the forgiveness of sins’ (Luke 3.3, a phrase particularly reminiscent of 1QS 3 cited above). Matthew similarly makes it clear that baptism was linked to a confession of sins (Matt. 3.1). In keeping with that call for moral purification is his Elijah-like clothing and austere diet of pure food.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0040571X11430891">8</xref></sup> More particularly, his address to the crowds requesting baptism is in the form of a stern prophetic moral warning to ‘bear fruits in keeping with repentance’ (3.8) because of the certainty of coming judgement. In Luke, that warning is applied with remarkable concreteness to different classes of people: those with material possessions, tax collectors, soldiers.</p>
<p>John subordinates his own immersing ministry to the superior and divinely empowered judge who will come after him (Luke 3.16–17): ‘I baptize you with water, but he who is mightier than I is coming, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire’ (<sc>NRSV</sc>). Luke concludes with the tersely intriguing and, to the contemporary ear, insufferably counter-cultural observation that (3.18) ‘So with many other exhortations he preached <italic>good news</italic> to the people.’ A ‘baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins’ implies that the effect of baptism is a <italic>divine</italic> ablution of sin. It is not clear whether baptism necessarily <italic>precedes</italic> repentance and forgiveness, as some commentators assume, or whether in fact the sequence of Jesus’ own call to ‘<italic>repent and believe</italic> in the good news’ (Mark 1.14 par.) may be equally à propos.</p>
<p>Given the prominence of the quotation adapted from Isaiah 40.3–5 in all four New Testament accounts, it is clear that the Gospels present a John sent to prepare the way for the Lord God himself, who is returning to Zion through the wilderness as the shepherd leading his flock (cf. 40.9–11). John’s Isaianic role, which was previously encountered in the Qumran community’s self-understanding, is also reminiscent of the messenger sent to prepare the Lord’s sudden arrival for purifying judgement in Malachi 3 (vv. 1–2). This final chapter of the Old Testament Prophets similarly stands behind the identification of John as the promised returning Elijah (Mal. 4.5 (<sc>MT</sc> 3.23)), which is explicit in Matthew (17.13), implicit in Mark (9.13) and Luke (1.17; contrast 4.25–6), but apparently rejected in John (1.21, 25). Either way, the coming Greater One is clearly not another human messenger but none other than the Lord himself (note Matt. 3.12 with 3.10): that is what John means, and it is what the evangelists want us to hear. The resonances here feature a dialectic that is deliberate but in no way ambiguous.</p>
<p>Following the episode involving John and Jesus with which we are here concerned, the only other specific reference to John’s immersion (aside from the use of his consistent epithet ‘the Immerser’) occurs in Jesus’ brief challenge to the chief priests and scribes to tell him whether that baptism was from man or from heaven (Mark 11.30 par.). Even here, however, it is not his baptism <italic>of Jesus </italic>which is recalled. Other than that, Luke refers in passing to the purification required after childbirth (vaguely applied to ‘them’ rather than to Mary, 2.22) while Mark alludes somewhat arm-wavingly to Pharisaic ritual washing before meals (7.3–4). While the Fourth Gospel may indeed be silent about the actual baptism of Jesus (perhaps because it presumes his purity?), none of the Synoptics shares its articulate interest in the arrangements for ritual washing at the wedding of Cana (John 2.6), in the meaning of rebirth by water and the Spirit (3.5), in Jesus’ <italic>aggiornamento</italic> of the water ceremony at the Feast of Tabernacles (7.37–9), in purification before Passover (11.55; 18.28), in the quasi-sacramental ablution of feet after immersion before the Last Supper (13.5–10), or for that matter in the important explicit link between baptism and purification (3.25 with 3.22–6; 4.1–2).</p>
<p>No Synoptic text alludes to the pre-Easter Jesus as either baptizing or instructing his disciples to baptize anyone, not even ‘with the Holy Spirit and fire’, as John had predicted. Plenty of comparisons between Jesus and John are made, and Jesus refers in passing to a metaphorical baptism he and his disciples need to undergo (Mark 10.38–9 par. – a logion that references his death rather than his immersion, and which may possibly underlie Paul’s argument in Romans 6 about baptism as incorporation into Christ’s death). Never, however, does he commend or practise an actual water baptism resembling John’s. This non-literal stance suddenly changes only in the Matthean and the secondary Marcan resurrection accounts (Matt. 28.19; Mark 16.16). The situation looks more complex in John (3.22; 4.1–2), but in the Synoptics the pre-Easter silence is consistent and presumably deliberate.</p>
<p>In Acts, however, we see a significant return to the theme of literal immersion in water. It becomes clear early on that Luke regards John’s promise of baptism in the Holy Spirit and fire to be specifically related to Pentecost (Acts 1.5; 11.16). Once this has happened, without further ado the proclamation of the apostles picks up where John left off, with Peter instructing the inquiring thousands to ‘Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit’ (2.38). The logic of this baptism, however, remains impeccably Jewish: it is a washing of repentance for cleansing from the defilement of sin and results in reception of the Holy Spirit; Paul’s own baptism is explicitly articulated in such terms (22.16). In the ensuing chapters, numerous baptisms follow – first of Jews, then of Samaritans and eventually of god-fearing Gentiles too. Luke nevertheless sees this baptism in the name of Jesus as superior to the baptism of John, since the latter’s disciples in Ephesus have to be rebaptized in the name of Jesus (19.5). To demonstrate his Jewish faithfulness and in keeping with his continuing claim to be a Pharisee (23.6), Paul readily undergoes ritual immersion before offering sacrifice in the Temple (21.24–6; 24.18).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0040571X11430891"><title>The baptism of Jesus</title>
<p>All this and more is part of the biblical setting as Jesus arrives from Nazareth to join with the crowds receiving John’s immersion of repentance for the forgiveness of sins (Mark 1.9 par.). Mark and Luke report his baptism matter-of-factly, describing an event that is the same for Jesus as for all Israel (for Luke, explicitly so: ‘all the people’, 3.21). Matthew inserts a hesitant pas-de-deux between John and Jesus about the latter’s fitness for baptism (3.14–15): not in any explicit sense because Jesus is sinless, but because he is greater than the Immerser himself – and thus, surely by deliberate implication, John’s Greater One of whose eschatological coming Isaiah and Malachi spoke. The Baptist only yields to Jesus’ assurance that this is required ‘to fulfil all righteousness’ – kingdom terminology whose first use here comes to characterize the teaching, ministry and identity of Jesus throughout Matthew’s Gospel (note the <italic>inclusio </italic>of 27.19). Interestingly, and perhaps significantly, the Matthean Baptist’s propensity to Christological reserve (Matt. 3.14; cf. 11.2–3) gives way in the Fourth Gospel to sustained Christological deliberation <italic>instead</italic> of immersion (John 1.6–8, 15, 20–36).</p>
<p>The Synoptic accounts of the baptism of Jesus are remarkably restrained in their narrative, claiming for him no great epiphanic self-disclosure. Similarly, these evangelists are silent about the extent of his self-knowledge as either messianic or divine: if the mind of Christ is known in this episode, it is in the fact that, although greater than John, he seeks out this Elijah-like messenger in order to participate in Israel’s purification of repentance for the forgiveness of all sins.</p>
<p>That said, this baptism does evoke in its aftermath a spectacular disclosure of God as Triune. Mark and Matthew describe the post-baptismal descent of the Spirit in the context of a vision granted to Jesus (‘he saw’), while it is not clear who (if anyone) other than Jesus <italic>hears</italic> the speaking voice from heaven – the first of its several New Testament appearances, in the familiar first-century Jewish trope of the <italic>bat qol</italic>, the divine pronouncement. Luke, here as elsewhere,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0040571X11430891">9</xref></sup> seeks to stress the facticity of revelation and therefore presents the Spirit’s descent as in some sense <italic>physical </italic>(‘in bodily form’, 3.22)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0040571X11430891">10</xref></sup> rather than merely visionary. It also, again typically for Luke, occurs in the context of the baptized Jesus <italic>at prayer</italic> (3.21).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0040571X11430891">11</xref></sup> For all three Synoptics, the <italic>bat qol</italic> speaks in biblical terms (Isa. 42.1; Ps. 2.7) of the Father’s love from whom the Spirit proceeds upon the Son of God, who will in due course bestow him on his people (Luke 24.49; cf. Acts 2.17–18, 33)<italic>. </italic>As several of the ancient commentators already noted,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0040571X11430891">12</xref></sup> this is a Trinitarian vignette that easily matches Johannine clarity (cf. John 14.26; 15.26; 20.22). It is also a narrative whose implications for the Gospels, and arguably for Jesus of Nazareth’s self-consciousness, are trivialized wherever critics still occasionally content themselves with inherited assumptions about the Synoptic evangelists’ indifferently ‘low’ Christologies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0040571X11430891"><title>The Jesus of the baptism</title>
<p>Why, then, is Jesus baptized? As we have seen, only Matthew gives an explicit answer to this question; Mark and Luke are untroubled by it. John altogether deflects it in favour of the Baptist’s Christologically ‘deictic’, pointing role (1.31; 3.30) famously captured in Grünewald’s Isenheim altarpiece that so moved Karl Barth, Walter Benjamin and others. Only Luke so much as mentions the episode subsequently; he identifies it prosaically as the beginning of Jesus’ ministry (Acts 1.22) but also, and more importantly, as the point of his messianic anointing with the Holy Spirit and divine power (Acts 10.37; cf. <italic>Ps. Sol.</italic> 17.37, 42; 4Q521).</p>
<p>The best answer we can give on the basis of the Synoptic Gospels is that Jesus sought baptism as a way of identifying with the nation’s response to John, who prophetically summoned Israel to wash away her impurities in preparation for the Lord’s promised return to Zion. Jesus responds to this call as the righteous Israelite par excellence, the Messiah who embodies Israel as divine Son.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0040571X11430891">13</xref></sup> This is perhaps most evident in Matthew (2.15; 3.15). But in Luke too, as we saw, the context of Jesus’ immersion is that <italic>all the people</italic> (3.21) are coming for baptism; and unlike the paradigmatic singular conversions of the later Gospel narrative, those who responded to John are addressed collectively (3.7–18 incl. 12–13, 14).</p>
<p>The innocuously familiar narrative of the baptism thus turns out to manifest the Son’s self-humbling solidarity with Israel and humanity, and for this reason quite emblematically to preface the story of Jesus’ ministry. Just as importantly for our purposes, this idea of Jesus’ baptism as iconic of his people’s salvation finds theologically potent confirmation in its patristic reception, as has been demonstrated by Kilian McDonnell with particular reference to the Syrian and Armenian traditions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0040571X11430891">14</xref></sup> While the Fathers’ focus is more on Adam in general than on Israel in particular, they repeatedly locate the programmatic purpose of this baptism in its expression of Jesus’ new humanity. Just as in his divinity he had no need to take on flesh and be born of a woman, so in his sinlessness he did not require baptism (an important subtext even in the Gospels; cf. John 1.27, 29–31; less clearly Matt. 3.14). Yet Theodore of Mopsuestia (<italic>c</italic>.350–428) notes that Christ as the new Adam here ‘recapitulates’ in himself all that concerns our humanity and its redemption.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0040571X11430891">15</xref></sup> ‘In Christ was the complete man,’ writes Hilary of Poitiers (<italic>c</italic>.300–68) a little earlier, ‘and in this way, having taken on his body in obedience to the Holy Spirit, he fulfilled in himself every sacrament of our salvation.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0040571X11430891">16</xref></sup> Thus there is a sense not only that Jesus undergoes baptism ‘to fulfil all righteousness’ (Matt. 3.15) but conversely too that the baptism powerfully reveals what Jesus is – a point recognized in the ancient texts that speak of <italic>fire</italic> appearing on the water on this occasion (e.g. Justin, <italic>Dial. </italic>88.3).</p>
<p>Ephrem (<italic>c</italic>.306–73) takes this thought further, and links the ‘fire and Spirit’ at Jesus’ baptism in the river with the same elements attending his birth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0040571X11430891">17</xref></sup> For all the Gospels, even for Mark and John who have no ‘birth narrative’, this event in some sense ‘births’ the Son’s incarnate ministry, just as it comes to symbolize his death (e.g. Mark 10.38–9; Rom. 6.3–4).</p>
<p>Jesus’ baptism thus discloses Christologically what John Macquarrie once called the ‘super-sacrament’, by which he meant ‘a unique manifestation in visible form of the authentic life of God’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0040571X11430891">18</xref></sup> On this reading Christ himself is indeed both content and minister not only of baptism but also (as Hilary put it above) of every Christian sacrament. If this is correct, then Jesus as the Baptized One sanctifies and ‘activates’ the dominical gift of grace that comes to his people through their baptism: the outward and visible sign of the salvation of Adam and Israel.</p>

Note too that while the Fourth Gospel’s Jesus baptizes, he also touches no lepers or corpses; he exorcizes the world (12.31) but never unclean spirits.</p></fn>
