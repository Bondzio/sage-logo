<p><italic>Objective:</italic> The objective of our study was to compare the standard protocol of anticoagulation to the Hepcon/HMS.</p>
<p><italic>Method:</italic> This study included forty-four patients who underwent coronary bypass grafting surgery (CABG), or biological aortic valve replacement (AVR). Unfractionated heparin (UH) was used for patients who underwent operations in the control group (n = 22) (300U/Kg of UH with a goal of an ACT of 400s). The heparin was antagonized dose/dose by protamine. For the patients who underwent operations in the HMS group (n = 22), the heparin and protamine doses were assessed by the Hepcon/HMS device.</p>
<p><italic>Results:</italic> The sex ratio amounted to 1.93 (29 men and 15 women) and the mean age was 70 ± 11 years. The patients in the HMS group had a chest closure time that was significantly shorter than patients in the control group. The times were, respectively, 42 ± 15 minutes and 68 ± 27 minutes (p = 0.001). The protamine/heparin ratio was significantly lower in the HMS group (0.62 ± 0.13 vs. 1 ± 0.11) (p = 0.0001). The postoperative bleeding amounted to 804 ± 729 ml in the HMS group versus 1416 ± 1103 in the control group (p = 0.016). In multivariate linear regression analysis, only two independent factors were significantly associated with bleeding: the Hepcon/HMS (OR = 0.1-p = 0.03) and the preoperative hemoglobin rate (OR = 1.4 - p = 0.05). Postoperatively, within 72 hours, the red blood cell transfusion was 1.04 ± 1.5 units for the HMS group and 2.1 ± 1.87 units for the control group (p = 0.05).</p>
<p><italic>Conclusion:</italic> During cardiac surgery under CPB, heparin and protamine titration with the Hepcon/HMS device could predict a lower protamine dose and lower postoperative bleeding without higher thromboembolic events, and lower perioperative red blood cell transfusion with a shorter chest closure time.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During cardiac surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) requires extremely effective anticoagulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112436632">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112436632">2</xref></sup>. However, no consensus about the monitoring or level of anticoagulation required (300 to 400 IU/kg of heparin) has been reached. Similarly, the neutralization of heparin is performed with protamine (dose/dose). This empirical approach, introduced during the 1960s, does not include inter- and intra-individual variations, which can involve bleeding complications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112436632">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The use of antifibrinolytic agents, including aprotinin (Trasylol®), allows us to reduce the risk of postoperative bleeding. A trend towards increasing morbidity and mortality in patients treated with aprotinin was shown by the BART study in 2008<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112436632">4</xref></sup>. Therefore, the clinical use of aprotinin was stopped. Therefore, there is a renewed interest in the optimization of anticoagulation during cardiac surgery.</p>
<p>We studied the Hepcon/HMS (Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, MN, USA) device, which allows individual management of anticoagulation by heparin and protamine titration.</p>
<p>The main objective of our study was the evaluation of intra- and postoperative blood loss and the comparison between the two protocols of anticoagulation. We also studied the occurrence of postoperative clinical complications.</p>

<sec id="section2-0267659112436632" sec-type="methods">
<title>Patients and method</title>
<p>This study included forty-four patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), or biological aortic valve replacement (AVR) under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) at the University Hospital of Amiens. The standard method of administration of unfractionated heparin (UH) was used for the control group (n = 22) (300U/Kg of UH with a target activated clotting time (ACT) of 400s). The heparin was antagonized by protamine dose/dose. The monitoring of anticoagulation was achieved by the Hémocron Response® (ITC Europe, Rodano, Italy). The HMS group patients (n = 22) were treated with heparin and protamine calculated using the Hepcon/HMS device. Simultaneous control of the ACT using a Hémocron Response® device was performed for the HMS group in order to verify the results.</p>
<p>In both groups, a baseline ACT was achieved after surgical incision<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112436632">5</xref></sup>; further measurements were taken after the heparin injection, before CPB, every thirty minutes during CPB, and, finally, ten minutes after protamine injection. An additional heparin injection (3000 to 5000 IU) was administered when the ACT target was not reached. Aprotinin was not used in either group. All patients received tranexamic acid (2g in the priming volume of CPB).</p>
<p>The non-inclusion criteria were: American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) patient classification ≥4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112436632">6</xref></sup>, chronic liver dysfunction with thymidine phosphorylase &lt;60%, clearance of creatinine &lt;30ml/min, heparin allergy, sepsis, neoplasm, previous thromboembolic event, and pregnancy.</p>
<p>The main goal of the study was to evaluate intraoperative and postoperative bleeding.</p>
<p>The minor objective was to assess the clinical and biological consequences of anticoagulation based on the titration system: perioperative transfusion, supraventricular arrhythmia onset, the usefulness of vasopressor drugs, and the occurrence of complications (myocardial infarction, stroke). Finally, we also conducted a cost study by approximating the additional costs and savings in terms of device, consumables and transfusion.</p>
<sec id="section3-0267659112436632">
<title>Hepcon-HMS device</title>
<p>The Hepcon/HMS Plus is a device which identifies the individual response to heparin in order to adjust the dose of heparin to the real need of the patient and, thus, achieve a targeted ACT. The software calculates the loading dose of heparin necessary to achieve this value of ACT, with the patient’s blood in contact with two doses of heparin (1.5 and 2.5 U/ml). Thus, the orthogonal projection of the ACT target during surgery crosses the extension of the straight at a single point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112436632">Figure 1</xref>). Theoretically, this determines the total amount of heparin necessary to achieve this ACT. Five minutes after the first dose of heparin, an ACT was performed to confirm that the target had been achieved. During CPB, a second test was performed allowing for a qualitative measurement to be made and the re-injections of heparin to be adjusted. Finally, a third test was conducted at the end of the procedure to determine the concentration of heparin in the blood sample, and, similarly, to give the protamine dose required for heparin neutralization. The heparin in the sample was neutralized in vitro by protamine sulfate and an ACT was measured in each cartridge. The shortest time for the sample to clot corresponded to the ideal dose of heparin needed.</p>

<p>Finally, control of residual heparin, with determination of the ACT, was performed 10 minutes after the slow administration of the protamine. If residual heparin was found, a new administration of protamine was performed. After the end of the procedure, the device printed a summary of all tests performed, allowing traceability of anticoagulation during surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112436632">7</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>CPB Set</title>
<p>Standard CPB was used for patients in this study: a roller pump, a Capiox RX25 polypropylene fiber oxygenator (Terumo, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), and a silicone uncoated circuit (priming 1600 ml) with arterial filter. The intra-pericardial suction and the cell-saver were used.</p>

<sec id="section5-0267659112436632">
<title>Statistical Method</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 9.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The qualitative variables were expressed as percentages while quantitative continuous numeric variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Univariate analysis comparing the two cohorts was carried out by using the Fisher test or χ<sup>2</sup> test for qualitative variables, and by a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test for quantitative variables. Univariate linear regression and multivariate analysis by binary logistic regression were performed on the data in order to find the independent factors associated with bleeding and the perioperative red blood cell transfusion. Factors incorporated in the multivariate analysis were selected for statistical significance in univariate analysis of p≤0.1. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered to be significant. The odds ratio and the confidence intervals were calculated at 95% and included in the multivariate analysis.</p>

<title>Ethics</title>
<p>Our study was observational and comparative. Monitoring of anticoagulation per CPB by the Hepcon/HMS was validated over twenty years and no thromboembolic complications have been reported with the use of this system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112436632">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659112436632">9</xref></sup>. Moreover, its use does not require any authorization and the monitoring of anticoagulation per CPB is not subject to any current recommendations in France<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659112436632">10</xref></sup>. This study was conducted at the University Hospital of Amiens independently of the Medtronic firm.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We found a male predominance with a sex ratio of 1.93 (29 men and 15 women). The mean age was 70 ± 11 years and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 27 ± 5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267659112436632">Table 1</xref>). There was no difference between the two groups concerning the preoperative biological data, especially for the antithrombin rate: 92 ± 13% for the control group and 88 ± 11% for the HMS group (p = 0.34). Similarly, the hemoglobin rate before surgery was similar across the two groups (p = 0.73) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267659112436632">Table 2</xref>). The surgical procedures performed in each cohort were similar. Coronary bypass surgery (CABG) was the most frequent procedure, performed on 45.4% of the control group and 50% of the HMS group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0267659112436632">Table 3</xref>). We found that 13.6% of the procedures were urgent. Two redo procedures were included in our series (one in each group). There was no difference between the two groups regarding CPB, aortic cross-clamping, or procedure time. Similarly, there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the total intraoperative fluid perfusion: 1268 ± 573 ml for the HMS group and 1616 ± 627 ml for the control group (p = 0.31 ). However, there was a significant difference between the surgical closure times: the patients in the HMS group had a closure time significantly shorter than the patients in the control group, with 42 ± 15 minutes in the former and 68 ± 27 minutes in the latter (p = 0.001 ). There was no significant difference between the control group and the HMS group for the initial doses of heparin (24,272 IU ± 4,832 vs. 22,068 ± 5,542 IU - p = 0.17), the mean doses of heparin re-injection (1,684 ± 2,358 IU vs. 1,572 ± 2787 IU - p = 0.9) or the total (23,231 ± 5,647 vs. 26,131 ± 4,617 IU - p = 0.5). Patients treated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) preoperatively received a slightly higher, though not significant, dose of heparin (27,250 ± 3,100 IU for patients treated with LMWH/ 23,920 ± 5,580 IU for patients not treated with LMWH - p = 0.09). There was a highly significant difference between the two groups for the initial protamine dose (13,827 IU ± 3877 vs. 24,777 ± 4,305 IU) and total (14,190 ± 3,470 IU vs. 24,777 ± 4,305 IU) (p = 0001). Therefore, the ratio of protamine/heparin was significantly lower in the HMS group (0.62 ± 0.13 vs. 1 ± 0.11) (p = 0.0001). The bleeding volume observed in the HMS group was significantly reduced compared to the control group. The total bleeding volume amounted to 804 ± 29 ml in the HMS group versus 1416 ± 1103 in the control group (p = 0.016). Univariate analysis of postoperative bleeding found that age (p = 0.003), preoperative hemoglobin rate (p = 0.001), CABG (p = 0.02), platelet count (p = 0.03) and the non-use of the Hepcon/HMS (p = 0.016) were factors significantly associated with bleeding. In multivariate linear regression analysis, only two independent factors were significantly associated with bleeding: the non-use of the Hepcon/HMS (OR = 0.1 - p = 0.03) and the preoperative hemoglobin rate (OR = 1.4 - p = 0.05). During the preoperative period, six patients (14 units) in the control group and five patients (12 units) in the HMS group (p = 0.5) received red blood cell transfusion. Within the first 72 postoperative hours, 11(32 units) patients in the control group and four patients (11units) in the HMS group (p = 0.054) received red blood cell transfusions. The total number of red blood cell transfusions amounted to 46 units in the control group and 23 units in the HMS group (p = 0.05). The average number of red blood cells transfused within the first 72 hours after surgery was 1.04 ± 1.5 units for the HMS group and 2.1 ± 1.87 units in the control group (p = 0.05). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding the transfusion of platelets or fresh frozen plasma. In univariate analysis, two factors were found to be associated with a decrease in red blood cell transfusion: age (p = 0.02) and the HMS protocol (p = 0.05). The CPB time also tended to decrease the red blood transfusion (p = 0.058). Those three factors were included in the multivariate analysis, which did not find any independent factors associated with an increase of red blood cell transfusion. The clinical postoperative complications onset was similar in the two groups, particularly concerning MI (1 pt for each group), supraventricular arrhythmia onset (HMS group 22% vs control group 28% - p=0.45) and the usefulness of vasopressor drugs (HMS group n=5 vs control group n=9 - p=0.33),</p>

<title>Cost effectiveness of the Hepcon/HMS Device</title>
<p>We conducted a cost study by approximating the extra cost and the potential savings achievable with the Hepcon/HMS system. The additional cost included the costs of the devices and the consumables. The main saving was the 23 units of red blood cells for the HMS group (46 units in the control group vs. 23 units in the HMS group) which involved a cost saving of about 6500 dollars. The cost of disposables when using the HMS for the 22 patients amouted about to 1500 dollars. Finaly, the total cost saving amounted to 5000 dollars (230 dollars/patient).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This comparative study showed a significant difference in postoperative bleeding between the control and the HMS groups. The data in the literature did not show a consensus concerning postoperative bleeding and the use of the Hepcon/HMS device. Aziza et al. performed a review of the literature and selected 14 papers: the studies selected did not show any differences concerning postoperative bleeding, but did have numerous biases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112436632">8</xref></sup>. Indeed, the studies of Yamanishi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112436632">11</xref></sup>, Sakurada et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659112436632">12</xref></sup>, and Shigeta et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659112436632">13</xref></sup>, only included a small number of patients; 32, 34 and 34, respectively. Those small cohorts did not allow for the finding of a significant difference. Similarly, for the studies of Yamanishi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112436632">11</xref></sup> and Sakurada et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659112436632">12</xref></sup> (cited in the Journal of the Manchester team), the articles were only available in Japanese. Koster et al. published a prospective, randomized study including 200 patients, which did not show any significant differences for bleeding during the first twelve postoperative hours (p = 0.11)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267659112436632">14</xref></sup>. It is interesting to note that the population included by Koster differed from those included in our study: combined and redo procedures, and patients treated with antiplatelet drugs ten days before surgery were not included in their study, whereas they were in ours. Patients treated with Aspégic® and Plavix®, and combined coronary and valvular procedures were included in our study. These data suggest that the titration method using an HMS device would be most efficient for treating bleeding in high risk patients, which is contrary to the findings of Koster<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267659112436632">14</xref></sup>. Despots et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659112436632">15</xref></sup>, in a study of 254 patients, found that use of the controller HMS device was associated with a significant reduction in bleeding in the first four hours postoperatively, and similar results were found in our study. Conversely, Beholz et al. reported excessive bleeding from the HMS group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659112436632">16</xref></sup>. However, this study included heterogeneous patients, particularly those administered with an antifibrinolytic drug (aprotinin)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659112436632">17</xref></sup>. A more recent study, published in 2008, showed no difference between the two systems concerning postoperative bleeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267659112436632">18</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="section10-0267659112436632">
<title>Protamine/heparin ratio</title>
<p>The protamine dose was significantly lower in the HMS group than in the control group, which resulted in a significant reduction in the protamine/heparin ratio for the HMS group. Similar results were found in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112436632">8</xref></sup>. After the protamine injection, the ACT control was close to the pre-CPB ACT control in both groups, showing an adequate antagonization in the HMS group, despite a decreased protamine/heparin ratio. There are several advantages related to reduced doses of protamine: fewer deleterious effects of protamine (anaphylaxis, hypotension, pulmonary hypertension,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267659112436632">19</xref></sup> and less bleeding). Despotis et al. showed that heparin and protamine doses, and especially the protamine/heparin ratio, are the main factors influencing the postoperative bleeding and transfusion requirements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267659112436632">20</xref></sup>. Shigeta et al. showed that reduced protamine dosage resulted in decreased platelet activation and significantly increased the recovery of platelet function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659112436632">13</xref></sup>. The same results were found in vivo by Griffin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267659112436632">21</xref></sup> who evaluated platelet aggregation at different concentrations of protamine and heparin. A longer period of platelet aggregation and thrombus formation was observed with high doses of protamine (protamine/heparin 1/1 ratio). Nielsen G et al. showed that protamine has an antiplatelet effect which works by inhibiting the formation of thrombin. The clinical benefits that may be associated with reducing the dose of protamine and the protamine/heparin ratio are: less perioperative bleeding related to reduced platelet dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659112436632">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267659112436632">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267659112436632">23</xref></sup> and a shorter surgical closure time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659112436632">15</xref></sup>. Therefore, it seems appropriate to reduce the protamine dose to close to the minimum necessary in order to lower the incidence of bleeding complications.</p>

<title>Intraoperative and postoperative transfusion</title>
<p>The present study found a significant decrease in red blood cell transfusions after cardiac surgery. It is particularly difficult to analyze these results because transfusion is a factor that is related to local practices. A recent prospective study has also highlighted the differences in transfusion practices after cardiac surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267659112436632">24</xref></sup>. The Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists Guidelines recommends the establishment of written protocols in order to reduce transfusion requirements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267659112436632">25</xref></sup>. Avidan et al. compared the transfusion rate in two groups of patients who underwent CABG with CPB, in whom transfusion was either left to the discretion of the physician or was subject to a strict algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267659112436632">23</xref></sup>. The transfusion rate was significantly lower in the group for which the protocol was applied, whereas there were no differences concerning the postoperative bleeding between the two groups. Despotis et al. highlighted the real benefits that could be expected if the transfusion in cardiac surgery followed a well-defined algorithm, with transfusion protocols validated and regularly updated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659112436632">15</xref></sup>. A saving of 900 blood units per year could be achieved with only a 10% reduction in transfusion rate. We report similar results with the Hepcon/HMS device. This is important because each blood transfusion could encounter several complications, including sepsis and oxygen depletion in 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), with an increased risk of splanchnic ischemia. Allogeneic blood transfusion also increases the inflammatory response after cardiac surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0267659112436632">26</xref></sup>. Leal-Noval et al. also showed that the infection and early mortality rates after cardiac surgery were proportional to the number of red blood cells transfused perioperatively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267659112436632">27</xref></sup>, particularly in regard to the occurrence of pneumonia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0267659112436632">28</xref></sup>. This is probably due to the red blood cells, which could increase the rate of anti-inflammatory cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0267659112436632">29</xref></sup>. Transfusion would otherwise impair the functioning of T-cells in contact with the leukocytes of the recipient’s donor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0267659112436632">30</xref></sup>. In light of these studies, the advantage of reducing the number of blood transfusions is two-fold: firstly to reduce morbidity and mortality, and secondly to save money.</p>

<sec id="section12-0267659112436632">
<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>There are some limitations to this study: the lack of randomization, the small numbers of patients in the cohorts (which may reduce the statistical value of the study) and the lack of some postoperative data (the protamine re-injection in the ICU, the use of Minirin®) for the HMS group).</p>
<p>In summary, during cardiac surgery under CPB, heparin and protamine titration with the Hepcon/HMS device predicted a lower protamine dose, a decreased postoperative bleeding without a higher risk of thromboembolic events, a decreased perioperative red blood cell transfusion rate and a shorter chest closure time.</p>
