<p>In the 27 countries in the EU (EU-27), 65% of households have Internet access and 56% have broadband. In the UK these figures are 71% and 69%, respectively. In the EU-27 18–24 age group virtually identical numbers of men and women (87% and 88%, respectively) use the Internet at least once a week, and in the 25–54 age group the figures are 70% (men) and 66% (women). In the UK over 80% of the 18–24 age group access the Internet every day and even in Romania (the lowest of the EU-27) more than 40% of the 18–24 age group access the Internet daily. High levels of formal education have, as would be expected, higher levels of Internet access, with 97% of the EU-27 16–24 age group with higher educational levels accessing the Internet at least once a week. All of the above figures are Eurostat data from 2009 (Eurostat Data in focus 46/2009).</p>
<p>It is thus of interest that in Jordan in 2009 nearly 90% of nursing students on a degree course see no need for a computer at home, and nearly 84% do not have one at home. Could it be that nurses are a group that are not computer literate? Are they scared of computers? Do they not use them? Well none of this is true in the UK, and has not been for many years. In October 2006 I surveyed all of our first-year diploma and degree (baccalaureate) students in my university, with 151 responses. These were a little older than the Jordanian students with a median of 23, although the mode was 19 with a long tail of older students in their late twenties, thirties and forties. Virtually all used the Web (98.6%) and 71% most days; 99.3% had used email, and 57.2% most days. Finally 93.1% were confident or very confident using computers.</p>
<p>All of this underlines the different situation in Jordan, where even in 2009 only about a third of the nursing degree students (34.2%) used email and three fifths (60.3%) the Web. Bear in mind that the UK sample of 2006 were largely diploma students (over 80% of the sample) on a lower course academically than the Jordanians. If you think this is something to do with the UK courses being higher than Jordanian ones, forget it! Jordan, like Ghana, has a similar level of higher education as the UK and the national agency who evaluate overseas courses, UK NARIC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.naric.org.uk">http://www.naric.org.uk</ext-link>), accept their qualifications as equivalent. This is not necessarily true of other countries, many qualifications (including from the US) are not considered as good as their UK counterparts.</p>
<p>I think Jordan is not far behind the UK in terms of information technology. In 1994 I contacted three mainstream nursing journals to suggest they consider an online format. None responded, and on follow-up by telephone it was clear they thought I was barking mad. They could not comprehend why nurses would access a computer network to get information, nor why a nursing journal would go online. A year later one journal (<italic>Nursing Standard</italic>) asked me to set up an online presence. So 14 years ago no UK nursing journal had an online format other than <italic>Nursing Standard</italic> (started April 1996). We have come a long way since: it would seem inconceivable not to have a Web presence for any journal now. Jordan is just on the cusp, with many of their students using information technology, but with a majority unsure. Do a survey even in 2 years time and the situation will be very different.</p>
