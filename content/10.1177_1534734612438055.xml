<abstract>
<p>The objective was to determine if new technology could provide feedback to the clinician when a 10<italic>g</italic> force had been delivered. Using a novel electronic force sensor, clinical longevity and the potential for reduced force delivery were assessed under laboratory conditions. Subsequent inter- and intrareliability data were generated and compared with the existing World Health Organization clinical standard (10<italic>g</italic> monofilament). A total of 20 subjects were trained in the use of the 10<italic>g</italic> monofilament (Bailey Instruments, Salford Quays, UK) and prototype electronic force sensor (Exsensus, UK). A total of 2000 applications (n = 100 per subject) were administered to a calibrated target at a controlled rate, while time and force histories were captured on a digital storage oscilloscope and data recorder for statistical analysis. Engineering standards in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials were applied throughout the experiment. No significant differences in mean peak, median peak, interquartile range, and total range of pressure forces were observed for the electronic force sensor. Alternatively, significant differences for mean and median peak forces were present in the 10<italic>g</italic> monofilament (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 and <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Post hoc analysis further showed the monofilament to degrade significantly at ≤30 applications (<italic>P</italic> = .013). Forces delivered by the electronic force sensor appear to be significantly less susceptible to mechanical variability than those provided by monofilaments, thus increasing longevity. Similarly, this new technology provides objective feedback as to when the device is functioning correctly and potentially negates the need for fiber rest periods.</p>

<body>
<p>The rising incidence of diabetes continues to be of global concern with 346 million diagnosed cases and a predicted doubling of the death rate by 2030.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612438055">1</xref></sup> While this chronic condition and its complications expand, the economic investment within the health care sector is set to face notable challenges.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734612438055">2</xref></sup> Indeed, diabetic foot disease continues to be a major cause of amputation, with a global rate of 1 every 30 seconds and substantial costs to developed economies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612438055">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612438055">4</xref></sup> Against such a dynamic background, the clinical ability to screen effectively and reliably for sensory deficit appears to have stalled.</p>
<p>A key clinical challenge is to determine whether a monofilament is fit for purpose, as there remains no objective indicator as to when its life span has expired. This seeming lack of progress poses somewhat of an irony, as Dr Sidney Weinstein introduced the use of nylon fiber as an improvement over varying diameters of horse hair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612438055">5</xref></sup> Hence, the current test and equipment was borne out of the need to embrace new technology, specifically to improve neurosensory testing.</p>
<p>Extensive study has demonstrated the value of the 10<italic>g</italic> monofilament test for increased risk of ulceration, but noted significant decay in delivered force within commercial-grade 10<italic>g</italic> monofilaments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612438055">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612438055">7</xref></sup> Accordingly, it was recommended that a fiber be rested after 100 compressions to permit recovery. Yet there remains no practical method of judging the work history of a particular device. In the absence of an effective regime to ensure that rested monofilaments are readily identifiable, the quality of diabetic foot screening will be impaired.</p>
<p>This issue is potentially compounded by the absence of a feedback mechanism as to when the test has been accurately administered, relying instead on operator subjectivity. The importance of under-applied forces has yet to be fully considered, but may lead to increased false positive responses. While a grossly deformed monofilament is readily identified, the earlier subtle changes through fatigue have a notable effect on mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734612438055">8</xref></sup> Similarly, there is a point where resting for 24 hours will have no clinical benefit,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612438055">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612438055">7</xref></sup> marring specificity. One method for determining clinical efficacy would be to calibrate the device after each session. However, given the lack of suitable technical resources and clinical time, this approach is not practical.</p>
<p>The absence of an evidence base further suggests that clinical variation in the cleaning of a monofilament device is probable. This is of particular concern, given that a single monofilament may be used on multiple patients, so increasing the potential for cross-infection. Therefore, an obvious countermeasure is to apply an alcohol wipe prior to use. Yet, despite the paucity of clinical evidence, extensive study within material science has demonstrated the effects of spirit on polymeric structures, such as the monofilament. Indeed, the resultant evaporation creates a “super cooling” effect and thereby, changes the mechanical properties of the fiber and in turn its potential reliability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612438055">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734612438055">8</xref></sup> As these structural changes would not be immediately apparent to the clinician, testing efficacy could well be impaired.</p>
<p>In contrast, the electronic force sensor exploits Hooke’s law,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734612438055">9</xref></sup> allowing it to convert spring movement into an electrical signal, which is compared with known values. Clinically, this principle allows the tester to apply the device to a given site, enabling it to calculate observed displacement and display a green light when a 10<italic>g</italic> force is present. Forces exceeding 11<italic>g</italic> produce a flashing red light, indicating an erroneous test, whereas forces below 10<italic>g</italic> fail to illuminate any light. Generated forces are measured in real time and displayed to the operator using these discreet visual indicators, with all signals obscured from the patient. Potentially, this strategy provides improved reliability, repeatability, and longevity because of inherent kinematic advantages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734612438055">10</xref></sup> Furthermore, if reliability and validity is comparable to the current clinical standard, it could provide a step toward an integrated approach for screening via telemedicine, which cannot be facilitated by current equipment.</p>
<p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the inter- and intrareliability of this novel technology against the current clinical standard to ascertain whether longevity and operator feedback can be improved.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>A total of 20 subjects were trained in the use of the 10<italic>g</italic> monofilament and electronic force sensor by a clinician versed in the application of both devices. Prior to inclusion, both devices had to be used with equal ability to the principal investigator’s satisfaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1534734612438055">
<title>Equipment</title>
<p>A 10 mm<sup>2</sup> rubber target was attached to a modified HVLab Tactile Vibrometer (ISVR, UK), with applied forces measured by 4 strain gauges bonded to a steel diaphragm. Signals were amplified and low-pass filtered at 20 Hz (8-pole Butterworth) before analog-to-digital conversion at 200 samples per second. All equipment was calibrated with a 10.2 g reference weight traceable to national standards. The measurement range was +60.7 g, with a resolution of 0.3 g because of stray sound pressure waves.</p>
<p>The force target was fixed vertically, its height variable between 350 and 400 mm above the test bench. Meanwhile, all applied forces were monitored by a digital storage oscilloscope, isolated from the subjects to prevent visual bias.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1534734612438055">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The target was adjusted to subjects’ satisfaction and force was applied at a rate of 1 cycle every 6 seconds, paced by an audible 350 Hz tone. Rate of application was based on a previous study, which employed an automated test fixture with a 2-second application cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612438055">6</xref></sup> This was modified to include a further 4-second lag to more accurately reflect the clinical environment, that is, patient response, notation of the result, and selection of the next site. After familiarization, each subject made 50 applications per device in 5 groups (runs) of 10 cycles with a 1-minute rest period between recordings. The data set comprised 100 applications per participant, that is, 2000 measurements in total. To negate bias, 50% of the sample population started with the 10<italic>g</italic> monofilament and the balance with the electronic force sensor.</p>
<p>A new 10<italic>g</italic> monofilament, type CH533 (Bailey Instruments, Salford Quays, UK), was issued to subjects and precycled 5 times before recording. Meanwhile, because of the early development stage of the electronic force sensor, a single experimental prototype was used throughout, thus it was required to deliver 1000 applications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734612438055">Figure 1</xref>). Prior to use, all devices were calibrated relative to the test equipment.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Statistics were computed for peak forces within each run of 10 cycles and were adjusted for the electronic force sensor to discount any overload signals, which were subsequently repeated by the participant. Initially, the mean forces delivered by both devices were broadly similar with loads slightly in excess of calibration at 10.7<italic>g</italic> and 10.5<italic>g</italic> for the monofilament and the electronic force sensor, respectively. However, from run 3 onward, there was a notable trend in both devices; an increase in delivered force with the electronic force sensor and a similar reduction in the 10<italic>g</italic> monofilament. Statistical analysis performed using SPSS, version 16, indicated significant differences for the monofilament for both mean and median peak forces, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .021 and <italic>P</italic> = .009; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534734612438055">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Post hoc analysis using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was employed to identify the extent and location of variance against the initial values for each device, this being consistent with previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612438055">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612438055">7</xref></sup> Significant differences were revealed for the monofilament for both mean and median peak forces, when comparing run 1 with run 3 and run 5, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534734612438055">Table 1</xref>). Conversely, no significant differences for the electronic force sensor were observed, although the analysis of run 1 to run 5 was borderline (<italic>P</italic> = .052). When matching the 2 devices, highly significant differences in both the interquartile and total range of forces were present (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), while significant differences for both mean and median peak forces were shown when comparing run 1 with run 5 (<italic>P</italic> = .028). This result could be attributed to the bidirectional deviations observed in both devices in the latter test stages, that is, the monofilament’s reduction in force against the electronic force sensor’s corresponding increase.</p>
<p>Finally, Kruskal–Wallis tests for independent samples were conducted to identify differences between the subjects. As such, it was shown that highly significant differences for mean and median peak forces were present in both devices (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534734612438055">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, the monofilament was shown to exhibit a highly significant difference for the total range of peak force (<italic>P</italic> = .001) compared with the electronic force sensor (<italic>P</italic> = .061).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings from this study indicate that the prototype electronic force sensor demonstrated increased longevity, performing 1000 applications without any significant difference in delivered forces. This result compares favorably to the 50 applications for each brand new monofilament, where significant variation was evident. When set in context, it should be noted that both devices demonstrated &lt;5% (0.5<italic>g</italic>) hysteresis for both mean and median peak force. This infers that both devices remain sufficiently accurate for clinical use, given previous study examining the 10<italic>g</italic> monofilament’s role in the prediction of ulceration risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612438055">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612438055">7</xref></sup> What remains notable is the electronic force sensor’s apparent 10-fold increase in clinical life, based on the recommendations of previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612438055">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our investigation suggests that further development of the electronic force sensor prototype would be advantageous, as preliminary trials clearly demonstrated equal performance to the 10<italic>g</italic> monofilament and in certain areas, superiority. For example, in the intrareliability analysis, the monofilament produced significant differences in applied forces at ≤30 applications (<italic>P</italic> = .013) and ≤50 applications (<italic>P</italic> = .030), respectively. In a clinical context, this would require a rested monofilament to be employed every 3 to 5 patients, in order to mitigate false-positive/erroneous risk diagnosis. Such an approach will invariably increase both screening cost and time; a contentious issue, given the existing demand versus service provision ratio.</p>
<p>As an example, a diabetic foot clinic of 20 patients would ideally require 7 monofilaments at a total cost of around £135 ($210). Although these devices can be reused, they must be rested for a minimum of 24 hours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612438055">6</xref></sup> requiring a higher total quantity of devices to be made available and critically, a strict rotation protocol to ensure fitness for purpose throughout the week. Yet the same task could be performed by the electronic force sensor at an estimated cost of £60 ($95) to include 20 replacement probes. The capital element is fixed and requires only replacement probes (£0.50 [$0.80] each) for future patient use. Such an approach may represent increased efficacy and value for money, particularly within primary care.</p>
<p>Additionally, our data provide a potentially new insight into the area of over- and underapplication of force. Although the mechanical principles of the monofilament (area moment of inertia) make overapplication unlikely, our findings suggest a degree of freedom. Indeed, mean peak forces ranged up to 13<italic>g</italic> for one participant using the monofilament, that is, 30% surfeit. Random error can be discounted, as further review of the data suggested that a number of participants demonstrated a trend toward consistent over- or underapplication of force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534734612438055">Figure 2</xref>). If this were replicated in a clinical setting, such behavior could lead to false-negative results and a potential failure to identify the at risk foot.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1534734612438055-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<p>One explanation for this outcome is the manufacturing process, causing slight variation in threshold moments prior to buckle. Additionally, the 10<italic>g</italic> monofilament may be susceptible to the dynamic stresses exerted by human operators. This influence is not merely restricted to the amount of force applied but also to its rate of delivery. Indeed, human error would corroborate the statistical findings, which showed the monofilament to produce the greatest range of force between participants (<italic>P</italic> = .001). Although both manufacturing and material variation cannot be discounted as potential contributory factors, our study nonetheless shows that the highest and lowest mean peak forces measured were delivered by monofilaments. Regardless of the source of error, be it human or machine, this result emphasizes the need to evolve tools that seek to reduce bias.</p>
<p>This study further highlighted a lack of standardization between manufacturers with respect to monofilaments’ fiber diameter. Consequently, as the current testing protocol requires all fibers to achieve a 1-cm buckle, this will lead to variation in delivered pressure at the plantar surface in accordance with Pascal’s law.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734612438055">9</xref></sup> Although a clinician may still apply a 10<italic>g</italic> force, the resultant pressure stimulus will vary as to fiber diameter and not necessarily an impairment of the sensory pathway. Clearly, further investigation is required to fully determine the impact of this on diabetic foot screening. In an attempt to minimize this influence, the electronic force sensor probe was designed to represent the mean diameter of clinical and research grade fibers, all of which have previously demonstrated clinical reliability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612438055">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, the prototype electronic force sensor is not without its flaws. Analysis of the time histories shows that the device suffered losses during run 5, resulting in a slight increase in the amount of force required to trigger the green light. Further interrogation of the data revealed that this event was largely due to the selected electromechanical architecture (piezo diaphragm). When excited, a piezo diaphragm produces a transient electrical charge, which varies as to time and displacement. Hence, as the duration of applied force is extended, so the electrical output reduces. To overcome this problem, increasing force is required to generate the desired voltage, thus explaining the observed variation.</p>
<p>Following this investigation, the design error has been removed and replaced with a novel active force transducer, which continuously monitors spring displacement and automatically adjusts for time and target force. As such, later examples of the electronic force sensor are no longer subject to temporal variation and can be readily programmed to provide variable forces and intervals, that is, an automated grading scale. Moreover, to improve overall kinetic performance, a replaceable bearing and probe assembly has been introduced. This modification is thought to have potential clinical benefits, as these parts could be readily gamma irradiated and supplied in blister packs to mitigate bacterial transmission.</p>
<p>Given the above event, we further noted that the existing clinical protocol is incapable of precluding temporal variation, that is, 1-second application, in the monofilament as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534734612438055">Figure 2</xref>). The relevance from a screening perspective is yet to be determined, but some insight may be gained from previous work into the validity of sharp (Neurotip) detection in the diabetic foot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734612438055">11</xref></sup> Indeed, this study used the Neuropen device to administer the sharp test, which uses a rapid fire spring mechanism combined with a monofilament fiber at the opposite end. The findings revealed that sensitivity was highest for the Neurotip when compared with the 10<italic>g</italic> monofilament (91.8% and 87.8%, respectively). However, when these testing modalities were combined, the sensitivity was 82%.</p>
<p>Consequently, if the purpose of the 10<italic>g</italic> test is to elicit whether a protective response is present, the protocol should be a rapid, not a prolonged delivery of stimulus. To date, this aspect has been undetermined, but it potentially corroborates previous studies that advocate the need to use the monofilament in combination with other validated methods, that is, 128 Hz tuning fork or sharp/pin prick test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734612438055">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534734612438055">13</xref></sup> It could be suggested that temporal parameters might further explain the relatively low specificity of the monofilament against the Neuropathy Disability Score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534734612438055">14</xref></sup> Indeed, test duration could potentially affect the stimulation of receptors and subsequent neurological response. Therefore, further investigation could parallel work which sought to quantify the sensory perception threshold for the monofilament for both normal and at risk feet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534734612438055">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534734612438055">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study demonstrates that the electronic force sensor delivers more repeatable forces than the 10<italic>g</italic> monofilament, while increasing longevity without diminishing clinical reliability. Consequently, these findings suggest that technological advance may prove a valuable ally in the future management of diabetic foot disease. Indeed, assuming the electronic force sensor is properly developed in accordance with the Medical Device Directive and BS EN ISO 13485, phase 1 clinical trials should be pursued to expedite its early adoption.</p>
<p>At present, forces delivered by the 10<italic>g</italic> monofilament differ significantly at &lt;50% of the recommended life (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05), marring the clinician’s ability to identify the at risk diabetic individual without additional controls. Although the sample population (n = 20) is relatively small, highly significant differences observed in the 10<italic>g</italic> monofilament underline the inherent mechanical flaws and affirm the need for improvement.</p>
