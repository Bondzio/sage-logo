<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One consequence of the U.S. “war on terror” has been the stigmatization of Islam, a religion that many Americans have come to routinely associate with terrorism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091829612475163">Chan-Malik, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091829612475163">Rana, 2011</xref>). In this increasingly polarized context, relations between Christianity and Islam have become matters of vigorous debate among theologians, mission historians, church leaders, and missionaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091829612475163">Cimino, 2005</xref>). Indeed, as the scale and frequency of transnational interactions, including church partnerships, pastoral exchanges, humanitarian service work, and proselytization, bring more American Christians into contact with Muslims at home and abroad, these ongoing debates have acquired greater urgency (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0091829612475163">Taylor and Hoke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091829612475163">Johnstone 2011</xref>). In this article, I attend to the discourses of a diverse and growing body of transnational Christian actors who are engaging with Islam through short-term mission practice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0091829612475163">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>While all types of mission efforts to Muslims have increased, the short-term segment, with its fusion of voluntarism, tourism, and evangelism, represents a new and, in light of the restrictions on Christian mission in Muslim regions, surprising paradigm for mission in Muslim contexts. It attracts participants of all ages but has become a staple within Christian youth culture in the U.S., largely among self-identified evangelical Protestants but also among mainline Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox communities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0091829612475163">2</xref></sup> Since its popularization in the 1960s and 1970s, U.S. short-term mission practice has focused mainly on Latin American and Caribbean destinations, working with local Christian churches at those sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0091829612475163">Wuthnow, 2009</xref>: 164–75; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0091829612475163">Offutt, 2011</xref>). Participants’ goals have tended to focus more on deepening their own faith through cross-cultural fellowship with other Christians and less on the conversion of non-Christians (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091829612475163">Priest, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0091829612475163">Trinitapoli and Valsey, 2009</xref>). While those destinations and goals continue to predominate, interests in mission opportunities in the Middle East and South Asia and among Muslim communities elsewhere have grown as has the diversity in styles of mission engagement, which are moving from direct evangelization toward witness, dialogue, humanitarian service, and a variety of “insider movements,” including messianic mosques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091829612475163">Ali, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091829612475163">Gallaher, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091829612475163">Grafas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091829612475163">Higgins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0091829612475163">Parshall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0091829612475163">Priest et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0091829612475163">Snodgrass, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0091829612475163">Travis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0091829612475163">Woodberry, 2011b</xref>). As missiologist J. Dudley Woodberry writes, “The most significant missions’ development since 9/11 has been the increased number of students who want to be missionaries to Muslims” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0091829612475163">Woodberry, 2011b</xref>: 3). While such attitudes may account for shifting patterns in career missions (though this remains to be demonstrated), how do such concerns inform short-term missions? How do representations of Islamic otherness inform—or collide with—the encounters that volunteers negotiate? How does the experience of that encounter relate to its theological framing? And what are the effects of short-term mission activity among Muslims?</p>
<p>This article examines how short-term mission projects frame Islamic “Otherness” and create zones of contact between Christianity and Islam in their efforts to engender identity-in-difference with Muslims.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0091829612475163">3</xref></sup> As I use it here, “identity-in-difference” refers to the conjunction of shared Christian identity and the attention to differences (cultural, linguistic, racial, and political) that such identification must negotiate. In short-term missions, as in other contemporary paradigms, mission practices are predicated on the notion that Christian commonality, in some form, can be engendered in spite of difference, and that it embraces this diversity. Strategies pursued on the ground exist within a theologically informed spectrum, from conversionist to ecumenical styles. Although mission strategies derive from theological orientations espoused by sponsors and by participants themselves, they are also negotiated in accordance with conditions that include a compressed mission period and participants’ limited linguistic competence and training, as well as in-country restrictions on evangelization. In this article, I document short-term mission projects’ engagement with Islam by showing how Islam is represented by agencies in guidebooks and on websites and how volunteers interact with Muslims. I argue that styles of representing and engaging with Islam arise from and shape a range of theological orientations, thus contributing to religious diversity in the U.S.A., especially among evangelical Protestants.</p>
<p>This article is based on research, carried out in Southern California between 2009 and 2012, which included visual and textual content analyses of sending agencies’ websites and guidebooks, and interviews with 57 respondents—short-term-mission-trip leaders, youth participants, and prospective participants—from non-denominational and mainline communities, a subset of whom (14) participated in mission projects with Muslim communities in Europe and the Middle East (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0091829612475163">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0091829612475163">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0091829612475163">Appendix</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0091829612475163">4</xref></sup> Most interviewees, with the exception of prospective participants, had volunteered for two or more short-term mission trips. A total of 27 sponsoring organizations were represented among the 57 respondents and four of those agencies were utilized by respondents who had volunteered in Muslim-majority areas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0091829612475163">5</xref></sup> These agencies—Cru (formerly Campus Crusade for Christ International), InterVarsity Christian Fellowship (IVCF), the Xtreme Team, and IMPACT—designed short-term projects meant to support the efforts of career missionaries, organizations’ in-country staff, and/or local Christians. Two of the agencies (Cru, IVCF) are unaffiliated with specific (denominational or non-denominational) churches and two, the Xtreme Team and IMPACT, are affiliated with mainline bodies, the American Baptist Church and the Presbyterian Church USA, respectively. Both Cru and IVCF recruit participants through chapters based on college and university campuses, sponsoring hundreds of volunteers annually on projects that mix evangelization with service. IMPACT and Xtreme Team are smaller operations, recruiting small teams of volunteers through parent denominations’ mission boards. In this article, I discuss the three agencies—Cru, IVCF, Xtreme Team—for which I have both interview and website data, leaving out IMPACT because I did not interview volunteers for its Turkey trips.</p>

<title>Framing and Engaging Islam in Short-Term Mission</title>
<p>Each agency crafted its own projects and goals, but all relied to some extent on socio-demographic and geographic data from mission databases, especially the Joshua Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.joshuaproject.net">www.joshuaproject.net</ext-link>) and <italic>Operation World</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091829612475163">Mandryk, 2010</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091829612475163">Barrett and Johnson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091829612475163">Barrett et al., 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0091829612475163">6</xref></sup> The latter organizations collect and disseminate qualitative and quantitative data on linguistic, ethnic, social, political, and religious attributes of the world’s population, with a special interest in identifying those regions and communities among whom Christian evangelization has had limited impacts or is non-existent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0091829612475163">7</xref></sup> Although all non-Christian peoples are targets of mission, Muslims attract particular attention because of their numbers. According to Joshua Project statistics, the numbers of Muslim adherents (1,530,529,000) and people-groups are exceeded only by Christian people-groups (6844) and adherents (2,333,534,000), making Islam Christianity’s closest competitor for adherents and thus a prime target for mission (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.joshuaproject.net/10-40-window.php">www.joshuaproject.net/10-40-window.php</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Of the four agencies sampled, Cru demonstrated the most reliance on data gleaned from the Joshua Project and <italic>Operation World</italic> in its presentation of Islam.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0091829612475163">8</xref></sup> Cru lists its ministries on individual country pages that, like the country entries in <italic>Operation World</italic> and Joshua Project pages, feature visual icons (portraits, landscapes, or architectural landmarks), maps, statistics, and brief reports on each country’s level of evangelical adherence and the threats to evangelical expansion. Its visual and textual representations of Islam depict it as an adversarial Other with whom Christian identity-in-difference can only be produced through Muslims’ disavowal of Islam and adoption of a new, Christian identity. In contrast to characterizations of other non-evangelical religious formations (e.g., Buddhism, Catholicism), Islam is routinely depicted in terms of the threats it poses to Christianity. In 5 of the 37 European countries listed, threats included the immigration of Muslims (to France, Finland, Ireland, and Germany) and the persistence of traditional ties to Islam (Bosnia and Herzegovina). The reports for 10 African countries (out of a total of 35) describe Islam as a threat, due to increasing numbers of Muslim adherents, Muslims’ persecution of Christians and Muslims’ seizure of political power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0091829612475163">9</xref></sup> Only one Middle Eastern country—Kuwait—was listed among Cru’s ministry sites and, although lauded because “immigrant religious minorities were permitted to worship,” both its ban on Christian proselytization and its accommodation of Shari’a law were highlighted to emphasize the threats posed by Islam (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cru.org/ministries-and-locations/asia/kuwait">www.cru.org/ministries-and-locations/asia/kuwait</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Along with maps and spiritual climate reports, Cru represents each country within the mission field with portraits of mission subjects, often in stereotypical fashion and attired in distinctive ethnic dress. Predictably, veiled female bodies and turbaned male bodies were employed to signify Muslim regions. Pakistan’s entry, for example, features a portrait of a Muslim man; he is wearing a patterned turban and his gaze meets the viewer’s. Its spiritual climate is described as ominous, for despite constitutional guarantees of religious freedom, “in practice … non-Muslims and non-Sunnis must practice their faith cautiously and under varying degrees of threat from Islamists” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cru.org/ministries-and-locations/asia/pakistan">www.cru.org/ministries-and-locations/asia/pakistan</ext-link>). There are also telling omissions in the presentation of Islam. Its entry on India emphasizes Hindu nationalism’s threats to Christianity, but includes the misleading observation that nationalist violence against India’s Muslims was limited to the early 1990s, when in fact Hindu nationalists’ targeting of Muslims is organized, long-standing, and persistent and has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths in the past decade alone (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cru.org/ministries-and-locations/asia/india">www.cru.org/ministries-and-locations/asia/india</ext-link>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091829612475163">Ghassem-Fachandi, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The text and images of Cru’s website characterize Islam as distant, different, and dangerous. It marks the boundary between the Christianized world and those who remain “unreached” by Christianity and is presented as a high-value target, worthy of the sacrifice of one’s time, comfort, and freedom. Although cursory references to Islam’s tenets can be found, its Abrahamic identity is downplayed, as is Muslims’ own experience of persecution. Instead, Islam is represented as anchoring the unreached of the world and mediated visually and textually in ways that assert its antagonistic relation to Christianity.</p>
<p>These framing images and discourses shaped volunteers’ experiences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0091829612475163">10</xref></sup> Cindy, an Anglo-American college student, who participated in a Cru-sponsored mission trip to a Middle Eastern country, described her campus chapter’s use of Joshua Project data in the context of mission trip recruitment:<disp-quote>
<p>They would tell us, “Hey, this is an unreached part. We know that it’s good to spread the Word to people on campus, but there’s [sic] people abroad who’ve never even heard of it.” … And they used this slideshow … that … showed the statistics about how many people have heard and how many haven’t that starts from “America” down to places, cities where there are zero known Christians. They don’t even know [about Jesus]. So that’s one of the methods that they use to show [that] “We’re not just saying they haven’t heard, really, they haven’t.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Volunteers lacking mission experience were guided toward opportunities in more Christianized regions. As they gained experience and what they called “boldness” in declaring their faith to others, they moved up the ladder to less Christianized destinations. And, while Islamic societies were generally considered among the most resistant to Christianity, there were gradations within this category, with Kuwait’s rigorous adherence to Sunni Islam contrasting with others, such as Turkey, considered only nominally Muslim. While rudimentary information about regional history and society were offered, the focus was on strategy—how to engage Muslims in interactions that would open the door to situationally appropriate forms of evangelization.</p>
<p>Mission practice incorporated these understandings. Volunteers lived in gender-segregated apartments in upscale areas of the cities where they worked and carried out what 21-year-old Peter described as “mission on the down low.” Their official “cover” as they put it was educational/cultural exchange, and some registered as auditors for local university classes. Their stays included visits to tourist sites, but they avoided poorer areas and other sites deemed dangerous. Cindy, quoted above, explained that most days of her two-week 2010 mission trip with Cru began with a brief period of collective worship, after which the students set out in pairs to college campuses and commercial areas of the city where they spent three or four hours striking up conversations with local youths. A typical opening gambit—“Do you speak English?”—would be followed by questions to ascertain the other’s willingness to discuss religious topics; in some circumstances, volunteers relied on the long-standing Cru technique of using written surveys as ice-breakers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091829612475163">Ingram, 1989</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0091829612475163">11</xref></sup> The goal, however, was to create opportunities for subsequent meetings for more targeted conversations using Cru’s pamphlet, <italic>Four Spiritual Laws</italic>, as the guide. In the evenings, the students re-assembled to talk about their day’s activities—what they accomplished and failed to accomplish, what they learned; on some nights, they held worship sessions to which local Christians might be invited.</p>
<p>Although committed to the conversionist imperative of Christianization, both the difficulties encountered in engaging people and interests in more relational styles of outreach departed from the sense of hostility toward Islam imparted by the website materials. Eric, an Anglo-American student who traveled to the Middle East in 2010, acknowledged that because Christianity was associated with force, “in-your-face evangelization would not work.” He continued, “It’s hard for people … to accept Christ right away, mostly we were just trying to build relationships with them, [to allow them to] see what our views are and why we are Christian … Nobody really accepted Christ … but I think we did make lasting relationships.” While Eric’s statements indicated an awareness of the complex political history in which Muslim–Christian relations were embedded, neither he nor any other volunteer elaborated on those issues in interviews. Instead, they traced both the limits and possibilities of engagement to the relative willingness of local youth to engage in conversations on spiritual matters—an openness that they contrasted with Americans’ reticence to engage when approached in a similar manner.</p>
<p>Efforts to bridge socio-political, cultural, and sectarian difference were advocated more explicitly and systematically by the two other agencies (IVCF, Xtreme Team). The aims and language of the Joshua Project were far less in evidence, although references to biblical warrants, such as the Great Commission, can be found on some websites, newsletters, guidebooks, and advertising materials. The language of ecumenism, forged in the 1952 Willingen Conference of the World Council of Churches, is invoked as well.</p>
<p>The visual vocabulary of IVCF’s website imagery underscores the mix of conversionist and ecumenical aims outlined in its stated goal of “relational mission,” that is, mission carried out within a context initiated through friendships and other collaborative interactions and maintained increasingly through electronic communications and social media (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0091829612475163">Stiles and Stiles, 2000</xref>). Visual images posted by IVCF contrasted with the often-stereotypical portraits and landscapes on Cru’s site. IVCF’s galleries comprised shots of mission in practice. The photographs emphasized cooperative relations and affective ties, showing missionaries and local community members constructing buildings, worshiping together, caring for children, providing healthcare, playing soccer, or sightseeing. Accompanying texts reiterated these messages. In Muslim-majority regions—which, in contrast to Cru’s website, were rarely identified as such—mission comprised the “lingua-cultural work” of language acquisition and training and the creation of friendships through “sharing world views” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091829612475163">Pennycook and Makoni, 2005</xref>). In some locales, mission was glossed as “radical incarnational witness.” This was the aim in what was described as a Turkic region of Northwest China (presumably Xinjiang Province).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0091829612475163">12</xref></sup> And, for the Bosnia and Herzegovina trip, students with “strong relational evangelism skills” were sought (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gp.intervarsity.org/projects/bosnia-2012">http://gp.intervarsity.org/projects/bosnia-2012</ext-link>).</p>
<p>IVCF volunteers to Bosnia and Herzegovina were normally stationed in one of two cities, Zenica or Banja Luka—the former a Muslim-dominated city and the latter, Serbian Orthodox—for about four weeks, with trips preceded by several days of training and followed by a few more days of debrief (in Dubrovnic, Croatia). During the pre-trip training, besides trust-building exercises and team orientation, volunteers learned about basic tenets of Islam and about regional history, especially the conflicts that followed Yugoslavia’s break-up. They learned that the latter topics were to be avoided, unless locals introduced them—in which case, their duties were to listen with compassion. Once on site, volunteers followed a daily schedule that mixed structured pursuits (usually English conversation classes) with unstructured follow-up, in which they pursued opportunities to “share their faith” during coffee dates and other informal settings. Jeff, a 23-year-old Anglo-American, explained:<disp-quote>
<p>Most of the time what we’d do during the days is call and text message using the one phone our team had … and say, “Hey, do you want to go to coffee?” ’Cause that’s one of the main social [pastimes]. They just go to a café or restaurant and really slowly drink their coffee and just hang out … So we’d try to meet up and be friends with the people at our English classes.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Liz, an Anglo-American trip leader in her mid-twenties, explained her understanding of IVCF’s relational ministry:<disp-quote>
<p>For our trip it … was both. It was … an even thrust with both relationships and sharing your faith. We develop relationships so that we can share our faith, not that it’s a bait and switch, because we make it very clear: “We’re Christian, we want to talk about this.” … We’re not like doing any shady business, but we develop relationships because that’s how you share. It’s a relational culture.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Like their counterparts in Cru, IVCF volunteers were also pleasantly surprised by Muslim youths’ willingness to engage them on spiritual matters. Liz described her experience with a young Muslim man:<disp-quote>
<p>I had a really, really powerful conversation with one of our friends. He was involved in kind of an equivalent to InterVarsity, but a Muslim student organization … I think he wanted to improve his English too. He basically told us like, “I’m trying to convert you.” And we were like, “Great! We are trying to convert you!” … And we would joke about it and that’s what I love about over there is like, it’s not taboo. In the United States people are like, “Don’t push your religion on me.” But there, I mean, he felt strong enough in his faith that he could talk about it, you know? I’m like “Great.” And we just had this deep trust and relationship with him that it was like, “Let’s get into it. You know.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These conversations often reached an impasse, though volunteers still found the opportunity to engage encouraging. Liz continued,<disp-quote>
 <p>I was having a conversation with him and he was talking about justice and he said, “God is just, therefore he has to keep track of all the good I do and all the bad I do because, since he’s just he can’t let these bad things go unnoticed, and God is constantly recording it. And then when I die I’ll find out if the good outweighed the bad.” And I just looked him in the eyes, and I said, “That sounds really scary.” And he said, “Yeah it is.” And he said, “I walk the line between fear and hope every day,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0091829612475163">13</xref></sup> and I just looked at him and I was speechless and I’m like, “Oh my gosh!” And I was looking at him as a friend with compassion, and then I explained, “I think God is just also.” And he’s like, “Really?” And I’m like, “Yeah, and let me tell you why, because of Jesus. Jesus was justice; he did pay the price, so now God doesn’t have to keep track because that is justice.” And he’s like, “Uhhhh.” And he didn’t like what he heard … He didn’t have a rebuttal. You know, he just kind of was like, “OK.” Then we started talking about prayers … It was neat, he like recited one of the prayers for me. I said, “Oh it’s really pretty. It sounds like a song.” And he said, “Oh, but it’s not.” … So, occasionally we had to say, “OK, let’s just be friends. Let’s keep it cool.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>IVCF’s relational approach to mission, while sharing Cru’s conversionist aims, ventured further into an exchange of perspectives than did Cru—an approach that was consistent with the relational emphasis found in its guidebooks and website (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091829612475163">Bramadat, 2000</xref>). Chris, a Latino college student, spoke for other IVCF volunteers in admitting that, despite their effort, the Muslim youth with whom he and his team spent time did not “change their hearts, ” even though they had been introduced to “freedom” by being shown that there was “something different from what they were born with.”</p>
<p>The third case, the Xtreme Team, is a short-term mission organization operated by American Baptist International Missions. It differs from other agencies in not providing extended, pre-trip orientation for mission. Indeed, trip destinations are not publicized to potential recruits and are only disclosed after volunteers have begun their trip together; in the course of travel, peer-learning facilitated by adult chaperones is emphasized. Because it fashioned itself as a critique of the colonial mission model, its website told a very different story than Cru about the world’s religious diversity and the role of mission in that world. It modeled mission as an egalitarian cross-cultural encounter, in which youth cross boundaries in order to gain distance from their own cultural norms, discover divinity in unexpected environs, and “learn God’s plan for their own lives.” And, regardless of destination, Xtreme Team’s style of mission practice differed from the more typical short-term menu of Vacation Bible School, skits, and building projects; trips were usually longer (closer to 6 weeks) and mixed homestays with hostel-type accommodations. Volunteers met with persons representative of the diverse composition of the host society, including persons from differing political parties, from different ethnic and religious communities, from urban and rural areas, and from different class backgrounds.</p>
<p>Relationships also provided the medium for engagement with and knowledge of cultural Others in Xtreme Team’s mission practice, although it differed from other agencies in the degree to which it stressed mission’s transformational effects on the team members. Thus, rather than introducing Muslims to Christianity with the aim of conversion, they sought to learn something about Islam and about Egyptian culture and history through immersion in that society. Service projects and shared worship were punctuated by visits to slums, to mosques, and Coptic churches, and to more typical tourist sites. Such approaches were typical regardless of the religious landscape of the host country—thus, unlike Cru or IVCF, their activities were not shaped by restrictions on evangelization, but by the goals of immersive learning. Describing his experience, 20-year-old Dwayne, an African American, concluded,<disp-quote>
 <p>It was different from other mission trips that I had been on because we were letting them tell their stories. It sounds small, but was it was huge in the end. People felt that they had been abandoned or neglected by their big brother … so when an American sat down and said, “tell me your story,” it was huge.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The agency’s 2010 trip to Egypt was illustrated by 97 unique images, all taken by mission team members and posted on the agency’s website after the trip was completed. These included typical travel photos—architectural landmarks (e.g. pyramids), streetscapes, and other features of the built environment, such as churches, mosques, and waterfront industry—as well as portraits of the volunteers themselves in various settings. Thus, rather than having a single visual icon (as in Cru), each country was represented by multiple scenes, refracted through diverse perspectives. This style of mediation was consistent with the ecumenism of their mission practice, which included visiting the religious spaces of different denominations and participating in worship. The text was similarly perspectival, rather than didactic. The web log for Day 19, entitled “Encountering Islam,” was illustrated with a picture of a mosque and accompanied by a brief commentary that began, “Today the team gained more perspective on Islam by visiting mosques and spending time with a Muslim woman.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0091829612475163">14</xref></sup> The writer continued in a freestyle list of the impressions gained from the interaction that began, “Seeing the Lord in Egypt: Care for loved ones, Strength of family.” The mosque was described as “open-aired, reverent, peaceful … grounded.” The contrast with Cru’s language of threat could not be more pronounced.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The examples of Cru, IVCF, and Xtreme Team illustrate the different ways that Islam is framed and engaged in short-term mission practice. To conclude, I consider what these cases might reveal about the direction of contemporary mission voluntarism and its broader effects.</p>
<p>First, these cases alert us to differences in the theological orientations that ground short-term mission voluntarism. Mission projects, past and present, aim to enlarge and extend communities of belief and practice across cultural, geographic, political, and economic boundaries through the realization of identity-in-difference between missionaries and those whom they seek to serve. <italic>How</italic> identity-in-difference is sought varies in accordance with the theological principles to which mission projects (short- and long-term) appeal and the contexts of mission work. In practice, these different emphases form a continuum, with most short-term missions involving varying combinations of ecumenism and conversionism. Conversionist (or evangelistic) aims lie at one end of this continuum. This perspective is represented in Cru and, to a lesser extent, in IVCF, which amalgamates conversionism with humanitarian service. The more ecumenical aims at the other end are exemplified by the Xtreme Team.</p>
<p>As these cases show, both conversionist and ecumenical orientations exist in mission projects focused on Muslims. Despite the limited impacts of Christianization, evangelicals across the theological spectrum attach considerable value and prestige to mission efforts in the Muslim world. For those conversionists who regard Islam as intrinsically antagonistic to Christianity, the rise in Muslim adherence rates is a cause for alarm and serves as a goad for both short- and long-term mission. Cru relied on objectivist tropes to mark Muslims as dangerous adversaries and as targets of proselytization. Its use of images and didactic text on its website and in training sessions build on these foundations by shaping and standardizing volunteers’ expectations about the mission field. They fused spiritual with geopolitical space, creating target objects defined by their distance and difference from the U.S. and from the Christian modernity that they associated with it, fashioning an imaginative space in which the tasks of <italic>producing</italic> identity-in-difference could be undertaken.</p>
<p>In more ecumenically oriented projects, Islam is invoked as a marker of the type of profound cultural difference that mission should bridge through service, dialogue, and witness. As relational partner, the missionary sought to <italic>recognize</italic> identity-in-difference. In IVCF projects, recognition entailed some degree of attention to the specificities of Islam but only insofar as such knowledge paved the way for evangelization. For the Xtreme Team, the attention to historical and cultural specificity was part of the recognition of incarnate divinity in the world. Volunteers’ commentaries as well as website images and texts posted by both agencies were artifacts of both processes.</p>
<p>While these cases suggest more mutability in evangelical subjectivity than dominant stereotypes allow, the commonalities in the ways that agencies framed the mission field and modes of appropriate engagement carry their own internal tensions and may have implications for the effects of mission practice. This brings me to my second set of concluding, and necessarily more speculative, observations. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091829612475163">Brian Howell (2009</xref>: 206–207) has observed, the popularization and routinization of short-term mission has meant that volunteers acquire a limited set of tropes for framing and interpreting their experiences, usually in the course of training, preparatory field projects, website imagery, and post-trip presentations. As a consequence, they may enter and leave the field with a generalized notion of mission as sacrifice, buttressed by perceptions of differences between “us” (wealthy, white, healthy) and “them” (poor, dark, diseased), without acquiring resources to understand the cultural, political, and historical specificities of individual sites and forms of interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091829612475163">Howell, 2009</xref>: 207). Short-term mission projects in Muslim regions are constrained by the same institutional forces that affect other short-term operations and I agree with Howell about their outcomes. Where Muslim-oriented mission projects departed from the norm, however, was in offering new models for thinking about the boundaries between secular and religious realms. Certainly, it was not unusual for volunteers, regardless of destination or agency, to describe their experience as a training ground for acquiring what they termed “boldness” in professing and sharing their faith; moreover, churches and parachurch bodies committed to evangelization have long sought to cultivate such “boldness” among adherents through short-term and temporary mission projects at home and abroad (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091829612475163">Ingram, 1989</xref>). Mission volunteers to Muslim regions, however, discovered in these social spaces new styles for the expression of this “boldness.” In interviews, as noted, volunteers consistently voiced appreciation for the public visibility of religious discourses, images, and practices in Muslim-majority contexts. They remarked on the willingness of youth to reveal their own religious orientations to relative strangers and to engage in conversations on spiritual topics; they took appreciative note of the visual and acoustic signifiers of religious belonging within public realms—from clothing choices to the call to prayer. In effect, they found examples within the space of the Other’s world with which to critique the everyday norms of secularity in U.S.A. that favor discretion and treat religion as a private concern, to be shared with family and like-minded others rather than co-workers or casual acquaintances (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091829612475163">Connolly, 1999</xref>). What effects these experiences may have on the ways that evangelical youth craft public voices and spaces at home remain to be seen. I close by suggesting, however, that the routinization of mission practice among evangelicals through the expansion of short-term mission voluntarism may have implications not only for Christianity’s globalization, but also for the ways that evangelicals envision and remake boundaries between religion and the secular at home.</p>

<p>Its efficacy as a mission paradigm continues to be debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091829612475163">Howell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091829612475163">Koll, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091829612475163">Priest, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0091829612475163">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0091829612475163">Priest et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0091829612475163">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091829612475163">Smith, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0091829612475163">Ver Beek, 2006</xref>). Advocates maintain that, besides its contribution to Christian personhood, synergy exists between short- and long-term styles of mission—that short-term mission operates as a recruitment mechanism and logistical support for career missionaries. Skeptics concede that it may deepen faith, but argue that its moral and financial costs exceed the benefits that it provides.

<p>A 2011 internet search identified 56 national sending organizations. 32 lacked any specific denominational affiliation, 8 were described as either inter- or non-denominational, 13 listed mainline denominational affiliations, and 3 listed affiliations with evangelical denominations. 27 of the 56 national organizations were represented among the respondents’ trip sponsors; 9 described themselves as inter- or non-denominational; 10 listed no specific affiliation; and the remaining 8 included parachurch agencies affiliated with mainline bodies. In addition, many individual churches arrange short-term mission trips for congregants; for example, among the 210 Christian congregations in Santa Barbara County (California), 68 claimed to sponsor some kind of short-term mission trips for members.</p>

<p>The Joshua Project (since 2006 a ministry within the U.S. Center for World Mission) is a “research initiative to highlight ethnic peoples having least followers,” taking its warrant from the Great Commission and from passages in Revelations about the necessity of “preaching the kingdom and assembling all peoples before God’s throne as prelude to Christ’s Second Coming” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.joshuaproject.net">www.joshuaproject.net</ext-link>). Its website hosts interactive databases categorized according to country, religion, “people-group,” and language, which can be mined by users to create cross-referenced reports. “People-group,” which is used synonymously with “ethnic people,” is defined as a “large sociological grouping who perceive themselves to have common affinity” and as the “largest group within which the Gospel can spread as church planting without encountering barriers of understanding or acceptance.” Country and people-group pages include slideshows, with portraits of individuals tagged as “reached,” “unreached,” or “formative,” with additional notes on population statistics, including rates of Christian adherence, human development notes, and “spiritual persecution” indices. Mercator projection maps depict mission targets, using color coding to show degrees of Christian adherence and dominant religious groupings (e.g. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.joshuaproject.net/assets/JPProgressScaleMap.pdf">www.joshuaproject.net/assets/JPProgressScaleMap.pdf</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.joshuaproject.net/10-40-window.php">www.joshuaproject.net/10-40-window.php</ext-link>). The site offers links to other informational resources, maps, ministries, prayer groups, and mission opportunities. <italic>Operation World</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091829612475163">Mandryk, 2010</xref>, originally published in 1974) is cited as the source of much of its statistical information.</p>

<p>Both the Joshua Project and <italic>Operation World</italic> are informed by millennialist theological orientations, notably the expectation that Old Testament covenants will be fulfilled in the near future, with the eventual second coming of Christ preceded in some variants by the Rapture, and a period of conflict known as the Tribulation. The Christianization of the world’s population is understood as a condition that precedes the fulfillment of these covenants. This theology, while by no means new, was re-popularized in the two decades prior to the turn of the twenty-first century and folded into contemporaneous movements, including the “10/40 Window” and “AD 2000 and Beyond” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091829612475163">Bush, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091829612475163">Han, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0091829612475163">McGavran, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091829612475163">Winter and Hawthorne, 2009</xref>), which sought to engage populations categorized as “unreached” by Christianity. The Joshua Project was formed within and later subsumed these movements.</p>
