<p>Despite earlier pessimistic assessments of social dialogue performance in central and eastern Europe, the 2008–2010 downturn in the economy brought an increase in tripartite activity in most new EU Member States. This article seeks to account for this development by analysing the drivers and outcomes of anti-crisis social dialogue in Poland and Bulgaria. It argues that the two countries’ governments staged tripartite negotiations in hard times to demonstrate their adherence to the consensual mode of policy-making. They did this with the expectation that this would boost their popularity and bring them electoral advantage.</p>

Cet article tente d’expliquer cette évolution en analysant les moteurs et les résultats du dialogue social anti-crise en Pologne et en Bulgarie.

<p>Trotz eher pessimistischer Prognosen in Bezug auf den sozialen Dialog in Mittel- und Osteuropa hat der Konjunkturabschwung zwischen 2008 und 2010 in den meisten neuen EU-Mitgliedstaaten zu einer Verstärkung der tripartiten Beratungen geführt. Zur Erklärung dieser Entwicklung untersucht der vorliegende Beitrag die Antriebskräfte und die Ergebnisse des sozialen Dialogs zur Bewältigung der Krise in Polen und Bulgarien. Darin wird geltend gemacht, dass die Regierungen der beiden Länder tripartite Verhandlungen in schwierigen Zeiten inszeniert haben, um zu zeigen, dass sie zu einer konsensuellen Politikgestaltung bereit sind.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The spate of social pacts concluded in Europe since the 1980s has led to renewed research interest in tripartite negotiations. Research has been focused on western Europe, and not without reason: with the exception of Slovenia, central and eastern European (CEE) countries have a poor social dialogue record. Despite the early creation of tripartite bodies, most transition reforms were implemented unilaterally by the government. As a result, corporatism in ‘new’ EU Member States has for long remained ‘more a possibility than a reality’ (Cambáliková, 1996, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1024258913480724">Heinisch, 1999</xref>: 84).</p>
<p>Against this background, the 2008–2010 downturn brought an increase in tripartite activity in CEE countries. In several of them anti-crisis programmes were discussed with the social partners, leading early observers to proclaim ‘the revival of social dialogue’ in the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1024258913480724">Czarzasty, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1024258913480724">Héthy, 2009</xref>). This development, puzzling in light of earlier negative experiences, raises two questions. First, why did CEE governments involve the social partners in drawing up anti-crisis packages? Secondly, do compromises reached during the downturn signify a growing importance of social dialogue in the ex-communist region?</p>
<p>Attempting to answer these queries, this paper examines the drivers and outcomes of crisis-related social dialogue in Poland and Bulgaria. Integrated into the European/global economy in different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1024258913480724">Myant and Drahokoupil, 2012</xref>), the two countries were affected by the downturn differently. For Bulgaria, which had become heavily dependent on financial inflows, the crisis was synonymous with a decrease in construction, spiralling government debt and a growing current account deficit, while Poland, integrated through trade and manufacturing FDI, was hit by declining exports. Despite these differences, the two countries developed a similar, tripartite response to the crisis.</p>
<p>I argue that the crisis-related increase in tripartite activity in Poland and Bulgaria was the result of i) uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the downturn <italic>and</italic> ii) the instability of the two countries’ party systems. Faced with the worsening economic situation on the one hand, and with extreme electoral volatility and/or the presence of opposition parties espousing social principles on the other, the two centre-right governments staged tripartite negotiations to persuade public opinion that they were actively searching for anti-crisis remedies, and that their policies were based on a wider societal compromise. Though this ‘PR corporatism’ boosted the governing parties’ popularity, it failed permanently to improve the quality of social dialogue. Consequently, once the anti-crisis packages moved out of the headlines, politicians returned to neglecting tripartite negotiations, and did not even adhere to previously agreed provisions.</p>
<p>This article is based on social partners’ and government documents, press reports, and 17 interviews with experts and social dialogue participants. It is structured as follows. Section one briefly presents the literature on CEE tripartism. Sections two and three describe Poland’s and Bulgaria’s recent experience with social dialogue, while section four looks at the bargaining outcomes. A brief conclusion is drawn at the end.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1024258913480724">
<title>CEE corporatism: a contradiction in terms?</title>
<p>Judged against western European standards, the achievements of CEE tripartism seem modest. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1024258913480724">Orenstein and Hale (2001</xref>), however, social dialogue in the newly democratized CEE countries fulfilled its original task of ensuring social peace by involving union and business representatives in the policy-making process, and thus made it possible to establish ‘a new capitalist order with a minimum of social unrest’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1024258913480724">Iankova and Turner, 2004</xref>: 85). Tripartite bodies were involved in discussing at least some transition-related social issues. They also lent legitimacy to the social partners and set down rules governing relations between organized interests and the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1024258913480724">Iankova, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Other authors however point to serious problems besetting CEE corporatism. Twenty years after their establishment, the balance of power within CEE tripartite bodies remains tipped towards governments. These tend to dominate tripartite discussions and, even though they are legally obliged to consult the social partners, they do not take their opinions into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1024258913480724">Heinisch, 1999</xref>). The reluctance of CEE political elites to share decision-making powers with societal actors is partly the legacy of the transition period, during which major economic reforms were implemented without regard to popular pressure, often under strict EU and IMF conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1024258913480724">Greskovits, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1024258913480724">Ost, 2001</xref>). CEE social partners have their own weakness to blame for their inability to counter government unilateralism. In the early 1990s, a number of organizations were created from scratch, while others struggled to redefine their role in the new socio-economic setting, often becoming fragmented and/or politicized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1024258913480724">Avdagic, 2003</xref>). Recent studies paint a more balanced picture. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1024258913480724">Bohle and Greskovits (2010</xref>) argue that social dialogue allowed CEE labour to make its voice heard despite its structural weakness, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1024258913480724">Gardawski and Meardi (2010</xref>) claim that even failed ‘pacting’ attempts gave social partners an opportunity to exchange views and fostered social learning. Nevertheless, the authors concede that Polish social dialogue has been ‘mostly a story of failures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1024258913480724">Gardawski and Meardi, 2010</xref>: 388). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1024258913480724">Bohle and Greskovits (2010</xref>) essentially repeat this pessimistic conclusion in relation to the Hungarian and Slovak experiences.</p>
<p>All in all, the literature focuses predominantly on the limitations of CEE tripartism, not addressing the question of under what conditions CEE governments might be willing to include social partners in the policy-making process. In this respect, Poland’s and Bulgaria’s embracing of tripartism in 2009–2010 is particularly noteworthy. The next two sections present the outcomes of the crisis-related social dialogue in the two countries and their post-2010 experience.</p>

<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1024258913480724">2</xref>

It was only after the 1992 strike wave that the so-called Pact on State Enterprise in Transformation regulating social issues related to privatization was concluded. Though 1994 saw the creation of the Tripartite Commission on Socio-economic Issues (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1024258913480724">Table 1</xref> below for membership details), its role remained negligible throughout most of the 1990s due to inter-union rivalry and the weakness of the employer associations. A 2003 attempt at concluding a social pact, undertaken by centre-left Economy minister Hausner, proved equally unsuccessful. Consequently, Poland tends to be considered a ‘tripartite laggard’, a country where tripartite agreements have been rare and narrow in scope.</p>

<p>However, the 2008–2009 crisis raised hopes for an improvement in the quality of social dialogue. After the first signs of the downturn appeared, unions and employers launched consultations on anti-crisis policies, signing an anti-crisis pact outlining 13 broad measures on 13 March 2009. In the social sphere, the deal provided for extra assistance to families whose economic situation had worsened during the crisis, and a new mechanism for calculating the minimum wage, which would ensure that it gradually reaches 50 per cent of average remuneration. Labour market measures included flexible working time schedules (in particular the introduction of a 12-month reference period), the creation of company-level training funds, and restrictions on fixed-term employment. In the field of economic policy, the agreement introduced subsidies for companies experiencing temporary economic difficulties.</p>
<p>The March pact received wide media coverage and was viewed as a timely compromise. Prime minister Tusk called it a ‘very mature and responsible [instance of] dialogue’ (Gazeta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1024258913480724">Prawna, 2009</xref>), and pledged to turn it into an anti-crisis bill. The Polish Parliament however ignored a number of the pact’s provisions and significantly modified others. In a joint letter, unions and employers criticized the bill, arguing that ‘it d[id] not represent a coherent and concrete answer to social partners’ proposals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1024258913480724">Komisja Trójstronna, 2009</xref>). Unions claimed that the bill ignored the socially-oriented goals and was silent about the mechanism for increasing the minimum wage. They also insisted that only companies experiencing crisis-related difficulties were to be allowed to introduce longer working time reference periods, thereby preventing the measure being used to avoid paying overtime rates. Finally, they criticized the relatively high threshold for state-funded wage subsidies (a 30 per cent fall in turnover in at least one quarter after 1 July 2008, year on year). They were backed here by a majority of Lewiatan-affiliated companies, while Pracodawcy RP and BCC viewed the subsidy scheme as unjustified market intervention.</p>
<p>On 22 August 2009, the ‘law on alleviating the impact of the crisis’ came into force. After consultation with unions or worker representatives, all companies, irrespective of their economic situation, could extend working time reference periods to 12 months (as opposed to the three months permitted by the Labour Code). Individual working schedules could also be modified. At the same time, the law restricted the duration of fixed-term employment to 24 months, after which workers were to be offered open-ended contracts. It also provided for state subsidies for wage and social security payments, which could be granted to enterprises experiencing a crisis-related fall in turnover (25 per cent and not 30 per cent). Troubled companies could send their employees on supplementary training courses, during which they would receive a state-funded allowance. The government earmarked nearly PLN1bn (about €250m) for the subsidies, and PLN500m (about €125m) for the training allowance.</p>
<p>Employers welcomed increased working time flexibility, even at the cost of temporary limitations on fixed-term employment. Unions, by contrast, criticized the asymmetric character of the law, claiming that ‘everything that was advantageous to employers was pushed through, and what was good for workers – omitted’ (Interview <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1024258913480724">OPZZ, 2012</xref>). Solidarność even launched a campaign under the slogan ‘the anti-crisis law is not the anti-crisis pact’. It also warned that the temporary restrictions on fixed-term employment could lead to massive lay-offs once the two-year protection period was over. State officials defended the law, arguing that the March pact consisted of ‘proposals, not solutions’, and was merely ‘a point of departure for discussion’ (Interview <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1024258913480724">MPPS, 2012</xref>). They also stated that regulations on social entitlements were set forth elsewhere, while the mechanism for increasing the minimum wage was too contentious an issue to be agreed upon in such a short time.</p>
<p>To what extent were the measures used? The Polish Labour Inspectorate’s report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1024258913480724">PIP, 2011</xref>) shows that companies were in no rush to take up wage subsidies – between 2009 and 2011, assistance was granted to 119 companies employing 7 241 workers, and only 8 per cent of the amount earmarked for this purpose was spent. Similarly, only 1 161 employees benefited from special training subsidies, using up just 4 per cent of the training funds. By contrast, employers were much more interested in flexible working time, with over 1 000 companies employing about 700 000 workers extending reference periods to 12 months. Controls showed little abuse of the law’s provisions. Similarly the scenario painted by the unions of massive lay-offs after the expiration of the two-year restriction on fixed-term contracts did not materialize.</p>
<p>The anti-crisis law remained in force till the end of 2011, with the government and employers seeking to extend its validity. In December 2011, the government suggested that reference period extension rules should be either included in a new temporary law, or incorporated into the Labour Code. However, neither option has been taken up so far due to the objections of the unions, who are arguing that no impact assessment of permanently adopting the regulation has yet been made. Moreover, they will only accept increased working time flexibility in exchange for restrictions on fixed-term contracts, together with an extension of unionization rights to the unemployed and pensioners. Though talks are underway, they are likely to be protracted.</p>
<p>Recent developments suggest that, notwithstanding the 2009 surge, social dialogue in Poland has fallen into oblivion. In 2010, the government rejected social partners’ proposals for the annual increase in the minimum wage, unilaterally setting a lower rate. Between July 2011 and March 2012, it did not convoke a single plenary meeting of the Tripartite Commission, even though such sessions are supposed to take place at least every two months. Further procedural shortcomings, documented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1024258913480724">Solidarność (2011</xref>), include the government’s failure to consult the social partners despite its legal obligation to do so, or its shortening consultation periods. The prime minister’s decision to lift the retirement age to 67, announced in February 2012 and not discussed with the social partners, further worsened the climate.</p>

<sec id="section4-1024258913480724">
<title>The anti-crisis pact in Bulgaria</title>
<p>Tripartite bargaining was relatively important in the initial phase of Bulgaria’s transition, with the social partners and the state signing the Political Agreement for Peaceful Transition towards Democracy in 1991, together with three other socio-economic reform packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1024258913480724">Iankova, 2000</xref>). In addition, unions and employers participated in drafting the law on settling collective labour disputes and the collective bargaining guidelines. In 1993, the National Council for Tripartite Cooperation (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1024258913480724">Table 2</xref> for membership details) was officially created. Following the 1997 crisis, the government and the social partners signed a Charter for Social Cooperation, but the government would often ignore union proposals, at the same time strictly adhering to the newly introduced currency board (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1024258913480724">Gradev, 2001</xref>). The 2000s saw a further weakening of social dialogue.</p>

<p>Despite the worsening economic situation, unions left the Tripartite Council in November 2008, frustrated by the ‘fruitless dialogue’ with the coalition government led by the socialist prime minister Stanishev (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1024258913480724">Monitor, 2008</xref>). Consultations resumed nine months later, following the electoral victory of the centre-right GERB party. In August 2009, Finance minister Djankov invited social partners to the negotiating table, supposedly reflecting the government’s ‘new approach’ to tripartism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1024258913480724">Government.bg, 2009</xref>). Given the delay caused by the elections, priority was given to a much-needed anti-crisis pact. Similarly to Poland, initial policy proposals were drafted by the social partners, with the subsequent tripartite negotiations leading to the drafting of a 59-measure anti-crisis pact, announced on 31 March 2010.</p>
<p>The pact can be divided into four parts. The first group of measures aimed at fighting the budgetary deficit through accelerated privatization, the reduction of administrative spending by 10 per cent and the sale of CO<sub>2</sub> emission quotas, and was expected to generate savings/revenue of BGN1.6bn (€800m). A second group of business-related measures saw the state undertaking to repay all its debts to private firms in the first half of 2010, and to increase the capital of the Bulgaria Development Bank specializing in investment funding. In the social sphere, the pact provided for a new mechanism for increasing the minimum wage, the removal of an upper limit on unemployment benefits, and a temporary freeze of state-regulated utility prices. It also allowed the Labour minister to extend collective agreements to whole sectors, once union and employer approval had been gained. Finally, labour market measures mirrored those introduced in Poland, although, in principle, Bulgaria’s Labour Code already contained specific rules on working time reductions and production stoppages caused by downturns in the economy. The pact added new provisions on training, and specified rules governing the distribution of wage subsidies. Most policies were to be implemented in 2010, while the labour market provisions were to remain in force until the end of 2011.</p>
<p>The pact was widely commented in the media, and all three sides were supposedly ‘visibly satisfied with the result’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1024258913480724">Kapital, 2009</xref>). However, as in Poland certain parts of Bulgaria’s anti-crisis pact never moved beyond the planning stage. In particular, the government managed neither to speed up privatization nor to sell carbon emission quotas, thus failing to generate additional revenue. Socially-oriented and labour market measures, by contrast, were largely implemented. Many companies reduced working time during difficult periods, but only 76 firms employing 985 workers combined this measure with state-funded training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1024258913480724">KNSB, 2010</xref>). Several sectors such as paper, furniture-making and water saw the extension of sectoral collective agreements. In addition, the minimum wage was raised to BGN290 (€145), even though the mechanism for calculating increases remained unspecified. Business leaders, for their part, were generally disappointed with the government’s actions. Though the state repaid its debts to business with a six-month delay, the amounts were 7 per cent lower than expected, allegedly triggering a debt spiral in the private sector and the cause of significant lay-offs (Interview <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1024258913480724">BSK, 2012</xref>). Overall, in the eyes of the BSK Executive Secretary, ‘social measures were implemented to a much greater extent than business-related ones’ in Bulgaria. Even unions acknowledged that state support for companies during the crisis was ‘clearly insufficient’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1024258913480724">KNSB, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the conclusion of the pact, social dialogue in Bulgaria has often been interrupted by disputes between the state and the social partners. In October 2010 the government unilaterally raised employer social security contributions by 3 per cent, infuriating employers and causing them to withdraw from the Tripartite Council. The dispute ended with the increase being trimmed back to 1.8 per cent. In November 2011, the government sought to raise the retirement age by one year as of 2012, in violation of the 2010 pension reform agreement. When 35 000 union members staged a protest against the changes, the government replaced the one-year rise by three four-month rises spread out over three years. Finally, in spring 2012, it was announced that resources accumulated in the so-called Silver Fund, earmarked for future pension payments, could be used to purchase Bulgarian bonds. Despite the critical position of unions and certain business associations, the measure was nevertheless pushed through.</p>
<p>In view of the largely ineffective tripartite talks, the recent intensification of bipartite dialogue deserves special attention. In November 2010, the Bulgarian social partners signed agreements on teleworking and home-based work which subsequently became the basis for legislation in these fields. In addition, the employers’ association AIKB and the union KNSB have been jointly running an EU-funded project aimed at combatting illegal employment since 2009. In early 2012, unions and employers put forward joint proposals for reforming Bulgaria’s social dialogue system, suggesting that a) bipartite agreements become official laws once government consent has been gained, and b) that the Tripartite Council be consulted not only on government bills, but also on proposals put forward by MPs. They would also like to set the agenda for tripartite meetings at least once a month. It remains to be seen whether the government accedes to these demands.</p>

<title>Social dialogue, crisis and party politics</title>
<p>In both Poland and Bulgaria, the increased activity of tripartite bodies in the 2008–2010 period was followed by a gradual decline in their importance and a return to the pre-crisis <italic>status quo</italic>. What spurred the sudden revival of social dialogue in the two countries, and why did this trend not last once the downturn had been overcome?</p>
<p>Addressing the above questions, it might be instructive to consult the body of literature on western European social pacts that combines insights from political economy and electoral studies. In their <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1024258913480724">2011 book, Hamann and Kelly</xref> underline the importance of the economic factors behind the agreements concluded in the 1980s and 2000s. ‘Pacting’ countries implemented economic adjustment policies and wage restraint to meet EMU criteria and to make their businesses more competitive in rapidly internationalizing markets. But economic pressure is not enough to explain the timing of specific agreements and does not constitute a sufficient condition for tripartite consultations. The authors therefore draw upon the literature on party politics and electoral competition, arguing that the second important variable stimulating social dialogue is the ballot-box calculations of the parties in power. Since economic reforms addressing external pressure can cost votes, governments seek to include societal actors in the policy-making process, thereby legitimizing a given policy course and signalling government responsiveness and accountability to society. This can be a preferred strategy for politically weak governments, including those with a very slight majority or minority governments (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1024258913480724">Baccaro and Lim, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1024258913480724">Avdagic, 2010</xref>). Government weakness may also be issue-specific, relating for instance to the existence of an internal faction contesting the official party line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1024258913480724">Baccaro and Simoni, 2006</xref>). Following this line of reasoning, the presence of a strong opposition party can be viewed as yet another dimension of issue-specific weakness, increasing the ruling party’s political vulnerability.</p>
<p>The above arguments have not as yet been tested against the CEE evidence, perhaps because tripartite negotiations in post-communist countries have rarely resulted in formalized social pacts. In the following I will argue however that the recent revival of social dialogue in Poland and Bulgaria can be put down to the same set of factors influencing the western European social pacts of the 1990s and 2000s, i.e. the combination of economic uncertainty and a governing party’s electoral considerations.</p>
<sec id="section6-1024258913480724">
<title>Poland: high electoral volatility and strong opposition</title>
<p>In November 2007, the liberal-right Platforma Obywatelska (PO) formed a coalition with the agrarian Polskie Stronictwo Ludowe (PSL), building a sizeable parliamentary majority. The new government was put to a hard test when the crisis began to unfold. By late 2008, Poland’s industrial production levels had fallen considerably, reflecting the turmoil on the country’s export markets. In March 2009, the decline was equal to nearly 10.8 per cent year on year, with the highest drop recorded in metal processing (34.1 per cent year on year). The unemployment rate rose from 8.8 per cent in October 2008 to over 11 per cent in March 2009 (GUS, 2010). Against the background of this negative data, it was hard to predict the extent of the downturn. Society shared the government’s anxiety, with 69 per cent of an opinion poll’s respondents agreeing in early 2009 that ‘issues in the country are moving in a bad direction’, while 75 per cent maintained that Poland was in crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1024258913480724">Rzeczpospolita, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In view of the economic downturn, popular dissatisfaction with the government grew significantly, while support for its economic policies fell by 24 percentage points year on year (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1024258913480724">Table 3</xref>). By early 2009, it seemed therefore that the high support gained by the PO in the 2007 elections could easily melt away. The scenario of electoral defeat had to be taken seriously in view of Poland’s extremely high electoral volatility, which, although decreasing in recent years, still ‘far exceeds what has been registered in post-World War II western Europe’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1024258913480724">Markowski, 2006</xref>: 816). In 2005, over 62 per cent of voters supported a different party than in 2001, while almost 30 per cent of voters changed blocks, switching from left to right or vice versa. Such drastic changes of electoral preferences signal a lack of party loyalty among voters, and, in combination with low turnout, make it virtually impossible to predict the result of any election. Moreover, PO could not feel safe given the strong position of its main challenger, Prawo i Sprawiedliwość (PiS), which had increased its electoral strength after the 2005 elections and ended up winning 32.11 per cent of votes in the 2007 elections. Polls indicated that between December 2008 and January 2009, PO popularity declined by 8 percentage points, while support for PiS grew commensurately (Puls Biznesu, 2010). Already in the 2005 campaign PiS had become a dangerous rival, contrasting its vision of a ‘solidarity-based’ Poland with the ‘liberal’ PO vision. In times of crisis, PiS’s attachment to social values, even if largely rhetorical, was likely to strike a chord with voters.</p>

<p>All in all, economic uncertainty combined with electoral considerations made the government launch what could be referred to as ‘PR corporatism’ – by involving the social partners in designing the anti-crisis measures, it sought to boost its popularity and demonstrate its responsiveness to societal initiatives. But once it turned out that the crisis would not be as acute as expected, it returned to neglecting tripartite negotiations. The cuts to the social partners’ 2009 pact and the subsequent procedural breaches took place in less turbulent times and thus did not attract much media attention. Indeed, the image of a responsive but tough-on-crisis government was preserved until the 2010 elections, when the voters, for the first time in Poland’s post-1989 history, allowed the ruling coalition to stay in power for a second term of office.</p>

<title>Bulgaria: minority government and the unstable party system</title>
<p>Prior to the downturn, Bulgaria had benefited from financial inflows and a boom in the construction sector. The crisis hit these two areas particularly hard. Whereas in Q3 2008, FDI into Bulgaria stood at €531m, the country experienced an outflow of €88m in Q1 2010 (BNB, 2010). In the construction industry, orders fell by 30–35 per cent in 2009, with 28 per cent of building companies going out of business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1024258913480724">Petkov and Vladikov, 2010</xref>). Between 2008 and 2009, delayed payments rose by 54 per cent across the whole economy, with their share in total transactions amounting to 70 per cent. The country slipped back into recession, with the unemployment rate doubling between late 2008 and early 2010, reaching 10.2 per cent in Q1 2010 (NSI, 2012).</p>
<p>The negative economic trends were accompanied by a significant drop in the popularity of the centre-right party Grajdane za Evropeiskoto Razvitie na Bulgaria (GERB), which had been running the country since mid-2009 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1024258913480724">Table 4</xref>). Its leaders were right to be concerned about negative survey results in view of high electoral volatility and the notorious instability of Bulgaria’s party system. Popular disappointment with the ruling elites and the country’s economic performance had resulted in ‘repeated radical changes of electoral preferences due to the search for new miracles and the ensuing collapse of each governing party’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1024258913480724">Genov, 2010</xref>: 28). Landslide victories by newly created parties were no one-off event in Bulgaria. Before GERB’s spectacular victory in the 2009 elections, nearly two million voters had supported Nacionalno Dvijenie Simeon Vtori (NDSV), the former tsar’s movement, in the 2001 elections, with the party gaining 42.47 per cent of the vote. But the lesson learned from the NDSV case was bitter, with the party receiving fewer than half of the 2001 votes in 2005 and becoming a junior partner in the socialist-led coalition, only to fail to even get into Parliament in 2009. In light of the NDSV’s experience, GERB’s falling popularity in the crisis was set to signal the beginning of the end of its political existence.</p>

<p>Moreover, GERB formed a minority government, bearing sole responsibility for state policies and making it particularly wary about its media image. The party with its charismatic leader, Boyko Borisov, campaigned on promises to fight corruption and organized crime, and to reveal the previous government’s misdeeds. Once in power, it indeed brought a number of former state officials to court and intensified controls in major companies linked to socialist party leaders. These actions received extremely wide media coverage, even though not all suspects were eventually convicted. The government adapted a similarly populist line in the social sphere. On announcing its crisis-related austerity measures, prime minister Borisov promised that the cuts would not affect the poorest: ‘we’ll touch only the big incomes and big real estate [owners]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1024258913480724">News.bg, 2010</xref>). It also sought to consolidate its socially-responsive image through ad hoc interventions in defence of employee rights. In March 2012, for instance, prime minister Borisov went to Kardzhali, a town with a predominantly Turkish population, to negotiate delayed wage payments for the local metal foundry’s employees.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the government’s recourse to tripartism can be viewed as yet another measure designed to signal its responsiveness to societal concerns in difficult times. Such ‘social PR’ proved largely effective, with GERB faring well in the October 2011 local elections. In January 2013 it still led the polls, although its support levels were significantly lower than in 2009 (Alpha Research, 2013)<sup>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The 2008–2010 crisis affected Poland and Bulgaria in different ways, dependent on how they were integrated into the European or global economy. At the peak of the crisis, however, both countries’ governments included the social partners in designing anti-crisis measures, an unexpected development in light of their poor social dialogue record before the downturn.</p>
<p>Why did the Polish and Bulgarian governments engage in tripartite talks during the crisis? Based on the literature on the emergence of social pacts in western Europe, and combining economic explanations with those related to party system characteristics, I argue that in the 2008–2010 crisis the governments in Poland and Bulgaria faced two challenges. The first stemmed from a growing uncertainty over how long the downturn would last and the countries’ economic fate, while the second was related to the instability of their political systems: high levels of electoral volatility, combined with either the presence of strong, socially responsive opposition (Poland), or the necessity to rule as a minority government (Bulgaria). The combination of these two factors increased the risk of electoral defeat faced by the two countries’ governing parties. Consequently, their leaders involved the social partners in the preparation of anti-crisis programmes, thereby signalling that they were actively searching for solutions to the crisis, and that they were taking societal views into account. The resulting ‘PR corporatism’ boosted government popularity at a time when every badly-targeted anti-crisis measure could easily result in a loss of power.</p>
<p>Of the two situations looked at, the Bulgarian government appeared more willing than the Polish one to include social partners in the policy-making process; its subsequent failure to implement anti-crisis pact provisions was partly the result of its limited administrative capacity and crisis-related challenges. Even so, the short-lived revival of tripartism did not translate into a lasting improvement of social dialogue either in Poland or in Bulgaria. Nevertheless, it would seem that the 2009–2010 negotiations did have two positive – though not ground-breaking – effects. First, they widened the scope of tripartite negotiations to include the effects of external pressures on the two countries’ economies, setting them apart from the reform-focused corporatism of the early transition period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1024258913480724">Hyman, 2010</xref>). Secondly, the crisis gave the Polish and Bulgarian social partners an opportunity to engage in bipartite dialogue. As shown by the Bulgarian experience, autonomous bargaining is not only effective in building consensus among the social partners, but may also speed up the legislative process by providing the state with regulatory solutions tailored to workers’ and employers’ needs. In the future, the intensification of bipartite dialogue might lead to the strengthening of the social partners’ position vis-à-vis the state. Perhaps as a result, the latter might in future engage in tripartite talks not only in bad, but also in good times.</p>
