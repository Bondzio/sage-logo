            <p>This manifesto is based on the discussions that have taken place since the Workshop on Transparency, organized in Ditchley Park, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom, on June 17 and 18, 2010. The authors present a strategic view on the concrete measures that must be taken for a European pharmaceutical transparency initiative to be successful.</p>

   <body>
      <p>On June 17 and 18, 2010, in Ditchley Park, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom, we organized a workshop on how a pharmaceutical transparency initiative should best look like in Europe. On the basis of this meeting, as well as the subsequent discussions that followed and with regard to the ongoing European debate on this subject, we believe that for the European Medicines Agency or for any nation-state medical/pharmaceutical regulatory body, the following measures must be taken for a European pharmaceutical transparency initiative to be successful.</p>
      <p>
         <italic>1. Acknowledge that there is more than just one form of transparency.</italic> For example, putting everything out in the open, such as data dumping on the Internet, does not lead to better decision making or to informed patients and publics. Rather, in many cases, the opposite is the case. What is now needed is a form of rational or reasoned transparency in which regulators and other bodies explain the decisions they took in an open and honest manner.</p>
      <p>
         <italic>2. Any transparency initiative must be underpinned by the best available communication science.</italic> Too often, initiatives put forward in the pharmaceutical, food, environmental, and other sectors are based on input from stakeholder consultations without paying attention to communication science.</p>
      <p>
         <italic>3. All transparency initiatives, as any risk communication program, should be properly evaluated.</italic> Evaluation leads to better, more thoughtful and robust transparency initiatives.</p>
      <p>
         <italic>4. Realize that any transparency initiative by itself does not automatically lead to better informed publics or patients.</italic> Any initiative must be coupled with tools and skills ensuring that the public and patients have the ability to understand it.</p>
      <p>
         <italic>5. Understand that transparency initiatives may have benefits as well as negative consequences associated with it.</italic> These initiatives, many put in place for political rather scientific reasons, raise the expectations of the members of the public, which in many cases simply cannot be met. In such circumstances, the trust and credibility of the transparency initiator will decline.</p>
      <p>
         <italic>6. Realize that different nations will benefit from better coordinating their transparency initiatives.</italic> Different levels of openness in a wide array of nations/trade blocks will lead to calls of unfairness, as well as attempts by outside stakeholders to pull up the “openness laggards” to the same level as the “openness leaders,” sometimes with disastrous consequences because of differences in cultural norms and societal expectations.</p>
