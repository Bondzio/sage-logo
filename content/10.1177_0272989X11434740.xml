<p>The theme of the 2009 Annual Meeting of the Society for Medical Decision Making was “Evidence, Economics, and Ethics: The Future of Health Technology Assessment.” As co-chairs for the meeting, we selected this theme to reflect 2 important points. First, we wanted to put the focus of the meeting on health technology assessment (HTA). Specifically, we were interested in focusing not only on high-quality science or methodological advances but also on how that knowledge is translated into policy-level decision making. Such discussions will be inherently challenging, in part because of the complexity of the information to be assimilated and the multiplicity of stakeholders who are involved. However, even among researchers with interests in HTA, academics often approach the same problem from very different perspectives.</p>
<p>Our second aim, accordingly, was to reflect some of the important disciplines involved in such decision making (we have, of course, neglected several others!). The last 20 years have witnessed remarkable growth in evidence-based medicine, economic evaluation in health care, and population and public health ethics. In each of these disciplines, methodological and theoretical advances have led to the develop-ment of standards for high-quality research and the establishment of new paradigms. Our concern, however, was that researchers entrenched in their areas of study do not always communicate well with researchers in other disciplines. A key objective of the plenary session was to address this concern by bringing together 3 experts, each representing 1 of these disciplines, to discuss what their discipline has to add to the HTA discussion, to consider the limitations of their approach, and to suggest what they might learn from others. What follows are discussion papers that originated from that plenary session, each published online in this issue, by Paul Glasziou, writing from an evidence-based medicine perspective, Anthony Culyer, writing from a health economics perspective, and Daniel Callahan, writing from an ethics perspective.</p>
<p>These authors raise important criticisms of their disciplines that challenge the underlying paradigm. Glasziou tackles the thorny problem, at its core an epistemological one, of when we can relax standards and still be faithful to the principles of evidence-based medicine. Culyer urges health economists to revisit the utilitarianism inherent in most economic evaluation by grappling with the question of how equity in resource allocation can be defined and measured. Callahan challenges ethics to engage more directly in questions of politics in order to be relevant to HTA. Each of these exhortations reflects an understanding that HTA will be strengthened by a process of interrogating where one’s discipline is lacking in a real-world applied setting. Furthermore, the solutions to these issues will come from a willingness to work outside of the respective disciplines, to incorporate new theories or methods, and to learn from the experiences of others. For example, ethicists have much to say about how to conceptualize social value judgments, economists have much to say about how to value uncertain information, and evidence-based practitioners have much to say about knowledge translation and public discussions of research findings.</p>
<p>A second theme that echoes across the 3 articles is the importance of context in HTA decision making. Examples of contextual concerns include changing costs of technologies over time, the incorporation of site-specific social value judgments, and the media and political contexts accompanying a recommendation or decision. As Callahan points out, the decision to use HTA is itself a political one, an observation that is demonstrated most clearly in the debate about health reform and comparative effectiveness research in the United States (and with many parallels in the current health reforms occurring in the United Kingdom). The particular objectives, mandates, and powers of an HTA agency reflect both the underlying values and the prevailing political leadership in a specific jurisdiction. Accordingly, the challenge for academics is to under-stand how seemingly “objective” sciences can quickly become political battlegrounds, in part because they represent implicit values that are inherent in the methods (such as the privileging of evidence or the necessity for efficiency in resource allocation). Researchers who use such methods have made social value judgments, perhaps implicit ones, but judgments nevertheless for which they may be held accountable. The relevant question then becomes not whether academics should engage in such processes but rather how they should do so.</p>
<p>The third common theme across the articles speaks to the process for engagement, particularly the need for wide discussions and deliberations. From this perspective, <italic>evidence</italic> has a broad and expansive definition. It is not only the result of a randomized controlled trial, nor is it solely focused on the question of clinical effectiveness, but it might include stakeholder views or public input into decision making. Whether and how this is done (quantitatively or qualitatively? broadly or focused?) are active questions worth of inquiry. As Culyer points out, perhaps the single greatest strength of the HTA approach (and of societies like SMDM) has been the ability to bring together individuals from a wide variety of backgrounds to have meaningful discussions. Such deliberations need to be continued and expanded in the real world of HTA.</p>
<p>Canada recently had its own version of the mammography debate that gripped the United States in 2009. Of interest, a sort of meta-discussion developed about what the discussion of restricting mammography among younger women was really about. Was it a discussion of costs versus effective-ness? Harms versus benefits? Hard evidence versus wishful thinking? Social values versus individual ones? In reality, the discussion was about all of these simultaneously. More important, however, is the recognition that societies need tools and platforms to have these sorts of discussions intelligently, sensitively, and democratically. We are not yet there, but those are the next steps for building the future of HTA.</p>
