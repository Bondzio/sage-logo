<abstract>
<p>This study investigates the rupture rate and morphology of articular cartilage by altering the bathing environments of healthy and degenerate bovine cartilage. Soaking tissues in either distilled water or 1.5 M NaCl saline was performed in order to render the tissues into a swollen or dehydrated state, respectively. Creep compression was applied using an 8 mm flat-ended polished indenter that contained a central pore of 450 µm in diameter, providing a consistent region for rupture to occur across all 105 tested specimens. Rupture rates were determined by varying the nominal compressive stress and the loading time. Similar rupture rates were observed with the swollen healthy and degenerate specimens, loaded with either 6 or 7 MPa of nominal compressive stress over 11 and 13 min. The observed rupture rates for the dehydrated specimens loaded with 7 MPa over 60 and 90 s were 20% versus 40% and 20% versus 60% for healthy and degenerate tissues, respectively. At 8 MPa of nominal compressive stress over 60 and 90 s the observed rupture rates were 20% versus 60% and 40% versus 80% for healthy and degenerate tissues, respectively; with all dehydrated degenerate tissues exhibiting a greater tendency to rupture (Barnard’s exact test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Rupture morphologies were only different in the swollen degenerate tissues (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.05). The mechanisms by which dehydration and swelling induce initial surface rupture of mildly degenerate articular cartilage differ. Dehydration increases the likelihood that the surface will rupture, however, swelling alters the observed rupture morphology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article reports on articular cartilage surface rupture rates and rupture morphologies during compression. Both healthy and mildly degenerate tissues under two different states of hydration are compared. Although tissue hydration has been previously shown to influence the level of nominal stress and loading time required to rupture articular cartilage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912439824">1</xref></sup> it has not been utilized to investigate how the rates of articular cartilage rupture and the observed rupture morphology are affected.</p>
<p>Articular cartilage is a load-bearing material, present in joints, that is compressed during daily activities. Fluid content within articular cartilage assists in load bearing during tissue deformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912439824">2</xref></sup> Changes to fluid content occur during initial stages of osteoarthritis where fluid content increases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912439824">3</xref></sup> whereas cartilage becomes dehydrated with advancing age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912439824">4</xref></sup> The articular surface of cartilage is also integral to both load bearing and stress transmission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912439824">5</xref></sup> The process of degeneration, occurring during osteoarthritis, involves the rupturing of the surface, which decreases the above mentioned biomechanical functions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912439824">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912439824">5</xref></sup> Also affected is joint articulation, where an increase in friction associated with degeneration contributes to the long term progression of osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912439824">6</xref></sup> Thus, understanding surface rupture is important, both for injurious compressive loading as well as the pathology of osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912439824">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912439824">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Previous studies have determined how certain mechanical factors contribute to cartilage surface rupture. For example, both compressive stress and the level of in-plain strain have been investigated and shown to induce rupture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912439824">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411912439824">15</xref></sup> Rupture rates increased with increasing peak stress and varied with strain-rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411912439824">16</xref></sup> Removing fluid from cartilage mechanically, either through pre-loading or creep compression of cartilage-on-bone specimens, reduces the likelihood of surface rupture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912439824">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912439824">18</xref></sup> These latter studies are important because they show that fluid content can alter the propensity of the cartilage surface to rupture. A recent study, therefore, compared how large differences in tissue hydration altered surface rupture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912439824">1</xref></sup> Dehydrated cartilage failed at greater induced nominal compressive stress, in agreement with previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912439824">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912439824">18</xref></sup> However, tissue hydration had a greater influence in altering the time to failure over the loading required to induce surface rupture than such stress. The time required to induce surface rupture varied by an order of magnitude between swollen and dehydrated samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912439824">1</xref></sup> It was proposed that the mechanism by which failure was induced differed between dehydrated and swollen tissue. With the former likely failing owing to stress concentrations induced within the tissue and the latter failing owing to an increased internal-swelling pressure present within the matrix. Differences in surface weakness were not assessed using surface rupture morphology. However, surface rupture morphology has been used previously to assess the extent of surface weakness with multiple rupture branches indicative of cartilage that has a weaker intrinsic surface strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912439824">13</xref></sup> Such assessment may enable changes to surface strength, induced by changes to tissue hydration, to be better understood.</p>
<p>In the previous study by Fick and Espino,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912439824">1</xref></sup> conditions that guaranteed surface rupture were used. However, the transition from cartilage that does not undergo surface rupture, to that which undergoes surface rupture, enables investigation of initial cartilage failure. Previously, surface rupture was determined to be more dependent on tissue hydration than mild degradation of tissue structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912439824">1</xref></sup> However, whether mildly degenerate cartilage becomes more vulnerable to rupture during initial surface failure of cartilage, rather than under conditions that guarantee failure, is unclear.</p>
<p>Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate initial stages of surface rupture (i.e. following transition from non-failure to failure), following large changes in tissue hydration for surface-intact healthy and mildly degenerate tissues (i.e. a model used to study the early effects of degeneration). Surface rupture morphology is assessed following the initial surface rupture of cartilage.</p>

<title>Cartilage samples</title>
<p>A total of 105 cartilage-on-bone test specimens were obtained from the distal-lateral quadrant of bovine patellae, stored at −20 °C, and thawed prior to testing. Both healthy and mildly degenerate patellae were used for these experiments. The tissue preparation procedure has been described previously;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912439824">1</xref></sup> briefly, the patellae were macroscopically assessed for superficial fibrillation (i.e. surface degeneration) with Indian-ink<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411912439824">19</xref></sup> using the Outerbridge scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912439824">7</xref></sup> The most distal-lateral regions that contained an intact surface on all patellae were selected. Mildly degenerate specimens that were selected were always adjacent to the surface lesion or area of fibrillation on the patellae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912439824">Figure 1</xref>). Test specimens consisted of blocks of articular cartilage (approximately 15 × 15 mm) with approximately 10 mm depth of underlying bone. Specimens were equilibrated in either distilled water (i.e. swollen cartilage) or a 1.5 M NaCl saline solution (i.e. dehydrated cartilage). Equilibrations lasted 12 h (at 4 °C) to obtain a maximum/minimum internal hydration pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912439824">5</xref></sup></p>

<p>Healthy and mildly degenerate cartilage specimens were tested when either swollen or dehydrated in a bathing solution that corresponded to their equilibration solution. After every test, the surfaces of the specimens were inspected for rupture. If any specimen from its corresponding group ruptured, then no further tests were performed on that group of specimens. If rupture did not occur across a specimen group, then the tissues were retested. Any sample undergoing repeat testing was re-equilibrated at 4 °C for 4 h in its respective solution. The rates of surface rupture for both healthy and mildly degenerate tissues were determined when:</p>

<title>Overview</title>
<p>Two main differences were found between healthy and mildly degenerate articular cartilage under transition from non-failure to failure, i.e. initial cartilage surface rupture, associated with initial degeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912439824">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954411912439824">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954411912439824">27</xref></sup> Dehydrated mildly degenerate cartilage tested with either 7 or 8 MPa of nominal compressive stress over either 1 or 1.5 min of loading time experienced higher failure rates than dehydrated healthy cartilage. Conversely, the swollen mildly degenerate cartilage was observed to contain an increased number of rupture branches relative to the swollen healthy tissues.

<title>Dehydration increases the observed rupture rate</title>
<p>The dehydrated healthy tissue rupture rate (when loaded with 7 or 8 MPa of nominal compressive stress) was lower at both 1 and 1.5 min of loading relative to the observed rupture rates for the dehydrated mildly degenerate specimens. Because dehydrated tissue contains a lower amount of water, the fluid phase during the initial process of load-carriage will experience a lower degree of load partitioning within the tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954411912439824">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0954411912439824">34</xref></sup> This implies that the collagen network in dehydrated tissue experiences a greater degree of partitioned load as discussed by Fick and Espino.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912439824">1</xref></sup> Thus, the earlier collapsing of the collagen network will occur in a dehydrated tissue relative to a hydrated matrix. The same degree of load partitioning onto a dehydrated and mildly degenerate matrix would mean that more stress is concentrated onto portions of the network that can still effectively function and transmit stress throughout a wider continuum. The dehydrated collagen network experiences an even greater and/or earlier collapsing of its network, relative to a hydrated matrix. Therefore, dehydration increases the likelihood that mildly degenerate cartilage fails during a single compressive deformation that is capable of rupturing the tissue. However, the resulting surface rupture branches do not change in morphology.</p>

<sec id="section16-0954411912439824">
<title>Swelling alters rupture morphology</title>
<p>Cartilage swelling (and therefore matrix swelling) is regulated by the support provided by the cartilage surface, surrounding matrix and underlying bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0954411912439824">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0954411912439824">36</xref></sup> Adams et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912439824">17</xref></sup> and Morel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912439824">18</xref></sup> have demonstrated that removing fluid from cartilage, either through pre-loading or creep compression of cartilage-on-bone specimens, reduces the likelihood of surface rupture. This is in agreement with our results, as greater stress was required to induce surface failure (for dehydrated over swollen specimens). Our degenerate swollen specimens contained an increase in the number of rupture branches relative to the swollen healthy specimens. Therefore, a combination of swelling and initial cartilage degeneration increases the vulnerability of the weakened surface during initial failure of cartilage. This might be owing to swollen cartilage (e.g. at or near peak pore pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912439824">5</xref></sup>) having more fluid available to recruit a greater proportion of the cartilage surface during load bearing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0954411912439824">37</xref></sup> In turn, this induces initial failure at the weakest points over a greater surface area (hence the branching). This method is different to that described in the previous subsection entitled ‘Dehydration increases the observed rupture rate’ (for dehydrated failure), as in this case stresses are less localized as they are induced over a greater area. Previously, we demonstrated that such mildly degenerate specimens showed no differences in load or stress for failure compared with healthy specimens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912439824">1</xref></sup> In this study, mildly degenerate specimens have been observed to undergo differences in surface rupture morphology when the tissue is swollen. This is important because surface fractures are associated with tissue degeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0954411912439824">38</xref></sup> Therefore, swelling is likely to induce initial failure of mildly degenerate cartilage by inducing an increased number of surface ruptures.</p>

<sec id="section17-0954411912439824">
<title>Clinical relevance</title>
<p>These findings suggest that mildly degenerate tissue undergoes different mechanisms of failure owing to compression when dehydrated and swollen. During dehydration, the greater indentation induced compression of the mildly degenerate tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912439824">1</xref></sup> causes the near-parallel orientation of the superficial layer of the collagen network. Hence the cartilage would experience increased tensile stresses relative to that of a healthy network.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954411912439824">30</xref></sup> Dehydration might be induced owing to excessive exercise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0954411912439824">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0954411912439824">41</xref></sup> and cartilage is known to dehydrate with age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912439824">4</xref></sup> Removal of excess fluid has been shown to stiffen cartilage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912439824">17</xref></sup> and even increase the strength of cartilage,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912439824">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912439824">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912439824">18</xref></sup> therefore, potentially having beneficial effects in terms of its mechanical function. However, our results show that excess dehydration may lead to initial failure of intact regions compromised by the degenerate process. This might be a mechanism of initial degeneration and its propagation through cartilage.</p>
<p>If mildly degenerate tissue is swollen, it is more likely to lead to multiple surface ruptures if loaded to failure. Swelling might occur following periods of inactivity, however, during degeneration, tissue swelling is also known to occur.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912439824">6</xref></sup> These surface cracks may alter the permeability of the cartilage surface. It has been suggested that such cracks enable additional water to enter the tissue, thus contributing to further swelling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0954411912439824">35</xref></sup> Further swelling could mean further crack generation, further propagating surface rupture and tissue degeneration.</p>

<sec id="section18-0954411912439824">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>As with any study, there are a number of potential limitations. One potential limitation relates to scaling effects caused by the similarity in scale between the indenter (8 mm diameter) and specimen block (15 × 15 mm block). However, microscopic studies have shown such surface effects do not extend beyond 1 mm from the loaded region in cartilage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912439824">5</xref></sup> In this study, no scaling effects are anticipated as the specimen edge was 4 mm away from the loading indenter site (i.e. four times the necessary distance).</p>
<p>Another potential limitation is that the water content of healthy and mildly degenerate tissues was not determined. The two bathing solutions utilized in this current study provided two extremes: swollen tissue (i.e. hyper-hydrated) and dehydration. This enabled fundamental differences of surface rupture owing to tissue hydration to be determined (it was not the intention of this study to correlate a range of hydration states to measurements of failure stress or time). Therefore, tissues were equilibrated in one of the two solutions and a consistent protocol was employed for both the hydrated and dehydrated tissue groups.</p>
<p>Repeat testing of tissues may have introduced artifacts that influenced the rupture characteristics of the tissues utilized in the study (i.e. fatigue, micro-damage or even visco-elastic changes to the tissues). However, McCormack and Mansour reported that, after loading articular cartilage with a nominal stress that ranged from 0.6–1.5 MPa over 64,800 cycles, no changes in the tensile strength occurred.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0954411912439824">42</xref></sup> Although the levels of stress utilized in the current study were larger than those utilized by McCormack and Mansour, the number of potential repeat loadings was much less.</p>
<p>Previous studies have typically allowed between 90 min<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0954411912439824">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0954411912439824">44</xref></sup> to 4 h<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912439824">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0954411912439824">45</xref></sup> for cartilage to recover to its original state. Furthermore, 3 h rebalancing in the appropriate solution leads to around 90% equilibration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0954411912439824">46</xref></sup> The current study allowed 4 h of rebalancing, thus, negligible differences owing to changes in viscoelastic effects from the tissue rehydrating procedures are anticipated. However, any possible accruing damage (from multiple testing), or visco-elastic effects, would be expected to be consistent for healthy and mildly degenerate tissue groups, thus not altering our conclusions.</p>
<p>The current study utilized static compression to investigate the failure mechanisms of cartilage that can be considered non-physiologic. For example, Fulcher et al. previously investigated cartilage under physiological and impulse loading rates (1–92 Hz) that are representative of normal gait, with nominal values of stress up to 1.7 MPa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0954411912439824">47</xref></sup> The nominal compressive stresses utilized in the current study were three to four times greater than those utilized by Fulcher et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0954411912439824">47</xref></sup> in order to induce surface rupture. However, contact pressures may exceed 8 MPa at the hip during sitting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0954411912439824">48</xref></sup> or in the tibiofemoral joint during squatting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0954411912439824">49</xref></sup> The frequency and duration of such activities are directly relevant to the induced stress and time-frames applied in this study (and may induce cartilage surface rupture).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The mechanisms by which dehydration and swelling induce initial surface rupture of mildly degenerate articular cartilage differ.
