<abstract>
<p>This article examines two critical questions related to equality of educational opportunity. First, does the academic advantage that was observed in Catholic high schools more than two decades ago continue to hold for contemporary students in Catholic middle schools? Second, how closely do different school sectors adhere to the common school ideal? Answers to these questions are central to efforts to reduce educational inequalities. The study reported here relies on data from sixth- and eighth-grade students in the Chicago School Study, a longitudinal survey of Chicago public schools, and the Chicago Catholic School Study, a survey of all the Catholic schools in the Archdiocese of Chicago. These school systems are the third largest public and largest Catholic school systems in the United States. The results show no consistent sector differences in achievement gains in sixth and eighth grades in reading and mathematics. Moreover, background characteristics vary by school sector, and neither sector eliminates all background effects on achievement. Compared to the Chicago public schools, Chicago Catholic schools reduce the effects of students’ race and socioeconomic status on reading achievement but exacerbate the effects of race on mathematics achievement.</p>

<body>
<p>The study of school sector effects on equality of educational opportunity is important both sociologically and in terms of educational policy. While both public and private schools share a mandate to produce educated citizens, school sectors differ in several ways. Among these are their effects on student achievement and their resemblance to the common school model. How these sector differences affect educational equity is of central importance to a sociological understanding of school effects. The way school sector affects learning opportunities has immediate and important implications for educational policy decisions.</p>
<p>Research on the effects of school sector on student outcomes focuses on two main issues: the Catholic school advantage and the common school ideal. The <italic>Catholic school advantage</italic> refers to the higher academic achievement attained by students in Catholic schools compared to public schools. The <italic>common school ideal</italic> signifies the goal of providing equal access to learning opportunities for all students. Both of these issues are related to current national concern about how to increase the academic achievement and educational attainment of K-12 students in U.S. schools.</p>
<p>Chicago was selected as the site of the research for three reasons. First, the Chicago public schools (CPS) comprise the third largest public school system in the country and the Chicago Catholic schools (CCS) constitute the largest subset of private schools, enrolling over 5 percent of the school-age population. In addition, students in CCS more closely resemble public school students in background characteristics than pupils in many other cities and most private schools. Finally, over the past several years, CPS have implemented extensive reforms to improve student learning and collected systematic data on the outcomes of these reforms. If public school students have surpassed Catholic school students in academic achievement, then the reforms likely have been successful. However, CCS also have undertaken school reforms, though they focused more on governance and organization than instruction. These foci permit a comparison of two types of reform on achievement gains.</p>
<sec id="section1-0038040711431586">
<title>School Sector and the Catholic School Advantage</title>
<p>Much of the research on the Catholic school advantage was conducted more than two decades ago. Since both public and private schools have changed in significant ways since that time, earlier findings showing sector differences in achievement may no longer hold. Moreover, most sector comparisons focus on high schools. The research reported here relies on data from the sixth- and eighth-grade students in the Chicago public and Catholic schools. Studying middle school students is important for many reasons. Sector differences may have their roots in middle school and simply pass their effects on to high school. Another possibility is that the organizational and curricular differences between middle and high school preclude comparisons. Moreover, Catholic schools, previously notable for academic excellence, may have lost their advantage by their increased focus on educating the disadvantaged.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038040711431586">Coleman et al. (1966)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038040711431586">Coleman, Hoffer, and Kilgore (1982b)</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0038040711431586">Greeley (1982)</xref> were among the first to compare the academic achievement of high school students across school sector. Analyzing the first wave of the High School and Beyond (HSB) survey, they found that sophomores in Catholic high schools attained higher test scores in reading and mathematics than those in public high schools. They corroborated their finding of a Catholic school advantage when the second wave of HSB became available. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038040711431586">Bryk, Lee, and Holland (1993)</xref> also found a Catholic school advantage in the HSB data. Of course, if these researchers had studied middle schools rather than high schools, they may have found different or no sector effects on achievement.</p>
<p>Further analyses by these researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038040711431586">Coleman et al. 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0038040711431586">Greeley 1982</xref>) revealed that disadvantaged minority students in Catholic schools had greater achievement gains than more privileged Catholic school students. That is, the test scores of disadvantaged and more privileged students converged in Catholic schools. The same results were not found in public schools, implying that Catholic schools were more effective than public schools in reducing the negative effects of race and poverty on achievement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038040711431586">Morgan (2001)</xref> reached the same conclusion in his analysis of National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) 8th- and 10th-grade data.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038040711431586">Coleman et al. (1966)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038040711431586">Bryk et al. (1993)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0038040711431586">Youniss and McClellan (1999)</xref> identified several school mechanisms that could account for a Catholic school advantage. Among these are a strong curriculum, strict disciplinary standards and practices, well-designed homework assignments, a strong academic culture, and the faith-based orientation of Catholic schools. These factors are believed to create a nourishing and caring school climate conducive to learning.</p>
<p>In evaluating the research in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038040711431586">Coleman et.al. (1966)</xref> and related research on a Catholic school advantage, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0038040711431586">Jencks (1985)</xref> concluded that the studies provide decisive evidence that juniors and seniors in Catholic high schools, on average, learn more than their public school peers. However, he found the conclusion that the Catholic school advantage is greatest for disadvantaged students to be suggestive rather than definitive and that the magnitude of the Catholic school advantage was uncertain due to modeling considerations.</p>
<p>Other researchers agreed with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0038040711431586">Jencks (1985)</xref> that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038040711431586">Coleman et al.’s (1982b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0038040711431586">Greeley’s (1982)</xref> analyses had methodological and modeling limitations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0038040711431586">Alexander and Pallas (1983)</xref> reanalyzed the HSB survey and data from the National Longitudinal Study (NLS) and found that when track membership was controlled, Catholic school students outperformed their public school counterparts by only a small margin. Additional critiques of Coleman’s findings of a Catholic school advantage were based primarily on methodological grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0038040711431586">Goldberger and Cain 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0038040711431586">Noell 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0038040711431586">Willms 1985</xref>). Rejoinders to these critiques appear in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0038040711431586">Coleman et al. (1982a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038040711431586">Kilgore (1983)</xref>.</p>
<p>Recent research on the Catholic school advantage is on stronger methodological grounds than earlier studies and continues to provide evidence of a Catholic school advantage at the high school level. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0038040711431586">Gamoran (1996)</xref> reported that in the NELS:88 non-Hispanic white students received higher test scores in 10th-grade mathematics in Catholic schools than in public schools. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0038040711431586">Carbonaro and Covay (2010)</xref> found a Catholic school advantage in grades 9 through 12 in the Education Longitudinal Study (ELS) survey.</p>
<p>Few studies have examined sector differences in achievement by grade. Two recent exceptions show little difference between achievement scores of public and Catholic school students at the primary level. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0038040711431586">Carbonaro (2006)</xref> investigated growth in achievement in kindergarten and first grade using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K). His analysis showed no clear pattern of results. Catholic school students had larger gains in kindergarten mathematics but smaller gains in first-grade reading than public school students. Analyzing data from the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0038040711431586">C. Lubienski, Crane, and Lubienski (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038040711431586">S. T. Lubienski and Lubienski (2006)</xref> reported that public school students outperformed private school students in mathematics achievement in the fourth and eighth grades.</p>
<p>By 1989, Chicago had reorganized CPS, moving from mayoral control to local jurisdiction. The next step in its reform plan focused on raising student test scores. Based on their prior observations of Chicago schools, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0038040711431586">Bryk et al. (2010)</xref> formulated a model of school organization aimed at improving student achievement. They conceptualize student learning as dependent on five “pillars” or essential supports: leadership, parent–community ties, professional capacity, student-centered learning climate, and instructional guidance. Leadership was seen as motivating the remaining four essential supports, each of which plays an indispensible role in the learning process. The expectation was that implementing this model in the school district would result in higher student test scores.</p>
<p>Bryk and CPS contracted with the Consortium on Chicago School Reform (CCSR) at the University of Chicago to undertake data collection to test the model. CCSR gathered a substantial amount of data from the principals, teachers, parents, and students in all the elementary and secondary schools in CPS. The data collection took place annually for seven years, from 1991 to 1997, and resulted in a rare and invaluable source of information on change in student achievement over time in the third largest public school system in the country. Analyses of these data have become known as the Chicago School Study.</p>
<p>In 1990, only 24 percent of the elementary students in CPS scored at or above the national average in reading comprehension and 27 percent in mathematics. Seven years later, after the data were analyzed and Bryk’s model was at least nominally adopted by the schools, 29 percent of the students were at the national norm in reading comprehension and 31 percent in mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0038040711431586">Bryk et al. 2010</xref>). Minority and economically disadvantaged students made particularly impressive gains in a number of schools. The model was most successful in improving student achievement in schools that implemented all five essential supports and least effective in schools that incorporated only some or none of its components. The model continues to guide reform efforts in CPS, and significant gains continue to be made in those schools that adopt it in its entirety.</p>
<p>At the same time, implementing the school improvement model in CPS has been hindered by a number of factors. The ability to up-scale a reform to an entire school district, especially one as large as CPS, involves power, status, and resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0038040711431586">Sarason 1998</xref>). A single districtwide reform takes far more time to implement than a series of small reforms and is less likely to obtain the support of all interested parties. While Chicago administrators tried to implement the school improvement model districtwide, many teachers and politicians resisted. They preferred small reforms that can be implemented quickly and may be used as political tools to satisfy the interests of various constituencies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0038040711431586">McDermott (2000)</xref> states that a typical urban school district adopts 12 reform initiatives simultaneously. However, teachers have considerable authority over policies and practices in their classroom and can resist implementing innovations, even when they are mandated for their entire school district.</p>
<p>A further hindrance to the implementation of the model resulted from insufficient funding by the federal and state governments to hire more teachers and reorganize schools according to the conditions of the school improvement model. Moreover, the creation of charter schools, magnet schools, vouchers, and other innovations have been a further drain on CPS’ finances. These obstacles to the large-scale implementation of the school improvement model limited its ability to improve student achievement.</p>
<p>Like CPS, CCS have inaugurated major school reforms over the past two decades. Several parish-based schools were replaced by area schools or designated as Archdiocesan schools. Catholic elementary schools are working toward the full implementation of boards of limited jurisdiction as new mode of governance. Elementary schools are initiating the president-principal model of school governance that is in place at Catholic secondary schools. Archdiocesan schools have been placed under the jurisdiction of the Superintendent of Catholic Schools in place of the parish pastor. Several schools have appointed development directors to expand the revenue base beyond tuition and parish investment. Nearly all schools introduced a technology-supported curriculum. In addition, Catholic school teachers have been provided with increased opportunities for professional development.</p>
<p>At the same time, Catholic schools are facing a severe financial crisis that has constrained their reform efforts. Many of these Catholic schools have been forced to close or consolidate with neighboring Catholic schools. Families in the inner city have faced a particularly onerous financial burden in trying to afford the tuition Catholic schools require to keep operating.</p>
<p>In order to enable comparisons between achievement gains in Chicago’s public and Catholic schools, data similar to that obtained in the public schools were collected in CCS. Analyses of these data became known as the Chicago Catholic School Study (CCSS).</p>
<p>In the face of the major changes in school governance, structure, organization, curriculum, and school culture in both CPS and CCS, an analysis of sector effects on academic achievement in contemporary Catholic and public schools is needed to determine how these changes may have affected persistent educational inequalities.</p>

<title>School Sector and the Common School Ideal</title>
<p>The American public school system was established to provide all students with equal opportunities to develop their intellectual, social, and moral abilities to enable them to contribute to the common good and act as an integrative influence on society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0038040711431586">Tyack and Cuban 1995</xref>). The goal of creating equality of educational opportunities for all students became known as the common school ideal or the common school effect. Achievement of this goal depends on three factors: open admissions policies, access to a common curriculum, and insulation of students from the negative influence of background on achievement.</p>
<p>Theoretically, the United States has provided open admissions to tax-supported public schools since their founding. However, in practice, many students were excluded from a free public school education when public schools were first established. Before the middle of the nineteenth century, legislation in many states, both North and South, denied African American students the right to enroll in an all-white public school. Before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0038040711431586"><italic>Brown vs. Board of Education</italic> (1954)</xref>, black students were granted access only to racially segregated schools. Before the passage of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) of 1975, U.S. public schools enrolled only about one out of five children with physical, intellectual, or emotional disabilities. Even after subsequent amendments to IDEA requiring public schools to provide an education for all disabled students commensurate with their capabilities, many were mainstreamed into average classrooms but did not receive instruction tailored to their learning needs. Moreover, before No Child Left Behind (NCLB) legislation went into effect in 2002, schools were not held accountable for raising the achievement of various subgroups of students, such as low achievers, English language learners, and disabled students.</p>
<p>Over time, CPS made progress toward open admissions as it implemented federal and state laws governing access to public schools. Yet, obstacles to open admissions remain. For example, in principle, all students in CPS have the right to choose a magnet school or a charter school, but in practice, since transportation is typically not provided, attendance is difficult or impossible for many students.</p>
<p>CCS set their own admissions policies. Nearly all Chicago Catholic schools have some restrictions on admissions, and some Catholic schools, typically those with higher socioeconomic status (SES) composition, are fairly selective. Admission is determined by scores on a test administered toward the end of eighth grade.</p>
<p>History reveals why Catholic schools set academic standards for admission. The Catholic school system was established soon after the public school system in response to the Protestant orientation of the public school curriculum. The Church encouraged parents to send their children to Catholic schools in order to learn about their religion in addition to secular subjects. The schools had no formal admissions policies other than affiliation with the parish church.</p>
<p>By the beginning of the twentieth century, the school-aged population, including many immigrants from Catholic countries in Europe, expanded rapidly and the number of Catholic schools increased to accommodate the population growth. The economic, social, and cognitive diversity of the American population led to the establishment of selective Catholic schools noted for their academic excellence while also staffing less prestigious but successful parish and independent schools.</p>
<p>When the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) urged Catholics to renew their commitment to serving the disadvantaged, Catholic educators channeled many of their resources to inner-city schools. This occurred at a time when the Church was experiencing an unprecedented exodus of priests, brothers, and nuns from their religious communities. Since these members of religious orders had donated their teaching services to the Church, their departure significantly increased the costs of staffing Catholic schools. White flight led many urban schools to lose enrollment, and financing both urban and inner-city schools became an unsupportable burden.</p>
<p>Catholic schools began to accept non-Catholic students, non–English-speaking students, students with weak academic backgrounds, and children with mild special needs. Besides providing much needed tuition, accepting a more heterogeneous student body had the added benefit of creating a diverse, multicultural learning environment for all students in a school. As a result of less restrictive admissions policies, the student composition of today’s CCS bears a greater resemblance to that of CPS than in the past. Both school sectors have a higher proportion of minority, underprivileged, and at-risk students and a smaller proportion of white students than the nation as a whole.</p>
<p>The second indicator of adherence to the common school ideal is access to a high-quality curriculum. CPS allows students to choose from a variety of required academic courses, ranging in difficulty from basic to advanced placement, as well as a limited number of elective courses. Unfortunately, low-achieving, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and minority students often are assigned to low ability classes, which are seen to provide an inferior instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038040711431586">Hallinan, 1994</xref>). Moreover, since some courses are sequential, students who do not take a required course in a given year may lose the opportunity to enroll in that course and the remaining courses in the sequence.</p>
<p>CCS schools require that all the students they admit, regardless of prior achievement, take a challenging academic program of study. The content of the curriculum is determined at the Archdiocesan level. Unlike CPS, the demands of CCS curriculum leave Catholic school students with few opportunities for electives. Differences in the curriculum requirements of CPS and CCS suggest that CCS may offer their students more academic instruction than their peers in CPS receive. The exception may be elite public and Catholic schools that have a fairly similar and rigorous academic curriculum.</p>
<p>A third indicator of adherence to the common school ideal is the extent to which a school reduces the influence of student-ascribed characteristics on academic achievement. Researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038040711431586">Coleman et al. 1982b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0038040711431586">Coleman and Hoffer 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0038040711431586">Greeley 1982</xref>) argued that a positive relationship between student background and achievement indicates that the school exacerbates educational inequalities. Their analyses of the longitudinal HSB data show that black, Hispanic, and low SES students have higher achievement in Catholic schools than in public schools and that the association between background characteristics and achievement is smaller in Catholic schools. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038040711431586">Bryk et al. (1993)</xref> reached the same conclusion based on their analyses of HSB. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0038040711431586">Greeley’s (1982)</xref> research also showed that the academic advantage of Catholic schools is greatest for disadvantaged and minority students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038040711431586">Morgan’s (2001)</xref> analysis of the NELS:88 data similarly support these findings, as does research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0038040711431586">Morgan and Winship (2007)</xref>.</p>
<p>Yet, other studies of the association between background and achievement reveal mixed results. Controlling for prior achievement and background variables in NELS:88, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0038040711431586">Hoffer (1998)</xref> found no special academic benefits for minority or low SES students in Catholic schools. Based on the ELS survey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0038040711431586">Carbonaro and Covay (2010)</xref> reported that SES, race, and ethnicity have a similar effect on availability of courses and student achievement in Catholic and public schools.</p>
<p>The effect of school sector on student test scores, access to a quality curriculum, and the influence of student background on achievement are critical equity issues. Available research fails to satisfactorily address these issues, particularly for upper-elementary and middle school students in contemporary schools. The aim of this study is to determine whether the Chicago public and Catholic middle schools differ in their adherence to the common school ideal as determined by the educational opportunities they offer their students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0038040711431586" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The first set of analyses in this article examines sector differences in gains in student achievement in sixth and eighth grades and in reading and mathematics. The statistical model used is identical in all four cases, both in its mathematics form and in the student- and school-level variables included in the model. The second set of analyses relies on the achievement results as well as school policies to investigate sector differences in adherence to the common school ideal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0038040711431586">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Principals in all the public and Catholic schools in the city of Chicago were asked to participate in the Chicago School Study. If a principal approved, a survey was administered to sixth- and eighth-grade students in the public schools in 2001 and the Catholic schools in 2004. The survey included extensive information on teacher and student characteristics, attitudes, and behaviors. Approximately 75 percent of the public school principals and 85 percent of Catholic school principals agreed to take part in the study. Students in participating schools could decline to respond to the survey questionnaire, but on average, 80 percent of public students and 90 percent of Catholic students agreed to participate. On the whole, 65 percent of all the sixth- and eighth-grade public school students and 80 percent of the sixth- and eighth-grade Catholic school students in the city of Chicago responded to the survey.</p>
<p>Student standardized test scores and other information were collected from school records. These data were available for more than 98 percent of all public school students in every grade. In the absence of test scores in the target grades in the Catholic schools, a special achievement test was administered. Only three schools declined to give the test, and student cooperation in the other schools averaged 99 percent.</p>
<sec id="section5-0038040711431586">
<title>Nonparticipation Bias</title>
<p>Bias may arise if the schools participating in the survey are not representative of the population of Chicago schools or if the students surveyed in those schools are not representative of their school. Within-school nonresponse in terms of test scores is not an issue given the high participation rates.</p>
<p>CCSR examined public school participation, comparing the schools in the study with the population of Chicago public schools on percentage of low-income students in the school, percentage of students scoring at or above national norms, and racial composition. They concluded that “the sample of schools participating in the survey is generally representative of Chicago Public Schools as a whole” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038040711431586">CCSR 2004</xref>:13). Catholic school participation was examined by comparing schools participating in both the survey and the achievement test with all Chicago Catholic schools in terms of percentage of low-income students in the school, percentage of Catholic students, and racial composition. No statistically significant differences in those distributions were found. Therefore, the survey data for both sectors contain no significant response bias due to school nonparticipation.</p>
<p>At the student level, CCSR compared survey respondents in a school to the general population of students in that school on test scores, socioeconomic status, gender, and race. They report that “In most schools, there were only small differences between survey participants and the total population . . . in the school” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038040711431586">CCSR 2004</xref>:18). They note some exceptions due to achievement scores but conclude that this “does not pose a problem if analysis . . . is done using multilevel statistical techniques” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038040711431586">CCSR:2004</xref>:19-20). For Catholic school students, comparisons were made on test scores and gender (no measure of race or socioeconomic status was available except for survey information). No significant differences in gender distribution or mean reading or mathematics achievement were found. Little difference in response rates by achievement within schools was found. Using multilevel statistical techniques to analyze the data alleviates any nonparticipation bias in the analysis.</p>

<sec id="section6-0038040711431586">
<title>Missing Data</title>
<p>Cases with missing school or student data were dropped from the analyses. The greatest source of missing data is due to the skip pattern on the survey. Half the students were instructed to answer questions about their reading/language arts class and the other half about their mathematics class. If there is bias due to this skip pattern, it is identical for both sectors and will have no effect on sector comparisons.</p>
<p>The only other source of unusual amounts of missing data is due to race. For public schools, race is recorded by school administrators as the standard five-category measure. For Catholic schools, race is self-reported and, in addition to the usual five categories, includes “Biracial/Multiracial” and “Other.” For the analyses reported here, “Biracial/Multiracial” and “Other” were dropped from the analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0038040711431586">1</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section7-0038040711431586">
<title>Selection Bias</title>
<p>In public and Catholic school comparisons, a common finding is that the students more likely to attend Catholics schools also are more likely to have higher achievement. The estimated sector gap in most studies is in favor of Catholic schools, and estimates of the size of this gap are typically reduced toward zero when selection effects are modeled.</p>
<p>Techniques to control for selection bias are not a panacea. The corrected estimators are unbiased, but this does not guarantee that corrected estimates from any single sample will be closer to the true value of the parameter than the uncorrected estimates. Indeed, there are situations in which it is likely that the corrected estimates will be further from the true value than the uncorrected estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0038040711431586">Stolzenberg and Relles 1997</xref>). Correction techniques should be used only after considering the particular analysis and concluding that the uncontrolled estimates are apt to be affected by bias.</p>
<p>The analyses in this article show no sector gap in achievement in three of the four grade/subject combinations. In the fourth case, the estimated effect of Catholic schools is negative. It is implausible to suggest that the negative effect is a result of selection bias, as that implies higher achieving students in Chicago are more likely to choose public schools instead of Catholic schools. Given the absence of the usual sector gap in achievement, it is unlikely that these results are substantially affected by selection bias. It is exactly in such situations, where selection effects are weak, that attempts to control for selection bias are more likely to result in poorer coefficient estimates. Therefore, no attempt is made to control for selection effects in these analyses.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section8-0038040711431586">
<title>Statistical Model</title>
<p>Since students are clustered within schools, both student and school characteristics affect achievement. In this situation, a multilevel model provides the most accurate parameter estimates, with individual student factors in the level 1 equation and school factors in the level 2 equation. Multilevel models also can provide within-school estimates of effects, thereby controlling for the possible bias due to differences in between-school response rates.</p>
<p>Four models, identical in structure, are estimated in these analyses. The only differences among the models are whether the dependent variable is reading or mathematics in sixth or eighth grade. The mathematics equations for the model used in these analyses are shown in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0038040711431586">appendix.</xref> Previous research indicates that some, but not all, of the factors that affect student achievement are the same in both sectors. Therefore, to more accurately estimate effects and mean sector differences, the model includes all sector interactions. Of particular interest in this analysis is whether sector interacts with race, SES, and previous achievement to assess which sector more closely adheres to the common school ideal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0038040711431586">2</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section9-0038040711431586">
<title>Dependent Variable: Achievement Gains</title>
<p>This analysis investigates the predictors of growth in achievement over a single school year. Since achievement gains are estimated separately for sixth and eighth graders and for reading and mathematics, four models are presented. Student achievement is measured by scale scores from standardized tests. Scale scores are designed to be an identical metric of performance across different test forms and grades for tests provided by a single testing company in a single subject.</p>
<p>The public school students in the Chicago School Study took the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS) while the Catholic school students took the Terra Nova (TN). In general, test scores are not strictly comparable across different standardized tests due to differences in content and format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0038040711431586">Feuer et al. 1999</xref>). Yet, it is possible to link ITBS and TN scores and convert scores on one test to scores on the other under certain conditions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0038040711431586">Kolen and Brennan (2004</xref>:433) indicate that “the utility and reasonableness of any linking depends upon the degree to which tests share common features.”</p>
<p>Both the ITBS and the TN are similar on the four criteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0038040711431586">Kolen and Brennan (2004</xref>:433-34) list: the inferences drawn from the test scores, the content measured by the test, the population for which the test is designed, and the test format and administration. Both tests are standardized achievement tests, divided into specific content areas. Questions are designed for schoolchildren at a particular grade level based on learning theory and school curricula from around the United States. The tests are nationally normed and used by schools and teachers to identify levels of student achievement as well as particular content areas in which students are excelling or struggling. Because of the high degree of similarity, linking the tests is reasonable and useful.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0038040711431586">3</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section10-0038040711431586">
<title>Independent Variables: Student Level</title>
<p>The student-level variables in the model allow investigation of sector differences in achievement gains and in sector adherence to the common school ideal. Controlling for a student’s previous achievement is necessary to assess whether there is a Catholic school advantage. Comparing the effects of student race, SES, and previous achievement on achievement gains by sector will reveal where these background effects are smaller, revealing which sector more closely emulates a common school model. Other student-level variables in the model are age, two social psychological measures (mastery and safety), and two measures of behavior (homework and misbehavior).</p>
<p>Theoretically and in previous empirical research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038040711431586">Bryk et al. 1993</xref>), student attitudes and behaviors act as mediating variables between sector and achievement. Catholic schools are generally believed to inculcate prosocial attitudes and behaviors to a greater extent than public schools, and these attitudes and behaviors then act to increase student achievement. A complete investigation of all effects of Catholic schools on achievement would be needed to examine these indirect effects.</p>
<p>However, while such effects would be an advantage of Catholic schools, they are not part of <italic>the Catholic school advantage</italic>. Since the early work of Coleman, that has been defined as the unexplained sector difference in student outcomes. Efforts to explain the Catholic school advantage have relied on factors such as student attitudes, motivation, and effort, that is, factors that have a different effect by sector. Following that research, the present analysis controls for some of those factors in order to determine if a Catholic school advantage remains in middle school grades.</p>
<sec id="section11-0038040711431586">
<title>Demographics</title>
<p>Gender is coded from administrative records for both public and Catholic schools. Student gender is measured as a dummy variable coded 1 for female and 0 for male. As discussed previously, race is obtained from administrative records for public schools and self-reports for Catholic schools. It is coded as two dummy variables, with 1 for black on one variable and 1 for Hispanic on the other variable, with white the comparison group.</p>

<sec id="section12-0038040711431586">
<title>Socioeconomic status</title>
<p>Indicators of family income or mother’s education are preferred measures of SES. However, when this information on SES is unavailable, as is often the case with student data, home resources is often used as a proxy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0038040711431586">Gamoran and Kelly 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0038040711431586">Entwisle, Alexander, and Olson (1997)</xref> indicate that fewer home resources is a result of poverty and low parental education, and these resources have been shown to affect educational success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0038040711431586">Teachman 1987</xref>). In this study, there is no measure of family income and more information about parental education is missing data than is desirable, hence home resources is used to measure SES. The indicators include a quiet place to study, a daily newspaper, a magazine subscription, an encyclopedia, an atlas, a dictionary, a computer, Internet access, more than 50 books in the house, and having one’s own room. There is no compelling reason to weight these indicators. The number of these resources is summed and ranges from 0 to 10.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0038040711431586">4</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section13-0038040711431586">
<title>Previous achievement</title>
<p>The models estimated in this study analyze growth in achievement by controlling for the previous year’s achievement. Fifth-grade test scores are used in the sixth-grade analyses and seventh-grade test scores are used in the eighth-grade analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0038040711431586">
<title>Age</title>
<p>Student age is measured in years. This variable has been centered separately for sixth and eighth graders. A value of 0 for a sixth grader indicates that the student turned 12 on January 1 of the year being studied, and a value of 0 indicates an eighth grader turned 14 on January 1.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0038040711431586">
<title>Mastery</title>
<p>Student feelings of confidence that they can master their academic classes have been shown to influence achievement growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0038040711431586">Pajares and Schunk 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0038040711431586">Pintrich and De Groot 1990</xref>). Mastery is measured by the item, “I am certain I can master the skills taught in this class.” Half the surveyed students were asked this question about their reading/language arts class and the other half about their mathematics class. Possible answers were <italic>strongly disagree, disagree, agree</italic>, and <italic>strongly agree</italic>, coded 1 to 4, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0038040711431586">
<title>Homework</title>
<p>Research reports a positive effect of homework completion on achievement gains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0038040711431586">Aksoy and Link 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0038040711431586">Eren and Henderson 2008</xref>). In this analysis, students were asked, “About how often do you complete your homework for this class?” As with mastery, half the surveyed students were asked this question about their reading/language arts class, half were asked about their mathematics class. Possible answers were almost never, about half the time, most of the time, and all of the time, coded 1 to 4, respectively. While mastery and homework are treated as endogenous variables in many analyses, they are viewed simply as controls in this study. Since they are not part of the theory underlying the research, their causal order is less relevant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0038040711431586">
<title>Safety</title>

In this study, students were asked, “How safe do you feel in the hallways and bathrooms of the school?” Possible answers were <italic>not safe, somewhat safe, mostly safe</italic>, and <italic>very safe</italic>, coded 1 to 4, respectively.</p>

<title>Independent Variables: School Level</title>
<sec id="section20-0038040711431586">
<title>School sector</title>
<p>Measured as a dummy variable, school sector is coded 0 if the student is in a public school and 1 if the student is in a Catholic school. The models specify that sector affects the slopes and intercepts of the student-level variables. In addition, sector is interacted with the school-level variable, proportion of students in poverty, to capture differential sector effects of that school characteristic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0038040711431586">
<title>School poverty</title>
<p>The proportion of students in a school who received free or reduced price lunch is used as an indicator of school-level poverty. In these analyses, school poverty and any variables related to it are treated as controls in modeling achievement gains. While group centering or grand-mean centering is generally useful in estimating multilevel models because it aids estimation and interpretation, it is not as useful for the free/reduced lunch variable because the sector means are different and there are many more public schools than Catholic schools in Chicago. Thus, the mean of this variable is weighted heavily toward the public school mean, rendering it less useful for Catholic school interpretation. This problem is eliminated by centering the variable at 0.70, a plausible value for both public and Catholic schools because it is within one standard deviation of both sector means.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0038040711431586">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The proportion of students on free and reduced lunch in the school has a significantly nonlinear effect in most of the four models. Inclusion of the quadratic term and its sector interaction significantly improved the fit of most models above the fit of the linear term and its sector interaction. The same was true for the cubic term and interaction. These linear, quadratic, and cubic terms are highly collinear, thus the estimates of these effects do not show as being statistically significant in the tables. While there is no conceptual reason for adding these terms, they do significantly improve the fit of the models (in every case, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .005, results not shown). The individual coefficients do not appear to be statistically significant in the tables because the square and cube terms are highly collinear with each other and with the linear term, with the usual consequence of inflated standard errors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0038040711431586">6</xref></sup></p>

<p>The gender distribution is similar in both sectors, with slightly more females than males in the sample. The racial distribution differs between sectors. The public school data include 45 percent black, 42 percent Hispanic, and 13 percent white students compared to 16 percent black, 27 percent Hispanic, and 57 percent white students in the Catholic schools. The measure of race in Catholic schools and the requirements of these analyses result in fewer black students in the analytic sample than in the larger Catholic school population, which is 24 percent black, 27 percent Hispanic, and 43 percent white.</p>
<p>The SES of sixth-grade students is higher in CCS than in CPS. Catholic school students are younger, report greater confidence that they can master the skills taught in their English/language arts course, and are more likely to complete their homework than their public school peers. Students in Catholic schools also feel safer in school and have lower rates of serious misbehavior than public school students. In addition, sixth-grade students in Catholic schools are more homogeneous than their public school counterparts as indicated by the standard deviations for SES, age, mastery, homework, safety, and misbehavior, which are all smaller in the Catholic schools than in the public schools. This is not due simply to truncation, since students at both ends of these distributions are found in Catholic and public schools.</p>
<p>A large sector difference in mean school poverty is seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0038040711431586">Table 1a</xref>. In public schools, the mean school poverty is 85 percent (.70 + .15) compared to 45 percent (.70 − .25) in Catholic schools. Little truncation occurs in these distributions as the range of school poverty varies from 5 percent to 100 percent in the public schools and from 0 percent to 100 percent in the Catholic schools. Given the higher school poverty in the CPS compared to CCS, one might expect smaller achievement gains in the public schools since SES and achievement are positively correlated. Yet the achievement differences between the two sectors are remarkably small. It may be that after years of systematic reform, CPS have improved to the point of reducing the Catholic school advantage.</p>
<p>Descriptive data for the eighth-grade reading analyses, shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0038040711431586">Table 1b</xref>, are similar to those for sixth grade for both students and schools. A notable difference is the mean growth in eighth-grade reading achievement, which is almost identical for public and Catholic school students.</p>

<p>The descriptive statistics for mathematics found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0038040711431586">Table1b</xref> are similar to those for reading. Gains in student achievement again provide the greatest dissimilarity between grades. In sixth-grade mathematics, Catholic school students increase their test scores, on average, about 3 points more than public school students. However, in eighth grade, public school students increase their mean test scores in mathematics by almost 5 points more than Catholic school students. In general, the bivariate statistics in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0038040711431586">Tables 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0038040711431586">1b</xref> suggest that in the absence of controlling and mediating factors, the Catholic school advantage found in earlier research on high school students holds for students in sixth and eighth grade in contemporary public and Catholic schools in Chicago.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0038040711431586">Table 2a</xref> shows that on average, 6th-grade females gain 2.38 points more in reading than males, all else constant. This result is consistent with NAEP findings for reading in 4th, 8th, and 12th grades. The model shows that the typical female gains 2.38 points more in 6th-grade reading than the typical male. In 8th grade, males gain 1.55 points more than females. No statistically significant sector effect for gender is found in 6th grade. However, in 8th grade, Catholic school females gain 5.80 points more than public school females. As a result, gains in 8th-grade reading scores for Catholic school females are, on average, 4.25 (5.80 − 1.55) points higher than Catholic school males. Surprisingly, in 8th-grade reading, males outperform females by 1.55 points. This finding may be an anomaly, since Catholic school females outperform males by 4.45 (5.80 − 1.55) points, a finding that is more consistent with other studies, including NAEP.</p>
<p>Black and Hispanic students have significantly slower growth in reading than white students in both sixth and eighth grades. Blacks score 4 points less than whites in sixth grade and 3 points less in eighth grade. Hispanics fall behind their white peers by almost 3 points in sixth grade and by 4.5 points in eighth grade. The interaction between race and school sector indicates that the test scores of blacks in Catholic schools do not differ significantly from blacks and Hispanics in public schools but are higher than those of whites in public schools. The estimated positive effect of being in a Catholic school is stronger for black students than for white students. The positive effects for Catholic school Hispanics offset the overall negative effects of being Hispanic. Most Hispanic students in Catholic schools suffer little or no disadvantage due to race in their growth in reading achievement relative to their white peers.</p>
<p>Higher SES students make significantly greater gains in reading in both sixth and eighth grades than lower SES students. The effect of SES for sixth graders in a Catholic school is not statistically different from its effect in a public school. However, in eighth grade, the interaction of sector and SES has the opposite sign (−1.19) and approximately the same magnitude as the public school effect (.86). Thus, the model shows that SES has virtually no effect on growth in achievement in eighth-grade reading in Catholic schools. In other words, unlike in public schools, economic disadvantage is not an obstacle to learning reading in eighth-grade Catholic schools. Prior achievement has a positive effect in both sixth and eighth grade in public and Catholic schools.</p>
<p>Being younger than the mean age for sixth or eighth grade has a statistically significant negative effect on achievement gains, likely due to maturation. No sector influence is found. Students’ belief that they can master the curriculum has a positive and statistically significant effect on reading gains in both grades, with no significant sector effect. Doing homework has a positive effect on reading and mathematics achievement in sixth grade but no effect in eighth grade. The value of homework is frequently questioned by educators and parents, and these results indicate that the age of students may be an important consideration in determining its utility. No sector effect of doing homework is found.</p>
<p>Feeling safe in school has no effect on achievement in either grade. However, feeling safe in a Catholic school has a statistically significant positive effect on reading gains. It may be that Catholic school students rely more on the order and discipline of their schools while public school students may be better able to filter out threatening disruptions that would distract them from learning. Misbehavior negatively affects achievement in both Catholic and public schools in both grades.</p>

Because these analyses grand-mean center the student-level variables, the typical student has an effective value of zero on all student-level independent variables in the model. Hence, differences in predicted achievement are entirely due to sector differences in achievement growth.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0038040711431586">Figure 1a</xref>, the almost coinciding solid and dashed lines show that the effect of school poverty on sixth-grade reading is similar in public and Catholic schools. The typical student achieves a test score of approximately 225 points at school poverty levels between 0 percent and about 70 percent. Predicted test scores gradually decline to about 221 points in schools with all of the students on free/reduced lunch.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0038040711431586">Figure 1b</xref> shows the response of eighth-grade students to level of school poverty. For public school students, reading achievement declines almost linearly as school-level poverty increases. As expected, the typical public school eighth grader attains the highest reading scores in schools with no poverty and the lowest scores in schools where all students qualify for free/reduced lunch. The effects of poverty are less straightforward in Catholic schools. The best performing Catholic schools are those with 15 percent to 20 percent of their students on free/reduced lunch, and the poorest performing Catholic schools have about 75 percent to 80 percent of their students on free/reduced lunch. Surprisingly, eighth-grade students in Catholic schools with more than 90 percent poverty not only have higher predicted test scores than their public school counterparts but also have higher predicted test scores than students in Catholic schools where 65 percent to 90 percent of students in poverty. This unanticipated finding may be due to the intense effort of Catholic schools to improve the performance of their most disadvantaged students as they prepare them for high school. It also may imply that CCS are more skilled than CPS at providing remedial and basic reading instruction for the lowest performing eighth-grade students.</p>
<p>On the whole, the relationship between level of school poverty and gains in reading achievement in sixth and eighth grades shows no noteworthy advantage for either public or Catholic schools. In sixth grade, gains in achievement are almost identical in both sectors at all levels of school poverty. In eighth grade, Catholic schools show an advantage at certain levels of school poverty, but a disadvantage at other levels.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0038040711431586">Table 2b</xref> presents a multilevel model for growth in mathematics achievement. At level 1, in both sixth and eighth grades, being female has a statistically significant, negative effect on gains in mathematics compared to males, with the effect being more pronounced in eighth grade. No significant sector differences are observed for boys or girls.</p>
<p>Being black has a statistically significant negative effect on growth in mathematics in sixth grade compared to whites, falling behind them by almost 4 points. However, in eighth grade, blacks do not have smaller gains in mathematics than whites. Examining sector interactions, being black in sixth grade in a Catholic school does not significantly change the negative effect of race seen in public schools. However, being black in eighth grade in a Catholic school results in significantly lower test scores than being black in a public school. On average, the gains of Catholic school black students are less than those of Catholic school white students by 5.74 points (−3.93 − 1.81) in sixth grade and by 7.75 points (−1.00 − 6.75) in eighth grade.</p>
<p>Hispanic students in sixth and eighth grades have smaller gains in mathematics than white students, although the differences are not significant. The mathematics gains for Hispanics in Catholic school are even smaller, and significantly so in eighth grade. Hispanic students in Catholic schools, on average, lag behind whites by 2.64 points in sixth grade and 4.23 points in eighth grade.</p>
<p>Students with higher SES have greater gains in mathematics than students with lower SES in both sixth and eighth grades. Unlike reading gains, the effect of SES on growth in mathematics does not differ significantly by sector in either grade. For public sixth- and eighth-grade students, the higher the previous test score, the greater the gains in mathematics. For Catholic school students in both grades, the effect of prior achievement on mathematics gains is not as strong as in public schools, although the difference is significant only in eighth grade. The direct effects on mathematics of SES, previous test score, age, mastery, homework, safety, and misbehavior follow a pattern similar to their effects on reading scores.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0038040711431586">Figure 2a</xref> shows that the average public school student in sixth grade achieves the highest mathematics scores in a school with 0 percent poverty and the lowest scores in a school with 100 percent poverty. In Catholic schools, the effect is nonlinear. In sixth grade in schools with between 20 percent and 80 percent on free/reduced lunch, little or no difference in achievement is seen between public and Catholic school students. Students in Catholic schools with less than 20 percent of students on free/reduced lunch are predicted to have lower achievement than similar students in public schools. For schools with over 80 percent poverty, Catholic school students are predicted to have higher achievement than public school students. The best performance of CCS is in schools with the highest percentage of poor students. In general, the mean difference between public and Catholic school growth in sixth-grade mathematics achievement is negligible (0.02 points).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0038040711431586">Figure 2b</xref> shows the effects of school poverty on eighth-grade mathematics achievement. For public schools, the general trend is much like that seen in the sixth grade. Increasing school poverty has a small negative effect on mathematics achievement. Unlike the three previous analyses, a sector difference is seen in eighth-grade mathematics achievement. The difference in gains favors public schools by 3.87 points, or approximately 32 percent of the mean annual gain.</p>
<p>In terms of the effects of student background on mathematics gains, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0038040711431586">Table 2b</xref> shows no statistically significant sector differences in sixth grade. In eighth grade, however, student gains in mathematics in Catholic schools are affected more by student race, less by previous achievement, and similarly by SES as in public schools. On the whole, neither public nor Catholic schools show a clear advantage in reducing the effects of student background on mathematics gains.</p>
<p>The effect of being a racial minority is suggestive, as it is for reading. Although neither being black nor Hispanic has a statistically significant effect in sixth grade, those estimates are negative, as are the significant effects in eighth grade. In every case, the total estimated effect of race on growth in mathematics achievement in Catholic schools is more negative than in public schools. This indicates that while neither sector shows success at ameliorating the negative effects of race on mathematics achievement, Catholic schools show more success than public schools.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study investigated whether the Catholic school advantage previously found in Catholic high schools also characterizes contemporary middle schools. The research also examined the extent to which Catholic and public schools approximate the common school ideal. The analyses are based on data from the Catholic and public schools in the city of Chicago.</p>
<p>The findings show that neither public nor Catholic schools in Chicago can claim consistently higher gains in test scores in reading or mathematics in sixth and eighth grades. In sixth grade, gains in reading are almost identical in both sectors at all levels of school poverty. In eighth grade, Catholic schools have a slight achievement advantage, but in both sectors, differences in gains resulting from school poverty dwarf any overall sector differences.</p>
<p>Similarly, the results for growth in mathematics achievement in sixth grade show no general advantage for either public or Catholic schools in Chicago. However, in eighth grade, public schools have a clear advantage. At all levels of school poverty, the typical public school student in eighth grade is predicted to have greater gains in mathematics than if the student were in a Catholic school.</p>
<p>In examining sector effects on adherence to the common school ideal, the analyses indicate that certain educational practices and policies on the part of both school sectors conflict with the equal learning opportunities that underlie the common school ideal. Many Chicago Catholic schools have admissions policies that exclude students who do not meet their standards. These standards may include previous achievement, religion, and level of disability. Moreover, Catholic schools generally charge tuition, which makes enrollment prohibitive for many families. The entrance requirements of Catholic schools are inconsistent with the common school ideal. In contrast, Chicago public schools have open admissions. All students, regardless of personal characteristics, are guaranteed enrollment and, in principle, equal access to learning opportunities, as consistent with the common school ideal.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the study shows that the Chicago Catholic schools are more successful than the public schools at reducing the deleterious effects of background characteristics on reading achievement. This implies that opportunities to learn in school are more inclusive in Catholic schools than in public schools. Once disadvantaged students have been admitted to a Catholic school, they have more opportunities to learn reading than in public schools because their background does not create a barrier to taking advantage of learning opportunities. While this is true for reading in this study, it is not the case for mathematics. Neither sector removes the negative effects of background on mathematics achievement. These results indicate that in public and Catholic schools in Chicago, approximation to the common school ideal is subject and grade specific and cannot be regarded as a school characteristic.</p>
<p>The findings of this study raise important educational questions. Based on the results reported here, one may ask how two school systems, different in numerous ways, can produce similar achievement results, at least at the middle school level. Research has focused on what Catholic schools do well, including establishing a school community, enforcing order and discipline, and creating a strong academic culture. Yet, if these are areas in which Catholic schools have an advantage, one can ask what explains the equal, sometimes superior, performance of public schools. Since the Chicago public schools underwent a decade of significant school reform prior to this study, it is likely that these and other reforms, such as NCLB, are having a positive impact on student achievement. Evidence of this would be if the test scores of public school students caught up with or surpassed those of Catholic school students.</p>
<p>Any discussion of the common school ideal should note that this concept extends beyond academic achievement to a broader definition of learning. Both public and Catholic schools seek to instill appropriate norms and values in their students, yet they do so in different ways. Public schools aim to create a broadly defined democratic citizenship while Catholic schools explicitly train students in a strong, specific faith tradition. Examining how this difference in the mission of Chicago CPS and CCS affects learning outcomes would make an important contribution to the debate on school sector effects.</p>
<p>Findings on school sector effects cannot be generalized automatically to schools across the country or even to all urban schools. However, with caution, some generalizations from the Chicago school analyses may be justified for three reasons. First, the Chicago public and Catholic schools are in a single city and share a common social, political, and economic climate. This reduces sector differences caused by macro-external factors. Second, the Chicago public and Catholic school systems are among the largest in the country. The size of CPS and CCS makes inferences from the Chicago study more accurate. Finally, Catholic school students in Chicago form a larger than usual percentage of the Catholic school-age population than in the country as a whole. Thus, although there are still large differences between the Chicago public and Catholic school student populations, Chicago Catholic school students include a broader segment of the population than most other Catholic school studies. With caution, then, one may generalize the findings of this study to Catholic and public middle schools in urban environments throughout the country. Consequently, the Chicago schools can inform both sociological understanding and school policy, particularly in the area of sector comparisons.</p>
<p>Recent reforms in the Chicago public and Catholic schools seem to be playing a significant role in reducing inequalities in educational opportunities. Yet, poverty continues to be a formidable obstacle to student learning and the goal of making progress toward the common school ideal. Only ongoing research can determine the extent to which school poverty interacts with school sector to facilitate or obstruct student achievement.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-0038040711431586">
<label>1.</label>
<p>For eighth-grade Catholic school students, removing biracial and other students does not have a severe effect on the sample. Only about 7 percent of these students were dropped because the student left the item blank or identified themselves as biracial. For sixth-grade students, however, 23.5 percent of the students did not have a single race classification. This affects the results in two ways. First, although the descriptive statistics are an accurate representation of the analytic samples, the distributions are not directly comparable between sectors. If the public school measure of race was used in the Catholic school data, most cases dropped from the Catholic school sample would be reported as black and some would be reported as Hispanic. Thus, the Catholic school racial distribution in these analyses shows a lower percentage minority than would be seen in a distribution of the same students if they were classified using the standard race measure.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-0038040711431586">
<label>2.</label>
<p>Second, the parameter estimates in the models may be affected. Students who self-identify as biracial may have higher achievement than those who self-identify as black or Hispanic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0038040711431586">Herman 2009</xref>). Previous research shows that being a racial minority has a negative effect on achievement. The Catholic school analyses includes only students that self-identify as a single race, and thus are unaffected by this issue. The public school analyses include students who might have self-identified as biracial but are classified as a single race, and thus these estimates of race effects, particularly for black, may be biased.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-0038040711431586">
<label>3.</label>
<p>However, if there is any such bias in the public school estimates, it does not affect the substantive conclusions of this article. Consistent with previous literature, the analyses show negative and statistically significant effects of minority status. If they include an upward bias for the public schools, the true effects will still be negative and statistically significant and biased toward zero.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0038040711431586">
<label>4.</label>
<p>School poverty is the only level 2 variable included in the model. No consistently significant contextual effects of the student-level variables were observed. The effects of three school-level teacher quality indicators were examined. These contextual variables included the proportion of teachers with more than a B.A., the mean years of teaching experience, and the mean number of credit hours teachers had in the subject they primarily taught. None of these three variables had statistically significant effects. As mentioned, school sector was interacted with all the variables in the model.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-0038040711431586">
<label>5.</label>
<p>Terra Nova (TN) scale scores were converted to Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS) scale scores using a form of equipercentile equating methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0038040711431586">Kolen and Brennan 2004</xref>:36-9). Catholic school students were assigned the ITBS scale score that corresponded to the national percentile score they achieved on the TN. This assignment was done separately for each grade and subtest. As a check on the comparability of results, the analytic models presented in the body of the article have been estimated for Catholic school students using both the original and the converted scale scores. The substantive conclusions reached from both analyses are identical. Thus, the use of converted scale scores for the Catholic schools in the analyses does not threaten the validity of the slope estimates.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-0038040711431586">
<label>6.</label>
<p>The use of converted scale scores will affect the estimates of mean sector differences. Both ITBS and TN percentile scores are involved in the conversion, and those scores are normed from two different random samples. Random differences in those norming samples will lead to error in the estimated mean sector difference, purely by chance. This error is relatively small. For the fourth grade by subtest comparisons examined in this paper, the 95 percent confidence interval around the mean difference is always less than ±0.80 points.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-0038040711431586">
<label>7.</label>
<p>All student-level variables were tested for contextual effects. The student-level variables were group-mean centered, the school mean of the variable was included as school-level variable, and a significance test was run on the difference in the magnitude of these estimated effects. No variable showed significant contextual effects in more than one of the four models, nor were the significant contextual effects found primarily in any one subject/grade analysis. Thus, contextual effects are not a significant cause of gains in student achievement in these grades and subjects, and no contextual effects are estimated in the final models. Note that this finding also indicates that differential between-school response rates do not significantly bias the results. Thus, in the analyses shown, the student variables are grand-mean centered and included at the student level, but not included at the school level.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-0038040711431586">
<label>8.</label>
<p>The effects of all student variables are theoretically assumed to vary across schools, and thus a school-level error term is prescribed for every student-level effect. To simplify estimation, however, the variance components for both socioeconomic status and previous test score were excluded. Although these variances were statistically significant in most of the four models, their magnitude was invariably trivial, always accounting for less than 0.5 percent of the total variance.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn9-0038040711431586">
<label>9.</label>
<p>The inclusion of sector interactions with the effects of poverty means there is no single coefficient measuring the sector gap in achievement. Rather, the size of the sector difference fluctuates with the level of school poverty. The significant nonlinearity of the effect of poverty further complicates this comparison. However, a measure that is equivalent to the usual single coefficient estimate of sector difference can be computed from the model estimates. At any level of poverty, for any student, the student’s predicted achievement in public school and Catholic school can be calculated. Because of the model specification, the magnitude of the sector difference at any poverty level is the same for every student, regardless of the student’s characteristics, so only one calculation of sector difference is needed per value of poverty. The difference in the values of predicted achievement in public and Catholic school is the sector gap at that poverty level. Thus, the mean difference of the predicted values across the full range of poverty measures the mean sector gap in achievement, comparable to the estimated effect of a Catholic school dummy variable in a simpler model. This mean has been computed (over 101 data points from 0 to 100 percent school poverty) and is presented with the analyses.</p>
