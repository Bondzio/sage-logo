<p>In the post-industrial media landscape, oftentimes the concept of value in media refers to the economic worth that contributes to economic growth. Even political economists whose concern is the effects of a capitalist mode of production on culture emphasize the transformation of cultural objects into industrialized commodities. The overarching principle of all these discussions is based upon the economic value in media production. However, Göran Bolin argues there are different forms of value in media and society, which are created in the process of both production and consumption of media.</p>
<p><italic>Value and the Media: Cultural Production and Consumption in Digital Markets</italic> consists of seven separate chapters. Each chapter either separately or collectively presents the author’s theoretical arguments and empirical examples on value and media. The general background to his argument is discussed in Chapter One by delineating the changes and development of cultural industries over the past few decades. Bolin provides concepts and definitions including text, audience, media production and consumption in the process of marketization and digitization of media. In Chapter Two, the author presents his analytic model developed from the field model of Pierre Bourdieu. He elaborates Bourdieu’s field of cultural production related to fields of media consumption in an effort to fit the model to his purposes. In Chapter Three, the author develops his discussion on how the media industry has adopted new business models to show that new and old media have similarities in the way they are organized to produce value in media industries. In Chapter Four, the discussion moves on to the roles of media users as key features of contemporary media culture. Bolin concentrates on the labor of media users as a work of consumption that is beneficial to media and culture industries. Chapter Five is devoted to a discussion of new textual expressions and patterns of narration. This chapter explains how content can relate to the changes in business models of media industries. Chapter Six discusses the process of digitization and its impacts on the cultural industries and media commodities. In the last chapter, the author comes back to the concept of value in contemporary digital media markets. He summarizes his discussion of value in media by focusing on the dynamic relationship between aesthetic, social, and cultural value in media.</p>
<p>With the digitization of media industries, the business models of media industries and the process of value production have been changed. The author perceives value as a product of social relationship and activity, and argues that we need to understand there are similarities between new and old media in the production of value. Throughout the book, value in media production is discussed as a symbolic exchange that connects economic value and moral value rather than as use and exchange value. Bolin successfully analyzes how value in media is produced, and how it works to affect media practices in production and consumption under the current digitalized media landscape.</p>
