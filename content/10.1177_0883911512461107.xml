<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There are two primary skin aging processes, intrinsic and extrinsic. Variations in individual genetic background govern the intrinsic aging, which is inevitable and, thus, apparently not subject to manipulation through changes in human behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883911512461107">1</xref></sup> Conversely, environmental or exogenous factors, such as chronic exposure to the sun, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, wind and smoke, excessive alcohol consumption, and poor nutrition, contribute to the extrinsic aging of skin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883911512461107">2</xref></sup> Chronologically, aged skin shares some of the same histological manifestations and several molecular and biochemical features, therefore, they should respond to the same treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883911512461107">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The treatment of a local cutaneous dermatologic or pathologic condition by direct application as a pharmaceutical formulation is easy, convenient, useful in limiting formulation waste, generally well accepted by patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883911512461107">4</xref></sup> and with few systemic side effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883911512461107">5</xref></sup> Vitamin A and many of its derivatives are recognized as potential substances for the prevention and treatment of photoaging,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883911512461107">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883911512461107">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883911512461107">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883911512461107">7</xref></sup> severe acne, skin inflammation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883911512461107">8</xref></sup> and psoriases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883911512461107">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883911512461107"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883911512461107">11</xref></sup> The efficacy of topical tretinoin for the treatment of photoaging, has been determined by numerous large-scale placebo-controlled trials. Although tretinoin is a prescription drug, over-the-counter products mainly contain vitamin A derivatives, retinol and retinyl palmitate (RP). These forms are not biologically active until enzymatically converted to the principal active metabolite, retinoic acid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883911512461107">2</xref></sup> These medications are typically applied each night and are associated with some irritation and desquamation during the early stages of therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883911512461107">6</xref></sup> Over 90% of the patients reported retinoid dermatitis side effect from this treatment, which was clinically evident by scaling, pruritus, burning sensation, and erythema.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883911512461107">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883911512461107">11</xref></sup> These side effects tend to lessen with time, but since the treatment involves continued use of the medication, some patients find the side effects unacceptable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883911512461107">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therapeutic use of retinyl esters is hampered by the lack of cutaneous absorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883911512461107">12</xref></sup> The barrier function exerted by the skin inhibits the absorption of active pharmaceutical ingredients as well as toxic agents. New media to overcome the barrier formed by the <italic>stratum corneum</italic> are the subject of current research. The approaches encompass both penetration enhancers and particulate carrier systems. Current research in the field of pharmaceutical technology is investigating micro- and nanoparticulate systems that not only enhance percutaneous absorption but may even allow for drug targeting in the skin and even to its substructure, thus, improving the potential of finding a better benefit/risk ratio for topical drug therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883911512461107">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The most promising and most applied carrier technology is based on polymeric materials that offer intrinsic biocompatibility and biodegradability. Several studies on drug penetration encapsulated in polymer-based particles showed marked difference between conventional and nanoparticulate formulations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883911512461107">14</xref></sup> Polymer particles can enhance dermal uptake or improve tolerability. Nanosized polymeric carriers with well controllable sizes and surface polarity, allow adaptation to the intended target.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883911512461107">5</xref></sup> In 1995, polymeric nanocapsules were introduced in the cosmetic market by L’Oreal. Subsequently, scientific articles based on skin penetration and distribution of drugs or cosmetic ingredients, encapsulated in polymeric nanoparticles (NPs), were published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883911512461107">15</xref></sup> The cosmetic industry is growing rapidly, and there is no doubt that cosmeceutical products will contribute enormously to daily care in modern life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883911512461107">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Currently, solvent exchange methods are most commonly used to formulate polymeric NPs for cutaneous applications. In this work, a nanoprecipitation method was utilized for the preparation of RP-loaded NPs based on poly(lactide-<italic>co</italic>-glycolide) (PLGA), Pluronic F127, and phospholipids derived from sunflower oil. Drug-loaded NPs were characterized by dynamic light scattering, zeta potential, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the morphology and physicochemical properties of the prepared NPs were investigated. The NPs were also characterized in vitro for cytotoxicity and genotoxicity utilizing 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), cell membrane asymmetry study, and Ames test with BALB/3T3 mouse embryo fibroblasts and the HaCaT human keratinocytes cell lines. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and cytokines produced in response to the exposure to NPs were determined, as well as the NPs’ penetration of coumarin 6–labeled NPs in human skin was assessed in vitro.</p>

<title>Materials</title>
<p>PLGA in a 50/50 molar ratio with an inherent viscosity of 0.40 dL/g (Purasorb PDLG 5004A) was purchased from Purac Biomaterials (Gorinchem, The Netherlands). RP in sunflower oil (0.48 g/mL) was provided by AHAVA—Dead Sea Laboratories Ltd (Holon, Israel). Pluronic F127, coumarin 6, and all solvents were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) and used as received.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0883911512461107">
<title>NP preparation</title>
<p>PLGA (16 mg) and Pluronic F127 (surfactant; 8 mg) were dissolved in 4 mL of acetone. A total of 21 µL of sunflower oil (for unloaded NPs) or 21 µL of a solution of RP in sunflower oil (for drug-loaded NPs) was added. The resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. This solution was dripped in 10 mL of deionized water using a 22-G needle syringe under moderate stirring. The NPs mixture was stirred for 1 h and then centrifuged at 9000 r/min for 1 h.</p>
<p>To prepare coumarin 6–labeled NPs, 16 mg of PLGA and 8 mg of Pluronic F127 were dissolved in 4 mL of acetone. RP solution of 21 µL in sunflower oil and 200 µL of coumarin solution in acetone (1 mg/mL) were mixed and added to 10 mL of deionized water under moderate stirring using a 22-G needle syringe. The mixture was stirred for 1 h, the NPs were filtered through a 5-µm filter, and then were centrifuged at 9000 r/min for 1 h.</p>

<title>NPs characterization</title>
<sec id="section6-0883911512461107">
<title>Granulometry in suspension</title>
<p>Dimensional analyses were carried out by means of a Coulter LS230 Laser Diffraction Particle Size Analyzer (Beckman Coulter Srl., Milan, Italy) equipped with small volume module plus. NP suspensions were added into the cell until 30%–50% obscuration of Polarization Intensity Differential Scattering (PIDS) detector was reached. Deionized water and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were used as background, and diameter distribution was processed using the Fraunhofer optical model. Three runs were performed on each sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0883911512461107">
<title>AFM</title>
<p>A commercial AFM instrument (multimode microscope with a Nanoscope IV controller; Bruker-Veeco Instr., Santa Barbara, CA, USA) was used. The AFM was equipped with an E-type scanner allowing for scans up to 12.5 µm in <italic>x–y</italic> direction and 3.7 µm in the <italic>z</italic> direction. The silicon cantilever used for imaging, an Rotated TappingMode Etched Silicon Probe (RTESP) probe, was 125 µm long with typical oscillation frequency of 35 kHz. Tapping-mode AFM was used to obtain the morphology of RP-loaded PLGA NPs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0883911512461107">
<title>UV analysis</title>
<p>Weighed samples of purified and lyophilized NPs loaded with RP were dissolved in acetone. The drug concentration was determined using a standard curve obtained by plotting the absorbance of each standard versus its RP concentration (<italic>λ</italic>
<sub>max</sub> = 340 nm; 0.1–10 ppm; <italic>R</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883911512461107">2</xref></sup> = 0.9995).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0883911512461107">
<title>Fluorescence analysis</title>
<p>To assess the stability of coumarin 6–labeled NPs, an in vitro release study was conducted over a 48-h period. The NPs were dispersed in 50 mL of PBS and incubated at 37°C under stirring. At predetermined intervals, 2 mL suspension was taken out, replaced with fresh PBS, and centrifuged at 9000 r/min for 30 min. The amount of coumarin 6 released from the NPs was determined by spectrofluorometric analysis (PerkinElmer VICTOR3 1420 multilabel counter) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 458 and 505 nm, respectively. All measurements were performed in triplicate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0883911512461107">
<title>DSC analysis</title>
<p>DSC analyses were carried out on samples of virgin PLGA as well as unloaded NPs (NPs_PLGA), loaded NPs (NPs_PLGA/RP), RP in sunflower oil, and sunflower oil. The samples were weighed directly in aluminum pans (5–10 mg) and scanned between −50°C and 250°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min or between −20°C and 200°C at the same heating rate, under nitrogen, using a Mettler DSC-82 (Mettler Toledo, Milan, Italy).</p>

<title>Cell lines and evaluations</title>
<p>The cell lines used in the present study were BALB/3T3 mouse fibroblast (ECACC 86110401) and HaCaT human keratinocyte (CLS 300493). Both cell lines were routinely grown as a monolayer in tissue culture–grade flasks in a humidified atmosphere with 5% ± 1% CO<sub>2</sub>/air. When cells exceeded 70% confluence (but less than 90%), they were subcultured on new culture flasks. At least 24 h before performing the cytotoxicity assays, the cells were trypsinized, counted, and cell suspensions of 80,000 cells/mL were prepared. An appropriate volume of the cell suspensions was dispensed in 96-well plates (MTT and inflammation) and 24-well plates (Annexin and ROS production studies). Plates were preincubated at 37°C ± 1°C, 5% ± 1% CO<sub>2</sub>/air, for 24 h in a humidified atmosphere.</p>
<p>Cell cultures were exposed to PLGA NPs for 24 h, and cytotoxicity due to interactions with loaded and unloaded nanosystems were analyzed by using MTT (a yellow tetrazole), Annexin V, ROS production, and inflammation assays.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0883911512461107">
<title>Cell viability</title>
<p>Cells were treated with unloaded (NPs_PLGA) and RP-loaded (NPs_PLGA/RP) NPs for 24 h. A range-finding experiment using 1:10 dilutions was performed on eight concentrations starting from 2.5 mg/mL. The concentrations were adjusted between 0% and 100% viability according to the curve obtained in the range-finding experiment. After incubation with the test item, cells were washed twice with PBS and dyed with MTT (Sigma). Plates were incubated at 37°C for 2–3 h, and at the end of the incubation time, media were removed and 100 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added. After incubation for 15 min, culture was gently agitated until a homogeneous solution was obtained, and the absorbance was read at 540 nm with a plate reader. The percentage of cell viability was calculated from the obtained results and plotted against the test item concentration. The lethal concentrations (LCs) of the products that produced reduction in viability or growth of 20%, 50%, and 80% were then calculated and defined as LC<sub>20</sub>, LC<sub>50</sub>, and LC<sub>80</sub>. The corresponding standard error mean was calculated for three independent experiments and with six replicates for each experimental point.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0883911512461107">
<title>Cellular membrane asymmetry</title>
<p>Annexin V, conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 molecular probes (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA), was used to study the loss of membrane asymmetry and characteristics of apoptosis. Annexin V is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>–dependent phospholipid binding protein with affinity for phosphatidylserine (PS). In normal viable cells, PS is located on the inner cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane. However, in apoptotic cells, the PS is translocated from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, which is a key feature of apoptosis. After a 24-h exposure of cells to NPs (0.1 and 0.5 mg/mL of PLGA and PLGA/RP), 5 µL of the annexin V conjugates was added to each 100 µL of cell suspension (BALB/3T3 and HaCaT cell lines; minimum of 10,000 cell/100 µL) and incubated at room temperature in dark for 15 min. After incubation, the cells were washed and submitted to flow cytometry acquisition. The stained cells were immediately contrasted with propidium iodide (PI; 5 μg/mL) to detect necrotic cells, by Cytomics FC500-MCL Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). After the cells were incubated with 1 µM of doxorubicin for 24 h, three independent experiments with three replicates for each experimental point were carried out.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0883911512461107">
<title>Assessment of inflammation</title>
<p>Cytokine (tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10) levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; BD OptEIA; USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The cells were treated with NPs_PLGA and NPs_PLGA/RP (Franklin Lakes, NJ) (0.1 and 0.5 mg/mL) for 24 h. HaCaT and BALB/3T3 cell lines were also treated with 200 µM of <italic>t</italic>-butyl hydroperoxide as a positive control. After NPs were incubated, cell media were diluted in the assay diluents in a ratio of 1:3 and incubated with conjugated cytokine antibody. Following multiple plate wash cycles, the substrate tetramethylbenzidine was added, and the optical density (OD) of the samples was read at 450 nm. The results were analyzed to determine cytokine levels using a four-parameter fit of the standard curve provided to determine sample levels of cytokines. Three independent experiments and three replicates for each experimental point were carried out.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0883911512461107">
<title>Measurement of intracellular ROS</title>
<p>Intracellular ROS levels were assessed by using the oxidant-sensitive fluorescent probe 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA, Molecular Probes, Leiden, NL, The Netherlands). After entering the cell, the esterases hydrolyze the compound into a nonfluorescent intermediate carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein, which is retained in the cell due to the negative charges of the molecule. Oxidation by ROS causes further conversion into fluorescent carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (carboxy-DCF). Cells were exposed to 0.1 and 0.5 mg/mL of NPs_PLGA and NPs_PLGA/RP for 24 h prior to the incubation with the DCFH-DA staining. HaCaT and BALB/3T3 cell lines were also treated with 200 µM of <italic>t</italic>-butyl hydroperoxide as positive controls. Cells (minimum of 10,000 cells/100 µL) were incubated with 10 µM DCFH-DA at 37°C for 30 min. Subsequently, the cells were washed with PBS, and cell fluorescence at 4°C was assessed via fluorescent signal detected by flow cytometry (Cytomics FC500-MCL). Three independent experiments and three replicates for each experimental point were carried out.</p>

<title>Genotoxicity studies</title>
<sec id="section18-0883911512461107">
<title>Ames test</title>
<p>In this study, the five strains of <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> used were TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and TA102 according to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guideline 471. Two different sets of experiments were carried out with and without metabolic system activation (AroclorTM 1254–induced rat liver S9, prepared from adult Sprague Dawley rats). The plates were also evaluated visually for the inhibition of growth in the bacterial lawn. In brief, cultures were prepared on nutrient broth (Oxoid No. 2, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK) in a shaking water bath at 37°C. Positive reference reagents were included in the experiment as recommended by OECD guideline 471. Assays were performed with 500 µL of the S9 mixture of Aroclor 1254–induced rat liver homogenate. Experiments were carried out in triplicates, and fivefold dilutions of both NPs_PLGA and NPs_PLGA/RP were used starting from 5 mg/plate. The tubes were incubated for 60 min at 37°C and 90 r/min in a shaking water bath. Soft agar (2.0 mL) was added, along with 0.05 mM histidine; vortexed; and plated on Vogel Bonner plates. The histidine revertants (His+) were counted in a Fisher colony counter after incubation for 48 h at 37°C.</p>

<title>Penetration studies in human skin organ culture</title>
<p>The penetration assay of skin cultures based on fluorescent derivatives was used. In brief, 0.5 × 0.5 cm<sup>2</sup> of skin specimens were obtained from healthy 18- to 60-year-old women undergoing plastic surgery with informed consent. These were cultivated separately in 12-well culture plates containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), with the dermal side placed in the medium and epidermis exposed to the air. A 5 µL of a 1 mg/mL suspension of coumarin 6–labeled NPs_PLGA/RP was applied on the epidermis of each skin piece. After incubating for 24 h, the epidermis surface was blotted with filter paper to remove the remaining NPs. The epidermis was separated from the dermis after 1 min of incubation at 56°C in PBS. Samples of the two tissues were suspended in 100 µL PBS in a 96-well microculture plate. Fluorescence was measured at 458 nm (excitation)/505 nm (emission) using a BioTek Synergy 2 microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). The experiments were performed on skin from two donors in quadruplets.</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Values are given as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The results were compared to a Levene’s test to confirm the homogeneity of variance between the different treatments and Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for normality. One-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni–Dunn’s correction was performed to assess differences in Annexin V, DCFH-DA, and cytokine release labeling as function of group. Comparison between parameters was performed by two-factor ANOVA for repeated measurements as a function of groups. A <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>The NPs prepared in this study were composed of a mixture of phospholipids (derived from sunflower oil), the nonionic surfactant Pluronic F127, and the polyester PLGA. Since skin lipids greatly contribute to the penetration barrier, carriers with lipid components that may allow for lipid exchange with skin surface appear very promising.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883911512461107">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The NPs were prepared by nanoprecipitation, a method allowing for the obtainment of polymeric particles in the nano range due to quick diffusion of the solvent to the water phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883911512461107">17</xref></sup> For the preparation of unloaded NPs, an acetone solution of PLGA, Pluronic F127, and sunflower oil was dropped into water. The diameter distribution in volume (%) and in number (%) of the unloaded NPs is reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512461107">Figure 1(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512461107">(b)</xref>, respectively; the diameter distribution of the NPs was compared to phospholipid micelles prepared by adding an acetone solution of sunflower oil into water. Both the NPs and the phospholipid micelles were polydisperse systems that had a monomodal distribution with diameters 102 ± 75 nm and 90 ± 42 nm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512461107">Figure 1(b)</xref>). The addition of PLGA and Pluronic F127 to the phospholipid micelles provided a matricial organization to the system that reduced the mean diameter of the colloidal suspension.</p>

<p>NPs with narrow and monomodal average diameter of 167 ± 44 nm were obtained, and drug loading into NPs was carried out by adding an acetone solution of PLGA and Pluronic F127 to a solution of RP in sunflower oil. RP oil is the most stable form of vitamin A, and it is largely employed in antiaging formulations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883911512461107">18</xref></sup> The presence of RP favored the formation of NPs with a relatively larger diameter but monomodal dispersion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512461107">Figure 1(c)</xref>). The encapsulation of RP within the PLGA NPs was achieved with a drug loading level of 18% (w/w) and a drug loading efficiency of 25% (w/w).</p>
<p>The zeta potential, −26.6 mV, of the RP-loaded NPs was in the range expected for colloidal systems based on polyesters and lipids, slightly negative due to either the carboxylic moieties present at the extremity of the polymer chains or the phosphate groups contained in the phospholipids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883911512461107">19</xref></sup> The zeta potential of the micelles of sunflower oil phospholipids in water was −6 and −24.18 mV for the unloaded NPs. Zeta potential data are commonly used to predict dispersion stability in aqueous dispersion state. In this study, the zeta potential of −26.6 mV indicated stable particle suspensions in aqueous medium and confirmed the stability of the prepared formulation in both saline and cell culture medium containing serum. The NPs stored at 4°C for 4 weeks had agglomerated only slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512461107">Figure 1(d)</xref>).</p>
<p>At the end of nanoprecipitation, the obtained NPs were harvested and purified by centrifugation to remove the organic solvents and the excess of drug, polymer, surfactant, and phospholipid micelles eventually formed. The 3D AFM images of the purified and harvested unloaded PLGA NPs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883911512461107">Figure 2(a)</xref>. They appear as spherical shapes with polymodal distribution of the sizes, which is in agreement with the light-scattering data. The colloidal particles presented both round smooth surfaces and collapsed areas. The NPs appeared to be softened by the presence of the phospholipids entrapped into the matrix and collapsed when subjected to mechanical stresses such as centrifugation. The presence of phospholipids provided elasticity and deformability to the NPs. As reported in the literature, a certain degree of deformability is desirable for dermal carrier systems, to enhance their interaction and adhesion to the <italic>stratum corneum</italic> layer and eventually to facilitate their penetration into the pores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883911512461107">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883911512461107">20</xref></sup></p>

<p>Based on the AFM image of the RP-loaded NPs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883911512461107">Figure 2(b)</xref>, the agreement between the light-scattering measurements and the AFM image was lower. By using AFM, it was possible to visualize NPs with a diameter less than 40 nm in addition to those with an average diameter size of 167 nm detected by the LS measurements. The LS was not able to detect the smaller particles, due to the instrumental limitations, but AFM scans showed a more accurate representation of the entire system since each individual particle can be accounted to determine the size distribution.</p>
<p>Particle deformability depends not only on the NPs composition but also on the <italic>T<sub>g</sub></italic> of the materials used in their preparation. Kim et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883911512461107">20</xref></sup> investigated the influence of polymers <italic>T<sub>g</sub></italic> on the nanocarriers’ delivery efficiency by choosing representative polymers with the <italic>T<sub>g</sub></italic> value in the range of 107°C–12°C.

The thermal DSC curves of virgin PLGA NPs, PLGA/RP NPs, PLGA, and RP that are found in sunflower oil, and DSC curves sunflower oil itself are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911512461107">Figure 3</xref>. The RP in sunflower oil had an endothermic peak at 48°C that was attributed to the melting of RP. This peak was neither present in a trace of the sunflower oil, confirming previous attribution, nor in the trace of NPs_PLGA/RP, indicating that the drug was completely dispersed into the NPs matrix. Compared to the virgin PLGA, the unloaded NPs showed a slight increase in the glass transition temperature (<italic>T<sub>g</sub></italic>) from 43.7°C to 45.6°C. In contrast, the dispersed drug acted as plasticizer in the RP-loaded NPs reducing the <italic>T<sub>g</sub></italic> value of the virgin PLGA from 43.7°C to 36.4°C.</p>

<p>Rather than specific melting temperatures, the sunflower oil showed two melting regions. It is commonly known that oils and fats have DSC melting curves characterized by more than one transition temperatures. The complexity in the thermal profile of the oil was also observed in the traces of the loaded and unloaded NPs that showed melting transitions in −50°C to 0°C. These peaks could be only attributed to the presence of phospholipids entrapped into the NPs matrix.</p>

<title>Biological evaluation</title>
<p>Traditionally, in vitro toxicity testing focuses on whether exposure to a potentially toxic agent causes cell death.

The viability of each concentration assay was calculated from the absorbance data obtained.

Also, the LC<sub>50</sub> and LC<sub>80</sub> obtained in NPs_PLGA and NPs_PLGA/RP studies in both cell lines were higher than 0.8 and 1.5 mg/mL, respectively. Based on the toxicity data, these nanomaterials are concentration dependent and RP is not implicated in cytotoxicity. Therefore, the concentrations 0.1 and 0.5 mg/mL were chosen to perform more sensitive studies focused on early cellular damage, such as apoptosis detection, ROS production, and cytokine release.

<p>The absence of a stronger cellular inflammatory response in keratinocytes and fibroblast cell lines, despite an increased IL-8 content in HaCaT, represented a low inflammatory response during incubation with NPs of both nanosystems. Moreover, a significant release of IL-10 (twice the amount in NPs_PLGA– and NPs_PLGA/RP–treated cultures in comparison to the untreated cultures) had the capacity to downregulate the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883911512461107">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0883911512461107">30</xref></sup> as shown in the fibroblast cell line cultures.

<title>Genotoxicity studies</title>
<p>The cytotoxicity and mutagenic nature of the RP-loaded and unloaded PLGA-based NPs was determined using the reverse mutation test on <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>. This method follows the “OECD Guideline for testing of chemicals” protocol no. 471. Cytotoxicity was assessed by visually inspecting the plates for any inhibition of growth over the bacterial lawn. Genotoxicity was assessed for each strain by calculating the mutation index (MI) number as the ratio of mutants in a dose to mutants in the control (MI &lt; 1.5, nonmutagenic; 1.5 &lt; MI &lt; 2, weakly mutagenic; MI &gt; 2, mutagenic). Based on our data, the developed NPs were nongenotoxic under the conditions of the study for both unloaded and RP-loaded PLGA-based NPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0883911512461107">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this study, RP-loaded NPs based on PLGA, Pluronic F127, and phospholipids derived from sunflower oil were prepared by a nanoprecipitation method. The drug-loaded NPs were characterized by monomodal distribution with an average diameter size of 167 ± 44 nm. The presence of phospholipids provided elasticity and deformability to the NPs systems, which are known to increase adhesion over the <italic>stratum corneum</italic> layer and to enhance the penetration into the pores. The in vitro biological evaluation indicated good cytocompatibility of the prepared systems and their ability to penetrate into the epidermis without the use of chemical or physical enhancers. In conclusion, the developed NP system represents a potential tool for topical administration of Vitamin A derivatives for the treatment of skin diseases.</p>
