<abstract>
<p>Evidence from close ethnographic observations, photos, videos, and interviews show that persons in violence-threatening situations experience the emotional state of confrontational tension/fear (<italic>ct/f</italic>). This emotion constitutes a barrier that makes most violence abort. Given one of several interactional patterns that allow violence to proceed past this barrier, violence is largely clumsy, imprecise, and uncontrolled. Moments of violence are often experienced as perceptual distortions in the flow of time, vision, sound, and sense of self, an altered state of violent consciousness that the author refers to by the metaphor, the tunnel of violence. The latter part of the article extrapolates the theory to consider mechanisms by which this emotional tunnel is prolonged into episodes lasting longer than a few seconds. These mechanisms include: self-entrainment in one’s own bodily rhythms; reciprocal micro-coordination between attacker and victim; audience or team entrainment. Some experienced individuals learn techniques to manipulate the emotional processes of the tunnel of violence for their own advantage. Greater awareness of micro-sociological processes hold out the prospect of heading off violence in the local situation itself.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There are many different kinds of physical violence, but they all must go through a crucial micro-sociological moment when an attacker confronts a target. The theory of confrontational tension, outlined here, provides a common denominator affecting whether threatened violence will be carried out or not, and with what degree of success. We will examine a small number of micro-interactional pathways and mechanisms that affect these situational processes and outcomes; different combinations of mechanisms explain key aspects of different types of violence.</p>
<p>My focus on micro-interactional mechanisms at the moment that violence threatens aims to fill a gap in theoretical explanations of violence. Most theories deal with structural properties of social location, or biographical conditions in the background of violent individuals, neglecting the situational dynamics of violence itself. My approach is closer to an opportunity theory of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011392112456500">Felson, 1994</xref>), but with emphasis on the micro-situational dynamics of violent confrontation; and covering not only crime but all kinds of violence including legitimate violence by police or military. In some aspects, my micro-situational theory is related to the emphasis on network location in the geometrical theory of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011392112456500">Black (1998)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011392112456500">Cooney (1998)</xref> and others with its concern for social distance or closeness to the several sides of a conflict; here again I add a micro-processual component. The micro-interactional theory does not explain all aspects of violence; it complements other theories of long-term motivational patterns of individuals, and the organizational and institutional structures affecting the initiation and control of large-scale violence. Conversely, I argue that even macro-organizational theories need a link to what happens at the sticking point; even in big organizations like armies or police forces, micro-contingencies make a crucial difference in actual events.</p>
<p>In what follows, I draw on a variety of data sources. Since I am concerned with what actually happens in violent situations, I analyze the interactional process among all persons present on the scene in as minute detail as possible, relying heavily on photos and videos; on ethnographic observations (carried out by myself, my students, as well as in published sources); secondary sources are also drawn upon, especially interviews with individuals experienced in violence, including criminals, police, soldiers, domestic abusers, and also interviews with victims. My theory examines violent persons on both sides of the law, holding that their different moral or professional outlooks do not obviate the basic micro-situational processes. My analysis often refers to serious violence carried out with firearms, but unarmed and lightly armed conflicts are subject to much the same interactional problems of micro-interactional tension.</p>
<p>To begin, let us examine an actual incident of violence in order to point up the difference between the micro-interactional approach and conventional explanations in terms of motivations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0011392112456500">
<title>The sequence of violent interaction: An empirical example</title>
<p>On New Year’s night in 2009, in Oakland, California, a white police officer put a gun to the back of the head of a young black man who was lying on the ground being arrested, and killed him with one shot (Associated Press reports; Wikipedia/BART Police Shooting of Oscar Grant). The incident began with reports that groups of young black men were fighting on the train; at the train station, four police began making arrests. There was much loud shouting on both sides, arguments about who was or was not involved in the fighting. The officer who fired the gun said afterwards that he thought he was reaching for his Taser – a device that shoots an electric charge to subdue a resisting suspect – but pulled out his pistol by mistake. The killing received wide publicity, as many people recorded it on their mobile phone cameras; it gave rise to large protests as a case of racially motivated police behavior.</p>
<p>The easy cultural script is for us to interpret this incident as an instance of racism. Nevertheless, for reasons I will explain, cultural factors like racism are never a sufficient explanation of violence; most people who are racists are not good at committing violence. They need a conducive situation; and if those situational conditions are present, it can produce the violence without the racism, or any other cultural motivation.</p>
<p>On that train platform in Oakland, there was a high level of emotion for many minutes before the shooting. The young men argued and struggled with police officers; one of the four cops, not the officer who did the shooting, was particularly aggressive, throwing black youths against the walls, pushing them down, and yelling the word ‘nigger’ at them. The officer who eventually shot his pistol was relatively restrained, trying to calm both the excited cop and the men being arrested; one photo of him, a minute before the shooting, shows a perplexed expression on his face. Micro-sociologically, the shooting officer was not acting as a detached individual; he was influenced by the emotional mood of the entire scene, and especially of his aggressive – and quite possibly racist – colleague. Given the general pattern (which I will document below) that individuals in violent situations are highly emotional, tense, and imprecise with their violence, it is quite plausible that the officer mistook his gun for his Taser; he seemed genuinely surprised when the shot was fired. Hypothetically, police training should make an officer automatically select the right weapon; but this supposes an idealized picture of what police behavior is intended to be, rather than what actually occurs. Our concept of violence as a deliberate, conscious decision by an independent individual, gives a very distorted picture of its dynamics. In the dynamics of this situation, the colleague of the shooting officer – the aggressive police officer – was most responsible for escalating the situation to the point of deadly violence. The entire sequence – the holiday atmosphere, the group fighting on the train, followed by the loud struggle between the black men and the police at the station, surrounded by an attentive crowd – generated the emotional situation that culminated in the killing.</p>

<title>Micro-situational mechanisms determining the process of violence</title>
<p>Let me now put this case in the context of a general theory of violent situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392112456500">Collins, 2008</xref> and sources therein). Detailed micro-sociological evidence from videos, photos, ethnographies, and reports of subjective phenomenology show that violent confrontations between humans are extremely stressful: people’s facial expressions and body postures show a high level of tension; physiologically, heart beats often accelerate to 160 beats per minute, as cortisol and adrenaline flood the body; at these levels, fine motor coordination is lost, and people cannot easily control their fingers, hands, or feet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392112456500">Grossman, 2004</xref>). Some people freeze up, and are unable to move at all; others go into a frenzy of throwing fists or kicks, which may or may not hit their intended target. People with weapons at close range are surprisingly inaccurate; for both cops and criminals, gangs and soldiers, far more bullets are fired than hit the target, and 50% of the bullets can miss an enemy less than two meters away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011392112456500">Glenn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011392112456500">Holmes, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011392112456500">Marshall, 1947</xref>; reanalysis in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392112456500">Collins, 2008</xref>: 43–70).</p>
<p>Micro-sociological evidence shows that violence is difficult, not easy. This is particularly difficult when it is face-to-face, literally two antagonists looking each other in full-channel social communication.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0011392112456500">1</xref></sup> If one surveys instances of hostile confrontations, the most typical pattern is that the confrontation does not rise to the level of actual violence, but stops at bluster, threat, angry insults, and eventually winding down by mutual withdrawal. Violence comes up against a barrier of confrontational tension and fear. For violence to happen, there must be situational conditions which allow at least one side to circumvent the barrier. This does not mean that once past the barrier, tension disappears; high levels of physiological arousal and perceptual distortion remain, which explains why fighters typically fire so many shots and miss with so many of them. Contrary to our popular images of violence as something easy for people to do, violent threats most of the time abort – they do not get past the barrier; and when they do pass the barrier, violence is mostly incompetent, not hitting its target, or often hitting the wrong target, innocent bystanders or even members of one’s own side, so-called friendly fire. In short: violence is emotionally difficult to carry out, and having a motivation is not enough.</p>
<p>This is why most of our theories about violence are very weak predictors of what will actually happen in a conflictual situation. Being a racist is not sufficient to make someone violent; nor is being poor, subaltern, shamed, hopeless, angry, or filled with religious fervor. It does not matter how angry or alienated someone is; they still have to get past the barrier of confrontational tension. Anger mostly produces verbal threats, especially when conversing with one’s own supporters about a distant enemy.</p>
<p>I call this emotional condition confrontational tension and fear (<italic>ct/f</italic>) because that is the expression on the faces of people at the moment of violence, in videos and photos; anger may have been expressed moments earlier but disappears when the violence actually looms. Is this because people are afraid of being hurt? That is a common-sense explanation, but in fact most people are rather good at accepting pain (as in medical situations); and the kinds of situations in which fighters show the most tension are not those which are statistically the most dangerous; for instance, distant artillery fire causes far more casualties than close-up bayonet charges, but soldiers are much more squeamish about the prospect of sticking someone with a bayonet, especially if one does it to their face; and most knife killings are done by stabbing in the back. The psychologist Dave Grossman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392112456500">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392112456500">2004</xref>), citing this evidence, argues that humans are more afraid of killing someone else than of being killed.</p>
<p>In micro-detail, what humans have greatest trouble with is a violent confrontation with another human being when they can see each other’s eyes and face, communicating each other’s humanity. In contrast to Grossman, I put the emphasis on the process of confrontation rather than on fear of killing. In my work <italic>Interaction Ritual Chains</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011392112456500">Collins, 2004</xref>), the micro-sociology of normal, peaceful interactions, the basic pattern is: when persons are physically nearby, recognize that each other is attending to the same thing, and share a similar emotion, a process is set off that builds rhythmic entrainment. Mutual focus of attention plus emotional contagion generates intersubjectivity, which is both mental but also – especially importantly in this context –bodily, physiological. Mutual entrainment, when it proceeds to relatively high levels, is a version of Durkheim’s collective effervescence. We can measure the degree of micro-coordination of participants by voice rhythms, body movements, and emotional expressions; once past a threshold, feedback loops intensify the mutual focus and shared emotion, generating feelings of solidarity, morality, and emotional energy.</p>
<p>A conflictual confrontation also has the ingredients of an interaction ritual: close bodily presence; mutual focus – since violent threat makes everyone intensely aware of each other; and a shared emotion of anger or hostility. But it adds one other feature: conflict is action at cross-purposes, each side trying to impose their dominance on the other, both trying to establish the rhythm that the other will give in to. Violence is an attempt to establish micro-situational dominance in a tightly shared situation; and this is what generates the confrontational tension. Violence is so difficult because it goes against our propensity to attune our nervous systems to those with whom we establish intersubjectivity. Quite literally, persons in a conflictual situation, who are close enough to send and receive signals from each other’s face and body, feel the tension of simultaneously becoming highly attuned to each other, while trying to force the other to submit to one’s will. Tensions arising from tight mutual focus at cross-purposes explain why conflict tends to be so emotional, and why violence often gets out of control, not just when lethal weapons are used, but also in milder kinds of violence. Thus Grossman’s argument, that tension arises from fear of killing another person, does not go far enough; the tension arises from a pervasive micro-interactional source, even when killing is not intended.</p>
<p>This micro-sociological dynamic provides the key to explaining not just why violent situations often abort, and why violence is generally incompetent, but also what factors make violence successful – that is to say, who wins and loses, and how much damage they do.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0011392112456500">
<title>Violence as pathways circumventing confrontational tension/fear</title>
<p>There are many different types of violence. I divide them into pathways circumventing the barrier of confrontational tension. In brief summary, the four main ways in which this is done are: (1) finding a weak victim, especially a victim who is emotionally dominated; (2) orienting to an audience that encourages a small number of performers of violence; (3) remaining at a distance to launch weapons without having to confront the enemy face-to-face; (4) a clandestine approach which pretends there is no conflict until the very last instant.</p>
<p>Let me deal with the last two types first, since these are the ones with the lowest tension. The easiest way is to avoid face-to-face contact with the person you are fighting (pathway number 3); it is much easier, emotionally, to fire artillery or drop bombs from a distance, to engage in arson or vandalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392112456500">Grossman, 2004</xref>). Quite literally, the faceless enemy is easiest to hate. A psychologically similar strategy (pathway number 4) is clandestine violence: attack so that you do not actually have to confront the enemy; guerrilla strikes on unsuspecting targets, gang drive-bys shooting into a crowd. Suicide bombings use this psychology, since the attacker pretends to be normal and peaceful, until the moment the bomb is set off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392112456500">Collins, 2008</xref>: 430–448). Modern military drones firing rockets by remote control are the counterpart of the guerrilla and the suicide bomber.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0011392112456500">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The more humanly difficult kinds of violence are where the two sides consciously confront each other face-to-face (pathways numbers 1 and 2). Here the attacker undergoes quite a lot of tension, because the confrontation with the opponent is palpable; under certain conditions the person gets past this barrier, and now plunges into a situation in which the tension is transmuted into another emotional state. I will use the metaphor of entering the tunnel of violence, an altered state of consciousness sometimes described as dream-like, frenzied, or out of oneself. Interviews with police officers who have been in shootouts show widespread experience of perceptual distortions: the sense of time is altered, and events either proceed in slow motion, like running underwater, or speed up to a blur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011392112456500">Artwohl and Christensen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011392112456500">Klinger, 2004</xref>). Vision narrows in; the enemy’s hands may become all that you see, and the rest of the world goes out of focus. Cops often do not hear the sound of their own gun, or consciously remember how many shots they fired; they are in a sound-proof tunnel, which suddenly pops back into the world of noises when the action is over.</p>
<p>The tension and the distortion is maximal at the moment when the barrier of confrontation tension is actually breached. We have evidence from interviews with burglars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011392112456500">Wright and Decker, 1994</xref>); their moment of maximal tension is when they open the window or door to enter the home; they often have the fantasy that the owner is sitting inside in the dark with a gun, and will shoot them when they come through the window. The fantasy is irrational; professional burglars are skilled at picking homes that are empty, and only in a small minority of cases do burglars encounter inhabitants. The fantasy expresses the confrontational tension of going into the tunnel. Many burglars have the urge to urinate or defecate – a sign of tension and fear – but they shit on the floor; because using the toilet gives them the feeling of being trapped in a small room. For similar reasons, most prefer to burglarize homes near their own neighborhood, where they feel comfortable, and avoid distant neighborhoods even though they have richer booty. If a burglar does encounter the homeowner, however, the latter is likely to be injured; a trapped burglar often goes into a frenzy of trying to escape, the episode of crime turning into the tunnel of violence.</p>

<sec id="section5-0011392112456500">
<title>Time-dynamics: Short, medium, and long tunnels of violence – the altered states of violent consciousness</title>
<p>How long can people stay in the tunnel of violence, and what enables them to do so? To understand their dynamics, it is useful to distinguish between emotional tunnels that are short (a few minutes or less), medium (many minutes up to several hours), and long (several days, possibly weeks).</p>
<p><italic>Short-tunnel violence</italic> (a few minutes or less): Most fights are short, such as brawls with fists in bars. In most gang fights and police shootouts, the actual shooting is over in minutes; surveillance videos show that most armed robberies take less than 60 seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392112456500">Levine et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011392112456500">Sanders, 1994</xref>; Jooyoung Lee, personal communication regarding University of Pennsylvania research on surveillance videos). Much of this short-tunnel violence is impulsive and unskilled; fighters have barely made it into the mouth of the tunnel, where they aim their blows or shots under high tension and then are precipitated back out of the tunnel by the emotional tension.</p>
<p><italic>Medium-length tunnels</italic> (lasting up to an hour or more): More extended tunnels of violence depend on stronger mechanisms which enable perpetrators to keep up their action, overcoming <italic>ct/f</italic> or transmuting it into repetitive violence. Medium-length tunnels include rampage killings such as massacres in schools and workplaces; also certain types of drawn-out violence such as bullying and repeatedly humiliating a hapless victim, and the kind of domestic violence that I have called a domestic torture regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392112456500">Collins, 2008</xref>: 141–147). Also in medium-length tunnels are kinds of group violence carried out for excitement and fun, such as football hooligan violence and flash mobs (a recent phenomenon in the US where a group of youths, notifying each other by electronic communication devices, converge on a downtown shopping street or gathering place and randomly attack pedestrians or ransack stores).</p>
<p><italic>Long tunnels of violence</italic> (several days, possibly weeks): These include killing sprees, where a small number of persons (usually a duo) travel about breaking into houses, robbing, raping, and murdering for several days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011392112456500">Katz, 1988</xref>). Riots typically go on up to three days; in instances where what is perceived as a single riot goes on longer, the violence moves to a difference venue, with different persons taking part (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392112456500">Collins, 2008</xref>: 248). At the outer limit of emotional tunnels of violence are genocides; for instance the 1994 genocide in Rwanda lasted 11 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011392112456500">Straus, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Beyond this time period, the emotional mechanism that I have called the tunnel of violence is superseded by other mechanisms. Some genocides, where there is a strong component of state organization and direction, can go on much longer than days or weeks, but these extremely long processes of sustained violence are outside my model of violence shaped by immediate, situational emotional mechanisms. Genocides covering years must involve a great deal of emotional variation, with long periods of routine and emotional callousness. Similarly, regimes of prolonged torture with large numbers of victims must have different micro-sociological mechanisms (as well as different macro-organizational contexts) than short, sudden episodes of torture. My metaphor of the tunnel of violence is no longer useful for highly institutionalized forms of long-term violence; in these very long processes, the perpetrators have come out of whatever emotional tunnels they were in at the outset, and now carry on violence under the pressures of large-scale social organization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0011392112456500">
<title>The place of physiological mechanisms in a sociological theory</title>
<p>As I have noted above, tunnels of violence have in common the subjective phenomenology of being in an altered state of consciousness, with distortions of perception and the sense of time; when the perpetrators emerge back into normal consciousness, they often describe it as waking from a dream, and wonder if that could have been themselves who caused all the mayhem. The altered state of consciousness is an effect of the physiological mechanisms underlying <italic>ct/f</italic>: the flood of adrenaline and cortisol, the extremely high heart beat, the narrowing of perceptual consciousness to the violent action or some part of it.</p>
<p>Does bringing physiological processes into a sociological theory make it a reductionist theory, giving the privileged explanatory position to physiology? If reductionist means ‘nothing but–x’ this is not a reductionist theory. As argued above, patterns of social interaction are the key to triggering the physiological mechanism (high adrenalin, elevated heart beat, etc.); and how persons deal with this physiological arousal, or fail to deal with it, is a matter of social interactions which I proceed to describe. These are above all micro-sociological processes, that is to say, processes in which one individual orients in refined detail to the gestures, speed, rhythm, and emotional expressions of other persons who are in the immediate focus of mutual attention; crucial variables are whether they tightly imitate or become entrained with each other, or whether one side of the conflict (and particular individuals within the side) takes the lead in establishing the micro-rhythms. (Evidence on how this happens in non-violent interaction are given in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011392112456500">Collins, 2004</xref>: 121–125.)</p>
<p>In a violence-threatening confrontation, the physiological arousal is driven to a high level; and this is the intervening mechanism that produces what I have called confrontational tension/fear. But by itself, an adrenalin rush is undifferentiated, often referred to as a ‘flight-or-fight’ mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011392112456500">Mazur, 2005</xref>). It is capable of producing both aggressive advance toward the target, but also panicky flight. Indeed, close micro-sociological observation of confrontational situations shows there are more alternatives: the antagonists can continue the confrontation into a standoff, neither fighting nor fleeing, until the tension eventually declines through boredom (an under-analyzed emotion, but crucial in de-escalation of small-scale conflicts; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392112456500">Collins, 2008</xref>: 361–369). Another outcome is to escalate to physical violence but acting under such high tension that the body movements are clumsy and out of control. Finally, some individuals have learned techniques for controlling their own <italic>ct/f</italic>, enabling them to act effectively in violent situations; it is command of such micro-sociological techniques that makes them professionals in violence. Which of these sequences occur is steered by micro-sociological processes.</p>
<p>Reductionism is not the issue here. Everything that humans do has a physiological substrate; something is happening in the body at the moments when persons move, gesture, talk, or think. Sociology can describe social processes without referring to the concomitant physiology; but where we can add information about the physiological mechanism, this does not weaken the sociological theory but may provide detailed links among some of the social processes. A quarrel during which each antagonist raises their voice, makes vigorous arm movements, talks faster and no longer follows conversational rules of turn-taking but tries to talk over their opponent – such a quarrel is a social process; participants imitate each other, driving the mutual level of noise, anger, and gesturing successively higher. As sociologists, we have our own evidence for these patterns (including the aid of audio recordings, photos, and videos); we also observe that confrontations often stall or become stalemated, for instance ending in angry exits rather than fights. We can stay on the sociological level and theorize these patterns as confrontational tension/fear and ‘pathways circumventing <italic>ct/f</italic>.’</p>
<p>But I go on to incorporate the argument of the psychologist Grossman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392112456500">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392112456500">2004</xref>) that the tension and its debilitating effects are due to high levels of adrenaline and cortisol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011392112456500">Mazur, 2005</xref>). This enables us to specify in further detail what happens in various scenarios of conflict: at extremely high levels (a heart beat over 160 beats per minute, bpm), the physiological tension is so great that people become paralyzed, merely passive victims of attack; at high but less extreme levels (ca. 150 bpm) fighters can function but misperceive targets and fight clumsily. A fraction of fighters, through social mechanisms such as training, and as I shall emphasize, internal loops of self-conscious control, have learned to focus their attention, and to perform particular bodily postures that enable them to bring down their physiological arousal to a level at which they can function effectively in violence. These are all sociological processes, both responding to the physiology, and also controlling the physiology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0011392112456500">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The causal relationship between physiology and social action is not a one-way street, but flows both ways. This is particularly apparent in the realm of emotional processes – since emotions are combinations of physiological arousal, bodily movements (especially face, voice, gesture), together with cognitions and micro-interactional communications with other persons. And among such emotional interactions, violence is emphatically a process involving bodies while remaining quintessentially social; it is the micro-alignment of the bodies in relation to each other, and the internal loops that make up the process of individual consciousness,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0011392112456500">4</xref></sup> that determines how the violence will play out, or indeed whether it does not come off at all. Here the physiological process adds welcome evidence for further details of <italic>ct/f</italic> and how it is sometimes circumvented; but I would stress that the major causal flows in the sequence are social. The interaction among several humans bodies in close communication with each other is quite literally driving their individual physiology from the outside in.</p>
<p>Returning now to the micro-sociological explanation of the differences among short, medium, and long-term tunnels of violence: the physiological component is strongest in short-term and medium-length episodes. I assume that for extremely long regimes of violence, the adrenaline/cortisol rush and its concomitants are no longer a major part of what is driving the violent performance; or perhaps it only kicks in intermittently at particular moments. The latter possibility needs empirical research.</p>
<p>What we know about the experience of violence – the pounding heart, the confusion, the being overwhelmed by emotions, the distortions of perception and sense of time – come mostly from descriptions of short, sudden descents into the tunnel of violence. What happens to these physiological and perceptual mechanisms when the tunnel is medium or long, going on for hours, or for days?</p>
<p>I suggest three mechanisms, all involving an extension of the micro-interactional entrainment which characterizes interaction rituals: (A) self-entrainment of the violent person in his/her own bodily rhythms, with little input from the victim; (B) reciprocal entrainment between the bodily rhythms of perpetrator and victim, such that the attacker sets the rhythm but also responds to the victim’s attempts to resist or cooperate; (C) audience or team entrainment, where the perpetrator of violence is oriented chiefly to a supporting group rather than to the victim.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0011392112456500">5</xref></sup> These are ideal types, and can overlap in a particular case, as well as appear in relatively pure forms; but each has a distinctive mechanism that can be more prominent than the others. The mixed cases, in principle, could be measured in terms of the strength at which each of the three mechanisms is playing its part.</p>
<sec id="section7-0011392112456500">
<title>(A) Self-entrainment in one’s own bodily rhythms</title>
<p>Self-entrainment is typical of severe domestic violence: a man strangling his spouse at the climax of a long argument, or a parent beating a child repeatedly in a rage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392112456500">Collins, 2008</xref>: 134–155). Such violence seems paradoxical, because the more devastating its effects, the more the perpetrator piles abuse on the pathetic victim. The violent abuser has become entrained with him/herself; his consciousness narrows to his own anger, caught up in his own bodily rhythms of heavy breathing, shouting, hitting. In this type of self-entrainment, an important feature is that the victim is extremely weak, unable to do anything that alters the momentum of the attacker. It is a closed circuit, a self-perpetuating tunnel.</p>
<p>Self-entrainment by the attackers is the chief mechanism of military atrocities, where enemy soldiers who cease fighting are massacred, or civilians who have the bad luck to be in the path of victorious soldiers in the moment they have established emotional dominance in battle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392112456500">Collins, 2008</xref>: 89–111). The passivity of the victims is characteristic of all such massacres, emotionally defeated and thus unable to disturb the self-entrainment of the victors in their own violence.</p>
<p>The self-entrainment mechanism can also operate in situations where the enemy is no longer accessible, resulting in a wild, pointless frenzy of noise and sometimes hilarity. A US Marine lieutenant in Vietnam describes a battle in which he was ‘shouting myself hoarse to control the platoon’s fire. The marines were in a frenzy, pouring volley after volley into the village, some yelling unintelligibly, some screaming obscenities. . . . A bullet smacked the earth between us and we went rolling over and came rolling back up again, me laughing hysterically.’ As enemy fire fades away, and reports come in by radio that the Viet Cong are retreating, the lieutenant tries to find a way to get his platoon across the deep river to finish them off. ‘The platoon became as excited as a predator that sees the back of its fleeing prey . . . I could feel the whole line wanting to charge across the river.’ But there turns out to be no way to get across, and the lieutenant has trouble coming down from his emotional high. ‘I could not come down from the high produced by the action. The fire-fight was over, except for a few desultory exchanges, but I did not want it to be over.’ He then deliberately exposes himself to draw enemy fire so that a sniper can be located – ‘walking back and forth and feeling as invulnerable as an Indian wearing his ghost shirt’; when nothing happens, he begins shouting and firing wildly, and when his own troops begin to laugh at him, he laughs uncontrollably too. Eventually he calms down. The whole episode apparently takes about an hour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392112456500">Caputo, 1977</xref>: 249ff.).</p>
<p>This hilarity is also evidenced during rampage killings. In the 60-minute massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999, the pair of students who did the killing were shown on security videos shouting and laughing (www.wikipedia/Columbine High School Massacre). Analytically, we should regard this not so much as a sign of the viciousness of the killers, but of the extreme degree of their physiological arousal and altered state of consciousness – metaphorically, the depth of the tunnel of violence they have entered. There were two killers at Columbine, but they stayed together rather than splitting up, although that would have been a more effective way of killing more victims. Their shared laughter, as well as their shooting, was part of their self-entrainment; laughter is a rhythmic, self-sustaining, involuntary repetition taking over the body and permeating one’s mood and consciousness, and high levels of laughter depend on group participation. It appears that this kind of sustained laughter only occurs in rampage killings when there are at least two attackers (although I have not systematically investigated all the available cases in regard to this detail) (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011392112456500">Newman et al., 2004</xref>). Laughter is a good example of a self-entraining process, and thus may be regarded as an especially powerful self-sustaining interaction ritual (more detail and references in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011392112456500">Collins, 2004</xref>: 65–66); it exemplifies what I mean by saying that a prolonged tunnel of violence is based on a mechanism of self-entrainment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0011392112456500">
<title>(B) Reciprocal micro-coordination between attacker and victim</title>
<p>Habitually or recurrently violent individuals are those who have learned how to locate weak victims. But a weak victim is not just physically lacking in muscles or weapons; he/she is weak emotionally. Bullies in schools or prisons have learned a social skill, reading the interactional cues to find persons they can easily dominate. The bullying relationship is the archetype for specialists in violence, such as armed robbers and career criminals, but also guerrillas, and hitmen; all have learned the technique of finding victims at the moments when they are situationally weak. Such people have learned the technique by which they can do something most other people find very difficult, circumventing the barrier of confrontational tension. They have learned how to enter the tunnel of violence, to stay in the tunnel, to perform fairly well in the tunnel – that is, not necessarily highly competent at violence, shooters who can hit their targets, but better than those they choose to fight against. Persons skilled at violence have learned to use their victim’s confrontational tension against themselves.</p>
<p>This kind of skilled violence may be professional and instrumental, whether it is used for crime, war, or legitimately sanctioned state violence. But it also can be used as an end in itself, done for the sake of the emotional satisfaction. In the terms of interaction ritual theory, here violence is an extremely asymmetrical interaction ritual, with strong common focus of attention by both sides, attackers and victim, and tight rhythmic coordination; but the rhythm is set entirely by one side, and the other side is forced to accede to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011392112456500">Collins, 2004</xref>: 111–138). It is a ritual producing Durkheimian collective effervescence, but where all the emotional energy and solidarity goes to one side. The victim is not only beaten repeatedly, much more than necessary to establish dominance in the situation, but also taunted, made to show signs repeatedly of his/her subservience. Dutch sociologist Don <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011392112456500">Weenink (2011)</xref>, in an investigation of hundreds of court cases, calls this ‘playing the humiliation game.’ A bullying group of toughs pick out an isolated or socially incompetent target, and proceed not only to hurt him at length but to humiliate him by repeatedly demanding self-denigrating expressions. Such humiliator-bullies excuse their violence by the dominant discourse of ‘he offended me,’ but the provocative behavior typically is no more than being nerdy or different. The victim is made to beg for mercy, to take the blame on oneself, to make derogatory comments about oneself echoing the accusations of the dominators.</p>
<p>The longest tunnels, the most prolonged immersion in the altered state of consciousness, are sustained by a series of self-reinforcing feedback loops, involving the overt or tacit communications between dominant attackers and passive or humiliated victim, and the bodily movements of violent attack. On the physiological level, the flooding of the body with adrenaline and cortisol starts already during the phase of confrontation and increases during the escalation into violence. What determines variations in how long this arousal persists needs further analysis. My hypothesis is that social/interactional mechanisms and subjective loops of self-interaction can prolong this physiological arousal. Alternatively, the adrenaline/cortisol arousal may subside, but the behavioral pattern of violent attack continues on, as a kind of momentum imparted initially by physiology and taken up by social/interactional mechanisms that I have described as various types of entrainment.</p>
<p>Self-entrainment in one’s own rhythms (mechanism A) and reciprocal micro-coordination between attacker and victim (mechanism B) appear to be characteristic of medium-length tunnels of violence. Self-entrainment is the shorter-lasting mechanism. Individuals come down from an adrenaline/cortisol rush within an hour or less;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0011392112456500">6</xref></sup> and it is their self-absorption in their own pounding heart, flailing limbs and repeated use of weapons, or involuntary laughter, that is the repetitive feedback loop that keeps them in the tunnel, and so out of touch with their surroundings. Reciprocal micro-coordination (mechanism B) goes on longer because perpetrators need not be in a self-enclosed frenzy; their victim’s behavior is a larger part of the feedback system. Thus bullies/humiliators are calmer than purely self-entrainment types of violent persons, having learned to provoke their victim into the behavior that makes it easy for them to renew their emotional high by tormenting the victim again (Weenink, 2001).</p>
<p>Turning now to mechanism (C), I suggest it is especially important in long tunnels (over a few hours, up through days or weeks); but mechanism (C) may also be involved in shorter tunnels when combined with other mechanisms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0011392112456500">
<title>(C) Audience/team entrainment</title>
<p>Here a group of violent attackers greatly outnumber their victim, or a large audience encourages the violence; thus the micro-social feedback loop is chiefly between perpetrators and their supporters. We see this pattern in photos of violence in riots, where almost all the violence happens in groups of between three and six attackers beating up a single victim who has fallen to the ground (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392112456500">Collins, 2008</xref>: 115–131). Evenly matched forces, in contrast, are more likely to engage in standoffs, doing no more than blustering at each other. A great disparity in numbers makes one side dominant emotionally, so that they become entrained in their group rhythm, their mutual focus eclipsing confrontational tension with the victim. They make violence a Durkheimian solidarity ritual among themselves. In riots, the great majority of the crowd does not take part in the violence; using data from photos and videos, I estimate 90–99% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392112456500">Collins, 2008</xref>: 413–429, 520). But the non-participating part of the crowd is not superfluous. They provide a necessary backdrop to the small clusters of violent activists, by cheering or otherwise just making noise; they provide the emotional support that enables the violent elite to keep up their emotional energy. The crowd creates an emotional attention space, the center of which is occupied by the violent activists. They are the center of attention, and know that they are; the tacit orientation between violent activists and crowd supporters is what makes this form of violence successful.</p>
<p>My data show that the attitude of the crowd controls how long and severe the fight will be: when the audience enthusiastically cheers the fight, it is prolonged; when the audience is indifferent, fights are mild; when the audience actively opposes a fight or becomes bored with it, the fight quickly ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392112456500">Collins, 2008</xref>: 203–204).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0011392112456500">7</xref></sup> The exception is where the number of attackers is relatively large; here the attitude of the surrounding crowd does not matter, since the fighters constitute a big enough audience for themselves. This might be referred to as team entrainment: the members of the attacking force circulate emotional signals among themselves, amplifying their polarization against the enemy, and egging each other on to keep up the attack. I suggested at the outset that the Oakland cop who shot a prone man in the back of the head was reacting more to the agitation of his police partner than to the behavior of the victim. Comparisons show that the more police officers are called to a chase or standoff, the more likely police violence is to happen, the arrested person being beaten or shot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392112456500">Collins, 2008</xref>: 129; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011392112456500">Worden, 1996</xref>). The mechanism of team entrainment produces more violence, on both sides of the law. This appears to be the same mechanism in prolonged crime sprees, usually carried out by pairs or small groups of perpetrators. In contrast, work rampages (where a disgruntled employee or former employee returns to attack the workplace) are usually carried out by a solo individual; their tunnel of violence is usually fairly short, on the order of minutes, rarely as long as an hour. Such violence lacks support both from audience and from a team.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section10-0011392112456500">
<title>Tunnels with no exit</title>
<p>Another important variant becomes apparent when we look at tunnels of violence as short, medium, or long. Some of them are relatively easy to cut off. As noted, in many of the short tunnels, an emotional shift in the initial confrontation can precipitate some persons over the brink into violence; but <italic>ct/f</italic> is still very strong, no rhythm is set up, and the fighters quickly are precipitated back out again. Particularly when sides are relatively evenly matched, such as confrontations between rival gangs, the confrontation is mostly bluster, hitting or shooting if it happens is very brief and inaccurate, and both sides beat a hurried retreat (see evidence in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011392112456500">Wilkinson, 2003</xref>). The mechanisms of self-entrainment (A), reciprocal entrainment (B), and audience/team entrainment (C) can keep violence going on longer, producing medium or long tunnels. But the medium and longer tunnels vary among themselves in another way: for most of them, the tunnel eventually ends; the altered state of consciousness passes, and the perpetrator is back into normal consciousness, the violence finished. But in a dramatic subset, usually the most violently destructive cases, the perpetrator enters the tunnel permanently.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether such attackers consciously plan their violence to be a suicidal life-ending episode by seeking to be killed, or whether they just find their way into the tunnel, where perception of time is distorted and there is no future, and never find their way out. In some circumstances, persons who enter this killing frenzy cannot stop. In the Indonesia massacre of Chinese in 1965, some participants went on marauding even after their racial targets were dead, and eventually were shot down by the Indonesian army (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011392112456500">Cribb, 1990</xref>). This appears to be related to the tradition of amok, in which an individual who wants to end his life and/or avenge a grievance launches himself into a frenzied attack on everything around him, until he is finally killed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011392112456500">Westermeyer, 1973</xref>).</p>
<p>But the tunnel with no exit is not entirely a matter of cultural traditions; in the US and Europe, school rampage killings and work massacres often end with the perpetrators killing themselves or being killed by the police; and murderous crime sprees typically end with the death of the marauders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011392112456500">Katz, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011392112456500">Newman et al., 2004</xref>). They enter into their spree and make no effort to bring it to an end. This is not necessarily a matter of suicidal intention at the outset, but may emerge as the spree goes along.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0011392112456500">8</xref></sup> The mechanisms that cause this kind of perpetual self-entrainment in the tunnel of violence are not well-understood. The physiological arousal of adrenaline and cortisol will eventually come back down to normal, but some other kinds of social and cognitive/subjective mechanisms can prolong violence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0011392112456500" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>To recapitulate the key points: Most conflicts do not escalate to violence because they cannot circumvent the barrier of <italic>ct/f</italic>. Some situational circumstances precipitate violence, but the tunnel is usually short, a few minutes or less, because the high level of emotional/physiological rush makes fighters incompetent, disoriented, and uncomfortable, and precipitates them back out again as soon as they can find a way to escape. Some circumstances produce a medium-length tunnel of violence, up to an hour or more; here the violence is prolonged by the mechanisms of self-entrainment in one’s own rhythms; by reciprocal entrainment between the attacker who imposes the rhythm and the victim that follows it; or by entrainment between audience/team and violent actor. For relatively long tunnels of violence – those lasting for hours or days – the physiological mechanisms must be prolonged or taken over by social interactional mechanisms, including subjective feedback loops of consciousness and emotion, that keep up the emotional engrossment and the altered state of consciousness, long past the point at which the adrenaline/cortisol rush would normally subside. I have raised the question – as yet unanswered – as to why some perpetrators stay in the tunnel of violence until their own death brings it to an end, while most perpetrators eventually come down from their emotion and return to normal consciousness.</p>
<p>I will add two points. First, there are some individuals who manipulate the tunnel of violence for their own advantage. They are sophisticates of violent situations; they recognize that adrenaline rush will occur, that there will be perceptual distortions, that they will experience a state of altered consciousness. They become experts at stepping into and out of the tunnel of violence, under their own conscious control. Professional enforcers for organized crime – those whose job is to intimidate persons who owe money or otherwise try to evade control by a criminal enterprise – often deliberately practice a ferocious demeanor; they do this not in order to be out of control, in the zone of ferocious violence, but precisely for the opposite purpose, to scare the victim but keep him/her alive and functioning for the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392112456500">Collins, 2008</xref>: 435–436). Bully gangs who specialize in humiliating their victims at length enjoy their activity, talk and laugh about it among themselves, and plan their forays in the tunnel as deliberate episodes of recreation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011392112456500">Weenink, 2011</xref>). Similarly, members of police SWAT teams, some specially trained soldiers, and other official specialists in violence cultivate their ability to perform inside the tunnel of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392112456500">Collins, 2008</xref>: 381–409; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011392112456500">King, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011392112456500">Klinger, 2004</xref>). Their violence is not necessarily cold and emotionless, but it is instrumental; such sophisticates of violence operate on a meta-level of consciousness, recognizing the emotional forces of the tunnel and adjusting to them for calculated purposes. Clearly, such sophisticates are operating in an entirely different fashion from those who enter the tunnel with no exit.</p>
<p>Finally, I would urge a program of micro-sociological research on the subjective phenomenology, and the detailed emotional and physical expressions, of persons in these various kinds of violent experience. We need data from interviews and other methods on people who have taken part in these various kinds of violence – the different pathways around <italic>ct/f</italic> , the different length tunnels of violence – as to their experience of their own physiology and sensory perception. Do they all experience the pounding heart beat that makes motor coordination so difficult? What kinds of sensations, if any, do they feel in their bodies? How much distortion of sounds, how much slowing down or speeding up of time, how much visual blur or visual clarity? Are there different patterns for persons in very short tunnels, compared to those in medium, long, and no-exit tunnels? My discussion above implies that for the longer tunnels, the extremely intense physiological rush and perceptual distortions, characteristic of impulse, short-tunnel violence, are mitigated in some ways for longer tunnels.</p>
<p>A key role here may be internal dialogue. Researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011392112456500">Archer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011392112456500">Collins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011392112456500">Wiley, 1994</xref>) have now made some progress in methods of collecting and analyzing self-talk – utterances that go through people’s minds as they talk to themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0011392112456500">9</xref></sup> Highly competent users of violence – some police, snipers, hitmen – use internal dialogue to guide themselves through violent situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011392112456500">Artwohl and Christensen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011392112456500">Klinger, 2004</xref>). These are the individuals who appear to have the greatest amount of sophisticated meta-consciousness of the pressures of violent situations and how they themselves can best perform in them. We know less about internal dialogue for persons whose violence is shaped by other mechanisms. Does all internal dialogue blank out for them? If so, this would unpack another dimension of the often-reported experience of being in an altered state of consciousness, since inner dialogue is a key feature of normal conscious life. Do they go ‘on autopilot,’ feeling they are merely going through a rhythm that takes them over? Police officers and soldiers often say ‘my training took over,’ i.e. they did what they had learned to do as an unconscious habit, without verbally thinking about it. But also, violent persons could go ‘on autopilot’ in a negative sense, simply feeling out of control, pushed around by forces internal or external to their own bodies and consciousness.</p>
<p>We would also like to know this for victims of violence, those who are dominated by others: do they blank out their internal dialogue, into a generalized passivity? Does the freezing up of bodily movements that characterizes many victims of extreme violence extend to mentally freezing up as well? Yet another possibility is that some violent individuals have a runaway interior dialogue; at the extreme, they hear voices that they do not own as their own (part of the clinical definition of psychosis).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0011392112456500">10</xref></sup> But it may be that the chaos of external impressions is matched by a chaos of internal voices – one way to perform incompetently in a violent situation is to be overwhelmed by an incoherent internal dialogue. These conjectures are for the most part very hypothetical; there is no good evidence that the stereotyped ‘raving lunatic’ produces much violence, and I have argued as to why persons who are severely mentally ill would be unlikely to have the micro-interactional sensitivity that is one of the bases of performing violence competently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392112456500">Collins, 2008</xref>: 187–189). On the whole, I am inclined to expect that lack of internal dialogue goes along with the stronger processes of entrainment, and that only those sophisticates who use meta-consciousness to instrumentally manipulate violent situations have much internal dialogue.</p>
<p>Finally, what is the value of penetrating deeply into these micro-mechanisms, to the level not only of emotions but physiology, and the details of their time-dynamics? Such a research program is an important step for testing the theory of violence as a set of pathways around confrontational tension/fear. Since the process of violence, and its triggering-off, involves both the perpetrator’s own <italic>ct/f</italic>, and their target’s, we need to pay close attention to the micro-details of persons on all sides of a threatening episode – not just the person who retrospectively becomes called the perpetrator, but also the victim or loser, as well as audience and bystanders. Such comprehensive data from real-life violent episodes are becoming increasingly available, with new techniques such as mobile phone cameras and CCTV surveillance cameras (an example is the research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392112456500">Levine et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Examining the micro-sociology of participants in situations where violence threatens also promises important payoffs on the applied level. From micro-interactional ethnographies, we know that threatened violence often aborts; even in military situations, standoff is more common than attack. This means that the triggering mechanisms for escalating violence – in terms of my theory, finding pathways around <italic>ct/f</italic> – are crucial for violence or for heading it off, in each immediate local situation. Self-awareness of emotional mechanisms and feedback loops opens up the possibility of human actors controlling their emotional mechanisms, and thus their violence. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392112456500">Klusemann (2010)</xref> showed by analysis of videos how the tipping point to a massacre came about in the ethnic cleansing wars in former Yugoslavia in 1995. More widespread awareness of the micro-sociological mechanisms that allow or that prevent violence are literally a matter of life of war or peace, potentially under the conscious control of participants in the local situation. In this respect, where most theories of violence are pessimistic – pointing to long-term patterns of life-course, social inequality, or cultural grievance – micro-sociological theory of violence is optimistic. The macro-conditions leading to violence are relatively intractable, and our chances of changing them in the foreseeable future are dim. But whatever the grievances or structural tendencies toward violence, all potential violence must pass through the eye of the needle which is situational <italic>ct/f</italic>. Situation by situation, violence can be avoided. Conscious awareness of how to promote this is what the micro-situational theory of violence can provide.</p>

<p>As evidence, violence is easiest to carry out when the attacker cannot see the eyes or face of the victim. Armed robbers prefer to perform a hold-up from behind, and become tense when victim and robber stare in each other’s faces; Mafia hitmen specialize in shooting their victim suddenly in the back of the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392112456500">Collins, 2008</xref>: 430–440). German special police units executing Jews in Poland during the Holocaust were most successful when their victims were lying face down to be shot in the back of the head, and were most likely to shirk in their killing duties when they could see the victim’s face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011392112456500">Browning, 1992</xref>). Violence in prisons and in police raids is higher when either the attackers or the victims wear hoods over their head, thereby hiding their human expressiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392112456500">Grossman, 1995</xref>).</p>

<p>Distant and clandestine violence are action-sequences extending further back in time than the immediate micro-situation; they are often institutionalized tactics, planned and set in motion by formal organizations. But these tactics have been chosen and institutionalized because they solve the micro-sociological obstacle of <italic>ct/f</italic>. The macro-sociological organization of violence is responsive to the micro-sociology of the <italic>Schwerpunkt</italic>.</p>

<p>Some analysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011392112456500">Barchas and Mendoza, 1984</xref>) have referred to this type of linkage as ‘socio-physiology,’ to emphasize the role of social interaction among persons in triggering physiological mechanisms.</p>

<p>I am invoking a symbolic interactionist theory of the inner self as social, in which the key activity of consciousness is comprised of thought, internalized dialogue. See Collins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011392112456500">2004</xref>: 183–220) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011392112456500">Wiley (1994)</xref>. The subjective experience of consciousness also involves internalized emotions coming from social interactions, reshaped and amplified in various ways through interaction among the various parts of the self; this is an aspect of the sociological theory of the self that needs more close study.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-0011392112456500">

<p>Earlier, I began by dividing different kinds of violence into four main pathways around the barrier of confrontational tension/fear. Two of these types (pathway number 1: finding a weak victim) and (pathway number 2: orienting to a supporting audience) now come into play with my present examination of the micro-mechanisms that sustain emotional impetus for tunnels of various length. (A: self-entrainment) and (B: reciprocal micro-coordination) are both components of (pathway number 1: finding a weak victim); (C: audience or team entrainment) is an explication on the micro-level of (pathway number 2: orienting to a supporting audience).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-0011392112456500">
<label>6.</label>
<p>This is a rough estimate from observations of violent situations; the actual length is subject to variation with other conditions yet to be spelled out. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011392112456500">Mazur (2005)</xref>.</p>

<label>7.</label>
<p>This is based on my analysis of 89 incidents of unarmed fights, observed by myself and my students. A hypothesis arising from the above is that the audience support mechanism produces tunnels of violence that are more easily, or more abruptly, truncated than other types of violence. The violence depends largely on an external mechanism, much less dependent on internal physiological and emotional feedback loops with the violent actors. On the other hand, if the audience favors violence, it can keep it going for a longer time in the absence of strong internal emotional mechanisms.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-0011392112456500">

<p>In this respect murderous sprees have a different mechanism than serial killers; the latter usually kill one victim at a time, with long intervals between; and serial killers usually have a well-controlled normal identity, which they use as their cover during the intervals between killings, and as a tactical device for approaching their victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011392112456500">Hickey, 2002</xref>). For this reason, I hesitate to include serial killers as operating through the mechanisms of the various tunnels of violence. Their explanation must lie elsewhere.</p>

<p>There is scattered information of self-talk during episodes of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392112456500">Collins, 2008</xref>: 435), but as yet there are no systematic comparisons among different scenarios and types of violence.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011392112456500">Wiley (1994)</xref> theorizes mental health and strong self-agency as the ability to use internal dialogue to maintain one’s own plan of action against external pressures and unwelcome emotions alike; and mental illness as impairment of internal dialogue.</p>
