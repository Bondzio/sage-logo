<p><italic>This Incredible Need to Believe</italic></p>
<p>Julia Kristeva</p>
<p>Translated by Beverley Bie Brahic</p>
<p>New York: Columbia University, 2009. 136 pp. $19.95</p>
<p>This book from linguist and psychoanalyst Julia Kristeva, which offers perhaps the most comprehensive overview of her religious thought to date, consists of a collection of interviews, lectures, and short commentaries in which she discusses not only belief but also suffering, the relationship between Christianity and modern humanism, and the Catholicism of John Paul II. Readers who come to this volume without any familiarity with Kristeva’s earlier works—especially <italic>Powers of Horror</italic> (Columbia University, 1982), <italic>Revolution in Poetic Language</italic> (Columbia University, 1984), <italic>Tales of Love</italic> (Columbia University, 1987), <italic>Black Sun</italic> (Columbia University, 1989), and <italic>New Maladies of the Soul</italic> (Columbia University, 1995)—can expect to arrive at only a limited understanding of the author’s arguments as presented here. The relatively brief exposition of her ideas afforded by these short pieces demands a prior knowledge of her work, as well as a thorough grounding in Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan, among others.</p>
<p>It is impossible in this brief review to do more than hint at the dense argument that Kristeva develops in the title interview with Carmine Donzelli. However, it is undeniable that her concern with what she here calls “prereligious” belief represents for her a possible opening into a new kind of politics and a new relationship among the monotheistic religious traditions, traditions whose present tendency toward fundamentalism threatens to bring civilization to its knees. For Kristeva, because the need to believe—or to have faith?—arises from the earliest stages of individuation, is reflected in human history, and must be satisfied as a precondition for any future, a reclamation of belief is necessary to save (post-Christian) humanism from the crisis of meaning that seems to be the defining condition of the contemporary world. But belief in what? In some ways, it seems hardly to matter, as long as the truth that one asserts when one says “I believe” is inescapable and absolute. Nevertheless, the terms in which she defines belief seem to render it at least quasi-religious. For Kristeva to say “I believe” means “I hold as true,” and truth, here, is that “to which I cannot not adhere, that totally, fatally subjugates me.” It is the truth, in other words, of <italic>credo quia absurdum</italic> (3). And herein lies one of the problematic moves of this book. Kristeva’s reading of the father of Freud and Lacan emerges here as inexorably entangled with a Christian understanding of paternity. The father who grounds belief, for Kristeva, is the father whose “loving authority makes me exist” (10). If, as she argues in the opening letter to Frédéric Boyer (“The Big Question Mark: In Guise of a Preface”), “faith holds the key to the act of speech itself” (x), and if “I don’t speak unless I am supported by my ‘believing, waiting’ addressed to the loving father of the individual prehistory” (xi), is belief necessarily religious, necessarily Christian? Kristeva’s emphasis on the role of the loving father in grounding belief—and speech, and existence itself—is especially problematic when she turns her attention to Islam, which she describes as having ruled out “any idea of <italic>paternity</italic> in its idea of the divine” (67)—an exclusion that, for Kristeva, handicaps “a possible opening of Islam toward the ethical and political problems raised by the freedoms, full of risks, of the men and women of the third millennium” (68). If, as she suggests, her project here is tied up with “the challenge of different kinds of fundamentalism and the wars of religion” (2), what are we to make of a notion of belief that all too easily supports a privileging of Christianity in relation to other religions, even that religion with which Christianity finds itself most at war today?</p>
<p>The other short pieces in this collection combine to provide the title interview with a context that seems to underline this privileging of Christianity. Both “From Jesus to Mozart (Christianity’s Difference),” an interview with Claire Folscheid, and “Suffering” seem to position a Christian understanding of suffering as a necessary precondition for psychoanalytic sublimation, while both “The Genius of Catholicism” and “Don’t Be Afraid of European Culture” offer complimentary assessments of the importance of Pope John Paul II, whom Kristeva sees as having affirmed his own embodied particularity in a way that makes possible the dream of an encounter between Christianity and the humanism that grows out of it, an encounter that “has the ambition to elucidate the perilous paths of freedom” (106).</p>
<p>None of this is to suggest that this book does not make a valuable contribution to an understanding of the place of religion in Kristeva’s thought. Quite the contrary: as always, she formulates her argument brilliantly, in a prose style that, while difficult, is exhilarating, and the breadth of the sources on which she draws from Hannah Arendt to Duns Scotus, from Teresa of Avila to Hegel, is dazzling. The reader who is willing to make the effort to meet her on the terms she establishes here will no doubt feel well rewarded.</p>
