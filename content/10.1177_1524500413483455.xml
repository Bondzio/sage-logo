<abstract>
<p>Successful behavioral change is the Holy Grail for social marketers. Meta-analysis demonstrates that effect sizes of behavioral change in social marketing campaigns is typically low. The present case study uses 4 years of survey data from an Alabama weight loss and behavioral change campaign to develop an explanation for why some people are more successful in lifestyle change efforts than others. Comforting, a communicative form of prosocial behavior, produced the greatest magnitude of change when tested as an independent variable on dependent variables, including pounds lost, amount of dairy products and water consumed, and physical activities undertaken. The case study concludes by discussing implications for social marketing academics and practitioners.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Holy Grail for health marketers is successful behavioral change. In health marketing campaigns, practitioners ask targets to give up a product, idea, or behavior in order to receive some offered personal or social benefit in exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524500413483455">Daniel, Bernhardt, &amp; Eroğlu, 2009</xref>). For example, the smoker exchanges cigarettes for the reduced risk of a heart attack. Unfortunately, for social marketers, meta-analysis shows that social marketing efforts achieve limited success, relative to effect size, in affecting behavioral change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524500413483455">Cugelman, Thelwall, &amp; Dawes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524500413483455">Snyder et al., 2004</xref>). We argue in this article that the limited effect sizes are attributable to the diversity of influencers, or driving and restraining forces, upon individuals’ behavioral choices.</p>
<p>Human behaviors are affected by a number of factors at the interpersonal, community, and ecological levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524500413483455">Glanz, Rimer, &amp; Lewis, 2002</xref>). Therefore, motivating human behavior through social marketing requires influence at many levels, “addressing barriers in the environment, enabling policies and laws, shifting social norms, and adapting to the context in which people live to support the adoption of new, healthy behaviors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524500413483455">Daniel et al., 2009</xref>, p. 2120). In light of that idea, we suggest a new approach for practitioners and academics to consider when designing social marketing campaigns: <italic>Comfort can be a driving force in bringing about behavioral change through social marketing campaigns</italic>. Because modifying one’s behavior can be a stressful process, the degree of comfort that one receives from others in the environment may influence the success of behavior modification. We further suggest that comfort can be used by social marketers to create more successful social marketing campaigns. In the management implications section, we suggest ways to elicit compassion in the targets of social marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Recently, academics have looked across five decades of social marketing research and found that social marketing campaigns can successfully motivate some people to affect behavioral change (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524500413483455">D’Souza, Zyngier, Robinson, Schollterlein, &amp; Sullivan-Mort, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524500413483455">Gordon, McDermott, Stead, &amp; Angus, 2006</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524500413483455">Helmig &amp; Thaler, 2010</xref>). In this article, we present 5 years of data from a workplace weight-loss intervention called Scale Back Alabama (SBA) as our representative case to support our notion that comforting can improve the success of social marketing efforts. During the 5 years we followed SBA, we tested various explanations for why some participants succeeded in losing weight, adopting healthier lifestyles, and modifying negative behaviors. Of the possible explanations of successful behavioral change that we tested, comforting was the most promising. Comforting is one form of compassionate behavior. In the sections that follow, we will describe the SBA program, then explain the three-factor compassion model and demonstrate how comforting fits into the model.</p>

<title>SBA Program</title>
<p>In 2007, a group of concerned professionals developed an online, workplace-based intervention designed to address the state’s staggering rate of obesity, which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1524500413483455">CDC, 2009</xref>, 2001) ranks among the highest in the nation . Survey data from 2007 and 2008 demonstrated that while participants did not use the online tools provided during the intervention, participants were still losing weight and reporting improved lifestyle behaviors. In addition to weight loss, SBA has measured program success using the following outcome variables (lifestyle behaviors): increased consumption of water, increased exercise, and increased consumption of dairy. The program officers selected these outcome variables because the variables are, generally, considered by many to be influencers of weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524500413483455">Dennis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524500413483455">National Institutes of Health, 2012</xref>). SBA coordinators also measured certain key concepts over the years that they believed would help in assessing the program’s success. Before providing a further description of the research methods employed in assessing SBA, we will first address those key concepts.</p>

<title>Key Concepts</title>
<sec id="section4-1524500413483455">
<title>Compassion Model</title>
<p>Compassion moves beyond empathy. Whereas empathy means connecting with the emotions of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524500413483455">Miller, 2007</xref>) who feel compassion actually take steps to help others for whom they feel badly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524500413483455">Kanov et al., 2004</xref>). Models of compassion have recently received greater attention in the organizational literature (psychology and communication), but they have not been used in social marketing research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524500413483455">Kanov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524500413483455">Miller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524500413483455">Snyder &amp; Cistulli, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524500413483455">Solomon, 1998</xref>). Compassion is a social emotion in which the compassionate person experiences feelings of distress similar to a target other and takes steps to help that target other reduce his or her distress. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524500413483455">Frost, Dutton, Worline, and Wilson (2000</xref>) argued that compassion “involves people allowing feeling to guide action, rather than the reverse” (p. 26).</p>
<p>Compassion comprises three stages: noticing, feeling, and responding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524500413483455">Clark, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524500413483455">Kanov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524500413483455">Miller, 2007</xref>). One initially notices the suffering of others by either having that pain brought to one’s attention, or through an unconscious response to the other’s distress. Upon noticing the other’s distress, one must feel the other’s distress by either imagining what the distress must feel like or by actually taking on that distress through emotional contagion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524500413483455">Kanov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524500413483455">Snyder &amp; Cistulli, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524500413483455">Solomon, 1998</xref>). Finally, one must respond to the other’s distress in a way that is designed to alleviate the other’s distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524500413483455">Kanov et al., 2004</xref>). For example, one might learn while speaking with a friend that the friend is having difficulty maintaining a healthy weight and feeling down as a result. Upon hearing about the friend’s feelings, one might feel sympathetic and demonstrate compassion by offering social support. Although the provision of social support can be seen as a compassionate act, social support is a broadly defined concept that does not lend itself to making specific recommendations for practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524500413483455">Snyder, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524500413483455">Snyder &amp; Cistulli, 2009</xref>). This desire to help practitioners led us to comforting behaviors.</p>
<p>Comforting behaviors are “communicative attempts to alleviate the emotional distress of another” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524500413483455">Burleson &amp; Goldsmith, 1998</xref>, p. 246). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524500413483455">Bippus (2001</xref>) identified five specific comforting behaviors that she argued were particularly effective in alleviating others’ distress. These behaviors include “other” orientation, refraining from general negativity, different perspective, problem solving, and relating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524500413483455">Bippus, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524500413483455">Snyder &amp; Cistulli, 2009</xref>). When exhibiting an “other” orientation, one focuses his or her comments on the distressed other and demonstrates deep caring for the distressed other. When refraining from general negativity, the comforter avoids saying things that the distressed other would see as upsetting. When a compassionate person demonstrates the different perspective dimension of comfort, he or she helps the distressed other reappraise his or her problems by viewing the problems from another point of view. Problem solving includes communication in which the comforter provides advice to help the distressed other come up with solutions to his or her problem. Finally, when a comforter is demonstrating the relating dimension of comforting, he or she communicates to the distressed other a sense that the comforter understands and can relate to the problem. The comforter helps the distressed other to see that his or her problem is not unique.</p>

<title>Self-Efficacy</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524500413483455">Clark and colleagues (1991</xref>), who developed the Weight Efficacy Life-Style Questionnaire, suggested that a global self-efficacy score could be helpful as a screening element, as in determining a person’s readiness to change behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524500413483455">Luszczynska, Gutiérrez-Doña, and Schwarzer (2005</xref>) have explained that the Generalized Self-Efficacy scale measures a “broad and stable sense of personal competence to deal effectively with a variety of stressful situations.” They argue that this approach does not oppose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524500413483455">Bandura’s (1997)</xref> suggestion that self-efficacy should be conceptualized in a situation-specific manner. They likewise argue that general self-efficacy can explain a “complex set of adherence behaviors (e.g., in diabetes) or the perception of health or various symptoms” (p. 151).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1524500413483455">
<title>Social Support</title>
<p>Albrecht and Adleman (1987) defined social support as “verbal and nonverbal communication between recipients and providers that helps recipients manage uncertainty and enhance self-efficacy.” For individuals attempting healthy lifestyle changes, giving and receiving social support can be important to successfully changing lifestyle behaviors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524500413483455">Schwarzer &amp; Leppin, 1991</xref>). Social support can be provided face-to-face, or through mediated communication, through the Internet for example. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1524500413483455">VanLear, Sheehan, Withers, and Walker (2005</xref>) applied the social support construct to computer-mediated communication in their study of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) groups. VanLear and colleagues found support for their hypothesis that asynchronous (on the Web) AA meetings’ interaction patterns were more supportive than those of synchronous (face-to-face) AA discussions. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524500413483455">Lemay, Clark, and Fenny (2007)</xref> created a model that demonstrates positive relationships among (1) the support that a partner perceives she <italic>receives</italic> from her dyadic partner, (2) the support the she believes she <italic>gives </italic>(projects onto) to her partner, and (3) her <italic>satisfaction</italic> with the relationship.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>We have followed SBA, a social marketing program in Alabama, for 5 years. Using this program as our representative case, we have been able to test various variables, in search of a richer understanding of how to make social marketing efforts more effective. The data we have collected underpin our argument that compassion can be used to increase social marketing’s impact.</p>
<sec id="section8-1524500413483455">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>SBA is a statewide program that recruits participants in their workplaces. Many of the participants are employees of the state government; however, employees of private entities also join. The program has funding for public relations activities, such as public service announcements (PSAs) and a website, and often engages the services of a local celebrity. Former contestants on reality shows such as Biggest Loser and American Idol, as well as popular college football coaches, have served as spokespersons for SBA. Because of the substantial public relations efforts, the intervention is widely reported by various media outlets across the state.</p>
<p>Participants formed their own teams and joined in groups of four, primarily from their places of employment. Once enrolled in SBA, each team member committed to losing at least 10 pounds in 10 weeks. During the intervention, participants receive additional social marketing program messages in the form of encouragement, support, and nutritional and exercise information. The messages come to participants through the SBA website, as well as through weekly e-mails from the contest sponsors. E-mail messages are crafted to be highly inspirational and motivational, with an emphasis on marketing messages such as “you can do this and here’s how.” The social marketing tools employed in the SBA program have changed with the times, based upon survey data collected yearly.</p>
<p>In early iterations of the contest, SBA program officers used webcasts and other Internet technologies to provide contest participants with health tips and access to online resources for healthier lifestyles. Survey data indicated these social marketing tools were not being used by participants (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524500413483455">Table 1</xref>). That negative finding ran contrary to research that suggests that between 40% and 70% of people who use the Internet do so for seeking health information, support, and services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524500413483455">Aspden &amp; Katz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524500413483455">Mittman &amp; Cain, 2001</xref>). Those researchers’ findings supported SBA program officers’ belief in the importance of social marketing via technology. However, the program officers redirected their efforts from webcasts toward social media such as Facebook, and redoubled their efforts on using e-mail correspondence. Still, these tools did not explain participants’ success in the program (as measured by weight loss, increased water consumption, increased exercise, and increased dairy consumption). Therefore, we began to test human interactional variables, outlined below, to explain program success.</p>

<p>Annually, during the 10-week program, SBA participants receive an e-mail invitation to participate in a web-based survey, with a web link to a participants’ survey. Participants do not provide their names, thereby assuring their confidentiality. Upon clicking the web link in the invitation, participants received consent information and selected a check box to continue into the survey. The survey procedures did not vary from year to year. However, there was some minor variation in the survey items (see concepts measured above).</p>

<p>The population of interest was all SBA participants for 2008–2011. The SBA contest officials sent e-mail invitations to all program participants for whom addresses existed. While the study participants self-selected into (or out of) the study after receiving the e-mail invitation, the data sets are relatively large, and as such provide considerable statistical power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524500413483455">Bartlett, Kotrlik, &amp; Higgins, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524500413483455">Cohen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524500413483455">Sawyer, &amp; Ball, 1981</xref>).</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>SBA, as a social marketing campaign, has been successful in leading participants to lose weight and affect lifestyle changes discussed previously and shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1524500413483455">Table 4</xref>. Furthermore, the data reveal that interactions among team members are related to the successful modification of behaviors associated with weight loss. As the propositions derived from the findings suggest, social marketers should consider the role of human interactions, as driving and restraining forces, in designing more effective social marketing campaigns targeting behavioral change. SBA did not collect information about social interactions with people outside of the intervention (e.g., family and friends), but others may wish to collect these data when evaluating the impact of social marketing campaigns.</p>

<italic>Proposition 1: </italic>Comforting behaviors from team members can be effective in helping one make healthy lifestyle changes, including weight loss.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>In this study, we have focused on responding to the distress of others in the form of comforting. SBA participants form four-member teams, which brought them into contact with others experiencing stress induced by lifestyle change. We thought that this contact with distressed others might elicit a desire to respond to others’ distress in the form of comforting. The present findings confirm that notion (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1524500413483455">Table 4</xref>).</p>
<p>During the 2011 campaign, SBA measured perceptions of comforting behaviors received from one’s SBA team members. Not only did SBA members report receiving comfort from their team members, but the relationship of that comfort with lifestyle and weight loss changes was nearly universal across the five factors. Participants whose team members (1) exhibited an “other” orientation, (2) provided problem solving advice, (3) related to the participants’ distress, and (4) helped the participants see their stress from a different perspective reported (a) increasing water consumption, (b) increasing exercise, (c) increasing dairy consumption, and (d) losing weight. Although SBA participation has led to success, we conclude from the data that the provision of comfort by team members is an important indicator of success in the program. Therefore, to capitalize on the social marketing campaign, SBA officials should consider moving beyond the provision of information about losing weight and modifying lifestyle behaviors to enhancing team member compassion.</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Proposition 2:</italic> Some comforting behaviors exhibited by team members are more effective in helping one make healthy lifestyle changes, including weight loss.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Four of the five comforting factors were related to positive lifestyle behavior changes and weight loss. We discovered one exception to this rule. The refraining from negativity factor’s impact on lifestyle behavior changes and weight loss was small and statistically insignificant (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1524500413483455">Table 4</xref>).</p>
<p>The findings provide strong evidence that the provision of comfort is indicative of participant success in SBA. We contend that the four factors that are positive influences of behavior change and weight loss are proactive forms of comforting. These factors are focused on what comfort providers are doing when providing comfort, rather than what they are not doing. This may, in part, explain why the refraining from negativity factor did not operate similarly to the other comforting factors. The findings relative to refraining from negativity and social support suggest that social marketing campaigns that seek to encourage social interaction should encourage positive, supportive behaviors instead of discouraging negative behaviors. This recommendation is in line with research on social undermining. In social undermining, one’s attempts to succeed at a behavioral or lifestyle change are met with efforts by a significant to sidetrack these changes. For example, a person trying to lose weight may be told that they have too much to lose to be worth the effort. The research suggests that social undermining can adversely affect one’s success when attempting to lose weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524500413483455">Ferrera, 2006</xref>).</p>

<italic>Proposition 3: </italic>
</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Social support from team members can be effective in helping one make healthy lifestyle changes, including weight loss.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Across the years, the data affirm social support’s role in positive lifestyle changes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1524500413483455">Table 4</xref>). The first-year SBA measured social support, there were very small negative correlations with the behavioral change variables, yet a very small positive correlation with weight loss. We attribute the direction of the correlation to the inadequate measurement instrument. When SBA adopted more sophisticated measures in 2009, 2010, and 2011, 10 of the 11 correlations changed from negative to positive, and the relationships were substantially larger in magnitude. Moreover, the correlations across the 2009–2011 measures of social support were consistent in magnitude. These changes suggest the importance of using previously validated and reliable measures.</p>
<p>The typical participant reported receiving social support from team members about once per week during the campaign. Additionally, those employees who received more social support also reported increasing their dairy consumption, increasing their water consumption, and increasing their exercise activities, as well as losing weight, which were outcome variables indicating success in the program. In sum, people who participated in SBA affected behavioral changes and achieved weight loss. Although behavioral changes and weight loss suggest SBA is a successful social marketing campaign, practitioners should be aware that the variables that most associated with individuals’ successes were those of human interaction (social support and comforting), not the web-based tools deployed by the SBA program staff.</p>

<sec id="section11-1524500413483455">
<title>Discussion and Recommendations</title>
<p>A discussion of the inclusion of comforting, a compassionate behavior, in social marketing campaigns cannot be held without addressing marketing communications. We contend, based upon our findings, that social marketers should consider developing messages that encourage participants to give and receive both social support and comfort. While this advice may seem, upon first glance, either simplistic or intuitive, our review of the literature reveals that our work in this area is without precedent. Some research has linked social support to success in social marketing campaigns (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524500413483455">Van Duyn et al., 2007</xref>). But to the best of our knowledge, comfort has not been included in any of this research. Therefore, communications channels represent a continuing opportunity for SBA as well as social marketers in a variety of settings addressing a multiplicity of social ills.</p>
<sec id="section12-1524500413483455">
<title>Implication 1: Listen to Your Target</title>
<p>For practitioners who conduct onetime campaigns, “listen to your target” could be advice difficult to take. Practitioners can use formative research and pre-campaign investigations to develop a social marketing campaign, but this implication is intended for continuing or multisectional campaigns in which the practitioner has opportunities to adjust the campaign as needed. However, even with onetime campaigns, it is important to measure success and determine where areas exist that need improvement. Therefore, whether for a onetime campaign or for a multiyear campaign such as SBA, social marketers can learn important information from their targets, and adjust current programs or apply the knowledge gained to the construction of future campaigns. Bridging the gap between academic research and practitioners’ applied research activities can be challenging, but helpful to both the practitioner and the academic. For example, in listening to the target, SBA officials learned that social support was important to program success. When SBA adopted validated and reliable measures of social support, a clearer understanding of its impact evolved from the data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1524500413483455">
<title>Implication 2: Leverage Social Support and Compassion</title>
<p>Although SBA’s goal is to create positive lifestyle behavior changes and weight loss for its participants, SBA’s social marketing messages should focus on more than education about these changes. The present study indicates that SBA, and similar social marketing campaigns, should pay attention to human interaction.</p>
<p>Both social support and comforting behaviors were related to positive lifestyle behavior changes and weight loss. Therefore, social marketing messages should be directed, in part, at enhancing these positive social behaviors. When participants take part in a program in teams, it is important for social marketers to acknowledge the role of social driving and restraining forces. Likewise, when targets participate as individuals in social marketing campaigns, social marketers should look for opportunities to leverage social support and compassion to improve the success of programs.</p>
<p>Though few SBA participants used the provided online educational resources, we learned that participants read their e-mails from the campaign. Therefore, leveraging compassion, through communications channels such as e-mail, represents a substantial opportunity to improve the campaign’s success. After revamping the web materials in 2009, educational materials use increased dramatically. However, use of educational materials was still lower than desired. Therefore, SBA might improve its social marketing practices, including its educational materials, in a couple of ways. First, SBA is redesigning its campaign messages so that messages can be delivered effectively through one-to-one communication. Social marketing messages should also focus more on encouraging social support within the teams. If SBA’s approach is correct, these changes to the social marketing messages should lead to increased use of these communications materials and then to healthier lifestyle choices.</p>
<p>A variety of social marketing campaigns may be more effective if they were designed to use comforting to elicit compassion. For example, a recent public service announcement featuring President Obama asks people to support and encourage teenagers to go to class and stay in school. The announcement is not targeted at teenagers who are at risk of dropping out but at the family and friends of those teenagers.</p>
<p>Additionally, a safer-sex campaign might target compassionate messages to targets that give a nod to how challenging it can be to practice safer sex, when in the heat of the moment. Another example would be in antismoking campaigns. Campaigns could target compassionate messages to not only the smoker seeking to stop smoking but also their families, partners, and spouses. For instance, the messages directed at the nonsmoker’s social network could be designed to help network members understand the difficulties of quitting or equip them with information to solve problems that a smoker confronts while trying to quit. Finally, another example would be campaigns that target high school students, encouraging them to persist to graduation. Messages to friends and family members of high school students that are designed to elicit compassionate responses from them might be effective in helping the high school students make it to graduation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1524500413483455">
<title>Implication 3: Use All Three Portions of the Compassion Model</title>
<p>This study focused on the responding (comforting) portion of the compassion model. However, before one responds to another’s distress, one must first notice the distress and feel for the distressed individual. This study suggests that helping campaign targets notice and feel the distress of others is a potential, but unverified, route to engendering compassionate communications among the targets and, thus, increasing the likelihood of campaign success. Social marketing campaigns are designed to ask people to make potentially distressful changes in exchange for some personal or social benefit. Therefore, campaigns should consider the role of one’s support network during these times of distress. In doing so, campaigns may find that directing some messages to increase awareness of the target’s distress to the target’s support network could yield positive results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1524500413483455">
<title>Implication 4: Sustain the Participants’ Success</title>
<p>SBA does not know if participants sustain their healthier lifestyle choices and weight loss, which is a weakness (or failure) of the contest. Program coordinators have indicated that they have attempted to collect 6-month follow up reports from participants, but participants have not responded favorably to these attempts. Although coordinators have not gathered data on why these attempts to follow up have been unsuccessful, it is likely that participants are exhausted after participating in such a lengthy and time-consuming process. Social marketers should develop ways of tracking and reinforcing participants’ success beyond the end of the campaign. Behavioral change is difficult, and to be successful, campaigns that seek behavioral change should leverage compassion and social support across the duration of the campaign and beyond. Providing participants with the tools to be supportive and compassionate during the campaign may also help sustain the campaign’s success long after marketing communications with the audience have concluded. If this is the case, social marketers may find that comforting is the Holy Grail for increasing campaign success.</p>

<sec id="section16-1524500413483455">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Across five decades of social marketing research, the academic literature has shown social marketers using business marketing strategies and tactics to advance positive social agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524500413483455">Gordon, 2011</xref>). A limitation of the present research on this social marketing campaign is that despite attempts at 6-month follow-up surveys with participants, very few participants responded. This low response rate means that we do not know whether the SBA intervention has long-lasting effects. Through this study, we suggest a way for social marketers to potentially increase the success of their efforts, at least in the short term. In the current economy, cash-strapped social marketers need an edge to boost the impact of their work, and thus justify to funding partners the efficacy of their efforts. While leveraging social support and compassion may not guarantee positive outcomes for social marketing efforts, the present research certainly suggests strongly that they can provide a boosting edge to campaigns that the campaigns would lack without them.</p>
