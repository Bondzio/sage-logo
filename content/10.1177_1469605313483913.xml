<abstract>
<p>Drawing from the science studies literature on scientific visualization, this essay examines how techniques of imaging Maya hieroglyphs have established conditions that constrain contemporary scholars’ systems of historical imagination and interpretation. I discuss imaging techniques innovated by three significant Mayanists: J. Eric S. Thompson, Merle Greene Robertson, and Linda Schele. Building on the work of historians of science Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison, I identify these Mayanist scholars’ techniques of visualization as established practices of ‘mechanical objectivity’ and ‘trained judgment’. These practices helped to reduce aesthetically complex and materially diverse ancient Maya inscriptions to the equivalent of modernist texts. I question this reduction, drawing from the work of Bruno Latour to advocate an empirical attentiveness to the located and embodied material practices that produce equivalences between objects rendered in diverse media: stone, paint, paper, and pixels. The essay thus calls for the extension of context-oriented archaeological empiricism to practices of image production.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1469605313483913" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Diverse contemporary scholars examine how imaging techniques and technologies shape historical fields such as archaeology and art history (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469605313483913">Banks and Vokes, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469605313483913">Cochrane and Russell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469605313483913">Gillespie, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1469605313483913">Moser, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1469605313483913">Smiles and Moser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1469605313483913">Swogger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1469605313483913">Winter, 1998</xref>). Archaeologists’ imaging practices translate particular soils, features, artifacts, and monuments into reproducible paper-and-ink and digital forms that circulate among knowledge consumers. Archaeological images mutate as they move across fieldwork notebooks, scholarly publications, popular magazines, and museums. Such inscriptions condition consumers’ virtual attachments to distant objects of knowledge (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605313483913">Latour, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1469605313483913">Shapin and Schaffer, 1985</xref>). Their specific materialities enable and constrain systems of historical imagination, constituting different affective dispositions to the past.</p>
<p>Drawing from the science and technology studies (STS) literature on scientific visualization (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469605313483913">Burri and Dumit, 2008</xref>), this essay examines how techniques of re-inscribing Maya hieroglyphs and imagery have conditioned scholars’ systems of historical imagination and affect. I focus on imaging techniques devised by three significant twentieth-century Mayanists: J. Eric S. Thompson, Merle Greene Robertson, and Linda Schele. Thompson compiled a catalog of hieroglyphs, helping to render the inscriptions intelligible as individual units of meaning. Robertson, in turn, produced rubbings of monumental imagery and glyphs, enabling diverse stone inscriptions to be simulated and consumed at a distance. Finally, through skillful line-drawing techniques, Schele enabled hieroglyphs and imagery to be parsed, cut up, and experienced in new ways. I suggest that these three imaging practices were vital to the rise of arguments for hieroglyphs’ grammaticality in the 1970s and 1980s. These arguments, frequently glossed as ‘Maya hieroglyphic decipherment’, have prompted an incomplete epistemic shift by treating hieroglyphs as fully grammatical texts rather than abstract astronomical signs and rebus-writing.</p>
<p>The scholars whose techniques I examine here did not have a unified view of hieroglyphs’ grammaticality. Thompson opposed arguments that hieroglyphs were writing. Robertson supported but did not contribute directly to decipherment. Schele played a major role in decipherment. But their material techniques were all integral to consolidating Maya hieroglyphs – diverse inscriptions carved into stone architecture and wooden objects and painted onto ceramic pots and bark-paper books (or ‘codices’) between the third and seventeenth centuries CE – as a single script. Extending the work of science studies scholar Bruno <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605313483913">Latour (1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1469605313483913">1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469605313483913">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1469605313483913">2005</xref>), here I develop the claim that these scholars’ material practices operated through translations producing chains of equivalences, transforming heterogeneous objects into standardized scientific facts that could be known and manipulated at a distance from their original material contexts.</p>
<p>These facts, of course, are also artifacts of archaeologists’ and art historians’ technical practices. Historical images emerge through scholars’ intimate encounters with material traces of the past. Whether we are discussing the Iron Age Africanist’s drawing of a furnace, the Americanist historical archaeologist’s rendering of gravestone designs, or the Mayanist’s rubbing of a monument, the production of images as ‘immutable mobiles’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605313483913">Latour, 1987</xref>) erases the located specificity of the scholar–artifact encounter. Imagers – and perhaps even the images themselves – seem to want image-consumers to ignore the technical practices of image production. But ignoring these practices risks assuming direct equivalence or correspondence between the image and the imaged. The assumed correspondence obfuscates how Maya hieroglyphs and late-modern writing function pragmatically through different kinds of cultural, material, and linguistic contexts. Thus this essay is a call for extending context-oriented empiricism to practices of image production.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1469605313483913"><title>Irreductionism and Mayanist imaging</title>
<p>Mayanist epigraphy requires techniques of classification and standardization. Classification and standardization pervasively structure practices inside and outside science. In their examination of the topic, Geoffrey C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469605313483913">Bowker and Susan Leigh Star (1999</xref>: 10, emphasis in original) define classification in these terms: ‘<italic>A classification is a spatial, temporal, or spatio-temporal segmentation of the world</italic>. A “classification system” is a set of boxes (metaphorical or literal) into which things can be put to then do some kind of work – bureaucratic or knowledge production.’ By the late 1950s, scholars began to reclassify Maya hieroglyphs, putting them into a new box, treating them as grammatical writing and historical records.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1469605313483913">Thompson (1950)</xref> and Sylvanus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469605313483913">Morley (1946)</xref> had categorized hieroglyphs as icons, rebuses, and logographs (or word signs) serving limited religious purposes and lacking a full signifying capacity. Two main innovations preconditioned a turn away from emphasizing glyphs’ calendrical functions and toward reclassifying hieroglyphs as writing: identification of phonetic signs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469605313483913">Knorosov, 1952</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469605313483913">1958</xref>) and identification of patterned dates indicating texts’ historical content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1469605313483913">Proskouriakoff, 1960</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469605313483913">Berlin, 1958</xref>). Such early reclassifications began to alter the kinds of work entailed in epigraphy. Thompson, the leading epigrapher of the 1950s and 1960s, resisted Yuri Knorosov’s argument that a substantial proportion of hieroglyphs were phonetic signs. Yet Knorosov’s and Tatiana Proskouriakoff’s innovations conditioned the possibility for hieroglyphic analysis to improve understanding of ancient Maya history in addition to cosmology.</p>
<p>The reclassification of Maya hieroglyphs was not a uniform development. Just as Thompson resisted Knorosov’s arguments, Proskouriakoff expressed some doubts about hieroglyphs’ grammaticality through the 1970s. Although Mayanist David H. Kelley supported Knorosov’s arguments and undertook phonetic analyses, his work did not receive significant attention until <italic>Deciphering the Maya Script</italic> was published in 1976. Strong claims that hieroglyphs were ‘more’ than icons, rebuses, and logographs did not develop until Peter Mathews, Linda Schele, and Floyd Lounsbury achieved readings evidencing that Maya glyphs combined logographs with phonetic signs in a fully syntactic manner (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1469605313483913">Mathews and Schele, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1469605313483913">Schele, 1982</xref>). In turn, accompanying images, sometimes glossed as ‘iconography’, could no longer be understood as primarily or entirely mythological. Many such images became comprehensible as historical representations of elite Maya figures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1469605313483913">Schele and Miller, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Such interpretive shifts developed within a transforming technological and aesthetic matrix. Reclassification of Maya glyphs required production of standardized, circulable images. A substantial body of science studies literature has addressed this theme, establishing the importance of imaging practices to the formation of epistemic certainty (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469605313483913">Baigrie, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469605313483913">Baldasso, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469605313483913">Daston and Galison, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469605313483913">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469605313483913">Jones and Galison, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1469605313483913">Latour, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1469605313483913">Lefèvre, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1469605313483913">McAllister, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1469605313483913">Tucker, 2005</xref>). Of particular relevance here is Lorraine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469605313483913">Daston and Peter Galison’s (2007)</xref> history of scientific imaging and atlases, in which they maintain that the rise of objectivity as an epistemic virtue was not coeval with the rise of science. Objectivity, as a suppression of the self in the production of knowledge, became an epistemic virtue in the mid-nineteenth century, when mechanical technologies first enabled scientists to produce purportedly untouched images.</p>
<p>As I develop below, Maya hieroglyphic studies has entailed practices that strongly resemble those that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469605313483913">Daston and Galison (2007)</xref> categorize as ‘mechanical objectivity’ and ‘trained judgment’. Attending to the specific material practices of scientific imaging opens up questions concerning how to conceive forms of objectivity attentive to the embodied practices and material situatedness of knowledge production (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469605313483913">Haraway, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469605313483913">Harding, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1469605313483913">Wylie, 2004</xref>). Thompson’s, Robertson’s, and Schele’s techniques were situated material practices that can be reconstructed through analysis of their published materials. Here I trace how these researchers abstracted hieroglyphs from material and aesthetic contexts, producing inscriptions that could be segmented, manipulated, and distributed at a distance from the monuments, ceramic vessels, or books where they performed their original cultural work.</p>
<p>This analysis draws particularly on Latour’s principle of <italic>irreduction</italic>: ‘nothing is, by itself, either reducible or irreducible to anything else’ (1988: 158; quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469605313483913">Harman, 2009</xref>: 12). Latour maintains that no object or concept fully replicates or substitutes for another. Genes do not autonomously govern personalities. Socioeconomic interests do not simply determine scientific interpretations. In turn, images of hieroglyphs do not transparently reproduce original inscriptions.</p>
<p>In his book on the philosophical implications of Latour’s ontology, Graham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469605313483913">Harman (2009</xref>: 13) describes the implications of the principle that actors do not transform without mutation:<disp-quote>
<p>Every human and nonhuman object now stands by itself as a force to reckon with. No actor, however trivial, will be dismissed as mere noise in comparison with its essence, its context, its physical body, or its conditions of possibility. Everything will be absolutely concrete; all objects and all modes of dealing with objects will now be on the same footing.</p></disp-quote>No actor straightforwardly reduces to another, but this does not render explanation impossible. Rather:<disp-quote>
<p>… it is always possible to explain anything in terms of anything else – as long as we do the work of showing how one can be transformed into the other, through a chain of equivalences that always has a price and always risks failure. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469605313483913">Harman, 2009</xref>: 15)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The goal of this essay is to trace chains of equivalences in Mayanist imaging practices. This is an especially pressing problem in hieroglyphic studies. Epigraphers have asserted that hieroglyphs are transparent signs providing direct access to ancient thoughts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469605313483913">Houston, 2000</xref>: 128; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1469605313483913">Stuart, 1993</xref>: 322). Inflecting Latour’s empiricism with linguistic anthropologists’ insistence that a speech act’s sense emerges through its cultural context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469605313483913">Errington, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1469605313483913">Malinowski, 1994[1923]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1469605313483913">Schieffelin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1469605313483913">Silverstein, 1979</xref>), I maintain that the assumption that Maya hieroglyphs can be translated directly into late-modern, post-Gutenberg Press text obfuscates as much as it elucidates. Through practices that construct equivalences or associations between previously unrelated actors, scholars have articulated Maya inscriptions and contemporary writing.</p>
<p>In so doing, epigraphers have embraced an epistemology that reduces language to a system operating in an aseptic vacuum and entailing direct correspondence between signs and referents (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469605313483913">Houston et al., 2001</xref>). I hold that the language of ancient Maya inscriptions is more and less than a direct reflection of ancient Maya words and thoughts. It is more in the sense that ancient Maya signs, like all signs, function through a multiplicity of relations with disparate actors in their environments, including, but not limited to, humans. These relations or – to use a term from Karen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469605313483913">Barad (2007)</xref> that emphasizes the co-constitution of scientists and scientific objects – ‘intra-actions’ could be the topic of significant archaeological and epigraphic work tracing the situated functionalities of specific hieroglyphic inscriptions. It is less in the sense that ancient Maya signs, like all signs, do not intrinsically reference anything, and achieve sense and consequence through situated, pragmatic forms of ordinary usage (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1469605313483913">Hanks, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Through a methodological commitment to ‘follow the actors themselves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1469605313483913">Latour, 2005</xref>: 12), I examine how hieroglyphic knowledge production is predicated upon chains of local equivalences, or ‘partial connections’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1469605313483913">Strathern, 1991</xref>), that link hieroglyphs’ simulations to referents, as opposed to direct sign-referent correspondences (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469605313483913">Latour, 1999</xref>). I emphasize how imaging practices entail both equivalences and ‘cuts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469605313483913">Barad, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1469605313483913">Strathern, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1469605313483913">Watson, 2011</xref>), practices of deferring or marginalizing material objects that enabled signs to function in their original contexts. While Mayanist epigraphers have heralded decipherment as a process of imparting ‘voice’ and ‘history’ to the ancient Maya (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469605313483913">Schele and Mathews, 1998</xref>), careful attention to the field’s imaging practices reveals how this epistemic shift actually risks reducing complex material-semiotic things to monovocal, immutable ‘texts’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1469605313483913"><title>J. Eric S. Thompson’s catalog</title>
<p>Thompson published <italic>A Catalog of Maya Hieroglyphs</italic> in 1962. Although Thompson opposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469605313483913">Knorosov’s (1958)</xref> phoneticism, the catalog ultimately enabled hieroglyphic decipherment. Here I rethink the catalog as a box of equivalences predicated upon cuts that marginalize the material texture and aesthetic complexity of specific empirically accessible hieroglyphs and establish ideal hieroglyphic types as standards.</p>
<p>Thompson was not the first or last scholar to classify glyphs systematically. Such efforts date to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469605313483913">Diego de Landa’s (1994[<italic>c</italic>.1566])</xref> attempt to discern the structure of hieroglyphic writing, an inquiry flawed by his mistaken presumption that hieroglyphs functioned alphabetically. The first attempts to produce catalogs that typologically structured glyphs from codices and monuments, however, did not emerge until the twentieth century. In 1931 William Gates published <italic>An Outline Dictionary of Maya Glyphs</italic>, the first attempt to catalog hieroglyphs <italic>appearing</italic> in the three then-known codices. Günter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1469605313483913">Zimmermann (1956)</xref> later improved on Gates’ catalog in his <italic>Die Hieroglyphen der Maya-Handschriften</italic>.</p>
<p>Gates and Zimmermann focused almost exclusively on codices, neglecting monumental inscriptions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1469605313483913">Thompson (1962)</xref> rectified this omission with a catalog categorizing signs from both sources. The catalog divides 862 signs into three categories: affixes, main signs, and portraits. He provides individual listings that document the material contexts of many affixes and the 356 main signs (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1469605313483913">Figure 1</xref>). Individual listings cite as few as one example of the sign and as many as 611 examples.

</fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1469605313483913">Thompson (1962</xref>: 5–9) offers sufficient description to follow the chain of equivalences entailed in the catalog’s production. He began by acquiring photographs or photostats of as many drawings of monumental hieroglyphs as possible. He individuated the signs appearing in photographs and photostats, as well as those in drawings by Hermann Beyer. Thompson <italic>literally cut them apart</italic> and mounted them on large ‘gray cards’ (23.5x18.5 cm) with one or more cards designated for each main sign. This was a materially intensive project of cutting and pasting (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1469605313483913">Watson, 2012</xref>: 290–291), rendering the hieroglyphic system structurally sensible: ‘In the case of some of the commonest glyphs, such as Imix with 611 entries and Cauac with 427 entries, a dozen or more cards were needed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1469605313483913">Thompson, 1962</xref>: 6). Thompson did not include codex and pottery glyphs on gray cards. He added these directly in transforming gray cards into catalog listings.</p>
<p>Converting gray cards into catalog entries posed difficulties. It introduced the problem of confirming that the ideal image that headed each listing faithfully represented the definitive qualities distinguishing the type, a process resembling biological atlas makers’ efforts to produce typical images between the seventeenth and mid-nineteenth centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469605313483913">Daston and Galison, 2007</xref>: 70–75). This reduction, subordinating real, material hieroglyphs to an abstract type, was further complicated by the damaged quality of original hieroglyphs and the poor quality of images. On this point, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1469605313483913">Thompson (1962</xref>: 8) expresses reservations about the catalog:<disp-quote>
<p>Identification of such damaged specimens from indifferent photographs can hardly be objective. Indeed, decision [sic] whether to accept, query, or reject an identification must on occasions have depended on passing mood or the flow of gastric juices. Users of the catalog should bear in mind the subjectivity of my approach, and be prepared to re-examine my very fallible identification before drawing any conclusions.</p></disp-quote>Thompson lacked complete confidence in his determination of signs’ essential meanings, emphasizing the burden on catalog-users to check types against original sources (which are, I might add, still abstracted from original objects). He notes that his use of an indefinite article (a) – rather than a definite article (the) – before the titular term Catalog indicates the ‘subjectivity’ troubling his compilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1469605313483913">Thompson, 1962</xref>: 9). In this prefatory remark, Thompson even invokes the embodied specificity of categorization, commenting that ‘gastric juices’ occasionally diverted him, cutting analysis short. Despite this admitted ‘subjectivity’, Thompson’s drawings became accepted standards. In the introduction to a later catalog, Kornelia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469605313483913">Kurbjuhn (1989</xref>: i) describes Thompson’s drawings as ‘a glyphic lingua franca’ that each convey ‘the essence of a sign’.</p>
<p>Thompson’s chain of translations produced a circulable volume comprised of individual glyph listings. Each listing is headed by a glyph number, followed by a clarification of the number of existing examples, reference to gray card numbers, and numbers for listings in Gates’ and Zimmermann’s catalogs (if the glyphs were included therein). Beneath this basic information, the catalog-user finds an image of the sign in question. Each entry ends with a list of the original hieroglyphs used to create the abstract type, denoted by reference to their locations in monumental inscriptions and codices. These entries further specify associated signs, designated by their respective Thompson-numbers (or ‘T-numbers’). Thompson extended the material and semiotic labor of imperial travel writers and archaeologists who produced his source documents. But his terminological conventions typically point users ‘directly’ to examples of each type. Users of the catalog must perform their own epistemic labor to trace the network of production back to original examples, mediated by his addendum on the ‘Sources of Texts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1469605313483913">Thompson, 1962</xref>: 404–411) and the associated bibliography. The catalog shortcuts the empirical chain of equivalences by instituting categorical types that stage ‘direct’ references between listings and virtually consolidated worldly things.</p>
<p>Despite Thompson’s explicit uncertainty, his catalog has irrefutably shaped Maya hieroglyphs’ reduction to writing, providing one way to designate signs within epigraphic discourse. The T-number assigned to each listing functions as an ‘immutable mobile’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605313483913">Latour, 1987</xref>) enabling the sign to be inscribed <italic>in standard typesetting</italic> without constantly reproducing images. While the interpreted meanings of many signs have shifted over the decades, their respective T-numbers provide stable means to designate them. T-numbers enable heterogeneous objects’ reduction to standardized signs such as ‘T539’. While ‘T539’ supposedly denotes a sign’s ‘essence’, it is cut from its conditions of cultural use, what Bronislaw <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1469605313483913">Malinowski (1994[1923])</xref> classically termed an utterance’s ‘context of situation’.</p>
<p>Thompson’s catalog established obligatory conventions of hieroglyphic analysis and discourse. It serves as a model for efforts to produce updated catalogs (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469605313483913">Kurbjuhn, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1469605313483913">Macri and Looper, 2003</xref>), which may be perceived by epigraphers as reflections of disciplinary rigor. The catalog achieves power by eliding inscriptions’ heterogeneity, aesthetic complexity, and markers of specific scribes or scribal styles. It effectively dehistoricizes glyphs by introducing the illusion of direct correspondence between typologically abstract signs and heterogeneous empirical examples. The catalog transformed hieroglyphs into a closed system of context-independent signs, cut from contiguous non-hieroglyph actors (e.g. imagery, architecture, and environment) and purified into decipherable proto-text.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1469605313483913"><title>Merle Greene Robertson’s rubbings</title>
<p>Robertson was not principally concerned with exploring the linguistic basis of Maya hieroglyphic writing. Yet, beginning in the 1960s, her research helped condition the inscriptions’ epistemic transformation. While Robertson employed both photography and drawings to document Maya art, imagery, and hieroglyphs, I focus here on a practice that has not received treatment in STS imaging studies: ink and oil rubbings on paper and cloth. Robertson’s techniques became crucial for rendering monumental inscriptions visible and consumable for ‘virtual witnesses’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1469605313483913">Shapin and Schaffer, 1985</xref>). The rubbings are consequential objects for rendering Maya hieroglyphs and modernist writing equivalent. Robertson’s rubbings brought monumental inscriptions into a new regime of vision, shaping not only <italic>how</italic> hieroglyphs are experienced but also – due to the high quantity of rubbings completed and the mobility of these objects – <italic>where</italic> hieroglyphs are experienced.</p>
<p>The rubbings entailed a traceable series of practices through which inscriptions gave rise to simulations. The existing account of these practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1469605313483913">Robertson, 2006</xref>) enables their review. First, Robertson taped paper or cloth to a stone or stucco monument. She generally used rice paper but also employed mulberry paper for fragile inscriptions. Robertson dampened the paper with a badger-hair brush, chosen on account of the filaments’ firm adherence to the handle. Avoiding the hairs’ transfer to the paper was crucial to evading artifacts in the simulation. She pounded the paper into the stone’s variegated surfaces using ‘a wad of men’s handkerchiefs or several American Airline washcloths’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1469605313483913">Robertson, 2006</xref>: 50). Robertson would allow the paper to nearly dry and proceed to apply sumi ink or a mixture comprised of black- and burnt sienna-colored Winsor Newton oil paint. Oil was required for inscriptions in the humid Petén department of Guatemala because moss that builds up on monuments’ surfaces transfers too much moisture for water-soluble sumi ink. Because of sumi ink’s tendency to bleed between adjoining sheets, Robertson preferred oil for large inscriptions requiring the use of multiple overlapping sheets, such as the sarcophagus lid in Palenque’s Temple of the Inscriptions. She covered a pad in sumi ink using a palette knife and transferred ink with a silk-wrapped cotton ball. Or, she covered a piece of tin with a layer of oil paint and transferred it to the paper with her thumb:<disp-quote>
<p>I would gently press onto the tin with oil and then on to [sic] the rice paper or cloth, building the intensity of color up gradually until the desired effect was achieved. This took forever as thousands of thumb prints were necessary to complete just one monument. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1469605313483913">Robertson, 2006</xref>: 50)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>An example of the resulting images is reproduced and juxtaposed against a photograph of the same monument in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1469605313483913">Figure 2</xref>. Through this juxtaposition readers can discern effects of Robertson’s translation of monumental inscriptions into rubbings. As rubbings function on the basis of water adhering to inscriptions’ raised features and repelling ink or oil as it is applied, the marking blackens the recessed, low-relief lines and spaces. It leaves the inscription’s high-relief components comparatively unmarked, revealing the white color of the paper or cloth, in some places shaded into gray. The translation’s immediate result is an increased contrast between raised inscriptions and background.
<fig id="fig2-1469605313483913" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>A rubbing and a photograph of the carved side of Yaxchilán Lintel 25. Rubbing by Merle Greene Robertson, © Pre-Columbian Art Research Institute, 1995–2007, used with permission.

</fig></p>
<p>The technique produces a partial connection rather than an absolute equivalence. Rubbings obscure depth and accentuate contrast. The sensuous dimensionality of the lintel (the differential depth of its relief) becomes a play of shadings in the two-dimensional rubbing (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469605313483913">Jones, 2001</xref>). While the photograph is also two-dimensional, the shadows reveal the carving’s uneven depth, a kind of technological trickery evincing multiple planes of the monument’s surface. The photograph simulates a worldliness absent in the rubbing. This is the trade-off of the rubbing as an artistic-scientific mediator. The lintel’s lines become vividly defined at the expense of reducing the appearance of texture and depth (as well as color in cases where monuments’ paint remains).</p>
<p>Moreover, the rubbing presupposes and instantiates a kind of user, or ‘intra-actant’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469605313483913">Barad, 2007</xref>). The rubbing constitutes a subject viewing the monument’s simulation at a distant and fixed viewpoint, as if it were an artwork on a museum wall (the original lintel, I might add, hangs today in the British Museum). While the photograph’s perspective is stabilized, the viewer can perceive the monument’s dimensionality and perhaps more easily imagine experiencing it from a different vantage point. This dimensional reduction and experiential reorientation is particularly problematic in the case of this and related Yaxchilán lintels, as they were installed as stone ceilings in Structure 23 doorways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1469605313483913">Josserand, 2007</xref>: 302–303). The photograph and rubbing both betray the experience of the inscription by an actor standing beneath. They also cannot accommodate the dedicational inscription on the front edge of the lintel, which would have been visible to subjects on the plaza in front of Structure 23. The lintel’s bottom and side surfaces signified through spatially distinct indexical fields, potentially marking a boundary between subjects standing inside and outside a royal house doorway.</p>
<p>The experiential trade-off revealed by contrasting the rubbing and photograph exists despite the absence of any obvious technological ‘blackbox’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605313483913">Latour, 1987</xref>), such as the camera, in the steps required to translate stone into inked paper. Each of Robertson’s steps is traceable and characterized by contiguity between one mediator and the next. Robertson placed the paper directly against the monument and dampened it with a brush. She touched the ink and transferred it to the paper. Through these embodied practices, she transformed the monument into a piece of art and a scientific document. At this stage she did not require instrumental blackboxes subsuming component actors – cameras’ mirrors, shutters, and lights. She had not yet been cut from the scene, though the material contexts in which Maya actors intra-acted with the inscription did not have to be considered.</p>
<p>Once the ink dried and the simulation became a definitive record, it could be further transformed. Rubbings’ sizes replicate simulated monuments, with minor deformations that attend the reduction of three dimensions to two. The bulk of these simulations were archived in Tulane University’s Latin American Library. But most users of Robertson’s rubbings do not consult the rubbings directly. They consult facsimiled copies of Robertson’s photographs of the rubbings. It is <italic>these</italic> mediated images – copies of photographs of rubbings of monuments – that circulate throughout the Mayanist community. Thus the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1469605313483913">Figure 2</xref> rubbing is thrice-removed from the monument, abstracted further than the twice-removed ‘direct’ photograph. A Latourian empirical account slowly and deliberately follows each step of transformation, each remove.</p>
<p>While it is initially deferred, the camera becomes requisite to transforming carved monuments and stucco walls into widely accessible actors. Rubbings are both conservative and performative. They conserve, partially, the likenesses of monuments vulnerable to damage, as they perform, partially, new modes of historical attachment. Rubbings, Robertson, and the camera intra-actively produced a tertiary form, a photograph that could be reproduced, digitized, and manipulated. Photographs further deform and reform rubbings. The constraining conditions of photographic media are especially apparent in digital photographs, as their pixilation turns rubbings into artifacts of technological pointillism. Here we are far from carved stone.</p>
<p>The savviness of Robertson’s techniques did not issue from evading blackboxes such as the camera. It issued from the power of the rubbing technique to counteract a particularly loathed artifact in ‘direct’ photographs, shadowing that obscures some lines and features while revealing others. The rubbing’s reduction of the monument to two dimensions permitted Robertson to avoid photographs with shadowing. While this may seem to maximize an image’s verisimilitude, it evades the possibility that shadows might remind viewers that the image is the product of a singular instant, the photographic encounter (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1469605313483913">Raffles, 2010</xref>: 28–29). Through ‘mechanical reproduction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469605313483913">Daston and Galison, 2007</xref>), Robertson’s photographed rubbings could circulate as more abstract and detached simulations than even ‘direct’ photographs. They became detached not only from monuments but also from rubbings themselves, blackboxed on 920 linear feet of archive shelving at Tulane.</p>
<p>Robertson’s Pre-Columbian Art Research Institute maintains a digital archive of Robertson’s rubbings online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.mesoweb.com">www.mesoweb.com</ext-link>. Anyone with internet access can further transform the rubbings, multiply mediated partial connections to ancient Maya experiences. We can download, view, print, cut up, and manipulate Maya hieroglyphs and imagery. This creative presenting of the Maya past enables countless acts of further translation through situated, affective encounters with each archaeological ‘factish’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469605313483913">Latour, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1469605313483913">Stengers, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1469605313483913">2011</xref>), a product at once fact and fetish, real because of its material construction. Such images reduce the ancient Maya to a product that individuals can consume flexibly and at a distance. In recognizing their status as factishes, perhaps we can begin to intra-act with images in ways that displace structures of consumerist, imperial, or neoliberal consumption, designing new modes of coexisting today with the always-mediated ancient Maya.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1469605313483913"><title>Linda Schele’s drawings</title>
<p>Thompson’s and Robertson’s techniques preconditioned decipherment, a set of knowledge practices developed, in part, by Schele and her colleagues. In this final analysis I focus on how Schele shaped the contemporary image of Maya objects through skillful, embodied manipulation of hieroglyphs. Drawings evidence artists’ specific encounters with inscriptions in situated experiential fields. The artist’s imagination is shaped by preceding experiences that render ambiguous forms visible as hieroglyphic units of meaning. In this sense, drawing hieroglyphs is a theory-laden act of interpretation.</p>
<p>Schele’s drawings have played major roles in the epigraphic re-staging of the ancient Maya for professional and amateur witnesses. Almost 1000 of Schele’s glyph drawings are – like Robertson’s rubbings – accessible via the internet, digitally archived by the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, Inc. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.famsi.org">www.famsi.org</ext-link>), or FAMSI. The original drawings have been bequeathed to the Nettie Lee Benson Latin American Collection at the University of Texas-Austin. Thus, actors involved in producing and simulating Schele’s drawings have rendered these objects actionable and consequential at a distance from original inscriptions and original simulations.</p>
<p>Schele was a painter and art instructor before becoming a Mayanist in the early 1970s. Artistic training enabled Schele to develop powerful techniques for re-inscribing hieroglyphs. On the FAMSI website two introductions to the virtual collection provide crucial information for understanding her drawing techniques and FAMSI’s digitization techniques. In his introduction, Peter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469605313483913">Mathews (2003)</xref> praises Schele’s drawings: ‘When combined with her intimate knowledge of imagery and hieroglyphs, her skills as an artist enabled her to create simultaneously beautiful and accurate records of the monuments and objects from the Mesoamerican world she loved.’ This ‘intimate knowledge’ emerged through Schele’s careful study of Thompson’s catalog, her work imaging monuments with Robertson at Palenque, her collaborations with many scholars including Mathews and Lounsbury, and her distinctive artistic talents. Together these factors transformed how we know and experience hieroglyphs and the ancient Maya today.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469605313483913">Mathews (2003)</xref> provides a useful summary of Schele’s drawing techniques. She rendered drawings with Mylar drafting film. During the 1970s and 1980s she employed drafting pens and China ink, and by the 1990s she had transitioned to felt-tipped pigment liner pens. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469605313483913">Mathews (2003)</xref> adds that she utilized pens that could produce very fine lines, with thickness sizes ranging from 3x0 to 2 in US drafting standards (0.25 to 0.60 millimeters). Such pens mediated Schele’s intra-active production of simulations with high degrees of aesthetic precision. In his introduction to the FAMSI Schele Drawing Collection, Matthew H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1469605313483913">Robb (2003)</xref> offers additional detail concerning the digitization of drawings. They were photographed using 35-millimeter slide film to produce white-on-black negatives. FAMSI scanned the negatives and adjusted and compressed the digital images for virtual reproduction (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1469605313483913">Figure 3</xref>).

<p>Thus, we can follow the chain of partial equivalences entailed in making hieroglyphs and images originally rendered with paint or stone into paper or pixels. As I have noted, Robertson’s lithographic images do not directly simulate monumental referents. They productively reduce the objects’ complexity, dimensionality, and sensual materiality. This abstraction imbues them with scientific sense and legibility in material-semiotic fields distant from Maya monuments. Schele’s intricate and remarkably accurate drawings enacted similar reductions, particularly the translation of three-dimensional objects into two-dimensional images.</p>
<p>Yet the two series of translations differ substantially. Robertson’s rubbings required a series of direct material contiguities. In the stead of material practices bringing mediators into direct contact, Schele’s drawings entailed a spatial distancing of the artist and her tools from the simulated objects. The artist’s perception and bodily self-regulation mattered more in Schele’s freehand drawings than in Robertson’s rubbings. Drafting and redrawing inscriptions from original objects or images (including rubbings) requires considerable precision. It entails a competence that re-instantiates multiple forms of knowledge. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469605313483913">Mathews’ (2003)</xref> introduction to the Schele Drawing Collection clearly makes reference to the conjunction of these skills. Producing highly accurate line drawings required embodied aesthetic knowledge of the symbols employed as well as artistic talent (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469605313483913">Coe and Lebrun, 2005</xref>). Given that much of Schele’s prerequisite knowledge emerged through exhaustive study of Thompson’s catalog, scholars today may wish to question how her drawings evidence the (conscious or unconscious) use of Thompson’s abstract types as paradigms resolving the empirical ambiguity of particular signs’ forms.</p>
<p>A major challenge of simulating inscriptions by hand is discerning how to parse intricate intersecting lines and shapes. Although drawings are invoked as evidence for specific interpretations, they are shaped heavily by producers’ ideological and interpretive dispositions. Prerequisite embodied knowledge includes the established conventions for drawing hieroglyphs that predecessors have employed (esp. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469605313483913">Graham, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1469605313483913">Lebrun, 2005</xref>: 18–19; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1469605313483913">Thompson, 1962</xref>). These ‘techniques of the body’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1469605313483913">Bourdieu, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469605313483913">Mauss, 1973[1935]</xref>) entail cutting hieroglyphs from co-actors in their fields of association, including architecture, imagery, and environmental actors. Perhaps even more important to drawing hieroglyphs is the capacity to distinguish elements internal to hieroglyphic signs. Such parsing is a performative act rendering hieroglyphs as useful factishes for epigraphic research.</p>
<p>Drawing hieroglyphs is not an act of ‘mechanical reproduction’, as in Robertson’s rubbings. Like Thompson’s catalog, it conforms closely to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469605313483913">Daston and Galison (2007)</xref> term ‘trained judgment’ and identify as a virtue of twentieth-century science. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469605313483913">Daston and Galison (2007</xref>: 311, emphasis in original) identify the shift from mechanical reproduction to trained judgment as a compensation for the partialities of mechanical imaging:<disp-quote>
<p>Slowly at first and then more frequently twentieth-century scientists stressed the necessity of seeing scientifically through an interpretive eye; they were after an <italic>interpreted image</italic> that became, at the very least, a necessary addition to the perceived inadequacy of the mechanical one.</p></disp-quote>The rise of trained judgment attended the growing prominence of psychology and concern with the unconscious in the early twentieth century. An intensifying scientific trend was to perceive advances as results of the interplay between willfully patient empiricism and machinations of the unconscious, that source of ‘aha! moments’ which line the pages of Schele’s popular publications (esp. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469605313483913">Freidel et al., 1993</xref>) and public workshops (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1469605313483913">Watson, 2012</xref>). Travelers, antiquarians, and Mayanists have employed variably trained degrees of judgment in distinguishing shapes and forms of hieroglyphic inscriptions since the late-eighteenth century (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1469605313483913">Thompson, 1927</xref>). But it remains significant that Schele’s popular discovery narratives (esp. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469605313483913">Freidel et al., 1993</xref>) revel in unconscious activity to a perhaps unprecedented degree.</p>
<p>Schele’s trained judgment entailed carefully building on and diverging from predecessors. Schele’s finely tipped pens were crucial technological allies for her divergences, mediating the production of equivalences between stone artifacts and paper-and-ink simulations. Accurate line drawings require high degrees of calligraphic precision. The width of lines defining boundaries between elements is highly consequential. This particularly matters for monumental limestone carvings that do not have boundaries of finite thickness, and instead employ curves of differential relief, a topological play of depth elided in drawings. Thus, when simulating a carving as a line drawing, Schele continuously made judgments regarding relative boundaries of semantically significant lines. The use of such finely tipped pens reflects not just a degree of precision, but also a degree of discretionary confidence concerning how to marshal qualities of ancient and often highly damaged objects, scrupulously simulating these qualities in a new matter and form.</p>
<p>Schele’s located and embodied techniques of judgment helped to materialize hieroglyphs as intelligible linguistic units. Embedded in these aesthetic practices were interpretive positions. Schele sometimes drew hieroglyphs and scenes inscribed into the same lintel as separate images. The ability and choice to cut hieroglyphs from associated images implicitly justifies prioritization of epigraphic techniques in understanding the ancient Maya. It implies that glyphs were intelligible independent of material associations and interplay between hieroglyphs and scenes, which include both secondary texts and Maya elite figures wearing hieroglyphic signs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469605313483913">Bassie-Sweet, 1991</xref>). To become legible today, in the absence of language ideologies and indexical fields integral to their original senses, hieroglyphs had to be cut free and reassembled anew.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1469605313483913" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Thompson’s, Robertson’s, and Schele’s images play intertwined roles in Maya historical knowledge production. Epigraphers deploy Thompson’s types and manipulate Schele’s drawings to inspire new readings. These readings ground interpretations of the cultural significance of monumental tablets that Robertson imaged. The power of such historical imaging practices resides in how they are cut from the embodied, located subjects who produced them (when not distracted by gastric juices). Simulated hieroglyphs and monuments substitute for a world that has – in only some ways – crumbled into fragments and dust.</p>
<p>Images of artifacts, features, and sites can be evocative mediations of past worlds. Archaeologists increasingly employ digital media to produce virtual worlds staging new modes of witnessing and consuming mediated pasts (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469605313483913">González-Tennant, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605313483913">Morgan, 2009</xref>). Even three-dimensional virtual worlds, however, emerge through material practices and condition located encounters with simulations as newly constituted artifacts. Edward González-Tennant suggests that digital archaeological reconstructions can function as technologies for democratizing historical knowledge. We should remember that democracy is messy, complex, and slow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469605313483913">Latour, 2004</xref>), and it requires violent exclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1469605313483913">Watson, 2011</xref>). But we cannot allow the non-innocence and partiality of representation to reduce us to epistemological paralysis, and the explicit, apparent status of virtual worlds as factishes inclines me to think that they might be effective models for archaeological imaging practices productive of new modes of coexisting with, or simply improving public engagement with, the always-mediated past.</p>
<p>My account of material and empirical practices that give rise to images of Maya glyphs, ostensibly simpler archaeological factishes, serves as both a test case and cautionary tale for archaeologists. The conditions of an artifact’s or site’s consumption through specific media constrain how we think the past, and perhaps with as much force as any epistemological or theoretical orientation. Thus, archaeologists should be as explicit as possible about their techniques of imaging and simulation.</p>
<p>Attention to how practices of translation and cutting produce chains of partial equivalences between objects rendered in different media means broadening the terms of our empirical commitments, even experimenting with a radical or ‘second’ empiricism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1469605313483913">Latour, 2011</xref>: 305). In Maya hieroglyphic studies, this broadened empiricism means recognizing that re-inscriptions of hieroglyphs in media designed for late-modern text – as in the cases of T-numbers, rubbings, and digital images – introduces new constraints that may undermine the experience of complex text-artifacts for both Maya specialists and publics, including attendees of popular workshops that helped to solidify the near-hegemony of epigraphic knowledge within Maya studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1469605313483913">Watson, 2012</xref>). The alternative is not to combat aesthetic partial connections with ascetic retreat from the messiness of knowledge production, or to purge archaeological and epigraphic work on images. It is, instead, a matter of becoming more open, empirical, and experimental in narrating what is lost in the production of equivalences, using texts rigorously as supplements.</p>
<p>I cannot presently discern how to generalize about everything cut, lost, excluded, blackboxed, deferred, or occluded in reassembling Maya glyphs today. Cuts cut specifically and deeply. They resist being ordered into classificatory boxes. But I can discern that when we look at a simulation of Yaxchilán Lintel 25, including each one ‘above’, we do not see a rough stone nearly dripping with humidity on the ceiling above our heads, with dedicatory edge inscriptions beyond our immediate view but accessible upon crossing the threshold between house and plaza. And when we look at a drawing of the Tablet of the 96 Glyphs, we do not see how finely carved lines of even depth evoke the scribe’s skills. And we do not and cannot see the socially differentiated forms of ideology, collective memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469605313483913">Gillespie, 2010</xref>), and affect felt by ancient Maya coming face to face – fleshy human face to iconic stone face – with beings cut into that tablet. Maya hieroglyphs were texts, yes, but they were not <italic>merely</italic> texts. One empirical challenge today is to resist that reduction.</p>
