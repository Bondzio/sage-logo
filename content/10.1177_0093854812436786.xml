<abstract>
<p>Predicting which forensic inpatients are likely to be violent is necessary if forensic hospitals are to implement effective risk management techniques. When conducting risk assessments, clinicians have at their disposal standardized risk assessment instruments that have demonstrated ability to predict violence. The present study examined the utility of static and dynamic measures used in risk assessment to predict aggressive behavior in a sample of 103 inpatients committed to a forensic hospital after being found not guilty by reason of insanity. Results indicated that both static and dynamic measures, including psychopathy, predicted inpatient aggression; however, neither type of measure provided incremental predictive validity above and beyond the other. Implications for predicting violence with forensic inpatients is discussed with the ultimate goal of implementing effective treatment interventions aimed at reducing violence.</p>

<p>Mental health practitioners are increasingly being asked to opine on the probability that a patient will engage in violent or aggressive behavior within secure forensic institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093854812436786">Vitacco et al., 2009</xref>). Accurate prediction is essential, given the rates of staff and patient injuries and costs that result from inpatient violence. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093854812436786">Carmel and Hunter (1993)</xref> reported that 121 staff members obtained 135 injuries in the course of 1 year in a large state hospital in California. Learning more about inpatient violence is necessary, as violence in facilities creates unsafe living environments for inpatients, leads to hazardous working environments for staff, and creates preventable expenses in terms of medical bills and lost work time. As such, the development of accurate assessment strategies that lead to improved risk management techniques is of central importance to staff and patients who work and reside within the confines of secure forensic hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854812436786">Martin, 1995</xref>). Recently, researchers have devoted more resources to developing accurate models of violence prediction within secure settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093854812436786">Daffern, Ogloff, Ferguson, &amp; Thompson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812436786">McDermott, Edens, Quanbeck, Busse, &amp; Scott, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0093854812436786">Snowden, Gray, Taylor, &amp; Fitzgerald, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Accurately classifying and predicting inpatient violence is a difficult endeavor for several reasons. For example, there is no prototypical aggressive patient; instead, it appears that inpatients aggress for a variety of reasons. Such reasons range from dysfunction in basic mental processes (e.g., disturbed thinking secondary to psychosis) to a desire to receive something valuable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093854812436786">Duxbury &amp; Whittington, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093854812436786">Lussier, Verdun-Jones, Deslauriers-Varin, Nicholls, &amp; Brink, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093854812436786">Vitacco et al., 2009</xref>). A useful way for understanding aggression subtypes is the reactive-instrumental classification paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854812436786">Cornell et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093854812436786">Fontaine, 2007</xref>). As defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854812436786">Cornell et al. (1996)</xref>, reactive aggression occurs as a result of perceived provocation and is generally designed to defend against the provocation. In contrast, the ultimate goal in instrumental or predatory aggression is not to harm the other; instead, harming the other is a means toward achieving some other, ultimate goal. Although there have been criticisms of the instrumental-reactive aggression paradigm (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093854812436786">Bushman &amp; Anderson, 2001</xref>, for a review), differentiating aggression on the basis of subtypes has proved profitable in understanding inpatient violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812436786">McDermott et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093854812436786">Quanbeck et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093854812436786">Vitacco et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093854812436786">Daffern, Howells, and Ogloff (2007)</xref> evaluated 502 acts of aggressive behavior committed by forensic inpatients in a secure hospital. They found that aggression resulted from three primary sources: (a) demands of the inpatient setting; (b) anger reactions, directed especially at other inpatients perceived as instigators; or (c) desire to maintain status on the unit. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093854812436786">Quanbeck et al. (2007)</xref> evaluated data on 839 incidents of inpatient aggression and found three differing categories of assaultive behaviors: impulsive (54%), psychotic (17%), and organized (29%). In both these studies, the latter form of aggression could be classified as âinstrumental aggression,â whereas the first two forms of aggression would be most likely classified as âreactive aggression.â These studies demonstrate that inpatient aggression can be understood both by its function and by its form.</p>
<p>In conducting violence risk assessments, standardized instruments have been developed that aid the clinician in making risk determinations. Two of the most commonly relied on instruments for predicting future violence is an actuarial instrument, the Violence Risk Appraisal Guide (VRAG; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093854812436786">Quinsey, Harris, Rice, &amp; Cormier, 1998</xref>) and a structured instrument that guides professional judgment, the Historical, Clinical, Riskâ20 (HCR-20; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0093854812436786">Webster, Douglas, Eaves, &amp; Hart, 1997</xref>). Both the VRAG and HCR-20 have been used in a variety of risk assessment contexts, ranging from capital punishment to sex offender commitment evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0093854812436786">Vitacco, Erickson, Kurus, &amp; Apple, in press</xref>). The VRAGâs predictive power is predicated on its measurement of static (historical or unchanging) variables empirically linked to violence, whereas the HCR-20 evaluates both static and dynamic (changeable) variables in guiding clinicians to their decision. Although originally developed to predict community-based aggression, these instruments have been integrated into inpatient settings to assist in identifying patients most at risk for engaging in aggressive behavior. Likewise, psychopathy, which has shown to be effective in the evaluation of community-based risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093854812436786">Neumann &amp; Hare, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0093854812436786">Vitacco, Neumann, &amp; Jackson, 2005</xref>) has also been employed in inpatient settings to assist with violence risk determinations. The next three sections will describe previous research on static factors, including the Psychopathy ChecklistâRevised (PCL-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093854812436786">Hare, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093854812436786">2003</xref>) and Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version (PCL:SV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854812436786">Hart, Cox, &amp; Hare, 1995</xref>), and dynamic factors, specifically, the HCR-20, and their ability to predict violence within inpatient settings.</p>

<title>Vrag and Inpatient Aggression</title>
<p>The VRAG is a strict actuarial instrument that has evidenced strong validity related to predicting violence, including inpatient violence with individuals suffering from mental illness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0093854812436786">Snowden, Gray, Taylor, and MacCulloch (2007)</xref> demonstrated that the VRAG had good predictive power regarding postrelease recidivism in a sample of offenders with mentally disorders within the United Kingdom. The VRAG has shown substantial promise as an indicator of postrelease violence and recidivism in both forensic and nonforensic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093854812436786">Harris, Rice, &amp; Camilleri, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0093854812436786">Snowden et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093854812436786">Monahan (1996)</xref> initially described the VRAG as a âmajor advanceâ (p. 113) as an instrument for predicting violent recidivism. Although there has been evidence suggesting the VRAG does not provide incremental validity compared to psychopathy for predicting violence in a civil mental health sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093854812436786">Edens, Skeem, &amp; Douglas, 2006</xref>), the overall results for the VRAG have been positive in regard to predicting violent recidivism.</p>
<p>Several other studies have focused on the ability of the VRAG to predict violence within an institutional setting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093854812436786">Hastings, Krishnan, Tangney, and Stuewig (2011)</xref> reported that the VRAG predicted both institution misconduct and postrelease recidivism in a large sample of male inmates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0093854812436786">Wanner (2010)</xref> found the VRAG was a strong predictor of short-term (3 months or less) misconduct in African American male inmates; however, the VRAG lost much of its predictive utility when evaluated across longer time periods. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093854812436786">Ho, Thomson, and Darjee (2009)</xref> reported the VRAG had moderate predictive validity for violent behavior in a sample of 96 patients placed in a Scottish medium-security unit. Although acknowledging the limitations of using a measure that evaluates only historical variables, the authors indicated their results ârevealed that the VRAG had moderate to good predictive accuracy for predicting minor, serious, and any violence incidentsâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093854812436786">Ho et al., 2009</xref>, p. 536). They added, âVRAG scores appeared to be the best predictors of overall violence in this studyâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093854812436786">Ho et al., 2009</xref>, p. 536). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093854812436786">Reimann and Nussbaum (2011)</xref> described how the VRAG did not predict seclusions in a sample of 130 males on a medium-secure inpatient unit within 24 weeks of admission; notably, the PCL-R did predict seclusions within that same time period. In a sample of 154 patients, the VRAG was found to be a significant indicator of staff-directed assaults but not of patient-based assaults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812436786">McDermott et al., 2008</xref>). Reviewing this extant research provides an empirical basis for choosing the VRAG to evaluate the potential for inpatient aggression.</p>

<title>Psychopathy and Inpatient Aggression</title>
<p>Psychopathy is a construct that consists of interrelated traits that include superficiality, callousness, lack of remorse, and irresponsible lifestyle as well as tendencies to violate rules and engage in antisocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093854812436786">Hare, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093854812436786">Hare &amp; McPherson, 1984</xref>). The PCL-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093854812436786">Hare, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093854812436786">2003</xref>) and its progeny, the PCL:SV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854812436786">Hart et al., 1995</xref>) and Psychopathy ChecklistâYouth Version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093854812436786">Forth, Kosson, &amp; Hare, 2003</xref>), have demonstrated predictive validity with regard to violent community behavior and violent recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093854812436786">Gray, Fitzgerald, Taylor, MacCulloch, &amp; Snowden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093854812436786">Leistico, Salekin, DeCoster, &amp; Rogers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0093854812436786">Salekin, Rogers, &amp; Sewell, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0093854812436786">Z. Walsh, Swogger, &amp; Kosson, 2009</xref>). As demonstrated by reviews of case law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093854812436786">DeMatteo &amp; Edens, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0093854812436786">T. Walsh &amp; Walsh, 2006</xref>), psychopathy is frequently evaluated in clinical forensic and correctional settings. Although predicting violent recidivism with PCL measurement of psychopathy has been well established in programmatic research, its use for predicting inpatient aggression has yielded mixed results.</p>
<p>Early research studies indicated that psychopathy was a rather strong to moderate predictor of inpatient violence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093854812436786">Buffington-Vollum, Edens, Johnson, &amp; Johnson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093854812436786">Hare &amp; McPherson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0093854812436786">Hill, Rogers, &amp; Bickford, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093854812436786">McNiel, Gregory, Lam, Binder, &amp; Sullivan, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093854812436786">Heilbrun and colleagues (1998)</xref> evaluated inpatient violence in a sample of 218 offenders with mental disorders. PCL scores were found to relate to physical assaults during a 2-month time frame and predicted violent recidivism after hospital discharge. In a study of 149 forensic inpatients followed for 6 months, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093854812436786">Hill, Neumann, and Rogers (2004)</xref> found that the PCL:SV accounted for 31% of the variance associated with institutional aggression. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0093854812436786">Stafford and Cornell (2003)</xref> reported that psychopathic traits predicted instrumental and reactive inpatient aggression in 72 adolescents.</p>
<p>Recently, studies have questioned the ability of psychopathy measures to predict inpatient violence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812436786">McDermott et al. (2008)</xref> stated, âWhile early indicators suggested a significant relationship between psychopathy and institutional aggression, recent research suggests that relationship is weakâ (p. 333). This view is consistent with a meta-analysis authored by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854812436786">Guy, Edens, Anthony, and Douglas (2005)</xref>, which evaluated effect sizes for PCL-assessed psychopathy and inpatient aggression in 38 studies. Their findings indicated that psychopathy was only weakly related to inpatient violence. However, a more recent meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093854812436786">Leistico et al. (2008)</xref>, which evaluated the relation between the PCL-R and violent outcomes, including institutional aggression, discovered moderate effect sizes (Cohenâs <italic>d</italic>) for Factor 1 (<italic>d</italic> = .53), Factor 2 (<italic>d</italic> = .41), and total score (<italic>d</italic> = .51). Certainly, the relation between psychopathy and institutional violence is not straightforward. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093854812436786">Vitacco et al. (2009)</xref> found that psychopathy, as measured by the PCL:SV, was not related to overall inpatient aggression or reactive aggression in forensic inpatients; however, traditional Factor 1 scores (i.e., interpersonal and affective traits) predicted instrumental aggression, whereas impulsivity, anger, and active symptoms of psychosis predicted reactive aggression. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812436786">McDermott et al. (2008)</xref> also found that psychopathy measured by the PCL-R was significantly related to inpatient instrumental aggression but not to the degree expected. Continued research is needed to disentangle the relationship between psychopathic traits and types of inpatient aggression.</p>

<title>HCR-20 and Inpatient Aggression</title>
<p>Clinicians and researchers have increasingly focused on dynamic or changeable factors as valid predictors of inpatient aggression. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093854812436786">Douglas and Skeem (2005)</xref> highlighted the importance of focusing on dynamic variables for improving violence prediction and treatment. To that end, inpatient violence is no different in that there appears to be tremendous value in using dynamic factors in determining risk for violence. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812436786">McDermott et al. (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093854812436786">Vitacco et al. (2009)</xref> studies, which indicated that dynamic variables, such as psychotic symptoms, impulsivity, and anger, predicted inpatient aggression, underscore the link between dynamic factors and inpatient aggression. Indeed, results across multiple studies evaluating dynamic factors have been promising. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0093854812436786">Muthukumaraswamy, Beer, and Ratnajothy (2008)</xref> studied 78 forensic inpatients across a period of 6 years and found the presence of auditory hallucinations and delusions strongly related to inpatient violence. In explaining their nonsignificant findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093854812436786">Daffern et al. (2005)</xref> reported that the Level of Service InventoryâRevised: Screening Version did not predict inpatient violence because it failed to include clinical factors predictive of inpatient violence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093854812436786">Lussier et al. (2010)</xref> studied 527 inpatients and found that dynamic clinical and risk factors were superior to historical (static) factors in predicting inpatient aggression (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093854812436786">BjÃ¸rkly, Hartvig, Heggen, Brauer, &amp; Morger, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the primary instruments for measuring dynamic risk factors is the HCR-20. The Clinical and Risk scales are saturated with dynamic variables, and these have proved useful in predicting inpatient aggression. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093854812436786">Macpherson and Kevan (2004)</xref> evaluated the ability of the HCR-20 in predicting aggression in 86 Scottish inpatients. Results indicated that only the Clinical, or C, scale predicted inpatient violence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093854812436786">Grevatt, Thomas-Peter, and Hughes (2004)</xref> reported only the C scale from the HCR-20 predicted inpatient violence in a sample of 44 patients. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093854812436786">Daffern et al. (2007)</xref> reported that the HCR-20 was significantly better than chance at predicting both immediate aggression and self-harm in a secure mental health facility. Likewise, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812436786">McDermott et al. (2008)</xref> study found the C scale of the HCR-20 to be a strong predictor of reactive, but not instrumental, aggression. These studies underscore the improved predictive power by using dynamic variables, such as those scored on the HCR-20, in the evaluation of violence risk within secure settings.</p>

<title>The Present Study</title>
<p>Research focusing on inpatient aggression has provided important insights into the phenomenon. First, inpatient violence is not a homogenous construct and instead can be identified by both appearance and purpose. The present study further unpacks inpatient aggression by classifying it into instrumental and reactive forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093854812436786">Fontaine, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093854812436786">Vitacco et al., 2009</xref>). Likewise, this study relies on both measures of static (PCL:SV and VRAG) and dynamic (active symptoms of mental illness, Clinical and Risk items from the HCR-20) factors as predictors of inpatient aggression. The principal goal of this research is to expand on earlier studies by determining whether differential relations exist between dynamic and static predictors and subtype of violence. In scoring our criterion and outcome measures, we relied on lengthy clinical interviews with the inpatients in conjunction with extensive file reviews that included official documentation and legal records. As such, we took great care to ensure accurate ratings of all measures and outcomes.</p>
<p>This study possesses high ecological validity in that the research sample consisted of inpatients found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect (NGRI) and used procedures commonly used in forensic settings to evaluate violence risk. Each individual in the present study was referred for a risk assessment by his respective treatment teams to determine whether he should receive an improved security-level assignment, including access to additional privileges within the hospital. Increased privileges typically included access to off-unit activities in the community, and the typical individual in the sample was considered relatively stable and working toward conditional release (i.e., release back to a community with conditions he must follow to maintain community placement).</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Data were collected from 103 male inpatients from a state forensic hospital. Participants were admitted to the hospital after being adjudicated NGRI and resided on maximum-, medium-, and minimum-security units within the hospital. Inpatients ranged in age from 22 to 75 (<italic>M</italic> = 41.01, <italic>SD</italic> = 12.37) years old. The sample was primarily Caucasian (62.1%) and African American (27.2%), with 10.6% comprising other ethnicities (i.e., Hispanic, Asian, or biracial). The average length of stay was 5.61 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.98). Most of the sample (68.0%) had committed a crime that was violent in nature, and some inpatients had committed sex offense. Approximately 50% of the sample had a major diagnosis of schizophrenia or related disorder; however, mood disorders, personality disorders, and cognitive deficits also were strongly represented. Diagnoses were collected through a formal review of the chart. Diagnoses were made by either a licensed psychologist or a board-certified psychiatrist. At the time of data collection, 36 participants had been released into the community for at least a short period of time either on conditional release or by achieving maximum release date. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0093854812436786">Table 1</xref> presents demographic information for the entire sample.</p>

<title>VRAG</title>
<p>The VRAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093854812436786">Quinsey et al., 1998</xref>) was developed using male offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093854812436786">Harris, Rice, &amp; Quinsey, 1993</xref>) and has been normed to predict violent recidivism among forensic inpatients, nonforensic psychiatric inpatients, sex offenders, and released prisoners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093854812436786">Glover, Nicholson, Hemmati, Bernfeld, &amp; Quinsey, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093854812436786">Harris et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093854812436786">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093854812436786">Harris, Rice, &amp; Cormier, 2002</xref>). Interrater reliability has been consistently above acceptable levels in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093854812436786">Quinsey et al., 1998</xref>), and the alpha coefficient for the VRAG in the present sample was a modest .67.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0093854812436786">
<title>HCR-20</title>
<p>The HCR-20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0093854812436786">Webster et al., 1997</xref>) is a structured checklist designed to assist in the assessment of risk for future violence. It contains 20 items, of which 10 items assess past behavior (Historical, or H), 5 items assess current behaviors (Clinical, or C), and 5 items examine future behaviors (Risk, or R). The H items measure static factors, whereas the C and R items measure dynamic factors. The items are coded by a trained clinician on a 3-point scale: 0 indicates that the item does not apply, 1 indicates that the item may apply or partially applies, and 2 indicates that the item definitely applies. Although a total score can be calculated (a maximum score of 40 is possible), the clinician ultimately uses the items as a guide to arrive at a final determination of risk as low, moderate, or high. The alpha coefficient for the total scale in the present sample indicated acceptable reliability (Î± = .76).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0093854812436786">
<title>PCL:SV</title>
<p>The PCL:SV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854812436786">Hart et al., 1995</xref>) was designed as a rater-based assessment to screen for the possible presence of psychopathy. It is a 12-item instrument based on a subset of items from the PCL-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093854812436786">Hare, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093854812436786">2003</xref>). Trained clinicians scored the items as either 0 (item does not apply), 1 (item applies to a certain extent), or 2 (item applies) on the basis of a lifetime prevalence of the characteristics or behaviors represented by each item. For this study, the traditional two-factor model was evaluated. Factor 1 consists of Interpersonal (e.g., glib and superficial) and Affective (e.g., callous and unremorseful) items. Factor 2 consists of Lifestyle (impulsive and irresponsible behavior), and Antisocial tendencies (e.g., child and adult antisocial behavioral) items. The PCL:SV has a high correlation (<italic>r</italic> = .80) with the PCL-R and has demonstrated good reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854812436786">Hart et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093854812436786">Rogers, 2001</xref>). Inpatients were scored on the PCL:SV on the basis of a semistructured interview and comprehensive file review that consisted of both institution and community behaviors. In the current study, the alpha coefficient for the total score of the PCL:SV indicated good reliability (Î± = .80). Given that psychopathy was assessed using the PCL:SV and because both the VRAG and HCR-20 include some items that also assess psychopathy, patient scores for both the VRAG and HCR-20 were computed without including their idiosyncratic psychopathy items.</p>

<sec id="section12-0093854812436786">
<title>Inpatient violence</title>
<p>The outcome variable for this study was inpatient violence. Data were collected by trained research assistants who coded violence after an extensive review of each individualâs inpatient records at the hospital. Hospital policy mandates that each violent episode is charted in the individualâs official medical record, which is considered a legal document. This methodology is consistent with most studies of inpatient violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093854812436786">Grevatt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093854812436786">Hill et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812436786">McDermott et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093854812436786">Vitacco et al., 2009</xref>). Given the confines of the forensic hospital, it is likely that few violent incidents were missed; however, we do recognize that the potential exists for missed violent acts. Each patient was coded whether they aggressed or not. Aggressive contact includes but is not limited to a slap, punch, kick, hair pull, or spitting. This operational definition assured that only readily identifiable violent activities were included in the current study.</p>
<p>To avoid criterion contamination, we used two safeguards. First, the individuals who coded the inpatients for violence were not involved in the formal risk assessments. Second, data coding for violence was conducted for the 6 months following the clinical evaluations. As such, this is a true prospective study. In addition, each violent act was coded to determine whether it was primarily instrumental or reactive using the coding structure developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854812436786">Cornell et al. (1996)</xref>. Violence was defined as clear documentation of physical contact made between a forensic inpatient and either a staff, other patient, or any other individual within the institution.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0093854812436786">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>As part of hospital protocol, risk assessments were completed to achieve consideration for movement to a less secure environment and/or access to off-unit activities. These assessments included a review of the records, interview with the patient spanning two to three sessions, and scoring of the risk assessment measures. Risk assessment data and demographic data were collected on the basis of raw scores and the reports generated as part of the assessment procedure. All risk assessments were conducted by a licensed clinical psychologist with a minimum of 5 years of experience working in forensic settings and conducting risk assessments or by a graduate student who underwent training in scoring of the risk assessment instruments and was supervised by a licensed clinical psychologist with a minimum of 5 years working in forensic settings and conducting risk assessments. Data regarding patient violence and rule violations were tracked through the use of a hospital database. This database is maintained as part of standard institutionwide procedure. Approval was received from the institutional review board prior to initiating formal data collection and analyses. The inpatients were followed for a time period of between 6 and 12 months after completion of the risk assessment.</p>

<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>Based on extant research, we expected to find the following in the current study of inpatient aggression:</p>
<list id="list1-0093854812436786" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>The VRAG would be a significant predictor of inpatient aggression, including both reactive and instrumental aggression.</p>

<p>The PCL:SV would be a significant predictor of inpatient aggression, including both reactive and instrumental aggression.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The HCR-20 would be a significant predictor of inpatient violence. The C scale would be especially relevant in predicting reactive aggression.</p>

<title>Preliminary Analyses</title>
<p>Of the 103 inpatients who underwent the risk assessment process, 22 inpatients engaged in one or more violent acts. Between them, these 22 inpatients committed a total of 49 violent acts. The number of acts ranged from 1 to 5, but the vast majority of those who committed violence committed only 1 violent act. As expected, the majority of the individuals engaged in âreactive-onlyâ violence (<italic>n</italic> = 13), although there were several inpatients who did engage in some instrumental violence (<italic>n</italic> = 9). The inpatients primarily aggressed against other inpatients (<italic>n</italic> = 11), but 3 individuals aggressed against staff, and 6 individuals committed violence toward both staff and peers. Two individuals in this study had atypical acts of inpatient violence, including one against a visitor. Age was not related to any of the factors or total scores of the PCL:SV (all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .05); however, age, as expected on the basis of VRAG scoring guidelines, was negatively associated with VRAG score (<italic>r</italic> = â.30, <italic>p</italic> = .002). Age was not associated with the HCR-20 H scale; however, both the C (<italic>r</italic> = â.26, <italic>p</italic> = .01) and R (<italic>r</italic> = â.30, <italic>p</italic> = .003) scores demonstrated a negative relation with age. There were no differences on the basis of age, <italic>t</italic>(101) = 1.57, <italic>p</italic> = .12, or ethnicity, Ï<sup>2</sup> = .37, <italic>p</italic> = .54, for committing inpatient violence.</p>
<p>Prior to presenting analyses on differences between inpatients on the basis of violent behavior and logistic regression models for predicting violence, we present the correlations between the various static and dynamic risk measures. Several of the risk measures evidenced significant correlations between one another. For example, VRAG score (excluding psychopathy items<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0093854812436786">1</xref></sup>) was correlated with all factors and total score on the PCL:SV (<italic>r</italic>s ranging from .29 to .35, <italic>p</italic>s from .003 to &lt;.001) and was correlated with the H score (excluding psychopathy items) of the HCR-20 (<italic>r</italic> = .25, <italic>p</italic> = .01). PCL:SV factor and total scores also evidenced significant correlations with the C and R scores of the HCR-20 (<italic>r</italic>s .26 to .69, <italic>p</italic>s from .01 to &lt;.001). The complete results for the correlations between scores on the risk assessment measures are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0093854812436786">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Differences Between Violent and Nonviolent Inpatients on Risk Measures</title>
<p>Using risk assessment measure as the criterion variables, we evaluated differences on risk measure scores as a function of violent behavior through the use of multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). As expected, the overall omnibus model was significant, <italic>F</italic>(8, 92) = 2.53, <italic>p</italic> = .01. As presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0093854812436786">Table 3</xref>, follow-up univariate ANOVAs revealed that the risk measures generally performed well at differentiating violent from nonviolent inpatients. For instance, Factor 1 of the PCL:SV, which consists of interpersonal and affective traits, and Factor 2 of the PCL:SV, which consists of lifestyle and antisocial tendencies, were both higher in inpatients who committed a violent act (both <italic>ps</italic> &lt; .002). The VRAG, which relies entirely on items that assess static factors, was higher in inpatients who engaged in violence (<italic>p</italic> = .003). The results for the HCR-20 were mixed. The H and C scores were higher in inpatients who committed inpatient violence (both <italic>ps</italic> &lt; .02); however, R scores did not differentiate violent and nonviolent inpatients (<italic>p</italic> = .28). The HCR-20 total score was also higher in inpatients who engaged in violent behavior (<italic>p</italic> = .007). We also computed effect sizes in the form of Cohenâs <italic>d</italic> for all differences on the risk measure scores between the violent and nonviolent inpatients. We interpreted effect sizes consistent with the recommendation set forth in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093854812436786">Cohen (1977)</xref>, and all effect sizes ranged from moderate to large, except for the R scale on the HCR-20.</p>

<p>The numbers for committing violent acts were relatively small, as were the number of instrumental and reactive offenses. Despite this small sample size, we ran a separate MANOVA to determine whether there were differences in risk scores between inpatients who committed only reactive violence verses those who committed both reactive and instrumental violence. The omnibus MANOVA model was not statistically significant, <italic>F</italic>(6, 15) = .45, <italic>p</italic> = .84, and as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0093854812436786">Table 4</xref>, none of the follow-up univariate ANOVAs were significant either. It is possible the lack of significance for some of the risk measures as a function of type of violence was the result of insufficient power, given the small sample sizes of both violence groups. Indeed, examination of Cohenâs <italic>d</italic> effect sizes indicated that (a) inpatients who engaged in both instrumental and reactive forms of violence trended toward higher scores on the risk measures than did those who engaged in only reactive forms of violence, and (b) these effect sizes were generally moderate in magnitude.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Risk assessment procedures used in forensic hospitals are gaining traction, as they are increasingly relied on by decision makers to inform placement decisions, including release of forensic inpatients into community settings. This article evaluated three measures and their ability to predict inpatient violence in a sample of mentally ill forensic inpatients adjudicated NGRI. The results of this study revealed that predictive accuracy predictive accuracy of inpatient violence is increased when static and dynamic factors are used in combination. Specifically, the VRAG, PCL:SV, and the H and C scales from the HCR-20 predicted reactive inpatient aggression. Instrumental inpatient aggression was more difficult to detect, given its very low base rate.</p>
<p>The results of the current study suggest a number of implications for assessment and treatment of violence risk, consideration of which may aid in the development of empirically informed treatment protocols aimed at minimizing violent behavior in forensic inpatient units. Before we discuss the primary implications of this study, it is necessary to note that evaluating violence with forensic inpatients presents unique challenges. In this study, approximately 21% of the inpatients engaged in one or more acts of inpatient violence. From a research perspective, this figure represents a low base rate, which makes the prediction of violence more difficult. Despite this challenge, the results of the present study support the premise that standardized assessment of violence risk using measures of both static and dynamic risk factors holds substantial promise for identifying inpatients at risk for violence.</p>
<sec id="section23-0093854812436786">
<title>Risk Assessment Results and Inpatient Violence</title>
<p>The present results demonstrate that evaluators can improve prediction of violent behavior in inpatient units by using structured, standardized assessment techniques that include measures of both static and dynamic risk factors. In this study, both types of risk measures were effective at predicting inpatient violence. There were significant differences between the violent and nonviolent inpatients on a host of risk measures (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0093854812436786">Table 3</xref>), and the results of the logistic regression analyses supported the use of either type of risk measure when making predictions of inpatient violence. Furthermore, although neither cluster of risk measure provided statistically significant incremental prediction above and beyond the other cluster, prediction as a percentage of variance was improved. Given these findings, three important implications are noteworthy for discussion with regard to violence risk assessment and treatment of inpatient violence.</p>
<p>First, in the present research, the C scale differentiated violent from nonviolent inpatients, suggesting that this dynamic measure provides valuable insight into an individualâs risk for violent behavior within an institution. This finding is consistent with other research that has found the C scale to be predictive of dysfunction and violence within hospital settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093854812436786">Belfrage, Fransson, &amp; Strand, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093854812436786">Gray, Taylor, &amp; Snowden, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093854812436786">McKenzie &amp; Curr, 2005</xref>). The finding also holds promise because dynamic factors are, by their nature, treatable. As such, when mental health practitioners identify a dynamic factor that tends to produce aggression, then they become able to target specific symptoms linked to the production of violent behavior. It seems, then, that one straightforward way to assist in such a treatment goal is by using a tool such as the HCR-20, which has clear clinical utility for predicting inpatient violence in forensic samples.</p>
<p>Second, measures that focus on static factors performed well. There are two potential explanations for this finding. First, the current sample was relatively stable, was generally medication compliant, and evidenced some level of behavioral stability within the institution; the average length of stay for the forensic inpatients was relatively long (<italic>M</italic> = 5.61 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.98). In these respects, this inpatient sample had many characteristics of community-based individuals, for whom static measures have been noted to be the strongest predictors of violence. Second, the sample was diagnostically diverse, and it appears the standardized risk measures have differing levels of predictive power as a function of clinical diagnosis. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093854812436786">Gray et al. (2011)</xref> indicated that the HCR-20 strongly predicted violence and recidivism in a sample of discharged individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia but weakly predicted the same outcomes in individuals having personality disorders. In a study evaluating risk in some inpatients with personality disorders and others with schizophrenia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093854812436786">Grann, Belfrage, and TengstrÃ¶m (2000)</xref> reported that historical (static) measures more strongly predicted violence in individuals with personality disorders, whereas dynamic measures more strongly predicted violence in individuals with schizophrenia. The fact that the current sample consisted of inpatients with primary diagnoses of both psychotic or personality disorders likely contributed to the improved prediction by the static measures and also contributed to the improved prediction when using a combination of static and dynamic variables.</p>
<p>Finally, the finding that the PCL:SV, a rater-based instrument of psychopathy, contributed to prediction of inpatient violence is a noteworthy finding, especially given the amount of contention that has revolved around using psychopathy measures to predict inpatient violence. The current results are consistent with earlier studies that found that PCL measures predicted inpatient violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093854812436786">Hare &amp; McPherson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0093854812436786">Hill et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093854812436786">McNiel et al., 2003</xref>). Although some recent studies have called into question the utility of the construct of psychopathy in predicting inpatient violence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854812436786">Guy et al., 2005</xref>, for their meta-analytic results), others have not. For instance, using meta-analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093854812436786">Leistico et al. (2008)</xref> found that psychopathy, especially traditional Factor 2, was related to inpatient violence. One intriguing possibility is that when major mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, are treated, psychopathic traits, when present, are then expressed, leading to a greater likelihood of instrumental violence. Consistent with this possibility, individuals in this study who engaged in both instrumental and reactive violence (rather than just reactive violence) within the institution trended toward having higher psychopathy scores.</p>
<p>With regard to psychopathy, our data generally support the idea that psychopathy is a risk factor for reactive and instrumental aggression within an inpatient setting. Consequently, recent research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812436786">McDermott et al. (2008)</xref> might have been too quick to dismiss the potential predictive power of psychopathy within inpatient settings. It appears that in certain settings, psychopathy is predictive of both reactive and instrumental inpatient violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093854812436786">Vitacco et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0093854812436786">
<title>Limitations and Future Directions for Research</title>
<p>The present findings must be considered in light of several limitations. First, the sample consisted of individuals with relatively low levels of violence, much of which was noninstrumental. Restriction in the range of violence may have undermined statistical power to detect meaningful effects. Yet, given the low rates of violence, the findings in the present study are impressive. Nonetheless, larger-scale studies of inpatient violence that include samples from multiple institutions are needed to disentangle the unanswered questions regarding inpatient risk assessment that arise in the present research. For example, do the risk assessment measures perform differentially as a function of diagnosis (psychosis vs. personality disorder), legal situation (forensic vs. civil), or time (new admission vs. long-term patient)? Larger-scale studies that focus on these differences would advance the field of forensic assessment with regard to evaluating the propensity for inpatient violence.</p>
<p>Second, the current study did not use diagnostic interviews to evaluate the full spectrum of <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> diagnoses and related symptoms. Full diagnostic interviews would have assisted in teasing apart differences based on symptoms and diagnoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093854812436786">Gray et al., 2011</xref>). The current study did use chart diagnoses; however, greater refinement of symptom constellations would be achieved by using comprehensive diagnostic interviews that determine the presence of both Axis I and Axis II symptoms. One recommendation that is that clinicians should consider diagnosis, placement, and individual-specific risk factors when attempting to make predictions of violence risk.</p>
<p>The finding that inpatients who engaged in both instrumental violence and reactive violence tended to have higher (but not significant) risk measure scores than did inpatients who engaged in only reactive violence warrants additional study. Unfortunately, there may have been insufficient numbers in this study to confidently determine potentially meaningful differences between these two groups of inpatients. Subsequent research with a larger number of violent inpatients also may find that making a distinction between instrumental and reactive forms of violence proves valuable. A further emphasis should focus on whether engaging in instrumental violence within an inpatient setting is evidence of longer-term dysfunction and lifelong patterns of aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093854812436786">Cooke, Michie, DeBrito, Hodgins, &amp; Sparkes, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This study employed three of the most commonly used risk assessment measures to predict inpatient violence. However, the use of measures validated on groups and applied to individuals has faced criticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093854812436786">Hart, Michie, &amp; Cooke, 2007</xref>) in that the error rate dramatically increases when group estimates are applied to the individual. One potential improvement on risk assessment methodology would be to apply structured measures to the interview but then carefully review specific, individual factors that were antecedents to violence in the individual being evaluated. Carefully evaluating individual factors is a process referred to as <italic>anamnestic risk assessment</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093854812436786">Otto, 2000</xref>). Reviewing individual factors in violence risk assessment has two primary advantages. First, it allows the evaluator to judiciously evaluate specific issues that could lead to violence in each individual. Second, it allows treatment plans to be developed that can target and eliminate violent behavior. One possibility is to begin with structured measures and then follow up with a focus on specific factors that relate to violence in the individual that might not be captured by the structured risk instruments. However, introducing numerous assessment instruments may muddy the waters of risk assessment. If it is possible to make accurate predictions of inpatient risk using the instruments that are currently available, that have been validated, and that assessors are already familiar with, the risk assessment processes may be streamlined.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The results of this study revealed that predictive accuracy is increased when measures of either static or dynamic factors are assessed and that combining static and dynamic measures further enhance the prediction of inpatient violence. Psychopathy, despite being recently dismissed as a predictor of violence within inpatient settings, did contribute to the prediction of violence in this study. One consideration that forensic evaluators must consider is the type of individual they are evaluating and the type of setting. Forensic evaluators assigned with the difficult task of predicting violence within a forensic institution can use these results to assist in structuring their risk assessment evaluations and then use the obtained results to develop improved risk management plans aimed at reducing aggressive behavior within institutional settings.</p>
