<p>Jing Li sets himself the ambitious goal of investigating Chinese perceptions of the United States throughout the 20th century. He not only aims to do justice to the different perceptions of different groups in Chinese society, but also seeks to address various factors that shape these perceptions. He identifies four major factors: the interplay between China–US relations and China’s domestic affairs; the interaction between Chinese cultural predispositions and Chinese politics; the domestic debate on interpretations of the United States; and the interplay between historical developments and the three elements just mentioned. This approach results in lengthy descriptions throughout the book of the political developments in China in the last century. Li addresses the views of three groups in Chinese society: intellectuals, state officials, and the general populace. Because of different interests and cultural inclinations, and unequal access to information, these three groups have different, sometimes opposite, takes on American politics and culture. And even within these social groups views vary widely, making the author’s task all the more complex.</p>
<p>The book is organized chronologically. Li takes us through the century in eight chapters. Chinese views of the United States in the period 1900–49 are summarized in Chapter 1. Subsequent chapters zoom in on shorter periods of time with the year 1957 and the period 1979–89 being dealt with most extensively. The trends in perceptions Li unravels for each period are illustrated by descriptions and quotes by famous figures in Chinese history – for example, Liang Qichao, Sun Yat-sen, and Qian Xuesen – and lesser-known intellectuals and officials.</p>
<p>In the first half of the last century, the debate on the United States was open and diverse, focusing on lessons that the United States could offer to China. This changed drastically after the establishment of the People’s Republic and anti-American instruction was made a part of the Chinese Communist Party’s reorganization programme for the country. With the exception of a short-lived but candid debate during the Hundred Flowers Campaign in 1957, positive assessments of anything American remained taboo for nearly two decades. In particular throughout the 1960s, perceptions were dominated by the officially propagated image of the United States as evil and decadent. In the early 1970s, however, when relations with the United States were re-established, officials had to adjust that image – thus creating more room for diverse views.</p>
<p>The period 1979–89 is dealt with in three chapters, each focusing on the views of a particular group. As China opens up to the outside world and begins its transition to a market economy, intellectuals resume their exploration of American culture. While the Chinese population is more exposed to American culture and their general view of the United States has become less one-dimensional, officials do their best to limit American influence on politics and the Chinese way of life. In the last decade of the 20th century, growing nationalist sentiments in China have caused the debate to intensify. Strongly pro- and anti-American views are expressed among both intellectual and popular circles.</p>
<p>This book’s strengths lie in its rich and detailed descriptions of debates on the United States among specific (groups of) Chinese individuals. Perceptions of the intelligentsia in the period 1979–89, for example, are addressed by exploring the contents of the literary journal <italic>Reading</italic> (读书). This makes for interesting reading. However, it also raises the question of the extent to which these writings are representative of the intellectual discourse on the United States during that decade. The same can be said for other chapters. Li’s accounts sometimes seem anecdotal rather than a full picture of the views of a specific group in a certain period of time.</p>
<p>Li’s comprehensive approach and coverage of a considerable period of time also has advantages. For example, it brings out remarkable resemblances between the pre-1949 debates about what China could possibly learn from the United States and more recent debates. It also shows that, no matter how perceptions change over time, the United States has always served as an important reference point for China, either to oppose or to learn from. Much more can be gathered from Li’s extensive research but regrettably the book offers little analysis. A concluding interpretation of findings could have added new insights into the constants and variables of 100 years of Chinese perceptions of the United States.</p>
<p>In spite of these shortcomings, this book provides an interesting read for students. It is well written and offers fascinating background material for a better understanding of the all-important Sino-American relationship.</p>
