<abstract>
<p>Measuring the impact of online health campaigns is challenging. Traditionally, advertisement click-through rates (CTRs) have been used to measure message reach, but CTRs are low with most clicks coming from a small fraction of users. However, low CTRs do not necessarily indicate that an ad was not effective. There may be latency effects whereby people do not click on ads at time of exposure but visit the promoted website or conduct searches later. Online panels that unobtrusively collect panelists’ web behavior may provide a more reliable data source for measuring online campaign effects. We used web behavior data from a proprietary online panel to identify panelists who were either exposed or unexposed to the Tobacco Free Florida Cessation Internet ad campaign. We assessed whether ad exposure influenced website visits and searches on campaign-related topics up to 4 weeks after initial exposure. Those who were exposed to the campaign were significantly more likely than those who were not exposed to have visited the campaign website (0.65% vs. 0.13%, respectively, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), but ad exposure did not influence searches on campaign-related topics. These results suggest that panel web behavior data may be useful for understanding behavioral response to and latency effects of online campaigns.</p>

<title>Background and Literature</title>
<p>Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524500412466072">Mokdad, Marks, Stroup, &amp; Gerberding, 2004</xref>). A large body of evidence demonstrates that televised mass media campaigns to encourage smoking cessation can contribute to reductions in adult smoking prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524500412466072">National Cancer Institute [NCI], 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524500412466072">Wakefield, Loken, &amp; Hornik, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524500412466072">Wakefield, Spittal, Yong, Durkin, &amp; Borland, 2011</xref>). As part of Florida’s statewide comprehensive tobacco education and prevention program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524500412466072">Florida Department of Health, Bureau of Tobacco Prevention Program</xref>), the Florida Department of Health worked with media agencies to develop a multichannel media campaign in 2011, “Tobacco Free Florida (TFF).” The TFF campaign provides Floridians with tobacco cessation services through a 24-hr quitline (1-877-U-CAN-NOW) and online WebCoach (TobaccoFreeFlorida.com) and disseminates tobacco facts, prevention and cessation messages, and information about state and local tobacco laws. These resources are provided on the TFF website (TobaccoFreeFlorida.com), Facebook page (facebook.com/TobaccoFreeFlorida), Twitter profile (@tobaccofreefla), and YouTube Channel (youtube.com/tobaccofreeflorida). To inform Florida residents about these resources, paid advertisements were aired on television, radio, and online. Evaluation studies were designed to assess the reach and impact of TFF paid advertisements.</p>
<p>The primary goal of this study is to examine the impact of TFF’s online advertisements in driving audience awareness of campaign messages and influencing them to seek out additional cessation resources. Historically, exposure to paid media campaign ads aired on television and radio has been measured with a standard metric of gross rating points (GRPs). GRPs are based on the percentage of the population potentially exposed to advertisements (reach) and the average number of times the advertisements may have been seen (frequency) over a time period. To understand how campaign ad exposure influences awareness of campaign messages and information-sharing and information-seeking behaviors, researchers have linked GRPs as an exogenous observational measure of television ad exposure to survey responses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524500412466072">Davis, Nonnemaker, &amp; Farrelly, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524500412466072">Farrelly, Davis, Haviland, Messeri, &amp; Healton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524500412466072">Farrelly, Nonnemaker, Davis, &amp; Hussin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524500412466072">Wakefield et al., 2011</xref>). While these methods have been employed effectively to evaluate the impact of traditional media, the lack of corresponding methods to assess exposure and outcome-related variables in an online environment poses significant barriers.</p>
<p>Measuring the reach and impact of online campaign advertisements is challenging. To date, companies have relied on measures of ad impressions and ad click-through rates (CTRs) to assess campaign reach. However, relying on CTRs can potentially inflate reach estimates because only about one third of Internet users click on display ads and 80% of all clicks come from only 16% of Internet users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524500412466072">Fulgoni &amp; Mörn, 2008</xref>). Conversely, low CTRs do not necessarily indicate that an ad did not have an impact as audiences may have seen the online ad but did not click through at the time of exposure. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524500412466072">Briggs and Hollis (1997</xref>) on banner ad exposure showed increases in brand awareness, consumer loyalty, and purchase intention with one exposure. Similarly, in a study of 139 online ad campaigns, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524500412466072">Fulgoni and Mörn (2008</xref>) uncovered latency and branding effects in campaigns where low CTRs were observed, suggesting that a subset of the target audience does not click through an ad but recalls the ad information at a later date. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524500412466072">Yoo (2009</xref>) showed that even incidental ad exposure had a positive effect on brand awareness and brand building. More recently, researchers have tracked cookies to estimate campaign ad exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524500412466072">Graham, Bock, Cobb, Raymond, &amp; Abrams, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524500412466072">Graham, Milner, Saul, &amp; Pfaff, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524500412466072">Gordon, Akers, Severson, Danaher, &amp; Boles, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524500412466072">McDonnell, Lee, Kazenets, &amp; Moskowitz, 2011</xref>). However, this approach is problematic because Internet users commonly delete their cookies (58%) and some users opt to disable cookies altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524500412466072">comScore, 2007</xref>). Surveys have traditionally been used to measure ad exposure to media campaigns and link exposure to intended behavioral effects. However, self-reported data on ad exposure are subject to recall bias. This bias is especially concerning for recall measures of online ads, given the extensive diversity of websites users may visit on any given day, the multiple types of ads (e.g., banner, pop-up, rotating, hover, sidebar), and the manner in which users may access the Internet (via computer vs. mobile devices) that may influence the number and type of ads delivered and viewed.</p>
<p>Finding more accurate ways to capture the web behaviors of the targeted audience of a paid media campaign is a critical step to better understanding the reach and impact of online ad campaigns to promote healthy behaviors. In the absence of an exogenous measure of exposure such as GRPs, we propose that panel data may be the most promising source of information to better understand who is exposed to online ads and whether people may seek out additional resources as a result of this exposure. Several companies using similar methodologies provide access to web panel data (e.g., comScore, Nielsen). These companies unobtrusively collect data about their panelists’ online behavior, capturing data on whether an ad was delivered on a site they visited, whether they clicked on the ad, and the websites visited and searches conducted using search engines such as Google. These data enable researchers to examine whether online ad exposure is associated with information-seeking behavior such as visiting the campaign website tagged in the ad and conducting searches on campaign-related topics over time. In the current study, we examined whether exposure to TFF online campaign ads influenced (1) visits to campaign websites and (2) searches for cessation information among Florida adults in an online panel of U.S. Internet users.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The TFF cessation campaign targeted adults aged 18 to 54 with tobacco cessation and secondhand smoke messages. Online advertising was used to support television advertising and reflected similar creative. For tracking purposes, all advertisements associated with the TFF online cessation ad campaign (“Reverse Lung Cancer,” “Reverse Heart Attack,” “Sponge,” and “Artery”) were tagged with unique html/javascript codes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1524500412466072">Figure 1</xref> shows the “Reverse Lung Cancer” digital ad.</p>

</fig>
<p>Cessation ads were placed on 10 websites and two online ad networks (e.g., Accuen, an ad network of more than 20,000 websites). When the ads were clicked, the destination website was floridaquitline.com. Data were collected during the campaign period from December 22, 2010, to April 17, 2011, and continued to be collected until mid of May 2011 to capture any exposure occurring throughout the 4-week period after initial exposure.</p>

<title>Panel Data</title>
<p>comScore (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.comScore.com">www.comScore.com</ext-link>) is a market research company that specializes in measuring online audience behaviors. Approximately 1 million U.S. Internet users are in their panel. The comScore panel is a convenience sample as panelists are largely recruited via nonprobability-based sampling methodologies (e.g., online ads, partner websites). However, a subsample is recruited via random digit dialing to calibrate the post stratification weights that comScore uses to project their estimates to the U.S. Internet population. Panelists provide demographic information and agree to download software that enables comScore to track their online browsing and purchasing behavior. These data are then aggregated to provide national estimates on consumer web visits and online purchasing behaviors. For this study, comScore analyzed web behavior data for all Florida adult residents in their panel to identify groups that were exposed (<italic>N</italic> = 5,200) and unexposed (<italic>N</italic> = 5,200) to the TFF campaign online ads.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section5-1524500412466072">
<title>Exposure to TFF Online Ad</title>
<p>A panelist was defined as being exposed to the online campaign if the comScore tags placed on the four Florida ads appeared in the panelist’s web visitation data. An unexposed group of equal size was selected with similar demographics and Internet usage and behaviors as the exposed group. A panelist was defined as being unexposed to the campaign if none of the tags for the four ads appeared in their web behavior data. This method of panelist selection has been used previously to balance test and control groups in order to isolate the effects of campaign ad exposure (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524500412466072">Fulgoni &amp; Mörn, 2008</xref>). Once the exposed and unexposed groups were identified, panelists’ web behavior data were observed from 1 to 4 weeks after a potential first exposure to determine whether they visited the campaign website or any related sites and whether they conducted searches on campaign-related topics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1524500412466072">
<title>Visit to Campaign Website</title>
<p>We examined whether panelists in the exposed and unexposed groups visited any of the nine websites listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524500412466072">Table 1</xref>, which include campaign-related sites and key national cessation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524500412466072">Bock, Graham, Whiteley, &amp; Stoddard, 2008</xref>). If audience members clicked on the TFF ad, they were directed to the floridaquitline.com website. We also examined visits to other TFF campaign-related websites, such as the cessation intervention site and campaign Facebook and Twitter pages. The national cessation websites were included because websites with similar content may see increased visits through content-related searches by the exposed group when a campaign has low brand awareness. A visit was captured if the panelist clicked on the online ad or visited the site using any other method (e.g., search, typed URL into browser, used a bookmark) at any time during the observation period. Increases in proportion of visits to the nine sites were reported 1 week, 1 to 2 weeks, 1 to 3 weeks, and 1 to 4 weeks after first exposure.</p>

<title>Information-Seeking Behavior</title>
<p>To determine whether exposure to TFF online ads influenced audiences to seek out additional information about the campaign, panelists’ search behavior data were mined for the occurrence of campaign-related search queries (e.g., quit smoking). A list of 100 potential search terms (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1524500412466072">Appendix A</xref>) was used based on previous analysis of top external keywords from Google Analytics for the floridaquitline.com and TobaccoFreeFlorida.com as well as top keywords identified by the Google Adwords Keyword Tool (adwords.google.com).</p>

<title>Were Panelists Exposed to the Campaign Ad More Likely to Visit the Campaign Ad Destination Website Than Other Cessation Websites?</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1524500412466072">Figure 3</xref> illustrates the cumulative visits to all of the TFF campaign related sites (including the ad destination website www.floridaquitline.com) versus all other cessation websites for up to 4 weeks after initial ad exposure. The findings indicate that visits to the www.floridaquitline.com website accounted for the majority of immediate visit behaviors following each time period after first exposure, whereas visits to the other websites had no significant effect on the increase in visits over the study period. Those who were exposed to the campaign were more likely to have made at least one visit to www.floridaquitline.com as compared to the unexposed panelists (0.65% and 0.13%, respectively, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). There was no significant difference in the proportion of panelists visiting the other eight tobacco-related websites between the exposed and unexposed group across all 4 weeks (e.g., 0.19% vs. 0.23%, respectively, in Week 4).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In summary, ad exposure influenced visits to TFF campaign website, but not other cessation websites. The proportion of exposed panelists visiting the campaign website at Week 4 was higher than the total CTR for the campaign (0.77% vs. 0.29%) suggesting that CTRs may underestimate TFF campaign reach. Overall, very few people searched for tobacco cessation information, regardless of whether they were exposed to campaign ads or not. These results suggest that online ads may influence some audiences to seek out additional information by visiting the campaign website, but do not influence search behavior on similar campaign topics. However, we may have been unable to detect significant differences in search behavior because the level of ads delivered was insufficient. According to comScore’s estimates, approximately 130 million impressions were needed to analyze the search behavior results for the tobacco-related keywords provided for the campaign. The cessation campaign fell slightly short, serving 102.8 million impressions overall during the campaign period. Although the size of the campaign is relatively large for the population, a national target audience may be necessary in order to fully examine whether online ad exposure influences information-seeking behavior using this approach. Additionally, a national campaign would provide a larger sample of exposed audiences for conducting stratified analyses by smoking status and demographic characteristics to better understand which subgroups respond best to online ads.</p>
<p>Although we saw an increase in the proportion of panelists visiting the campaign site over time, we cannot be sure whether this was due to a latency effect (i.e., panelists remembering the campaign ad and visiting the site at a later point), or increased exposure to multiple TFF ads over time including television and radio ads that were also tagged with the TFF destination website. Future studies of large national campaigns should examine the dose–response relationship between the amount of online advertising and information-seeking behaviors as well as the relative effectiveness of campaign ads delivered via the web versus traditional media channels such as TV and radio. Furthermore, investigating the impact of online campaigns overall and for specific subgroups will help campaign planners and evaluators to understand the dose of advertising needed to influence information-seeking behaviors and to optimize media purchases across channels to most effectively reach target audiences.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study that has examined whether online ad exposure influences information-seeking behaviors using observational measures of exposure and web activity from online panels. In tobacco control and prevention, little information has been published about measuring online ad exposure and its effects on information-seeking behavior online. Much of what has been reported relies on self-reported survey data, the use of cookies, session identifiers requiring a username and password, online ad campaign tracking (e.g., Google AdWords, Yahoo! Search Ads, etc.), or Web analytics for a specific website (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524500412466072">Graham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524500412466072">Graham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524500412466072">Gordon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524500412466072">Danaher, Boles, Akers, Gordon, &amp; Severson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524500412466072">McDonnell et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, many of these studies do not examine ad exposure and the subsequent website visits and search behavior that may be associated with the exposure. By addressing this gap in the research, we highlight a method to unobtrusively collect information on ad exposure and online behavior beyond the campaign website that is not limited by the recall bias of self-reported survey data, a user login, or users who regularly delete cookies. Additionally, we matched the unexposed and exposure groups on key demographics to manipulate ad exposure and minimize the potential impact of confounding factors.</p>
<p>Despite these strengths, our study is not without limitations. The current study was unable to assess whether increased visits to the campaign website were due to latency effects or increased level of ad exposure over time. In addition, comScore’s panel is a convenience sample, so results are not generalizable to the U.S. adult population. Furthermore, we were unable to examine how smokers specifically responded to campaign ads, as data on panelists’ smoking behavior are not regularly collected by comScore. However, in a recent survey of visitors to the TFF website, over 91% of respondents indicated they were either current or former smokers (unpublished data).</p>

<title>Conclusions and Implications for Social Marketing</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524500412466072">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2007)</xref> has published best practice recommendations for media strategy and planning of television and radio media campaigns, but no comparable recommendations are available for online ad campaigns.  Given the challenges of measuring online ad exposure and the lack of empirical evidence in this emerging field, social marketing campaigns should carefully evaluate their impact by measuring reach and exposure as well as examining the connections between ad exposure and information-seeking behaviors. Relying on self-reported data or ad CTRs may provide unreliable estimates of campaign impact. This study suggests that mining web behavior data from online panels is a useful method for measuring the impact of digital media on audiences’ information-seeking behavior. However, future studies should go beyond exposure and information-seeking behavior to examine how online activities influence engagement on campaign social media platforms and changes in attitudes and behaviors over time. Additional studies are also needed to examine whether our study results are generalizable to specific target audiences (e.g., smokers) and across different health promotion campaigns. Researchers and practitioners in the field of social marketing have an unparallel opportunity to harness the vast volume of digital data available in order to provide a more evidenced-based approach to designing and evaluating digital media campaigns.
