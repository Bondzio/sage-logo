<p>Clifford Williams is a professor of philosophy at Trinity University in Deerfield, Illinois, and a writer of several books exploring faith and reason. An interesting dimension of his contributions to philosophy is his regular attendance at the annual National Hobo Convention in Britt, Iowa, and his founding of The Hobo Press for the publication of hobo poetry.</p>
<p>The simple yet complex theme of his latest philosophical exploration is the significance of human emotions in religious faith. He names human emotional needs such as giving and receiving love, acceptance and forgiveness as essential paths in the formation of a reasoned faith. His research is comprised of lengthy one-on-one interviews on the subject of the faith journey from initiation to commitment. The author has based his book on two premises: the significance of existential needs to faith, and the satisfaction which faith gives to these needs. He wends a path between traditional evidence-based rational Christian apologetics and contemporary psychology. In making his case for faith in the Christian God based on the conjuncture of existential needs and rational evidence (including the rationale of emotional need), Professor Williams refers to the earlier writings of Blaise Pascal, Søren Kierkegaard, Martha Nussbaum, William James and C.S. Lewis, among many other theologians, psychologists, and writers.</p>
<p>He names eight self-directed needs and five other-directed needs which he tests against five criteria of validity (universal; enduring; significant; connected to other needs; and felt strongly) to bolster his argument regarding the relationship of rational evidence and existential emotions. He argues his case using what he refers to as four objections against a faith based purely on emotional needs: the satisfaction of emotional needs; images of the God which satisfy these needs; the diversity of those who do and do not feel such needs; and the satisfaction of these emotional needs outside of religious faith. Each objection merits arguments and criteria in its own dedicated chapter. In the chapter dedicated to the satisfaction of emotional needs (e.g., self-transcendence) he lists four criteria which he says are embedded in the human condition: the restless search for human love; human desires which conflict with faith in God; the conflicting weights of values which satisfy various human needs; and finally, emotional satisfaction reflected in experiences which meet the above five validity characteristics for both other-directed and self-directed criteria. In this particular chapter he has added a sixth validity criterion: the importance of contentment as a satisfying emotion.</p>
<p>Clifford Williams thus constructs for his argument what he refers to as a ‘cumulative case’ for faith in God on the basis of existential need: thirteen tested existential needs for faith in God; the interconnection of these needs; and the rational basis supporting these needs. In the penultimate chapter he explores his case against the arguments of Thomas Aquinas and Søren Kierkegaard. He looks at what Aquinas meant by the will that moves assent to faith, where ‘will’ is interpreted as the emotion which invokes ‘willingness’ and thus subsequent actions of charity which complete the experience of religious faith. In citing the work of what appears to be his favourite philosopher, Søren Kierkegaard, Willams writes that religious faith must be a passionate personal commitment rather than participation in a ritual affirming membership in a particular Christian community. Williams makes his own case for faith in the Christian God in this chapter by arguing that faith in a non-Christian God does not satisfy existential needs as well as does faith in the Christian God.</p>
<p>This book will appeal to several categories of readers: philosophers who will question the line of argumentation and the authorities cited; theologians of the apologetic school who will question the validity of existential needs in whole or in part; and psychologists who follow evidence-based schools of psychological therapy. Practical and pastoral theologians should welcome the significance Professor Williams affirms in the confluence of human emotions and religious faith, both historically in sacred scriptures and in contemporary life experiences.</p>
