<abstract>
<p>This study examines time with children among women who remain childless in young to middle adulthood. The authors identify biologically childless women aged 25 to 44 years in the June 2004-2008 Current Population Survey, and use their subsequent time use diaries in the 2004-2009 American Time Use Survey to measure their time with children. The authors pay particular attention to time with children who are not one’s “own” (by adoption or marriage) and to differences across educational groups of childless women. It is found that childless women frequently spend time with children, and childless women with no 4-year college degree are almost twice as likely to spend time with children as childless women with a 4-year degree. The authors also show how educational differences in childless women’s time with children are mediated by work patterns, residential arrangements, and especially union status. The findings suggest large class differences in how women experience the boundary between childlessness and parenthood.</p>

<p>Because of increases in delayed childbearing and permanent childlessness, a rising proportion of U.S. women remain childless in young to middle adulthood. Thirty-five percent of U.S. women aged 25 to 44 years remain childless in the June 2006 Current Population Survey (CPS). These ages correspond roughly to the span between the normative age at first birth and the age at which childlessness becomes permanent. For many childless women at these ages, having no children of their own means spending no time with children at all. However, some women who are biologically childless spend time with their own stepchildren or adopted children. Still other childless women spend time with children who are not their own, in various durations, frequencies, and contexts.</p>
<p>The interactions childless women have with children who are not their own can be an important part of the experience of temporary or permanent childlessness, in the portion of the life course where most women are mothers who spend much of their time with children. Previous research on childless women’s interactions with children has suggested that interactions with children are generally experienced as beneficial. Time with children is gratifying for many (but not all) childless women, and across the long term, it can strengthen intergenerational social bonds. However, previous work on this topic has been based only on case studies. As such, there has been no published work on the demographics of childless women’s interactions with children. We know little about which childless women are spending time with children, how often they spend time with children, or how much time they spend. Moreover, previous research on childless women has primarily focused on women who are middle or upper class with little attention paid to the experiences of working and lower class women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192513X12443943">Schlesinger &amp; Schlesinger, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Education is a demographic variable of particular interest in the study of childless women’s time with children. Mothers who have higher levels of education spend more time with children than those who have lower educational attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X12443943">Bianchi, Robinson, &amp; Milkie, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X12443943">Gauthier, Smeeding, &amp; Furstenberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192513X12443943">Leibowitz, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192513X12443943">Sandberg &amp; Hofferth, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192513X12443943">Sayer, Gauthier, &amp; Furstenberg, 2004</xref>). In contrast, the presumed career orientation and living arrangements of childless college graduates might predict that these women are less likely to spend time with children than their counterparts without college degrees. This prediction has never been empirically tested, but if true it would indicate that the boundary of lived experience separating childlessness from motherhood is much more abrupt for college graduates than for women of lower educational attainment.</p>
<p>In this study, we combine data from the June 2004-2008 CPS and 2004-2009 American Time Use Survey (ATUS) to measure the time childless women spend with children, and especially with children who are not their “own”; that is, children who are not related to survey respondents by biological parenthood, adoption, or marriage (i.e., step-parenthood). We pay particular attention to differences across educational groups of childless women, and we examine the roles of childless women’s work time, union status, and residential arrangements in explaining patterns of time with children.</p>
<sec id="section1-0192513X12443943">
<title>Background</title>
<p>The growing sociological literature on time with children has focused primarily on the time mothers spend with their own children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192513X12443943">Bianchi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X12443943">Bianchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192513X12443943">Kendig &amp; Bianchi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192513X12443943">Sanik &amp; Mauldin, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X12443943">Sayer, Bianchi, &amp; Robinson, 2004</xref>), or less frequently, the time fathers spend with their own children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X12443943">Bianchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X12443943">Sayer, Bianchi, et al., 2004</xref>). A separate literature on child care by mothers’ relatives and friends recognizes that women spend time with children that are not their own, but these studies have focused more on the children receiving the child care and their mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192513X12443943">Brewster &amp; Padavic, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192513X12443943">Riley &amp; Glass, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192513X12443943">Uttal, 1999</xref>) than on the women who spend time with children who are not their own. Data from the ATUS, and in particular variables that identify the time women are spending with “not-own” children, allow us to extend this work still further and to examine time with children in childless women’s lives.</p>
<p>Childless women’s time with children is of social interest for two reasons. The first reason is that time with children can affect the quality of life of childless adults. Interactions between children and childless adults may not be sufficient to generate the social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192513X12443943">Schoen, Kim, Nathanson, Fields, &amp; Astone, 1997</xref>) and social support in old age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192513X12443943">Connidis &amp; McMullin, 1994</xref>) associated with biological parenthood and commonly identified in theories of the value of children. However, interactions between children and childless adults are often considered beneficial to childless adults because they provide a sense of <italic>generativity</italic>, helping satisfy the profound psychological motivation to achieve care and concern for others, to carry on one’s legacy, and to transcend the self in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192513X12443943">Kotre, 1984</xref>; see also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192513X12443943">Erikson, 1963</xref>).</p>
<p>The relationship between generativity and well-being has been found to be as strong for childless adults as for parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X12443943">Rothrauf &amp; Cooney, 2008</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0192513X12443943">Rubinstein (1996)</xref> describes how childless women’s involvement in their siblings’ families can be a source of generativity. Psychological arguments about the value of generativity for childless women are supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192513X12443943">Hoffman and Manis (1979)</xref>, who listed the advantages of having children reported by parents and nonparents. Some of these activities, such as stimulation and fun, and giving love to a child, are consistent with the notion of generativity and do not seem to be contingent on being a parent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0192513X12443943">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the societal level, researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192513X12443943">Preston, 1984</xref>) have argued that the positive social implications of parenthood, such as altruism and social cohesion, may be reduced due to the rise in childlessness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192513X12443943">Hagestad and Uhlenberg (2005)</xref> link the decline in fertility to a weakening of intergenerational ties and increase in age segregation. However, if childless women are spending time with children perhaps social cohesion and intergenerational ties are stronger than assumed.</p>
<p>The second, and arguably more theoretically important, reason childless women’s time with children is a topic of interest is that it can clarify our understanding of the boundary between childlessness and parenthood. Most sociological studies on family change (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192513X12443943">Goldscheider &amp; Waite, 1991</xref>) and work–family balance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192513X12443943">Hewlett, 2002</xref>) equate childlessness to a complete separation from or rejection of children. For example, with a focus on household structure, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192513X12443943">Goldscheider and Waite (1991)</xref> equate the rise of independent living with having “no families” rather than considering the possible role (not own) children have in the lives of these young adults. Theories of fertility generally equate the value of children with the value of having children of one’s own, which would be appropriate if childlessness is (as is generally assumed) a life stage or a life path devoid of children, or at least a condition homogenous across all its members (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192513X12443943">Dykstra &amp; Hagestad, 2007</xref>). However, if there are significant group differences in <italic>childless women’s</italic> interactions with children, then there will necessarily be significant group differences in the life changes associated with the transition to parenthood, separate from and additional to the group differences in <italic>parents’</italic> interactions with children.</p>
<p>Consider hypothetically two groups of childless women, of which one group has higher rates of contact with non-own children than the other group. Differences in contact with non-own children could affect the levels of experience the groups bring into the transition to parenthood, could provide information that influences decisions to have delayed births or remain childless, could provide some women a suitable substitute for the experience of parenthood, or could even (if the group differences were large and persistent enough) contribute to cultural differences in understandings about the suitable antecedents for the transition to parenthood.</p>
<p>This discussion is particularly salient with respect to educational differences in fertility. In the United States, highly educated women are more likely to remain childless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192513X12443943">Abma &amp; Martinez, 2006</xref>) and much more likely to delay childbearing and have first births at later ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192513X12443943">Rindfuss, Morgan, &amp; Offutt, 1996</xref>) compared with women of lower educational attainment. Childless college graduates are also much more likely to use medical fertility assistance than childless women of lower educational attainment, apparently net of differences in economic resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192513X12443943">Chandra &amp; Stephen, 1998</xref>). Conversely, women of lower educational attainment are more likely to have births outside of marriage or to divorce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192513X12443943">McLanahan, 2004</xref>). In sum, educational differences in fertility have been diverging across a wide range of outcomes, and the explanations for this divergence have not been fully satisfactory.</p>
<p>In this analysis, we focus on childless women’s educational attainment as a predictor of time with children. We anticipate significant educational differences in time with children—differences that reflect the diverging fertility and economic experiences of women of different educational levels. In the following section, we outline the measurable and unmeasurable variables that might contribute to such educational differences. We also suspect that educational differences in the time use of childless women can in turn provide insights into those same diverging fertility patterns, and will return to this discussion in the concluding section.</p>
<sec id="section2-0192513X12443943">
<title>Education and Childless Women’s Time With Children</title>
<p>As we have noted, previous research has established that among mothers, highly educated women spend more time with their children than less educated women. There are several reasons, however, to expect that such a pattern might be reversed among childless women, and that childless college graduates might be <italic>less</italic> likely to spend time with children than childless women of lower educational attainment. In this section, we identify three such reasons that are amenable to analysis through variables available in the CPS or the ATUS; these variables are employment hours, union status (marriage or cohabitation), and coresidence with children. We also discuss other possible reasons for which there are no suitable variables available for investigation.</p>
<p>In studies of mothers’ time with children, <italic>work hours</italic> are perhaps the most widely studied competing activity. Research has shown that employment is negatively related to parents’ time with children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X12443943">Bianchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X12443943">Gauthier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192513X12443943">Sandberg &amp; Hofferth, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X12443943">Sayer, Bianchi, et al., 2004</xref>). For mothers, labor force participation reduces the amount of available time and increases the opportunity costs of spending time with children. However, despite women’s increased labor force participation over recent decades, parents spend more time with their children than they have in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X12443943">Bianchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X12443943">Sayer, Bianchi, et al., 2004</xref>) and have pulled time from other activities, such as housework, to spend more time with their children.</p>
<p>In studies of childless women’s time with children, additional work hours might also predict a reduced likelihood of spending time with children, with two possible differences compared with what has been found in the literature on mothers. First, given that childless women are often more imbedded with careers than mothers, we might see higher rates of overtime hours as compared with full-time or fewer hours. Furthermore, given that even childless women who spend time with children do not spend as much time with children as mothers, we expect that competition between paid work and time with children might only become acute for the highest levels of paid work, 45 hours per week or more.</p>
<p>Second, interactions between paid work and education might produce a negative effect on time with children for childless women, which is not present for mothers. Among childless college graduates, long hours spent at a job are likely to indicate strong career involvement, so that work hours compete with children not only temporally but also psychologically by providing alternatives for life satisfaction and a sense of generativity. Among childless women with lower educational attainment, work hours at typical jobs and careers may be less likely to provide psychological as well as temporal competition to time with children.</p>
<p>After work hours, a childless woman’s <italic>relationship status</italic> is an important predictor of time with children that also might have interactions with educational attainment. Compared with a single woman, a married or cohabiting woman generally has a network of relatives twice as large (through relatives of her husband or partner). In addition, when a childless woman is married or cohabiting, she is likely to be exposed to any children her spouse or partner has through a previous relationship, although such children would generally be coresident with their biological mother rather than the childless woman. Given that women with no college degree have much higher rates of nonmarital childbearing and divorce, one might expect opportunities for time with a male partner’s previous children to arise more frequently for childless women of lower educational attainment than for childless women with 4-year college degrees.</p>
<p>Finally, from the household identifier variables in the CPS, it is possible to determine whether a childless woman is coresident with children. <italic>Coresidence with children</italic> is an obvious predictor of time with children, although the prevalence of such coresidence is likely to be low in the population of childless women. Nevertheless we expect childless women with no 4-year degrees to experience such complex living arrangements more frequently than childless college graduates.</p>
<p>There are additional factors that could predict educational differences in childless women’s time with children, but such factors are outside the reach of this analysis. Such factors include neighborhood characteristics, proximity of close friends and relatives, whether those friends and relatives have children of their own, and other factors that are generally inaccessible in the ATUS because there are no variables that capture such complex relationships. Also, there might be educational differences in the value of children, an assumption based on the reduced and delayed fertility of college graduates compared with women of lower educational attainment, although direct measurements of such values or attitudes have produced inconclusive results. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192513X12443943">Koropeckyj-Cox and Pendell (2007)</xref> found that less educated women tend to hold more negative attitudes about childlessness. However, among childless women, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192513X12443943">McQuillan, Greil, Schreffler, and Tichenor (2007)</xref> found higher education to be associated with greater importance of motherhood, although this difference fell below statistical significance. Still other factors include boundary flexibility, or the differential willingness of different social groups to bring individuals outside the nuclear family into relationships with children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192513X12443943">Johnson &amp; Barer, 1995</xref>). All these factors and others would be expected to occupy any residual coefficient for education, net of previously described controls for work hours, union status, and coresidence with children.</p>

<sec id="section3-0192513X12443943" sec-type="methods">
<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>In this analysis, we use the August 2004-December 2009 ATUS, combined with fertility and residential data collected from the same respondents in the June 2004-2008 CPS. The CPS is a monthly survey of households conducted by the Bureau of the Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to collect information on the employment and unemployment of the U.S. population. Additional data on special topics are collected in periodic supplements, such as the June Fertility Supplements. Childlessness is measured with a variable from the June 2004 CPS Fertility Supplement which asks, “How many live births, if any, has . . . ever had?” Women who reported no live births in June 2004 were recorded as childless and constitute our primary sample of interest. The age range of 25 to 45 years reflects a range of ages in which, had the childless women been biological mothers, time with children would likely have been a daily activity of long duration.</p>
<p>The ATUS is a follow-up survey drawn from a sample of households that previously completed interviews for the CPS. The ATUS stage of the sample is drawn as follows. A nationally representative sample of households is drawn from CPS households that completed their final eighth month of interviews from the CPS. Then, out of all household members, one individual of at least 15 years of age from each household is randomly selected to complete the ATUS time-diary interview. About 55% of selected respondents completed their time diaries in the ATUS. Hence, although the ATUS time diaries are considered a reasonably accurate measure of patterns of time use by Americans, the final sample size is relatively small. The ATUS time diaries are collected in the following manner. The sample is allotted between weekdays and weekends and for each week of the month. Data are collected on randomly preassigned interview days and interviews are conducted via telephone with the assistance of computer-assisted telephone interviewing. The time diary consists of a detailed account of the respondent’s activities, starting at 4:00 a.m. the previous day and ending at 4:00 a.m. on the interview day. The interviewer asks how long each activity lasted and, for most activities, the interviewer asks who was in the room or accompanied the respondent during the activity and where the activity took place. Also, the ATUS updates survey data from the CPS (excluding data from supplements such as the fertility supplement), so that demographic variables such as education and marital status are measured contemporaneously with the diary data.</p>
<p>Of particular interest for our analysis, the time diaries account for time women spend with children who are their own, and children who are not their own, on the diary day. The ATUS defines “own” children as children through birth, adoption, or marriage (i.e., stepchildren). Hence, some women who are biologically childless are nevertheless spending time with children who are their “own” by ATUS definitions. Unfortunately, there is also the possibility of a live birth in the months between the original June CPS was measured and the follow-up ATUS where time with own children was measured. Hence, time with “own” children reported in the diary could represent biologically childless women’s time with their own adopted or stepchildren, or time with a recently born first baby. Because of this uncertainty about the time with own children, we analyze time with own children and time with non-own children separately as described later.</p>
<p>The sample for this study consists of 885 women, childless and 25 to 44 years of age at the June 2004-2008 CPS who subsequently completed a time diary interview in the ATUS between August 2004 and December 2009 and had a nonzero sampling weight in the ATUS. Of these childless respondents, 184 reported coresiding with their “own” children in the ATUS. Of these 184 respondents, 106 also reported coresiding with their own children in the CPS where they reported being biologically childless, so we suspect that these women were step- or adoptive mothers. The remaining 78 had no “own” children at the CPS interview, and reported coresident children younger than 6 years in the ATUS interview; we suspect that most or all of these women had a first biological child between the CPS and the ATUS interviews. We removed all 184 such women from the second stage of the analysis, leaving 701 childless women with no “own” children for the analysis of time with non-own children. Finally, for a brief descriptive comparison of time use by childless women with time use by mothers, we use a sample of 8,651 biological mothers aged 25 to 44 years in the June 2004-2008 CPS, who were also reinterviewed in the ATUS.</p>

<title>Dependent Variable</title>
<sec id="section5-0192513X12443943">
<title>Time with children</title>
<p>The ATUS distinguishes time with “own” children from time with “non-own” children. A few women who were biologically childless in the CPS reported time with “own” children in the follow-up ATUS, indicating that biologically childless women were either spending time with adopted or stepchildren (defined as “own” children in the surveys), or that a first birth occurred in the brief interval between the CPS and the ATUS. We define time with own children as <italic>probably</italic> time with stepchildren or adopted children in cases where a woman reported being biologically childless in the 2004-2008 June CPS but also coresident with one or more “own” children in the same CPS. We define time with own children as <italic>probably</italic> time with new biological children if a biologically childless woman reports no “own” children in her household roster in June 2004-2008 but an own child in her household roster at the ATUS follow-up. Our assignments of the status of own children are probably correct in most cases, but no doubt there are miss-assignments as well, so we only do a brief aggregate analysis of time spent with own children and limit the individual-level analysis to time spent with non-own children.</p>
<p>For the main analysis of time with non-own children, we use a simple dichotomous coding with a value of 1 if the woman reported time with non-own children on the diary day, 0 if not. We use this dichotomous variable as a categorical outcome in a series of standard logistic regression models. Time with non-own children is defined as time with children who are not a woman’s biological, step-, or adopted children. Also, time with children as a part of paid work (say, by day care workers or school teachers) is excluded from time with non-own children.</p>
<p>The time diaries record time spent with “non-own” children as a continuous variable but treating time use for an infrequent event as a continuous outcome variable raises numerous methodological concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X12443943">Kang, 2007</xref>). In parts of the analysis where we need some measure of the duration of time with children as well as its prevalence, we split the categories of time use into relatively short durations of an hour or less, versus long durations of more than 1 hour.</p>
<p>All analyses are weighted to adjust for sample stratification. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0192513X12443943">Table A1</xref> (see the appendix), we show results from unweighted analyses and from Tobit models for continuous but censored data. These alternatively specified models produce equivalent findings to the main logistic regressions.</p>

<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p><italic>Educational attainment</italic> is captured by the question in the ATUS survey, “What is the highest level of school you have completed or the highest degree you have received?” The response categories range from less than first grade to doctorate degree. This variable was recoded into a dummy variable for those who completed a 4-year college degree (bachelor’s degree or higher) versus those who did not complete a 4-year degree (associate degree or lower). The noncollege graduate category is excluded as the reference group in the regressions.</p>
<p><italic>Race and ethnicity</italic> is measured by two variables: one variable with 21 racial categories as response choices and another variable based on the question, “Are you Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino?” with Hispanic and non-Hispanic as response choices. Recoded dummy variables were created for Hispanic, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic Asian, and (non-Hispanic) Other. Non-Hispanic White is excluded as the reference group in the regressions. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0192513X12443943">Table A2</xref> in the appendix provides results from analyses using limited samples by race and ethnicity.</p>
<p><italic>Union status</italic> is captured with a variable that asks whether a spouse or unmarried partner is present in the household. The ATUS provides a variable that distinguishes married women from cohabiting women among those in a union, but we combined marriages and cohabitations because of the small number of cohabitations in the sample (36 out of 701 cases) and because cohabiting and married women were similar in their patterns of time with non-own children (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0192513X12443943">Table A3</xref> in the appendix).</p>
<p><italic>Employment</italic> is measured in a number of ways in the CPS and ATUS, but we chose a specification based on the number of hours worked to identify women who worked overtime hours and presumably had less time for children in their diary day. In the main models we use a dichotomous specification for women who worked 45 or more hours a week (coded as 1) and women who worked 0 to 44 hours (coded as 0). The dichotomous specification for overtime work is interacted with the dichotomous specification for education, producing a single dichotomous interaction term for overtime * 4-year degree. Alternative specifications for full-time versus part-time versus no work, or for employed versus not employed did not show evidence for relationships between work patterns and time spent with non-own children.</p>
<p>For childless women, we use the household rosters from the June 2004 CPS to determine whether the woman was <italic>residing in a household with a (non-own) child</italic>. This variable has a time lag to the ATUS diary but is still a useful measure of one factor (coresidence) that can clearly predict spending time with children.</p>
<p><italic>Age</italic> is a continuous variable that ranges from 25 to 45 years. We use 25 as a minimum age on the assumption that most (although certainly not all) women who obtain a college degree will have done so by age 25. We use 45 as a maximum age because 44 is the oldest age at which women were asked about their fertility in the June 2004 CPS (and the ATUS came up to a year later). We allow for a possible nonlinear relationship between age and time with non-own children by estimating both a linear term for age and a quadratic term for age squared.</p>
<p>The <italic>day of the week</italic> in which the diary took place is captured with a variable with responses for each day. A dummy variable was created for a weekend versus weekday diary day with a weekday diary day excluded as the reference category. The weekend variable is important as an analytical control because weekend diaries were overrepresented in the sample. The distinction between weekends and weekdays provides important clues about weekly as opposed to daily patterns of time use, especially if some groups of women report time with children more frequently on weekends than on weekdays.</p>

<p>To show whether educational differences in time with children are unique to childless women, we begin with descriptive data that include both mothers and childless women. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192513X12443943">Table 1</xref> provides the distribution of biological and other “own” children among women 25 to 45 years of age. Among women with no 4-year degree, 80.7% are known to have biological children, 3.7% have “own” children who are either stepchildren, adopted children, or recent first births, and 15.6% have no biological or other “own” children. Among women with a 4-year degree, 60.1% are known to have biological children, 4.8% have other “own” children who are either stepchildren, adopted children, or recent first births, and 35.0% have no biological or other “own” children.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0192513X12443943">Table 2</xref> presents percentages, means, and standard deviations for time with own children and time with non-own children. In the sample of biological mothers, women with a 4-year degree report higher values for time with own children and similar values for time with non-own children, compared with women with no 4-year degree. We found some cases with very high numbers of hours reported for time with non-own children, and caution against interpreting too much from group differences in means as compared with percentages. Also, because this sample cannot control for age of children and college graduates often delay first births, it is impossible to tell what part of the educational difference in time with children is due to the younger average age of children for college graduates. Nevertheless, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0192513X12443943">Table 2</xref> suggests that low frequency of time with own children is a phenomenon unique to <italic>childless</italic> college graduates.

Hence, if long work hours take away opportunities for time with non-own children, one would expect that adding controls for work hours would explain part of the educational difference in time with non-own children.</p>

<p>Educational differences in union status indicate that women with a 4-year college degree are more likely to be in a marital or cohabiting union (46.2 + 10.9 = 57.1%) than women with no 4-year degree (43.3 + 6.1 = 49.4%). If union status has the expected effect of increasing opportunities for time with non-own children, then we would predict that union status would be a mitigating factor that makes educational differences in time use smaller than they would otherwise be. Finally, women with a 4-year college degree are slightly less likely to be coresident with non-own children than are women with no 4-year degree, but coresidence with non-own children is so infrequent that it is unlikely to have much effect on the overall results.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0192513X12443943">Table 5</xref> shows the results from the logistic regressions predicting time with non-own children for childless women. Model 1 includes educational differences plus basic demographic and sample controls, and it confirms that women with a 4-year college degree are less likely to spend time with non-own children than women of lower educational attainment. This difference in the sample is statistically significant and therefore likely to reflect a true difference in the population. According to the coefficient for educational attainment in Model 1, the odds of spending time with non-own children for women with a 4-year college degree are exp(−0.74) = 0.46 times as great as for women with no 4-year degree.</p>

<p>In Model 2 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0192513X12443943">Table 5</xref>, we add additional controls for employment status, and for the interaction of employment and education. The coefficient for working 45 or more hours per week is negative but not statistically significant (−0.79, <italic>ns</italic>). Although this coefficient is not statistically significant, its direction is consistent with our prior theory that part of the reason women with a 4-year degree are unlikely to spend time with non-own children is that a high proportion of such women work very long hours. The work * education interaction interaction coefficient is positive but not statistically significant (0.39, <italic>ns</italic>). With controls for work hours added to the model, the main coefficient for education is smaller than in Model 1 but remains statistically significant (−0.72 vs. −0.74), suggesting that work hours explain some of the educational differences in childless women’s time with non-own children.</p>
<p>To illustrate the interaction of employment and education, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0192513X12443943">Figure 1</xref> displays time spent with non-own children according to women’s weekly work hours and educational attainment. Among childless women with no 4-year degree, 30.5% of women who work less than 45 hours per week spend time with non-own children whereas 16.6% of women who work overtime spend time with non-own children. Among college graduate childless women, there is a less pronounced employment difference in time with non-own children. Among women with a 4-year degree, 17.5% of women who work less than 45 hours per week spend time with non-own children compared with 12.5% of women who work overtime. To summarize, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0192513X12443943">Figure 1</xref> illustrates that although women’s higher weekly work hours do predict a lower probability of spending time with non-own children, this relationship does not explain educational differences in time with non-own children.</p>

<p>In Model 3 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0192513X12443943">Table 5</xref>, we add controls for union and residential status, and for the interaction of union status and education. With controls for living arrangements added to the model, the main coefficient for education has almost disappeared compared with Model 1 (0.09, <italic>ns</italic> versus −0.74), suggesting that most of the educational differences in childless women’s time with non-own children are mediated by their relationship status in some way. The coefficient for being in a marital or cohabiting union is statistically significant (0.83) indicating that childless women in a union are more likely to spend time with non-own children than childless women who are single, at least for the omitted education category of women with no 4-year degree.</p>
<p>This positive coefficient for union status is consistent with our prior hypothesis about unions exposing childless women to larger networks of relatives and children, but the size of the coefficient begs the question of how college graduates, who are <italic>more</italic> likely to be in a union, are <italic>less</italic> likely to spend time with non-own children. The large significant negative interaction coefficient for union status * education appears to answer this question.</p>
<p>It appears that the relationship between union status and time with non-own children is different for childless college graduates than it is for nongraduates. Among women with no 4-year degree, being in a marital or cohabiting union greatly increases the chance of spending time with non-own children. Among women with a 4-year degree, the interaction coefficient erases almost all the main coefficient for union status, so that there is little or no difference in frequency of spending time with non-own children by union status for women of higher educational attainment.</p>
<p>Model 3 also includes a control for whether the respondent was coresident with a non-own child. The coefficient for coresidence with children is large and statistically significant. However, only about 4% of the childless sample is coresident with non-own children, which suggests that coresidence with children is not a key factor explaining educational differences in time with non-own children.</p>
<p>To summarize our main findings about marriage and education, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0192513X12443943">Figure 2</xref> shows time spent with children according to women’s educational attainment and union status. Among childless women with no 4-year degree, 19.2% of single women spend time with non-own children whereas 35.3% of married or cohabiting women spend time with non-own children. Among women who are college graduates, union status differences in time with non-own children are much less pronounced. Among childless women with a 4-year degree, 20.6% of women who are single spend time with non-own children compared with 12.4% of women in marital or cohabiting unions. Hence, for women with no college degree, marriage and cohabitation <italic>increase</italic> the probability of spending time with children.

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section9-0192513X12443943">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>We have examined overall levels and educational differences in the time childless women spend with children. We found that biologically childless women frequently spend time with children, sometimes with children they call their own (presumably stepchildren or adopted children), and more often with non-own children.</p>
<p>In our main analysis we focused on childless women’s reported time with non-own children, and we confirmed our prediction that women with 4-year college degrees had a much lower probability of spending time with non-own children on a given day, compared with women with less than a 4-year degree. This finding among childless women is noteworthy because previous research has repeatedly found the opposite pattern among mothers, where college graduate women spend the most time with children.</p>
<p>As we previously noted, other studies of family change often equate childlessness to a complete separation from children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192513X12443943">Goldscheider &amp; Waite, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192513X12443943">Hewlett, 2002</xref>). Our findings suggest that such a simplification is often true for highly educated women but frequently untrue for less educated women. Among college graduates, parenthood sharply divides the childless women who seldom spend time with children from the mothers who spend more time with children (their own and others) than in most other activities. In contrast, among women without a 4-year degree, the relationship between parenthood and time with children appears to be more fluid. For many women with less than a 4-year degree and no children of their own, the label “childless” accurately describes their birth history but not their day-to-day experiences.</p>
<p>To search for a partial explanation of this educational difference in the probability of spending time with children, we used logistic regression models to examine the roles of work hours, union status, coresidence with children, and interactions between work hours and education and between union status and education. Our findings suggest work hours and coresidence with children each explain a small part of the educational difference in time with children, although the coefficient for work hours is not statistically significant.</p>
<p>We found that union status appears to be the most important factor in explaining educational differences in time with non-own children among childless women. Among childless women with no 4-year degree, marriage and cohabitation are associated with an increased probability of spending time with children. In contrast and somewhat surprisingly, among childless women with a 4-year degree or higher, marriage and cohabitation are associated with a lower probability of spending time with children. Hence, although different educational groups of childless women have comparable proportions who are married or cohabiting, the relationship between union status and time with children is reversed from one education level to the other.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0192513X12443943">
<title>Interpretation</title>
<p>From a simple perspective, time with children can be considered to be beneficial in that time with non-own children prepares childless women for later motherhood, or else provides opportunities for fun or a sense of generativity whether childless women have children later or not. In this sense, our results suggest that time with non-own children is a possible benefit for less educated childless women. However, we expect future research will show the truth to be more complicated, with opportunities, obligations, and needs acting as predictors of whether childless women spend time with children.</p>
<p>The evidence that educated differences in time use among childless women are mediated by union status might also have implications for educational differences in overall fertility patterns. To fully understand the patterns of time with non-own children reported by childless women in unions, it would be necessary to identify both parents of the non-own children, and the relationships of those parents to the childless respondent. Unfortunately, as the ATUS does not provide such information, our interpretation of those patterns is somewhat uncertain.</p>
<p>We can offer two likely explanations for the high probability of spending time with non-own children for childless women with no 4-year degree in marital or cohabiting unions. One explanation might be that the non-own children are children of the partner or husband’s siblings or other relatives. Married or cohabiting childless college graduates might then be reporting much lower incidence of time with children, if their husband or partner’s relatives, more likely to be college graduates themselves, have also postponed childbearing or remained childless.</p>
<p>The second explanation might be that the non-own children are the biological children of the husband or partner, that is, children from a previous relationship. Such an explanation would be plausible, given high rates of nonmarital and early childbearing, family instability, and constrained marriage markets for women and men with less than a 4-year college degree in the United States.</p>
<p>To further speculate from our second explanation above, the patterns of time with children that we have found among childless women might have implications for broader questions about educational differences in fertility in the United States. Many social researchers have commented on how highly educated women in the United States have adopted a fertility pattern of postponing marriage and fertility, then marrying, then having children. Such a pattern of family formation is associated with high rates of union stability, high parental incomes, and high rates of home ownership and other wealth accumulation. A natural question, then, is why women of lower educational levels are less likely to pursue the same strategy, but instead have children earlier, more often outside of marriage, and (if in marriage) in less stable unions with fewer economic resources.</p>
<p>With respect to this broader discussion of education and fertility, our analysis has shed some light on a critical group: women with no 4-year degree who have remained childless and yet are in a (generally marital) union. These women postpone fertility, and then often enter a union with a husband with children from previous relationships, a husband who might be less oriented to or even opposed to childbearing in the new marriage. Under such circumstances, marriage might be less conducive to delayed childbearing than it is for college graduates, who are more likely to marry childless husbands. In other words, a crucial difference between less educated women and highly educated women’s fertility trajectories across the life course might be that for less educated women who postpone fertility, union formation could be less conducive to childbearing.</p>
<p>Previous research on women who postpone childbearing or remain childless has been noted for concentrating on the experiences of middle- and upper-class women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192513X12443943">Schlesinger &amp; Schlesinger, 1989</xref>). Our results point out that among childless women spending time with children is quite common among women with less than a college degree—women who are largely invisible in the literature on childlessness. For these childless women, time with children is likely to be an important and enriching part of life, and their contribution to the care and enrichment of children in other families is likely to be considerable. Furthermore, our finding of very high levels of time with non-own children among less educated childless women who are married and cohabiting suggests strong educational differences in the dynamics of childless marriages in early midlife. Such education-by-union interactions provide insights not only into class and educational differences in time with non-own children but also possibly for class and educational differences in fertility timing across the life course.</p>

<p>Although the association between time with children and the well-being of childless adults is generally considered to be a positive one, it would be a mistake to use differences in time with children to infer differences in quality of life among groups of childless women. Even if we assume that generativity is a universal human need, adults and especially childless adults can satisfy that need for generativity through pursuits that have nothing to do with their own or other children, pursuits attuned to their own preferences and skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192513X12443943">Ireland, 1993</xref>). Similarly, the more transactional benefits of interactions of time with children such as social capital and social support are often achieved through alternative activities that do not involve children.</p>
