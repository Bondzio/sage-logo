<abstract>
<p>This paper describes the past ten years of the International Union for Health Promotion and Education’s (IUHPE) flagship programme on health promotion effectiveness. It examines the context in which the programme developed and the organization of the programme to carry out its goals. The paper takes a critical look at the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and difficulties of conducting such a broad programme within a global membership-based non-governmental organization (NGO). It also discusses how the field of evidence gathering has developed in relationship to the project and what changes have emerged since the early years. Lack of resources, both in terms of contributors and financial support, is identified as the key problem in sustaining an NGO effort to examine effectiveness.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Global Programme for Health Promotion Effectiveness (GPHPE), originating in 2001, is and remains a multi-partner initiative, coordinated by the International Union for Health Promotion and Education (IUHPE). During its tenure the GPHPE has collaborated with numerous organizations. Examples include the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the African Medical and Research Foundation, the Australian International Health Institute, Health Canada, Health Development Agency England, the Netherlands Institute for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention and the Voluntary Health Association of India, to name some of the original partners from across the world. However, as with many organizations, interest and resourcing varied greatly and over time other organizations such as the Africa Institute for Health and Development and the Swiss Health Promotion Foundation became active participants. Some organizations ceased to exist during the decade and/or changed their names.</p>
<p>The chief goal of the GPHPE is to enhance the global profile of health promotion by reviewing evidence of effectiveness, translating evidence to end users and stimulating debate on the nature of evidence of effectiveness. The work is guided by representatives from the regions of IUHPE and from major partner organizations. Much of the original protocol for this programme was stimulated by the IUHPE publication, <italic>The Evidence of Health Promotion Effectiveness – Shaping Public Health in a New Europe</italic> (IUHPE/EC 1997).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913912442268">1</xref></sup> The principal challenge for the GPHPE has always been to develop a sustainable approach with adaptations suitable to different regional needs while maintaining high quality. Initially I was the global programme leader and the IUHPE programme coordinator was Anne Bunde-Birouste; Anne was followed by Catherine Jones who remains as the coordinator.</p>
<p>From the beginning the idea was to produce a sizeable global monograph as a product designed to take a broad overview of issues of evidence, evaluation and effectiveness in health promotion. It would try to reflect the strong regional emphasis of IUHPE and as a result would contain considerable variation in the approach to evidence, evaluation and effectiveness by region. The monograph would compare and contrast these variations and search for commonalities in approaches. In addition it would provide key chapters on issues considered critical to the development of health promotion throughout the world – issues such as how the changing nature of health promotion relates to larger debates on the nature of evidence and how rising problems in the world such as globalization, urbanization and inequity affect how evidence is viewed by health promoters. Initially the global monograph was intended to be seen as a companion document to regional documents that would be produced in specific geopolitical areas of the world such as Southeast Asia, Latin America, Europe, Africa and North America.</p>
<p>From the onset it was felt that the GPHPE should have a strong focus on communications that mixed different approaches and different sectors for a better understanding of issues around effectiveness. So there has been, throughout the programme’s existence, strong emphases on dissemination adapted to specific target audiences. The chief target audiences for the GPHPE in general were health promotion practitioners and researchers, policy makers and those interested in health promotion approaches. The monograph was targeted to those conducting research and practice in health promotion.</p>
<p>Finally it should be noted that from the outset the organizational structure for the GPHPE was well developed. The budget for the programme was, however, always very limited and it continues to be limited and dependent on occasional small grants and mechanisms that fund pieces of the programme. This fact is not to be discounted; it shows the power of partnership and the role of the voluntary health promotion community. For many of the years of the GPHPE there has been no hard budget and the programme remains largely virtual.</p>
<p>One note of history for reflection: during the last decade of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st the growth of programmes and efforts to assess ‘evidence’ were accelerating, spurred on by the clamour for evidence-based medicine. Health promotion as a field of public health was not spared this need to prove itself scientifically. How well the notion of evidence that was called for would fit into the field of health promotion is a complicated story, some of which will be discussed below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1757913912442268">
<title>The High Point of the GPHPE</title>
<p>It is assertable that during the 10-year history of the GPHPE the high point came in 2007 with the publication of the monograph <italic>Global Perspectives on Health Promotion Effectiveness</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913912442268">2</xref></sup> It was the culmination of three years of effort and was released in Vancouver, Canada at the IUHPE World Conference. The publication was conceived as the first volume in what would be a series of monographs on health promotion effectiveness. This was, in part, because the editors realised that there was much more that needed to be said on this topic and the volume was driven in part by the need to have a solid product of the programme in time for release at the IUHPE triennial conference. Indeed the hope was that such a volume might accompany each of the triennial conferences.</p>
<p>The monograph provided much needed assessment of evidence and the evaluation of effectiveness of health promotion in a global context. It also strove to include as many regional efforts in the programme. The monograph clearly introduced some areas to the concern of effectiveness that had not been there before and advocated the strengthening of the evidence base for broad areas such as urbanization; globalization; governance; peace building; and social determinants – areas that were only just emerging as critical in the health promotion field. To be sure, many of these areas could only advocate or call for the need for evidence in areas that were largely motivated by values and unexamined by any traditional evidence-seeking efforts. One thing is certain, the monograph clearly laid out a perspective that evidence gathering was highly contextual and without a clear methodological underpinning for its assessment in a field as ubiquitous as health promotion. At the same time it made clear that the nature of the assessment of evidence, effectiveness and evaluation was highly complicated and that health promotion had to draw on a broad set of methods from a wide set of disciplines. The much vaunted random controlled trial approach was found highly wanting in a field that had no luxuries of controls and experimental designs.</p>
<p>Early on in the production of the monograph it was clear to the editors that global coverage was lacking. At the beginning of the programme it was hoped that each of the regions of IUHPE, spanning the globe, would produce analyses of effectiveness in their regions. Instead this was only partly accomplished and the final assessment in the monograph was a unifying chapter by the programme leads from all the areas that summarised the state-of-the-art and up to date nature of the publication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913912442268">3</xref></sup> Headway was being made in many of the regions, but not headway that would yield comprehensive analyses of effectiveness in each region. Many regions had carried out workshops and meetings on effectiveness and there was definate activity, just not activity that would yield a comprehensive analysis of each region that could be included in Volume I. Thus the monograph remained largely a western and northern document despite the best laid plans of the programme. Nonetheless, there were subsequent efforts to address this deficit and where possible this effort will continue. A primary reason for this deficit lies with lack of funding, which will continue to mar efforts to achieve a comprehensive global perspective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1757913912442268">
<title>Some Critical Thoughts on Evidence, Effectiveness and Evaluation</title>
<p>In the monograph the argument was made that the above three words beginning with the letter ‘E’ are found commonly in the health promotion literature and while they have very different meanings, are often used together.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757913912442268">4</xref></sup> Regarding the field of health promotion, there is little hope to adequately define the words evidence, effectiveness and evaluation. This is not due to a lack of definitions, but rather that there are far too many definitions. As is often the case, the definitions given mostly illustrate the context in which the definer works. While we like to perceive these words as precise, they are in fact highly contextual and conceptual.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the programme efforts were made to distinguish the notion of effectiveness from evidence. Evidence is a strong word, deriving from a strong epistemological base, while at the same time it is rather limited because few causal situations in the real world of complexity can withstand the true rigours of ‘evidence’ in a scientific sense. Most cases of evidence are best left to the physical sciences; even there evidence is difficult in some areas, such as astrophysics. When entering the complexities of the human sciences of biology, medicine; sociology, anthropology; and psychology (to name a few), the rigorous expectations of evidence is most demanding and unforgiving.</p>
<p>Effectiveness, on the other hand, does not arise from a strong epistemological base. It is much more about translating knowledge into application. Sometimes that knowledge has an evidential base, but in many cases judgement plays a major role. Effectiveness is related to understanding change as opposed to the description of causation itself. In the GPHPE programme an underlying assumption was that we are interested in how to intervene in the causal process to stop, delay, maintain or accelerate the causal relationship. For example, if we have evidence that smoking may, with a definable probability, lead to lung disease, then as health promoters we want to intervene somewhere in that causal process. Effectiveness is concerned with our intervention’s ability to affect the causal pathway. It is easier to measure when the intervention is simple and the causal pathways well described. Smoking, by dint of much research over the years, has a well-defined causal pathway from production to puffing.</p>
<p>The programme never veered far from the broader concept of evaluation, which was much more in the comfort zone of most health promoters. In the second half of the 20th century, evaluation took on a strong scientific-based dimension in the natural and social sciences and created an industry of consultants and specialists in the many different forms of evaluation. Furthermore, there is almost an expectation that any programme or human effort should be evaluated. In the early 1990s a group of health promoters concerned with evaluation efforts in health promotion formed a working group that met for nearly ten years, producing a number of products, but chiefly resulting in a WHO publication on evaluation in health promotion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757913912442268">5</xref></sup> This was just one of the many groups globally that constituted organized efforts to discover evidence of effectiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757913912442268">6</xref></sup> Despite the accumulated literature, it would be incorrect to assume that this effort to assess evidence and effectiveness related to health promotion is anything near complete. That is why the GPHPE effort was undertaken by the IUHPE.</p>
<p>With regard to assessing evidence and effectiveness, complexity makes the effort extremely difficult. Several factors are pertinent. First, causal relationships that may indeed be operating in a complex situation cannot always be observed. The methodological skills to analytically model the true relationships either do not exist or may be inaccessible to most practitioners in the field. Second, few practitioners can imagine and/or construct a viable model of the complexity. Third, measurement of many important variables remains problematic. Those in health that deny complexity are a challenge for health promotion. Simplicity is easier to argue than complexity because: (1) cognitively, people want a single direct causal connection to an outcome; (2) most causal models are conceived of as linear with discrete interconnecting causes; and (3) traditionally, science tends to be reductionist in its relationship between theory and proof, stripping away complexity to understand the ‘true cause’. Further, the placement of health promotion institutionally has generally been in places with more traditional approaches to science and public health. Complexity is a real problem because it masks what many would like to understand as the real or main reasons why something happens. Further, there seems to be an innate need in people to understand precisely why something succeeds or fails. In short, simple answers are preferable for many. Unfortunately, in the real world of events simple explanations do not solve the complexity problem. Everything takes place in a context that is open to the impact and relationship of many variables. In many cases many of the variables are either poorly conceptualized or unknown.</p>
<p>What became very clear in the GPHPE is that some areas of health promotion cannot be discussed easily in terms of evidence. Many people, including world-recognised experts in health promotion, fall into the trap of stating, based on values and opinions, what would be effective rather than discussing how we could know what is effective. Certainly this is not unique to the field of health promotion, but it is exacerbated in health promotion because so many of the topical areas in the field are complex and value laden. This is illustrated by the fact that, despite the best efforts of programmes such as the GPHPE or others, such as the Community Guide, to provide solid answers as to what is effective, the outcome of many investigations is that there is ‘insufficient’ evidence to determine what the effectiveness is, if any. Hence it is compelling, in many cases, to fall back on beliefs and values as an evidentiary base.</p>

<title>Some Thoughts Arising From a Decade’s Work on the GPHPE</title>
<p>The notion of causality seems clear to some in the biomedical field. Its use is usually restricted to a probabilistic notion that if an ‘x’ precedes a ‘y’ and there is a high statistical correlation between ‘x’ and ‘y’ and if ‘y’ statistically occurs rarely in the absence of ‘x’, then causation is imputed. This basis in the hypothetico-deductive system of scientific explanation has been adhered to by many historically. Despite the comfort that some in biomedicine may feel, causality is a widely debated idea in the philosophy of science. Social science methods, both quantitative and qualitative, have addressed causality from a number of perspectives. Sociology, notably in the past decades, has devoted considerable effort to complex causal modelling, from multivariate techniques to graphical analyses. These approaches with their sophisticated statistics dovetail powerfully with probabilistic notions of causation that consider multiple interactions. Qualitative methodology, on the other hand, has been able to elaborate the many complicating interactions that mask true causal relations. Repeatability has been addressed in numerous ways by the social sciences, but most uniquely by concepts such as triangulation wherein the same data phenomena have been looked at through several competing methodologies to find explanations. Thus in addition to the notion of repeatability being simply the conduct of a similar experiment in another setting, it has also come to denote ‘repeated’ analyses on the same data.</p>
<p>Despite the elaborate and complicated discussion of causality, the notion of ‘evidence’ has moved on from any notion that there is an exact method to discover evidence. In particular, many in public health and health promotion have grown tired of continuing efforts to prove causation, which is obvious from years of research and observation. Many have grown tired of continuing work emanating from the well-known Institute of What We Already Know (IWWAK). We need to have evidence on how to translate what we know to public health action. That has been the mantra of the GPHPE and it will continue to be so.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1757913912442268">
<title>Evaluation of the Evaluation</title>
<p>Shortly after the monograph was published a very useful evaluation of the GPHPE appeared.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757913912442268">7</xref></sup> This analysis focused on the role of partnerships in the development and operation of the GPHPE. From the beginning, given the essential voluntary nature of the project, the programme depended on partnerships. This evaluation was, in fact, the very kind of evidence gathering that is necessary in health promotion. In assessing the strengths and weaknesses in the GPHPE and analysing them for the goals of the programme, the funds available and the communication with partners, the evaluation laid out some of the fundamental challenges to operating such a programme in an international NGO. It is exactly this kind of evaluation of effectiveness that we need more of if we are to comprehend fully what it means to deal with a complex problem in health promotion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1757913912442268">
<title>The Doldrums, But Some Later Success Stories</title>
<p>Following the release of the global monograph in 2007 the GPHPE lost energy. This was partly due to changes in the positions of those leading the programme, but largely because funding was becoming an increasing problem. There was, in short, very little money to finance any meetings, publications or efforts specifically to address the many challenges uncovered in the earlier years. The primary challenge was how to move beyond a western-based focus when considering evidence and effectiveness. The secondary challenge was opposition within the field of health promotion itself, which often resisted the ‘scientization’ of the field and perceived this area as outside the primary interest of health promotion. In addition, it was recognised that many in the IUHPE organization felt that the effectiveness work should best be taken up at the regional level. Nonetheless, the various regions of IUHPE had little or no resources for such an undertaking, in particular those poorer regions that most needed to develop their case of effective interventions. The efforts to produce Volume II of the global monograph did not bear fruit and the 2010 IUHPE World Conference in Geneva did not see a second monograph despite some concerted efforts to make it happen.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there were some success stories. In 2008 a book was published on health promotion evaluation practices in the Americas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757913912442268">8</xref></sup> Although not a direct product of the GPHPE, many of the key writers and contributors had been leaders in the GPHPE programme and their influence in the publication was clear. In this book the emphasis was on values and research in evaluation. The publication was an excellent example of the importance of the context of health promotion research and how the Americas, notably Latin America, deal with the translation of knowledge to effective health promotion practices.</p>
<p>In 2009, under the auspices of the GPHPE and with the partnership of the African Institute for Health and Development, a book on the evidence of health promotion effectiveness in Africa was published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757913912442268">9</xref></sup> This was a watershed for the GPHPE and the African region. For many in the West and North, this region’s work in health promotion was little known yet here was a publication dealing with evidence and effectiveness. It was clear from the content that the GPHPE had given guidance on what was vital in assessing evidence and effectiveness. The chapters, written primarily by health promotion leaders on the continent, addressed ideas such as context, methods and database creation – some of the very fundamentals addressed in the GPHPE. Furthermore, the book addressed the soon-to-be-hot area of social determinants as well as issues of the urban poor. It was up to date and helped to reposition health promotion in Africa and increase its visibility in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>In March 2011 the IUHPE journal <italic>Global Health Promotion</italic> published a special issue on the GPHPE entitled ‘What is the effectiveness of using evidence?’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757913912442268">10</xref></sup> This issue addressed many of the critical questions that have arisen in the GPHPE and then presented 26 case studies from across the globe to illustrate how the current understanding of effectiveness has emerged and been treated in various contexts.</p>
<p>In sum, the GPHPE has continued to have an influence, if sometimes less directly, because of its commitment to making the case for evidence of effectiveness in multiple contexts. What distinguishes its work to date has been the reliance on definitions of effectiveness that stem from practitioners who are working in the field, while at the same time having a high degree of theoretical and methodological integrity in the pursuit of how to best define evidence and effectiveness for the field of health promotion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, efforts to produce further publications as well as a second monograph have not been abandoned. A brainstorming meeting was held in Atlanta in 2008 to explore in depth the possibilities for the content and publication of Volume II on effectiveness. Part of the discussions led to the publication of the special issue mentioned above. However, much of the conversation was on how to link the GPHPE to the global working groups in IUHPE, notably those on salutogenesis, social determinants of health, surveillance, school settings and advocacy. Also links to other review groups were considered. Most notably there was considerable interest in the problem of the insufficient evidence that was arising in many groups concerned with evidence from around the world and the implications for health promotion actions in such cases. Clearly many new concerns for the content of Volume II were being put forward. One thing was certain, there were many critical issues arising, but the problem of funding also remained. Given emerging economic problems globally, there would undoubtedly be dwindling resources. What has happened globally since then has reinforced the fact that we can probably not easily move forward until the global financial situation has improved. We have many good ideas waiting. Since that meeting and many subsequent emails and conversations among the participants from the Atlanta meeting and many others affiliated with the GPHPE, there have been efforts to put together a viable second monograph. At this time alternatives are being explored with a publisher.</p>

<sec id="section7-1757913912442268" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The management of a volunteer programme such as the GPHPE is not easy. Based on a decade of effort carrying out the programme, there are five key points to stress. First, not only is there little global capacity to carry out such a programme, there is also the need to build global capacity at the same time. One can see this as a resource problem, both in terms of people and financial resources. In a field that is limited by both types of resources, one has to consider how vital it is to build capacity for this type of work. Second, a wide array of partners has both advantages and disadvantages. One advantage is buy-in across a number of sectors, but a major disadvantage is in working with what is a mixture of interest and competence to work in this area. Third, a truly ‘global’ programme is almost impossible to maintain for many reasons. There is no unified ‘global’ consensus on how to approach effectiveness. Certainly there are wide differences in capacity, ability and understanding across regions. Fourth, there is the general question of how important the problem of effectiveness is to those working in health promotion or indeed those in public health. Many in the field recognise that many decisions on interventions are taken by agencies with only lip service or scant reference paid to ‘evidence’. Perhaps the ‘evidence-based’ quest has run its course. Finally, the work in this area is significantly affected by the ‘definition’ problem. That is, what is the definition of health promotion and what is the definition of ‘evidence’. So the question of what is being evaluated for effectiveness is salient, as is the question of what constitutes ‘evidence’ or effectiveness. In a field led by principles and values, effectiveness may be only a secondary concern.</p>
