<p>For nursing faculty who work at research-oriented institutions, finding adequate time to do research can be a challenge. Research requires a sustained effort that includes uninterrupted time for writing. Finding adequate time for research in the face of pressing teaching deadlines and committee duties requires that individuals have the ability to make efficient use of time. Enhancing research productivity through effective time management is the subject of the <italic>WJNR</italic> editorial board special paper in this issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945912463871">Chase et al., 2013</xref>). Our board members provide their perspectives and advice on how individuals faced with myriad academic responsibilities can work more efficiently so that their research is not given short shrift.</p>
<p>Although individuals must take personal responsibility for the success of their research programs, the leadership within academic units—administrators and faculty leaders—can also have a powerful impact on increasing faculty research productivity. They can do so by creating a workplace in which efficient use of time is encouraged and rewarded and also by finding ways to reduce or redistribute faculty teaching and service workloads.</p>
<p>Leadership to promote effective time management begins in the hiring phase. The most attractive faculty candidates will be skilled not only in research but also in effective time management. Often a candidate’s doctoral education trajectory will provide evidence for both. Research activities completed outside of course requirement can be good indicators of a candidate’s capacity to work efficiently. The time required to complete the dissertation itself in the context of concurrent paid employment may be informative but should be interpreted cautiously across candidates, given the great variations in the nature of dissertation research.</p>
<p>Leadership can facilitate effective time management by carefully selecting mentors for junior faculty. Junior faculty are often paired with senior faculty solely on the basis of shared substantive areas of research. However, also matching them with senior faculty who have a record of outstanding research productivity may show them how to more effectively sustain the research programs they are building.</p>
<p>Another method leaders can use to assist faculty in using their time more effectively is to have a mechanism for research accountability. Faculty can be required to submit a research plan that delineates their planned accomplishments for the year. These annual plans, which are reviewed and approved by the department chair or faculty member appointed to oversee research activities, can include information about ongoing projects, grant submissions, manuscripts, scientific presentations, and the like. The plan can then be used as a reference point for assessing research productivity during annual faculty evaluations.</p>
<p>Along with the annual research plan, having an academic unit workload policy that outlines typical faculty workload distributions and includes concrete expectations regarding research activity can give faculty a clear idea of what is expected of them. Such a policy can also stipulate assignment changes for faculty with persistent insufficient research productivity.</p>
<p>Effective leaders not just address faculty low productivity but they also reward high productivity. Rewards can include merit-based raises, desirable teaching assignments, or nominations for local, regional, and national awards. Academic units that treat faculty identically regardless of research productivity are missing an important opportunity to positively reinforce productive faculty.</p>
<p>In allocating faculty time across teaching and research, academic leaders who expect faculty with research responsibilities to carry a teaching load identical to faculty hired as full-time instructors can also count on limited research output. Research-oriented units should ideally give research faculty half the teaching load of nonresearch faculty. This load can be reduced further as circumstances require, say for new faculty just starting their research programs or at critical phases of senior faculty programs such as semesters when a major grant proposal is due. Some leaders may believe they can achieve some research productivity with little time allocated to research. This may not be effective because there may be a critical mass of time which must be devoted to research to build and maintain research activities.</p>
<p>The nursing identity seems to include the sense that nurses must do it all and know it all. As a consequence, the number of courses and course requirements for the nursing degree tends to creep upward over time. Although education must continue to be a central mission of schools of nursing, the increasing demands on faculty to teach a burgeoning number of requirements within courses and additional courses will inevitably affect time available for research. Periodic serious examination of the nursing curriculum is important for faculty and students alike. Fewer requirements will lessen faculty teaching loads, translating into more time for research. Winnowing requirements to the most vital content will produce graduates more able to focus on key components of nursing care with less unnecessary anxiety.</p>
<p>Beyond the sheer numbers of courses taught, the content of specific courses can also affect faculty research productivity. Faculty members assigned brand new courses or existing courses that they have never taught before perforce will have to spend more time on preparation. Rotation of courses among faculty does help infuse new ideas and prevent “ownership” of courses. However, excessive churning of teaching assignments will inevitably reduce time for research as well as prevent instructors from making improvements in course content.</p>
<p>Another strategy is to assign faculty courses that are related to their area of research emphasis. To the extent that leadership can facilitate congruence between what faculty members teach and what they research will serve to enhance course quality and research productivity. Similarly, congruence between faculty research focus and PhD student research interests can affect time available for research. With the explosion of DNP programs and increasing student enrollment in these programs, research productivity can also be threatened if PhD-prepared faculty are expected to supervise DNP student capstone projects. Not only does this cut into faculty research time but also undermines the DNP students’ educational experience because PhD-prepared faculty may expect dissertation-like capstone projects. Appropriate leadership in schools with PhD and DNP programs will assign DNP students to DNP faculty.</p>
<p>Just as courses tend to proliferate, so do the number of committees on which faculty may be expected to serve. Leadership sensitive to the burden committee work imposes on faculty time will develop strategies to ensure committees function in a time-efficient manner. One strategy is to appoint committee chairs who are action-focused, avoiding individuals who hinder decision making because they waste time on excessive discussions of process. Providing committee chairs with workshops or other learning opportunities to develop leadership skills will also result in more productive meetings.</p>
<p>Periodic assessments of the purpose and membership of committees will help minimize the number of committees faculty are required to serve on. For those committees in which a research expertise is not necessary, assignments can be shifted to nonresearch faculty. Finally, relinquishing membership on those campus-wide committees where a nursing presence is not essential can reduce service burden.</p>
<p>Nursing historically has had an uneasy relationship with task delegation. The tendency has been to assume that a professional nurse must perform every activity. This is reflected in nursing education in which nurse faculty perform many activities—including even clerical duties—that could readily be delegated to non-nurses. The nursing faculty shortage will likely force employment of non-nurses such that faculty will end up devoting more time to activities that do require nursing expertise. Careful selection of non-nursing staff with expertise in specific areas of need may actually improve the quality of nursing education overall.</p>
<p>Except in rare circumstances, most schools of nursing cannot simply hire more faculty to spread the work around. It therefore behooves school leaders to implement strategies like the ones discussed here to prevent faculty from being so overburdened that research suffers. Schools in which the leadership is sensitive to faculty time as a limited resource will be more likely to reap the reward of higher research productivity.</p>
