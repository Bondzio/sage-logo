<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prostate cancer is the commonest cancer in men and a major health issue worldwide. Screening for early disease has been available for many years, but there is still no national screening programme established in the United Kingdom.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0036933013482631">
<title>Objective</title>
<p>To assess the latest evidence regarding prostate cancer screening and whether it meets the necessary requirements to be established as a national programme for all men.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0036933013482631">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Electronic databases and library catalogues were searched electronically and manual retrieval was performed. Only primary research results were used for the analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0036933013482631">
<title>Results</title>
<p>In recent years, several important randomised controlled trials have produced varied outcomes. In Europe the largest study thus far concluded that screening reduced prostate cancer mortality by 20%. On the contrary, a large American trial found no reduction in mortality after 7–10 years follow-up. Most studies comment on the adverse effects of screening – principally those of overdiagnosis and subsequent overtreatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0036933013482631">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Further information about the natural history of prostate cancer and accuracy of screening is needed before a screening programme can be truly justified. In the interim, doctors and patients should discuss the risks, benefits and sequelae of taking part in voluntary screening for prostate cancer.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0036933013482631" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prostate cancer is the commonest cancer in men, with the third highest cancer death rate globally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0036933013482631">1</xref></sup> Screening for prostate cancer initially consists of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serum testing and a digital rectal examination (DRE). Further radiological and invasive investigations such as prostate biopsy will be usually performed if prostate cancer is suggested clinically.</p>
<p>PSA is a serine protease glycoprotein produced by the prostate gland and is present in increased concentrations with both benign and malignant prostate disorders.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0036933013482631"><title>Objective</title>
<p>To consider whether a national screening programme for prostate cancer is justified based on current evidence and the effect it has on patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0036933013482631" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>Electronic databases including MEDLINE, CENTRAL, PUBMED and the Aberdeen University Library Catalogue were searched with the keywords: prostate, cancer, PSA, screening, DRE, prevention, value, randomised control trial, RCT.</p>
<p>Results were limited to human males and those available for download. Some journals and bibliographies of relevant reviews were also hand searched.</p>
<p>Four randomised control trials (RCT) were identified as the most significant and relevant; three were then critically appraised using the SIGN Methodology Checklist for RCT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0036933013482631">2</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0036933013482631" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Any screening programme must be well supported by reliable data according to the Wilson and Jungner criteria of 1968.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0036933013482631">3</xref></sup> With an incidence rate of 214 cases per 1000 men<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0036933013482631">4</xref></sup> and predicted to rise due to an aging population,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0036933013482631">5</xref></sup> prostate cancer is an important health problem. However, when considering the other criteria for a screening programme prostate cancer itself is not ideal as the natural history, reliability of early detection and treatment are still all under much debate by healthcare professionals and organisations around the world and therefore cannot yet be considered well understood. Furthermore, prostate cancer is one of the only cancers where at an early stage the most appropriate treatment may just be watchful waiting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0036933013482631">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since PSA screening initially started in 1987, it has been widely tested in the United States during routine medicals for older males<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0036933013482631">7</xref></sup> and is actually recommended by the American Urological Society after the age of 50 or earlier for ‘at-risk’ groups of men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0036933013482631">8</xref></sup> However, it has not had such a great uptake in other parts of the world. The current European Association of Urology (EUA) guidelines state that there is no absolute proof that prostate cancer screening leads to a reduction in mortality from prostate cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0036933013482631">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Prostate cancer screening is thus highly controversial. New evidence is being published regularly, and recently two large RCTs have published interim results providing some more substantial data to add to the debate.</p>
<sec id="sec5-0036933013482631"><title>Screening methods</title>
<p>Prostate screening will normally involve serum PSA checking and DRE.</p>
<p>A normal serum PSA level is defined as being 4.0 ng/mL or lower by most assay manufacturers, using this value the sensitivity of PSA screening ranges from 47% to 72% and specificity from 44% to 91%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0036933013482631">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Results from a screening trial which evaluated screening by DRE alone showed a sensitivity of 58%, specificity of 96% and a positive predictive value of only 20%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0036933013482631">10</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0036933013482631"><title>Studies justifying prostate cancer screening</title>
<p>Two RCTs were identified which reported positive results from prostate cancer screening trials. The first, carried out between 1988 and 1996, was reported in 1999<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0036933013482631">11</xref></sup> and included all (<italic>n</italic> = 46,193) men aged 45–80 on the electoral rolls in the Canadian city of Quebec, who were stratified by age and residential area. This may have introduced selection bias. The study excluded any men with a previous diagnosis or those referred with a suspicion of prostate cancer, and no public announcement about the study was made. Men were assigned to the screened or unscreened groups on a 2:1 ratio to try and compensate for the predicted lower uptake of screening, the actual response to invitation was even worse than predicted at only 15.7% of those invited. For most men, screening was defined as a yearly PSA measurement and DRE. If the PSA level was greater than 3.0 ng/mL initially or on follow-up or had increased by more than 20% since the last result, a TRUS-guided prostate was performed. An abnormal DRE was also an indication for TRUS biopsy, with the only exceptions being the first 1002 men who received a TRUS regardless of the other results. The report writers argued that by choosing the PSA cut-off level to be 3.0 ng/mL rather than 4.0 (the recommended level), up to an extra 18% of the smaller cancers were identified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0036933013482631">11</xref></sup> The primary end point was death from prostate cancer. As data were collected from the Death Registry the rate of diagnosis in the unscreened group was not recorded, which would have been worth comparing to that of the screened group to evaluate over diagnosis. Blinding of the assessors does not appear to have taken place, which increases the risk of bias, it was obviously not possible to blind the participants which is the case with all such screening trials. A major flaw standing out in this study is the high rate of crossover and contamination between groups and a lack of intention-to-screen analysis in the report, which is essential for screening trials. Of those invited to screening only 23.6% actually were screened. In total 7.3% of the control group were known to have been screened but this will be an underestimate. The main finding of the trial was a 67.1% decrease in the death rate of the screened group compared to the unscreened group (13.7 deaths per 100,000 man years compared to 41.6, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02). On the first screen, prostate cancer prevalence was 3.00% and then 0.52% on average for the remaining 8 years of follow-up; furthermore, during the follow-up period not one of the cancers detected had reached a metastatic stage as a result of the regular screening.</p>
<p>The second RCT which comes out in support of screening is the largest (<italic>n</italic> = 182,000) to date with men from seven different countries involved. Published in 2009 the European Randomised study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0036933013482631">12</xref></sup> ran from 1991 to the end of 2006. PSA measurement with a 3.0 ng/mL cutoff without DRE was used in most countries. Men were randomised from population lists and assigned to either group without any stratification; the full age range was from 50 to 75 – although most participants were aged 55 to 69. The primary outcome was the rate of death from prostate cancer, blinding of outcome assessors also took place.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis took place on the intention-to-screen principle. Compliance within the screening group was better than the QUEBEC trial at 82%, but had a higher contamination of the control group at 20%. The study fails to explain how contamination was evaluated so could potentially be substantially greater. The cumulative incidence of prostate cancer was 8.2% in the screening and 4.8% in the control group. As in the QUEBEC trial, cancers were detected at an earlier stage with only 27.8% in the screened group being detected at a Gleason score of 7 or more (on a scale of 2–10) compared to 45.2% in the control group. The ERSPC authors reported the number needed to screen to prevent one prostate cancer death was 1410 (95% CI 1142–1721) with an average of 1.7 screens within 9 years. It is possible that the lower frequency of follow-up encouraged more men to take part in the screening group compared to the poor numbers in QUEBEC, although it does seem to have impacted on the numbers picked up on screening compared to the QUEBEC trial. There were many (mainly minor) differences between screening protocols at each study centre leading to potential statistical bias due to the differing sizes of groups in each centre. For example, Sweden screened every 2 years and included men aged 50–69 diagnosed prostate cancer in 11.8% of their subjects whereas Italy included the older men aged 55–75 and screened every 4 years with a positive PSA cutoff for biopsy at 4.0 ng/ml diagnosed only 3.9% of their screening group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0036933013482631"><title>Studies finding no evidence for prostate screening</title>
<p>Again two RCTs have been selected which have reported no positive effect of prostate cancer screening. The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0036933013482631">13</xref></sup> reported in March 2009 that the difference in death rate between the screened and unscreened arm of their trial did not significantly differ. Between 1993 and 2001, 76,693 men at 10 American centres were randomised 1:1, stratified according to centre and age, into a screening or usual care (control) group and have so far been followed up for a median of 11 years with annual serum PSA tests and DRE as well as screening for lung and colon cancer. Entry to this trial was stricter than others as nobody with a history of any PLCO cancers was allowed to take part and from 1995 onwards men were excluded if they had a PSA test done within the past 3 years. When a positive DRE or PSA (&gt;4.0 ng/mL) result was recorded men were advised to seek further diagnostic evaluation from their own doctor who would perform a TRUS or other investigations as necessary and give subsequent treatment, this ensured that the care received by each patient in the screened and control arms was the same. Contamination was closely monitored using yearly surveys for 1% of the screening group, a new 1% was surveyed each year giving an estimated contamination of up to 52% by the sixth year although at all points the screening rate was higher in the screened group. This high contamination rate could be one of the reasons for the negative findings, for several reasons in America PSA screening is more widespread than Europe with one trial reporting 49% of general male population aged 50–79 having had a screen within the past 2 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0036933013482631">14</xref></sup> Subjects were surveyed annually for this information and chased up if no reply was received and additionally the American National Death Index and death certificates were used, although 10% had been lost to follow-up after 10 years. Reviewers, blinded to group assignment, recorded and reviewed deaths using an end point adjudication process to minimise bias. At 10 years when 67% had completed their full follow-up (PSA for 6 years and DRE for 4) 9.00% (<italic>n</italic> = 3452) of the screened group had been diagnosed with cancer compared to 7.75% (<italic>n</italic> = 2974) from the control group (rate ratio, 1.17; 95% CI 1.11–1.22), a 22% increase in diagnosis. Possible reasons for this include the higher frequency of screening, contamination or selection bias due to baseline screening, which could account for the higher rate in the control group.</p>
<p>A further RCT, with no evidence of beneficial effects from screening, was also published in 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0036933013482631">15</xref></sup> Based on the men in the catchment of Stockholm South Hospital (<italic>n</italic> = 27,204), it is the longest running trial considered in this article – running for 15 years between 1988 and 2003. Screening was a one-off DRE, PSA and TRUS with a biopsy for abnormal DRE or TRUS results and a repeat TRUS for PSA results of more than 7 ng/mL. Although by far the smallest study considered it had a very thorough initial cancer detection screen. With a median follow-up of 12.9 years, 2.23% (<italic>n</italic> = 53) of the screened group and 2.04% (<italic>n</italic> = 506) in the control group died from prostate cancer. Interestingly, the screening invited non-attendee group incurred a higher incidence of prostate cancer compared to both the screened and uninvited control group, as well as a higher mortality rate overall. This observation may suggest that those who are at most need of screening are the ones who will not volunteer, and those with greater comorbidities – the overall survival rate of screening attendees was 89% higher than non-attendees. The results of this study not only add to the argument against prostate cancer screening for reasons of harm and inaccuracy as in the PLCO trial, but should also be remembered when considering other studies that do not report on the difference between those who do and do not attend after invited for screening.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0036933013482631" sec-type="discussion|conclusion"><title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>It is only relatively recently that large-scale RCT results have been available, with the publication of the PLCO and ERSPC trials. While contradictory in their results regarding the effect of screening on mortality, they are able to agree that not enough is known about false positives and false negatives, which can cause harm to patients. The UK National Screening Committee has also reviewed the available evidence and advises against mass screening for prostate cancer. It emphasises the need for discussion with patients who request PSA testing and subsequent implications of elevated results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0036933013482631">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Overall, follow-up frequency does not appear to affect the overall results as the QUEBEC and PLCO study followed up annually compared to every 4 years by most centres in the ERSPC trial and the one-off screening in Stockholm. Lead time for most prostate cancers is thought to be in the region of 5–10 years; however, this is shorter for more aggressive cancers which arguably are the ones that need to be picked up on screening to allow earlier potentially curative treatment.</p>
<p>Prostate cancer overdiagnosis and overtreatment carries a high risk of serious impact on quality of life, with incontinence, impotence and hormonal side effects being some of the more common complications of treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0036933013482631">17</xref></sup> Some recent data from the Finnish ERSPC centre reveal that 12.5% of all screened men had at least one false positive result and were up to twice as likely not to agree to participate in subsequent screening – clearly demonstrating the negative psychological effect a false positive has on a patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0036933013482631">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Quality of life issues are often underestimated. If mortality is not affected by screening then some men may rather have had more time to live in ignorance of their cancer than having an early diagnosis made. Given the long lead time prostate cancer may never even cause symptoms, and other comorbidities may even be more likely to be responsible for death during that pre-clinical phase.</p>
<p>Prostate cancer screening still requires a more solid evidence base before a final decision can be made regarding the introduction of a national screening programme in the United Kingdom. Although it was hoped that the PLCO and ERSPC trials would give clear guidance on this matter, they have further highlighted that at this stage we are unable to say with confidence that such a programme is justified, particularly in these times of NHS financial hardship.</p>
<p>Overall the results presented above paint a mixed and often unclear picture, and without consistent comprehensive evidence proving the efficacy of prostate screening a nationwide prostate cancer screening programme cannot be justified currently. As new trials report further data, this situation may hopefully improve, but still promises to be a very controversial topic among men, doctors and politicians for many years to come. As clinicians, we should focus on providing high-quality information to men who request prostate cancer screening enabling them to take informed, autonomous decisions.</p>
