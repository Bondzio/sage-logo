<abstract>
<p>Tata Nano has rewritten the evolution of transport by creating history as the world’s cheapest car. The creation of Tata Nano is a result of innovation leading to new market creation to tap latent opportunities lying at the bottom of the pyramid in the automobile, four-wheeler segment. This is the turnaround story of Tata Nano which focuses on how the initial strategies for launching and positioning backfired, leading to attraction of the wrong segment towards the car. There were instances that made people lose their interest and trust in Nano resulting into its nose-diving sales. The case highlights how Tata Motors Ltd. recognized its shortcomings and mistakes that led to the rejection of Nano among the segment it was created for. It revamped its strategies keeping in mind only its targeted segment that is the bottom of the pyramid. Thereafter it bounced back to win the trust of its prospective customers and is presently on a path-breaking journey to win sales.</p>
