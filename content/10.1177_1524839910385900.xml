<abstract>
<p>This article assessed the relationship between breast and cervical cancer screening rates and health beliefs in African American women participating in Witness Project of Harlem (WPH) education sessions. WPH is a culturally sensitive, faith-based breast and cervical cancer screening education program targeting African American women in medically underserved New York City communities. A questionnaire administered to women participating for the first time in a Witness Project education session collected demographics, adherence to breast and cervical cancer screening, and information about health beliefs related to cancer worry, medical mistrust, and religious faith. Screening adherence guidelines applied were as per the American Cancer Society recommendations. No statistically significant relationship was found between worry about getting breast or cervical cancer and screening adherence, or between screening adherence and agreement with statements about medical mistrust and religious beliefs. The low screening mammography and monthly breast self-exam rates emphasize the utility of programs like WPH that teach the importance of screening mammography and breast self-exam and point to the need for increased access to quality health care and cancer screening in underserved populations.</p>

<p>Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and second most common cause of cancer death in the United States. It was expected that 192,370 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839910385900">American Cancer Society [ACS], 2009</xref>) and 40,170 breast cancer–related deaths were expected in women in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839910385900">ACS, 2007</xref>). Cervical cancer is less common, with an estimated 11,270 new cases of invasive cervical cancer and 4,070 expected cervical cancer–related deaths in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839910385900">ACS, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839910385900">2007</xref>). Although cervical cancer causes fewer deaths in the United States, it is similar to breast cancer in that both cancers have disproportionately higher mortality rates in African American women than in White women. During 2000 to 2003, African American women had a 36% higher breast cancer mortality rate than White women. For example, the age-adjusted breast cancer mortality rate for African American women younger than age 40 years was double the rate for White women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839910385900">Baquet, Mishra, Commiskey, Ellison, &amp; DeShields, 2008</xref>) and from 2000 to 2005, African American women were twice as likely as White women to die from cervical cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839910385900">Ries et al., 2008</xref>). It is important to note that since 1990, breast cancer mortality for both African American and White women has been declining slowly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839910385900">Ries et al., 2008</xref>), partially associated with the use of screening mammography, which allows for detection of cancers at an earlier and more treatable stage. Through this pathway, the use of screening mammography contributes to a reduction in breast cancer mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839910385900">Elmore, Armstrong, Lehman, &amp; Fletcher, 2005</xref>). Since 1975, cervical cancer mortality has also been decreasing for both African American and White women, again partially attributed to the Papanicolaou (PAP) test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839910385900">Saslow et al., 2002</xref>) and early detection of cancer or precancerous conditions.</p>
<p>Despite the overall gains in survival, 5-year relative survival rates for breast and cervical cancer show that African American women continue to fare more poorly than White women. For the years 1996 to 2004, the 5-year relative breast cancer survival rate for all stages for African American women was 77% compared to 90% for White women; the 5-year relative cervical cancer survival rate for African American women was 62% compared to 73% survival for White women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839910385900">Ries et al., 2008</xref>). Controlling for tumor severity, biology, and stage at diagnosis does not eliminate survival disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839910385900">Curtis, Quale, Haggstrorn, &amp; Smith-Bindman, 2008</xref>) or mortality disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839910385900">Li, Malone, &amp; Daling, 2003</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1524839910385900">
<title>Background/Literature Review</title>
<p>A meta-analysis of eight randomized trials examining the efficacy of mammography demonstrate that screening mammography decreases breast cancer mortality by 20% to 35% in women aged 50 to 69 years and slightly less in women aged 40 to 49 years at 14 years of follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839910385900">Elmore et al., 2005</xref>). In addition to inequities in incidence, mortality, and survival, disparities persist in screening rates for breast cancer among African American women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839910385900">Adams, Breen, &amp; Joski, 2007</xref>). Racial and ethnic disparities in health care have been shown to persist after controlling for socioeconomic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839910385900">Smedley, Stith, &amp; Nelson, 2003</xref>). Factors that may contribute to disparities include cultural differences between patients and providers, personal health beliefs, religious beliefs, language barriers, mistrust or misunderstanding of the health care system, lack of health insurance, provider bias, prejudice, and stereotyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839910385900">Kinney, Emery, Dudley, &amp; Croyle, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839910385900">Klassen, Smith, &amp; Shariff-Marco, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839910385900">Smedley et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of this study focus on cancer worry, spirituality, and medical mistrust among African American women. These items were chosen for study because they appear frequently in literature examining barriers to health care for African Americans. Many studies report high levels of medical mistrust in African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839910385900">LaVeist, Nickerson, &amp; Bowie, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839910385900">Matthews, Sellergren, Manfredi, &amp; William, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839910385900">Thompson, Valdimarsdottir, Winkel, Jandorf, &amp; Redd, 2004</xref>). Medical mistrust is significant in the context of this study as it may lead to reduced cancer screening participation. A study investigating the Group-Based Medical Mistrust Scale (GBMMS) and breast cancer screening found that African American and Latina women who were nonadherent and had never been screened or had long-term screening lapses had higher GBMMS scores compared to women who were nonadherent but had been screened in the past (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>Another study found that African American patients were significantly more likely than White patients to feel that racial disparities were present in the way doctors and hospitals treat African American versus White patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839910385900">LaVeist et al., 2000</xref>). Suspicion toward medical doctors’ motivations and mistrust of medical doctors and the medical field has been identified as a barrier to the seeking of medical care among African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839910385900">Matthews et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Among African Americans, strong cancer-related worry in this population may represent a barrier to seeking health information, care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839910385900">Matthews et al., 2002</xref>), and screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839910385900">Powe &amp; Johnson, 1995</xref>), and African American women have been found to be more likely than Whites or Hispanics to report cancer worry as a barrier to mammography. Cancer worry and fear appear to pose a barrier to cancer screening in African American women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839910385900">Consedine, Magai, Krivoshekova, Ryzewicz, &amp; Neugut, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839910385900">Miller &amp; Hailey, 2004</xref>) and unscreened African American women reported a higher mean fear of cancer than screened women in one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839910385900">Cronan et al., 2008</xref>). Other studies, however, have suggested the opposite: that cancer worry has a positive influence on screening behaviors in African American women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839910385900">Consedine, Magai, &amp; Neugut, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839910385900">McCaul, Branstetter, O’Donnell, Jacobson, &amp; Quinlan, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Religious belief, though felt to be an important coping mechanism among many African Americans, may also be a barrier to seeking health care in African Americans patients who eschew taking control of their medical care in favor of faith in the ability of God to handle medical problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910385900">Holt, Clark, Kreuter, &amp; Rubio, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839910385900">Matthews et al., 2002</xref>). Belief in God also appears to be associated with decreased mammography and clinical breast exam adherence among African American women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839910385900">Kinney et al., 2002</xref>). A recent study, however, found that religiosity predicts a positive association with adherence to screening mammography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524839910385900">Steele-Moses et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The challenge of increasing cancer screening rates among minority populations is very important because prevention is central to reducing morbidity and mortality. Cultural beliefs and attitudes as discussed above must be taken into account when considering approaches to increasing cancer screening in African American women. This article reports the results of an intake survey for the Witness Project of Harlem© (WPH), a faith-based, culturally competent breast and cervical cancer education program targeting African American women in medically underserved communities. The purpose of the survey is to assess the breast and cervical cancer screening adherence rates among WPH participants and examine the relationship of screening to the health beliefs of African American women.</p>

<title>Method, Strategies, and Intervention Applications</title>
<sec id="section4-1524839910385900">
<title>Intervention Design</title>
<p>Originally designed as an educational intervention in response to the low breast cancer screening rates and high breast cancer mortality rates among African American women in rural Arkansas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839910385900">Bailey, Erwin, &amp; Belin, 2000</xref>), the Witness Project now operates nationally, in more than 20 locations throughout the United States. The goal of the Witness Project is to reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by breast and cervical cancer in African American women by promoting awareness, knowledge, and motivation for early detection and screening behaviors. Witness Project education sessions take place at local churches and community gathering places. The Witness Project model incorporates the use of local African American breast and cervical cancer survivors, who serve as witness role models (WRMs) and share their personal experience with cancer. The WRMs deliver the message that early detection and prompt treatment play an important role in their positive outcome within a spiritual context. WRMs also address fatalism toward and fear of cancer by serving as direct evidence that survival after cancer diagnosis is possible. Lay health advisers (LHAs) then teach the participants the proper method for breast self-examination with ethnic breast models, disseminate information about breast and cervical cancer screening guidelines, and link participants to cancer screening services and resources in the community. This intervention has been shown to be effective in reaching African American women who have been difficult to reach with other educational methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910385900">Erwin et al., 2003</xref>). Women who participated in Witness Project programs were shown to have had significant increases in mammography and breast self-examination compared with women who did not participate in Witness Project programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839910385900">Bailey et al., 2000</xref>). Following national implementation of the Witness Project, data from eight new project sites showed a 43.4% increase in screening mammography in women older than age 40 years who were previously unscreened or underscreened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910385900">Erwin et al., 2003</xref>). In 2000, the WPH was established, through the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1524839910385900">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>From July 2001 to January 2008, approximately 2,700 women participated in the program in 129 education sessions and 1,369 women completed the optional questionnaire (throughout the New York City area). Of these, 946 women were African American, 211 were Afro-Caribbean/West Indian, 30 were Hispanic, 130 were Caucasian, and 28 reported their ethnicity as Other. The goal of the current study is to report the findings and assess breast and cervical cancer screening adherence among the WPH attendees, as well as health beliefs that may influence adherence among African American women. Thus, we examined the data from the 946 African American women only.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1524839910385900">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>As part of the WPH programs, women were asked to fill out a brief questionnaire, capturing their age (within six categories), race/ethnicity, and current screening practices. Seventy of the 129 education sessions were held at 59 different New York City churches, and the remainder were conducted at a variety of community centers and private organizations, including public libraries, nursing homes, hospitals, and schools. The sessions were coordinated by WPH staff based in the Mount Sinai School of Medicine’s Department of Oncological Sciences and were led by LHAs and WRMs trained by the WPH. During each program session, the LHA encouraged participants to complete the questionnaire, which was presented as a voluntary research component of the program. IRB approval, with a waiver of signed consent, was received.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1524839910385900">
<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section8-1524839910385900">
<title>Breast and cervical cancer screening adherence</title>
<p>Cancer screening adherence was categorized as adherent or nonadherent to screening based on recommendations by the ACS. The ACS recommends that women at average risk for developing breast cancer begin annual mammography at age 40 years and have a clinical breast exam annually and that women in their 20s and 30s have a clinical breast exam at least every 3 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839910385900">Smith et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, women age 40 and older who reported undergoing screening mammography and clinical breast exam once a year were categorized as adherent as were women in their 20s and 30s who reported undergoing clinical breast exam at least every 3 years. At the time the data were collected, the ACS recommended monthly breast self-examination (BSE). Although the ACS dropped BSE as part of their standard breast cancer screening recommendations, sources still suggest that BSE may help some women detect changes in their breasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839910385900">Smith et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, in the current study, women who reported performing BSE monthly were categorized as adherent whereas those who underpracticed or overpracticed BSE were categorized as nonadherent.</p>
<p>For cervical cancer, the ACS recommends that screening by Pap test begin 3 years after the onset of vaginal intercourse and no later than 21 years of age and that screening should be done every year with the regular Pap test or every 2 years using the newer liquid-based Pap test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839910385900">Saslow et al., 2002</xref>). New ACS guidelines on cervical cancer screening are much more complex, but because the WPH began collecting data before the new guidelines were in place, we will categorize all women who reported having a Pap test within the past 2 years as adherent to Pap test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1524839910385900">
<title>Breast and cervical cancer worry</title>
<p>For worry, participants responded on a 4-point scale (<italic>not at all worried, a little worried, somewhat worried, very worried</italic>) to the questions “When you think about getting breast cancer, how worried do you get?’ and “When you think about getting cervical cancer, how worried do you get?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524839910385900">Vernon, Myers, &amp; Tilley, 1997</xref>). For data analyses, the above responses were divided into two categories: <italic>not at all worried/a little worried</italic> and <italic>somewhat worried/very worried</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1524839910385900">
<title>Medical mistrust</title>
<p>Regarding medical mistrust, the statement is “People of my ethnic group should be suspicious of modern medicine.” This statement is one of 12 items included in the GBMMS, which measures suspicion of health care systems and health care professionals and treatments provided to individuals of the respondent’s racial or ethnic group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839910385900">Thompson et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1524839910385900">
<title>Spirituality</title>
<p>To measure health and faith, women were asked to respond to a single item “I rely on God to keep me in good health” from Holt’s Spiritual Health Locus of Control scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910385900">Holt et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The response key for the spirituality and medical mistrust measures was a Likert-type scale with responses ranging from <italic>strongly disagree, disagree</italic>, and <italic>agree</italic> to <italic>strongly agree</italic>. For data analyses, the above responses were divided into two categories: <italic>strongly disagree/disagree</italic> and <italic>agree/strongly agree</italic>.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The African American participants represented a wide range of ages: 177 (20.9%) were younger than age 39 years, 177 (20.9%) were age 40 to 49 years, 188 (22.2%) were ages 50 to 59 years, 170 (20.1%) were ages 60 to 69 years, 105 (12.4%) were ages 70 to 79 years and 30 (3.5%) were age 80 years or older. Women in the 50 to 59 and 60 to 69 age groups were the most likely to be adherent to screening mammography guidelines, with 64.7% and 74.1% adherence, respectively, whereas women in the 80 or older age group were least likely to be adherent to screening mammography guidelines, with 39.3% adherence (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). There were no significant differences found between age group and the other screening modalities (Pap test, BSE, and clinical breast exam). See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839910385900">Table 1</xref> for adherence rates among African American women to mammography screening guidelines (for women 40 years of age and older), clinical breast exam guidelines, monthly BSE and cervical cancer screening.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the only statistically significant relationship found was between BSE adherence and response to the statement “I rely on God to keep me in good health.” Those who disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement were significantly less likely than those who agreed or strongly agreed to practice BSE once a month (<italic>p</italic> = .044). No statistically significant relationship was found between breast or cervical cancer worry and screening adherence, or between screening adherence and agreement with the statements about medical mistrust and their faith beliefs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This article assessed factors that were hypothesized to influence (either positively or negatively) breast and cervical cancer screening adherence in a minority population. It had been anticipated that women who are more worried about getting cancer would be more adherent to screening than those who were not worried, that women who were suspicious of modern medicine would be less adherent to screening than those who did not report a similar sentiment, and that women who reported relying on religious beliefs to stay in good health would be less adherent. Consequently, it was surprising that the data did not reveal such relationships. Many studies have found evidence supporting a relationship between decreased screening rates and suspicion of modern medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839910385900">Klassen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839910385900">Matthews et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839910385900">Shavers, Lynch, &amp; Burmeister, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839910385900">Thompson et al., 2004</xref>) decreased <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839910385900">Consedine et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839910385900">Miller &amp; Hailey, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839910385900">Powe &amp; Johnson, 1995</xref>) or increased screening rates in relation to worry about cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839910385900">Consedine et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839910385900">Diefenbach, Miller, &amp; Daly, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839910385900">Katapodi, Lee, Facione, &amp; Dodd, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839910385900">McCaul et al., 1998</xref>) and decreased screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839910385900">Kinney et al., 2002</xref>) or medical care in women who report strong religious faith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910385900">Holt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839910385900">Matthews et al., 2002</xref>). Elucidation and understanding of the relationship between cancer worry, health beliefs, and screening adherence is important in increasing cancer screening, but evidently very complex. This study should be used as a foundation for more intricate analysis of these relationships.</p>
<p>The low screening mammography rate in our study population reported by the survey before the intervention and the subsequent increased rates of screening reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910385900">Erwin et al., 2003</xref> emphasize how important programs like this are in educating women about the benefits of screening and linking participants to care. Another important finding is that a large majority of women participating in this program (70.1%) did not perform BSE with the recommended frequency of once a month prior to program intervention. More African American women than women of any other race or ethnicity will be diagnosed with breast cancer before age 40 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839910385900">ACS, 2009</xref>). Women younger than age 40 years are not routinely screened with mammography, so we feel that programs such as WPH that teach how to correctly perform BSE and encourage its regular use may contribute to early breast cancer detection in African American women younger than age 40 years.</p>
<sec id="section15-1524839910385900">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Our study has a number of limitations. First, the study population does not represent a random sample and therefore the data captured may not represent the attitudes and beliefs of African American women in general. Women harboring a historical mistrust of research studies may have self-excluded from the group of women who agreed to participate in our voluntary research survey; therefore, our results may not represent attitudes toward medical mistrust in African American women in general. In addition, as this was a predominately urban sample, the findings may not generalize to African American women living in different settings. The use of single items to assess complex constructs such as worry and mistrust is another limitation. The use of multiple questions to explore these issues may have been a more effective means of investigating the relationship between screening rates and these constructs. Finally, this is a cross-sectional sample and therefore we cannot assess the impact of the program on women’s future cancer screening behaviors.</p>
<p>There are a number of strengths that we believe balance some of the limitations. This large sample of community-dwelling, average breast and cervical risk African American women informs us about the screening behaviors and beliefs of these women. These results allow us to better understand women participating in WPH sessions and take these behaviors and beliefs into consideration when designing future interventions. The WPH is one of many Witness Projects in the United States seeking to help reduce the excess burden of breast and cervical cancer among African American women. These are important community-based venues to reach minority women and help many women overcome barriers to cancer screening.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Screening mammography, clinical breast exam and Pap tests are well known to be associated with early breast and cervical cancer detection and therefore with reductions in cancer morbidity and mortality. In minority populations where cancer mortality rates are disproportionately high, it is very important to identify barriers to cancer screening and to develop interventions that can reduce the barriers. This investigation of health beliefs and attitudes confirms that a large proportion of African American women are worried about breast and cervical cancer and are suspicious toward modern medicine. These issues are known to be major barriers to healthcare and should be addressed and discussed during future WPH interventions in order to improve screening rates and healthcare-seeking behaviors.</p>
<p>Our results failed to find evidence of hypothesized relationships between cancer screening and health beliefs that were suggested by previous literature. The failure to replicate these previously reported relationships may be a result of our study limitations. It is, however, also a possibility that our results suggest a different relationship between health beliefs and screening adherence in the women in our study population as compared to groups of African American women included in previous studies; certainly, cultural beliefs are extremely variable in different populations and can be difficult to generalize. Furthermore, the lack of relationships found in our results between cancer screening rates and health beliefs may indicate that factors not examined in this study may be acting as barriers to cancer screening in the study population and confounding our results. Recent investigations into cancer screening and mortality disparities in African American women continue to identify socioeconomic factors and access as important barriers to adequate screening. Economic concerns, lack of insurance, and lack of access to physicians and high-quality screening services serve as major barriers to breast and cervical cancer screening and these barriers are all too common in minority communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839910385900">Ansell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839910385900">Lopez, Khoury, Dailey, Hall, &amp; Chisholm, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1524839910385900">Ward et al., 2008</xref>). Non-White women lacking health care insurance also experienced more delay in follow-up care after abnormal or incomplete mammography results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1524839910385900">Wujcik &amp; Fair, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In underserved minority populations such as our study population, it is possible that low socioeconomic status and lack of access to health care play a central role in breast and cervical cancer screening adherence. These barriers may need to be addressed in order to improve cancer screening adherence before more subjective barriers such as health beliefs are taken on. Culturally sensitive screening education programs like the WPH should intensify their efforts in advocating for improved participant access to quality screening and health care. In addition, culturally sensitive screening education programs should track health insurance status, access to screenings and health care, and rate of repeat screening after participation as measures of program outcome and efficacy.</p>
