<title>Background:</title>
<p>Accurate risk stratification is important in the management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. Several risk scores have been developed to stratify patients hospitalized with ACS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1474515112449412">
<title>Aim:</title>
<p>To compare the prognostic value of three risk scores used to determine the risk for secondary events in patients diagnosed with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1474515112449412">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A retrospective analysis of patients with an ACS experiencing a STEMI treated with PCI presenting to a Kaiser Permanente Foundation Hospital in Northern California from January 2007 to January 2008 (<italic>n</italic>=186). For each patient, the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI), Controlled Abciximab and Device Investigation to Lower Late Angioplasty complications (CADILLAC), and Global Registry for Acute Coronary events (GRACE) risk scores were calculated and predictive ability was analysed using the area under the curve or C statistic method.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1474515112449412">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The CADILLAC, TIMI, and GRACE risk scores all had high predictive accuracy for a major cardiac event in hospital, with C statistics ranging from 0.63 to 0.718 with the CADILLAC risk score superior. For non-major cardiac events in hospital, the three risk scores were similar in accuracy for predictability, with C statistics ranging from 0.62 to 0.66.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1474515112449412">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Risk stratification of patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention can be done using all three risk scores. In our analysis, the CADILLAC and GRACE score was more predictive for major cardiac events in hospital and CADILLAC and TIMI for major cardiac events at 1 year.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the major goals of risk assessment is to predict the likelihood of occurrence of clinically significant outcomes, given an initial complex presentation. Early risk stratification on admission is essential for a tailored therapeutic strategy. Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are a heterogeneous population with varying risks of mortality and morbidity. In these patients, early risk stratification plays a central role, as the benefit of more recent and more aggressive treatment strategies seems to be proportional to the risk of adverse clinical events. Over the past decade, a multitude of risk scores have been proposed to facilitate risk assessment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112449412">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112449412"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112449412">3</xref></sup> These scores are based on presenting clinical history and electrocardiographic and initial laboratory tests that enable early risk stratificationon admission.</p>
<p>One of the first validated and clinically useful risk scores was the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score for STEMI, derived from fibrinolytic therapy trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112449412">1</xref></sup> The TIMI score incorporates clinical and electrocardiographic characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474515112449412">Table 1</xref>). With the increasing use of primary percutaneous coronary intervention as the preferred method for achieving reperfusion in STEMI, risk scores based on primary percutaneous coronary intervention trials were developed and validated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112449412">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112449412"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474515112449412">4</xref></sup> The Controlled Abciximab and Device Investigation to Lower Late Angioplasty complications (CADILLAC) risk score uses clinical and angiographic parameters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474515112449412">Table 1</xref>). The Global Registry for Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score, based on a large registry of patients across the spectrum of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) incorporates clinical and electrocardiographic characteristics to determine risk (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474515112449412">Table 1</xref>). The GRACE risk score was shown to be of predictive value for all forms of ACS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112449412">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474515112449412">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>A retrospective analysis of 200 patients (determined by power analysis) was identified by ICD9 codes with STEMI treated with PCI from 2007 to 2008 in Northern California Kaiser Permanente Foundation Hospitals or affiliatedhospitals. Permission for the study was granted throughan institutional review board process at the Division of Research Northern California Kaiser Permanente. The STEMI diagnosis for patients presenting with symptoms consistent of an ACS required an increase of troponin I with at least one value greater than the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit and one of the following: (1) acute onset of prolonged (&gt;20 minutes) typical ischaemic chest pain; (2) ischaemic electrocardiographic changes at presentation (persistent ST-segment elevation of ≥0.1 mV in ≥2 contiguous leads or new left bundle branch block or the development of pathologic Q waves). The standard definition of ACS STEMI was used to define eligible patients who were 18 years of age or greater.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112449412">10</xref></sup> Patients were excluded from the analysis if they presented with cardiogenic shock. Of the 200 patients initially selected for the study, 14 were excluded due to incomplete medical records. Thus 186 patients [109 (57%) men, age 60.05±10.93 years; 77 (41%) women, age 67.38+11.75 years] who had been admitted for ACS with STEMI represented the final study group.</p>
<p>The data for calculating the risk scores were collected directly from the patient’s medical record. In-hospital risk scores were calculated from admission data. Dischargedata and ongoing clinic visits, and subsequent laboratory and diagnostic test data were used to calculate 30-day and 12-month risk scores. In-hospital data included prehospital drug history, admission ECG reports, blood chemistry and haematology results, in-hospital diagnostic tests and medical events, medical interventions, and discharge summary. The long-term follow-up data contained total mortality, cardiac mortality, non-cardiac mortality, confirmed myocardial infarction (MI), interventional cardiology treatment (&gt;30 days after discharge), cardiothoracic surgery treatment (&gt;30 days after discharge), incidence of stroke, and cardiac/non cardiac hospitalization. The total mortality, an objective measure widely used in major clinical trials, was used as the primary end point for our study with the causes of death obtained from the medical record.</p>
<p>All patients in our study were treated for ACS STEMI according to the hospital and AHA/ACC guidelines for the management of patients with STEMI. Primary PCI was performed in 186 cases and pharmacological treatment was optimized according to these guidelines.</p>
<p>Patients were treated with aspirin 325 mg before PCI and clopidogrel administered either before the PCI or immediately after. Unfractionated heparin (70 U/kg loading) was administered before the PCI. Selection of stent type, predilatation, and post dilatation were left to the operator’s discretion. Patients were prescribed lifelong aspirin and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) for 3–12 months upon discharge, depending on type of stent implanted.</p>
<p>The three risk scores were calculated from the initial history, electrocardiogram, laboratory values, and coronary angiogram (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474515112449412">Table 1</xref>). Immediate, in-hospital events, 30-day events, and 12-month events were obtained from electronic hospital records. Repeated revascularization procedures and episodes of reinfarction were collected from the electronic medical record. Data from affiliated hospitals were available through scanned medical records. The patients’ clinical characteristics of the study sample are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1474515112449412">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of reinfarction following the initial event was based on recurrent chest pain suggestive of acute myocardial infarction accompanied by increase in cardiac enzymes to ≥2 times the upper limit of normal ≥48 hours after PCI and new ST-elevation or pathological Q waves on 12-lead electrocardiograph.

The association between outcome variables and the risk scores (predictor outcome) was assessed using logistic regression. For each of the three risk scores, receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to relate the calculated scores to the rate of adverse events in hospital and at 12 months. The area under the ROC curve or C statistic index was used as a measure of the predictive accuracy of each risk score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112449412">13</xref></sup> A risk model with perfect discriminative ability has a C index of 1.0; an index of 0.5 provides no better discrimination than chance. Models with area under the ROC curve of greater than 0.7 are preferred. Rates of adverse clinical events were also compared among risk strata (low, intermediate, and high) for each risk score. All statistical analysis was performed using SAS software 9.1 for logistic regression and 9.2 for the ROC analysis (SAS Institute, Carey, NC, USA).</p>

<p>The areas under the curve (C statistic) of the three risk scores for the various end points are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1474515112449412">Figure 1</xref>. In general the CADILLAC, TIMI, and GRACE risk scores all had high predictive accuracy for MCE in hospital, with C statistics ranging from 0.63 to 0.71, with the CADILLAC risk score being the highest. For non-major cardiac events (NMCE) in hospital, the three risk scores were similar in accuracy with C statistics ranging from 0.62 to 0.66. For MCE at 1 year, the CADILLAC risk score had the highest C statistic of 0.64 compared to the GRACE with a C statistic of 0.53 and the TIMI with a C statistic of 0.56. The CADILLAC and TIMI risk score had a high predictive accuracy for death in hospital compared to the GRACE, with C statistics of 0.86, 0.85, and 0.64 respectively. For death at 1 year, the CADILLAC and TIMI risk score had a relatively high predictive accuracy, with C statistics of 0.80 and 0.76 compared to the GRACE risk score with a C statistic of 0.64. The three risk scores had lower predictive accuracy for NMCE at 1 year with C statistics ranging from 0.54 (GRACE) to 0.61 (CADILLAC).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Based on a cohort of consecutive patients with STEMI treated using PCI, we compared the predictive accuracy of three different risk scores for clinical outcomes in hospital and at 1 year for cardiac events and mortality. We found that the CADILLAC and TIMI risk scores had high predictive value for mortality in hospital and at 1 year. The CADILLAC risk score was superior to the GRACE and TIMI risk score for MCE in hospital.</p>
<p>The TIMI risk score for STEMI was derived from a data set of patients treated with thromobolytic agents in randomized trials, the Intravenous nPA for Treatment of Infarcting Myocardium II trial, and validated in an external data set from the TIMI 9 trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112449412">1</xref></sup> The TIMI risk score was also later applied to an unselected population of patients with STEMI treated with fibrinolytic therapy that was included in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction-3 (NRMI-3) and showed a strong predictive value (C statistic=0.79).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112449412">14</xref></sup> The data that served the GRACE risk score development included patients already treated with PCI; however, there was an increase in use of PCI with a corresponding decrease in the frequency of fibrinolytics in STEMI during that time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112449412">3</xref></sup> The GRACE score included both STEMI and non STEMI/unstable angina patients thus representing an unselected and wider patient population. About 35% of the patients in the GRACE registry cohort usedto develop the score had ST-segment elevation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112449412">3</xref></sup> The CADILLAC risk score was based on randomized trials of patients with STEMI treated with primary PCI and validated using external data sets from other primary PCI intervention trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112449412">2</xref></sup> The CADILLAC risk score differed from the other risk scores because it included the angiographic parameters of triple vessel disease and final TIMI flow, as well as left ventricular ejection fraction.</p>
<p>Comparing the composition of the three risk scores used in the present study, all included the components of age and Killip’s classification, consistently shown to be important predictors of survival in patients with STEMI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112449412">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112449412"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112449412">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474515112449412">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112449412">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112449412">16</xref></sup> The CADILLAC risk score can be calculated only after interpretation of angiographic results and PCI, and given that it performed very well in our study it appeared that the angiographic parameters included in the score have an important additive value to clinical variables.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112449412">2</xref></sup> Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction, for example, was repeatedly shown to be a strong long-term determinate of survival after STEMI, including in the era of primary angioplasty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112449412">17</xref></sup> Another unique component of the CADILLAC score was anaemia, which recently emerged as another strong predictor of mortality after STEMI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112449412">18</xref></sup> The score however is not helpful in decision making before angiography.</p>
<p>The weak predictive value of the GRACE score outcomes of patients with STEMI in our study may be related to the GRACE score being derived from a wide selection of all patients with ACS and included other risk factors of cardiac arrest at admission, ST segment elevation/depression, and increased cardiac enzymes. In our study, we excluded cardiogenic shock and all the patients included in our sample had ST-segment elevation and increased cardiac enzymes. Two important factors effecting cardiac function are location of the acute myocardial infarction and ejection fraction, which were not used in the GRACE risk score calculation. These exclusions may have contributed to the poor predictive value of the GRACE score in assessing a population with STEMI.</p>
<p>Improving outcomes for ACS patients relies on arapid response, which encompasses risk assessment and associated target interventions. Risk score assessments are used to facilitate clinical decision making by incorporating physical assessment parameters, angiographic data, and laboratory data to varying degrees, depending on the period that the initial risk score was developed. None of the three risk scores are absolutely predictive. Comparing the three risk scores and recognizing the patient population in which they are validated will guide the clinician to determine which one to select. The TIMI risk score is an easy to use tool and its use should be primarily for predicting risk of very near-term events. The CADILLAC score is not useful in the decision making before angiography; however, it is very useful for predicting risk in patients undergoing PCI for ACS. The GRACE risk score can be used for all types of ACS patients in clinical practice.</p>
<p>The risk assessment scores are secondarily used to determine the type of counselling patients should receive after PCI for STEMI. The risk of death during the first 30 days after a STEMI in the literature was highest in patients who presented with advanced age, raised biomarkers, and high Killip class.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112449412">19</xref></sup> Knowledge of the highest risk period for patients after PCI for STEMI will guide the clinician in structuring patient teaching, follow-up appointments, and diagnostic tests.</p>
<p>Technology and associated outcomes for treating ACS patients are constantly evolving. Current risk scores will need to be updated and revised and new ones developed. The use of risk scores strengthens the individualized plan of care for the patient both in the hospital and upon discharge.</p>
<p>This study represents a population of consecutive patients with STEMI treated using the contemporary approach of PCI. The patients are representative of a single Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) which limits its generalizabilty, and our study is underpowered as the final sample size was 186. Our study shows that risk stratification of patients with STEMI early after presentation using the TIMI risk score or after angiography using the CADILLAC risk score provides important prognostic information and enables accurately identification of high risk patients.</p>
<p>Accurate risk stratification of patients with STEMI is important for guiding decisions about the need for a different or higher level of care that could be offered at another medical facility, the length of hospital stay, or the interventional and pharmacological treatments.</p>
