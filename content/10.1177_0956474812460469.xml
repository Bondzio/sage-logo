<p><italic>The inside story of the BBC and the Hutton Inquiry from the</italic> Today <italic>programme editor at the time of Gilligan's dawn broadcast</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>George Creel is a name on few British lips, if any. Yet he was one of the most influential journalists of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Not because of his investigative work on the <italic>Denver Post</italic> or the <italic>Rocky Mountain News</italic> but because, in April 1917, he persuaded President Wilson to set up the commission that bore his name, the Creel Commission or Committee on Public Information (CPI). Its job, to persuade an indifferent American public that the European war was their war too.</p>
<p>Creel was content to call his campaign propaganda: “not propaganda as the Germans defined it, but propaganda in the true sense of the word, meaning the propagation of faith”. And for the most part, it delivered. But then, it crossed an important line. It planted a news story that the US Navy had sunk a group of German submarines in the Atlantic. It hadn't. Reporters found out it hadn't, trust in Creel's commission crashed and both press and public renamed it the Committee on Public Misinformation.</p>
<p>It created a new rule for a new industry: Creel's first law of PR. Burnish the truth by all means, but don't try to create it. And don't lie. You <italic>will</italic> be found out. Eventually. One of Creel's commission members begged to differ, a nephew of Sigmund Freud called Edward Bernays. He thought the problem wasn't that they'd gone too far. It was that they hadn't gone far enough and in 1928 wrote the handbook of the new industry called Propaganda. Its opening paragraph said it all: “The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organised habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.”</p>
<p>I first read Bernays' book towards the end of the Alastair Campbell era in Downing Street, around the time of the September 2002 dossier, <italic>Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction: The Assessment of the British Government</italic> and all that followed — the Gilligan affair, the death of Dr David Kelly and the Hutton inquiry. The parallels between it and what we'd all witnessed for the best part of a decade of New Labour's obsessive media management were striking. Almost as striking as Peter Mandelson's boast to The <italic>Guardian's</italic> Katherine Viner in 1997 that it was his job and that of the New Labour media machine “to create the truth”. The September dossier was part of it — in many ways, an unexceptional part — and straight out of Bernays' handbook. As was Alastair Campbell's subsequent defence of it at the Hutton inquiry: “Conscious and intelligent manipulation”.</p>
<sec id="section1-0956474812460469">
<title>What we think we know is incomplete</title>
<p>Ten years on from the dossier and the Hutton inquiry, we all know what we think about both. But what we think we know is incomplete — for three reasons.</p>
<p>First, Alastair Campbell's crude and misleading reformulation of Dr Kelly's allegations has largely replaced in public memory the actual allegations. No-one at the BBC accused him or the Prime Minister of “lying”. No-one accused him of “inserting” false intelligence into a dossier dropped into his in-tray by the spooks.</p>
<p>Second, Lord Hutton never invited me to explain why, as the editor of the BBC <italic>Today</italic> programme, I judged it right to put Dr Kelly's allegations on air. That meant he knew next to nothing about the “editorial system” that he condemned as “defective” — and what he thought he did know was wrong.</p>
<p>Third, and most important, Lord Hutton was outstandingly incurious about the dossier and how it had been written. Yet it was the violence that some thought had been done to the honest assessment of intelligence that motivated Dr David Kelly to share the intelligence community's concerns with at least three journalists, including Andrew Gilligan. The way the intelligence in the dossier had been spun to “create the truth” was the key to understanding the “Circumstances Surrounding the Death of Dr David Kelly” — the purpose and title of Lord Hutton's inquiry.</p>
<p>When I began to write <italic>Stumbling Over Truth</italic> — my account of the September dossier, Andrew Gilligan's reporting, Campbell's fight with the BBC, the death of Dr Kelly and the inquiry itself — I called Hutton “unfinished business”. Not because I thought I could put the record straight — I doubt anyone's mind will be changed by anything I've written — but to provide the final missing pieces.</p>
<p>Hindsight has invested the September 2002 dossier with a significance it never had. That was inevitable — a brave man of outstanding integrity died because of it. But at the time, we all read the dossier for what it was. A routine, here-today-gone-tomorrow New Labour exercise in “creating the truth”. A political rhetorical document — propaganda, if you like — designed to justify the Prime Minister's faith in his judgment that Saddam's WMD were an imminent threat to the West and had to be dealt with.</p>
<p>It was assertive, aggressive and unqualified. It had a specific job to do — to get Tony Blair round a tricky bend in the political road; the recall of Parliament, the TUC and his own party conference. It got the headlines he needed; “Forty-five minutes from doom” was one. And Campbell purred in his diary that coverage was “massive” and the dossier was “leading almost every bulletin in the world”.</p>
<p>Then, its job done, it was forgotten… except for a constant drip of stories written by trusted security specialists describing row after row between Downing Street and the agencies over the way the intelligence was being cherry-picked, twisted and framed to make it fit Blair's beliefs and justify war.</p>
<p>Then came the second dossier, in February 2003, known as the “dodgy” dossier, perhaps the most cynical of attempted deceptions in an age of cynical deceptions.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2003, the case for the imminent war was evaporating. UN weapons inspectors were back in Iraq, working freely and finding nothing. The Downing Street strategy was to undermine them, which Campbell tried to do with a dossier titled <italic>Iraq: Its Infrastructure of Concealment, Deception and Intimidation.</italic></p>
<p>A discredited propaganda unit called the Coalition Information Centre (CIC), directly responsible to Campbell, cobbled together outdated cuttings and a PhD thesis it had copied from the web, complete with typos and tweaked to make it alarming. The Prime Minister told MPs it comprised “intelligence … about the infrastructure of concealment … It is the intelligence that (the agencies) are receiving, and we are passing it on to people”.</p>
<p>Within hours it was exposed as the abuse of the truth that it was. Campbell shrugged, Blair shrugged, apologised for not crediting the author of the PhD thesis and got on with the war.</p>
<p>Even before that war was over, stories sourced to anonymous discontented spooks were appearing almost daily. And I, too, was hearing from very senior intelligence sources that they hadn't shared the Prime Minister's assessment of the threat from Saddam's WMD.</p>
<p>Then, on Wednesday May 28, 2003, <italic>Today</italic> reporter Andrew Gilligan presented me with what he said was the partial transcript of a meeting he'd had with “an official involved in producing the September dossier”. The whistleblower was Dr David Kelly — though I didn't know that at the time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0956474812460469">
<title>Dossier was to get Blair through a tricky autumn</title>
<p>The nub of the allegations was that the dossier had been “transformed” in the week before it was published “at the behest of Downing Street”. A dossier had been in production for months but never published — there wasn't the intelligence to make a convincing case. But at the beginning of September, Blair committed to a dossier to help get him through a tricky autumn. There still wasn't the firm intelligence to do the job, but it was no more than a routine exercise of “creating the truth” to massage any doubts and qualifications out of questionable intelligence to make what was uncertain look certain.</p>
<p>The “classic” was the 45 minutes claim, Dr Kelly had told Gilligan. The claim that Saddam's WMD could be launched within 45 minutes of an order to do so. Apart from anything else, it enabled the dossier to assert that Saddam was continuing to produce chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, even though there was no reliable intelligence that he was.</p>
<p>Dr Kelly was close to the experts at the sharp end of intelligence analysis, the Defence Intelligence Staff. Everyone involved in producing the dossier knew the 45-minutes claim came with qualifications. The analysts thought it was wrong. It was single-sourced and the reporting line was dubious. The analysts thought the original source had “misunderstood what was happening”. They wanted the claim out of the dossier. But if Downing Street insisted, they wanted it carefully worded and heavily qualified.</p>
<p>Instead, the qualifications were stripped out and wording became less and less careful in each successive draft. Least careful of all was in Blair's foreword, the section Campbell alone drafted, the only section most of the public would read.</p>
<p>Was it “to make it sexier?” Gilligan wanted to know. “To make it sexier,” Dr Kelly had agreed. “Who was behind it?” Gilligan asked. “Campbell,” Dr Kelly replied.</p>
<p>As soon as I saw Gilligan's notes, I knew we had to put his source's allegations on air. It was risky. It was a single source and anonymous — but unlike the 45-minutes claim in the dossier, our source's background and track record were sound. He was credible, authoritative and his allegations reportable, even by the strict standards of the BBC editorial guidelines. More than that, after careful consideration, I believed that, on the balance of probabilities, his allegations were true.</p>
<p>Hutton heard no evidence from me about any of this — and assumed Dr Kelly's allegations and Gilligan's story had gone through no editorial process. He heard nothing because he didn't call me. Confusing absence of evidence with evidence of absence, he came to that conclusion that the “editorial system” was “defective”.</p>
<p>As Andrew Gilligan conceded to Lord Hutton, when he went on air with his story for the first time at 6.07 the following morning, he didn't have his script in front of him and made a hash of his live interview — or two-way — with John Humphrys. He fell over words, mis-spoke, and attributed his own inferences to his single, anonymous source. But he went on to report Dr Kelly's allegations a further twenty or so times that day, complete with the government's confirmation that the 45-minutes claim was indeed single-sourced. Thankfully, he stayed on script and never repeated the mistakes of that first two-way.</p>
<p>Campbell first thought Gilligan's story was no more than a rehash but complained anyway, his rambling and ill-focused faxes apparently more designed to take pot-shots at Gilligan and argue about BBC editorial guidelines than to put right what he later presented as a major wrong.</p>
<p>There was a noisy row which, after a week, died away, just like every other fight he'd picked with us over the years.</p>
<p>There, I'm convinced, it would have ended had it not been for the pasting Campbell was getting at the Foreign Affairs Select Committee — not over the September dossier but over the February 2003 “dodgy” dossier. Foreign Secretary Jack Straw had called it a “Horlicks”; the plagiarised author had told MPs it had endangered his family; and it turned out that the tiny amount of real intelligence in it had been put there without the agencies' permission.</p>
<p>It was grim. Campbell needed a diversion. And he needed to stop the infection spreading from the “dodgy” dossier — though it was, by then, too late to win back the public's trust in anything he or the Prime Minister said about the war and the case they'd made for it.</p>
<p>His answer was to re-ignite the dying row over the September dossier — or rather, over his misleading but deniable reformulation of Dr Kelly's allegations about it. He appeared before the select committee, gatecrashed Channel 4 News and sent us what seemed an endless stream of lengthy faxes. Blair wrote later that he was worried his director of strategy had “probably gone over the edge”.</p>
<p>It brought Greg Dyke centre stage, determined to defend the BBC's independence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0956474812460469">
<title>The account Hutton never heard</title>
<p>Dyke's critics claim he “bet the farm” based only on vague assurances from Gilligan and defended him blindly, unaware of the problem he had with “loose language”.</p>
<p>Neither is true. Dyke grilled Gilligan and he grilled me before he took up the fight with Campbell. And Gilligan's occasional inaccuracy and lack of judgement in his choice of words and phrases had been on the agenda at the previous month's BBC governors' meeting. Then, his controversial reporting from Baghdad was described as “painting in primary colours”. But any mistakes that Gilligan had made at 6.07 — and they were serious mistakes — didn't mean the allegations weren't true or couldn't be reported.</p>
<p>And I took Dyke through the detail of my decision to put Dr Kelly's allegations on air and why I thought they were, on balance, true. The account Lord Hutton never heard.</p>
<p>It's clear now that Lord Hutton did us all a disservice — most of all Dr David Kelly, the circumstances of whose death he failed to account for. He handed Tony Blair, Alastair Campbell, New Labour and the BBC's enemies an empty victory. When it came to a choice between journalists and whistleblowers stumbling over the truth on the one hand and a government obsessed not just with burnishing the truth but creating it on the other, Lord Hutton chose government.</p>
<p>Since the New Labour decade, it's become the conventional wisdom that all governments — all politicians — have always been strangers to truth. Blair and Mandelson and the rest were no different. No better, no worse, old lobby hands will sigh. ‘Twas ever thus.’ Twasn't.</p>
<p>Governments have always kept secrets, always put the best gloss on things and even — when it came to matters military, devaluation and interest rates — lied outright. New Labour were different. Their obsessive need to own the agenda and control rather than merely influence all that was said in the media about them created that “unseen mechanism … the true ruling power of our country” that Bernays described.</p>
<p>And like Bernays, Campbell appeared oblivious to any limits — until Dr Kelly's body was found.</p>
<p>It was then, as he told his diary, he realised “it had all gone too far”.</p>
