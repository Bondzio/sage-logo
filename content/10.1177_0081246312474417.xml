<abstract>
<p>Studying sleep differences across different ethnic groups is not only important for our understanding of sleep but may lead to the development of new, culturally appropriate interventions. Perceptions of sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and sleep cognitions (beliefs and attitudes) were investigated in a community sample of Caucasian Australians and Black immigrants currently resident in Australia from Zimbabwe (Black Zimbabwean) and Ghana (Black Ghanaian). A sample of a total of 176 participants including Caucasian Australian (<italic>n</italic> = 58), Black Zimbabwean (<italic>n</italic> = 59), and Black Ghanaian (<italic>n</italic> = 59), aged between 18 and 60 years was surveyed. Groups were matched on age and gender, with a strong predominance of professional occupations in all groups in the final sample and no significant socio-economic status differences between groups. Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep, and the Short Form-36 Health Survey. After matching participants on age, gender, and socio-economic status, no statistically significant group differences were found on sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and physical health. However, significant group differences were found on beliefs and attitudes about sleep with Black Zimbabwean and Black Ghanaian participants, attributing sleep difficulties more to physical than psychological phenomena compared to Caucasian Australian participants.</p>

<p>In the past decade, several bi-ethnic studies in the United States have reported subtle differences between African American and Caucasian American participants on sleep duration, continuity, and subjective quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0081246312474417">Durrence &amp; Lichstein, 2006</xref>), while polysomnography (PSG) studies have reported stronger and consistent differences for sleep architecture between Caucasian American and African American sleepers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0081246312474417">Mezick et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0081246312474417">Thomas, Bardwell, Ancoli-Israel, &amp; Dimsdale, 2006</xref>). Studies from Europe and the United States report that negative sleep cognitions (e.g., beliefs, attitudes) play a mediating role in perpetuating insomnia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0081246312474417">Morin, Vallieres, &amp; Ivers, 2007</xref>), but ethnic differences on this issue have not previously been published in Australia.</p>
<p>Poor sleep has been identified as an important issue in medical and psychological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0081246312474417">Nassermoaddeli et al., 2005</xref>). Because sleep is an important determinant of health, knowledge of normative sleep patterns and sleep cognitions among different ethnic groups may provide essential information for clinicians to make valid conclusions on the interaction between ethnicity, psychopathology, and sleep regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0081246312474417">Rao et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, this knowledge is essential in the development of new, innovative, culturally appropriate interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0081246312474417">Jean-Louis et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>While cross-cultural sleep habits of adults have been researched and well documented in the US literature, searches on PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Scopus databases using relevant search terms including ‘sleep’, ‘ethnicity’, and ‘Australia’ returned no published studies comparing sleep between ethnic groups in Australia. Further searches on these databases and Google substituting ‘Africa’ for ‘Australia’ returned only two relevant studies: one by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0081246312474417">Aloba, Adewuya, Ola and Mapayi (2007)</xref> in Nigeria and another by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0081246312474417">Reid and Baker (2008)</xref> in South Africa. The first identified study, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0081246312474417">Aloba et al. (2007)</xref>, was designed to validate the use of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) on a cohort of university students in Nigeria. This study reported that the extent of sleep-related problems remained largely an unidentified public health issue in Nigeria. The second study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0081246312474417">Reid and Baker (2008)</xref> also revealed a low awareness of sleep and sleep disorders among university students in South Africa. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0081246312474417">Reid and Baker (2008)</xref> also highlighted that there was a general lack of qualified personnel in sleep-related disciplines in South Africa, thus hampering research and dissemination of knowledge in this area. Based on the observations reported in the two studies, it can be argued that there is indeed a knowledge gap about many aspects of the sleep of different ethnic groups within Africa.</p>
<p>This study involved three community-based samples comprising Caucasian Australians (CAAs), Black Zimbabweans (BZWs), and Black Ghanaians (BGHs), where the Zimbabwean and Ghanaian groups were adult immigrants resident in Australia. Zimbabwean and Ghanaian participants in this study were of diverse cultural/ethnic origin with a mix of different cultural experiences, languages, and values. The participants were recruited based on nationality but not necessarily on cultural identity.</p>
<p>The first aim was to explore the possible interplay between ethnicity and sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, physical health, and mental health. The second aim of the study was to investigate differences in beliefs and attitudes about sleep among the three ethnic groups. Possible gender differences were also explored.</p>
<sec id="section1-0081246312474417">
<title>Defining ethnicity</title>
<p>The notions of ethnic minority and race status are highly charged with potential political ramifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0081246312474417">Okazaki &amp; Sue, 1995</xref>), and there is disagreement among psychological researchers on usage of the terms. In many psychological studies, ethnicity is used as a proxy for psychological variables such as cultural values, beliefs, self-concept, minority status, and so forth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0081246312474417">Okazaki &amp; Sue, 1995</xref>). In this study, we define ethnicity from a primordial perspective (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0081246312474417">Baumann, 2004</xref> for further discussion), which is captured succinctly by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0081246312474417">Mezick et al. (2008)</xref>, who limited ethnicity to refer to a self-identified social or cultural group with shared physical features and of common descent. Participants’ genetic make-up did not form part of the definition of ethnicity adopted in this study. In addition, ethnicity was as stated by participants in the biographical questionnaire consistent with identification in previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0081246312474417">Thumboo et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>It is noteworthy to acknowledge that in sleep literature, the definition of ethnicity remains a controversial topic. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0081246312474417">Betancourt and Lopez (1993)</xref> argue that the common practice among psychological researchers has been to refer to ethnicity, culture, and race interchangeably when identifying and categorizing people by background. The controversy on the issue of race and ethnicity has not been circumscribed to psychological research. In medical and biomedical research, similar issues with definition of ethnicity have been explored (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0081246312474417">Burchard et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0081246312474417">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>This study was a cross-sectional between-groups design in which data were collected by means of postal surveys using standardized questionnaires. The research focused on exploring relationships using ethnicity and gender as independent variables and a range of dependent variables. This study was approved by the Victoria University Human Research Ethics Committee.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<sec id="section5-0081246312474417">
<title>Target groups and rationale for selection</title>
<p>The target populations of this study were CAA, BZW, and BGH members of the community. The CAA group was selected because they represent the majority ethnic group in Australia. However, BZW and BGH were selected on the basis that they constitute a growing part of the African population resident in Australia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0081246312474417">
<title>Sample and response rate</title>
<p>The study sample consisted of 176 participants including CAA (<italic>n</italic> = 58), BZW (<italic>n</italic> = 59), and BGH (<italic>n</italic> = 59), aged between 18 and 60 years (<italic>M</italic> = 34.1 years, standard deviation [<italic>SD</italic>] = 10.2 years). Groups were matched on age and gender, with a strong predominance of professional occupations in all groups. A total of 150 research packages were mailed to the BZW sample, and 76 valid questionnaires were returned, representing a return rate of 50.7%. Out of 150 research packages sent to the BGH sample, 67 valid questionnaires were returned, a return rate of 44.7%. For the CAA group, 84 valid questionnaires were returned (42% response rate). Not all potential participants who returned valid questionnaires met the inclusion criteria.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0081246312474417">
<title>Inclusion criteria</title>
<p>To be included in the study, participants had to be aged 18 years and older. An arbitrary maximum of 15 years residency cut-off for inclusion of immigrant participants in this study was applied, based on the assumption that those who had been in Australia for longer than 15 years would be much more integrated in the host community than more recent immigrants. In addition, participants needed to have been 18 years of age or older at the time of migration to Australia. The African sample recruitment was limited to Black members of the population to control for potential effect of lifestyle and culture on sleep experiences. We assumed through reference to anecdotal evidence, the likelihood of similarity in lifestyles between CAA and Caucasians from Zimbabwe and Ghana on the basis of similarity of their cultural origin. In addition, we assumed that Caucasian Zimbabweans and Ghanaians would have different experiences of migration, suffered less discrimination, and integrated easily in the Australian society because they look like the majority population.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section9-0081246312474417">
<title>Biographical information</title>
<p>Employment status, ethnicity, gender, and age of participants were obtained by self-report using an 11-item self-report measure designed by the researchers. Classification of education and employment was done following classification standards designed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0081246312474417">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0081246312474417">
<title>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</title>
<p>Sleep quality, one of the key dependent variables in this study, was assessed using the PSQI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0081246312474417">Buysse, Reynolds, Monk, Berman, &amp; Kupfer, 1989</xref>). The PSQI is a standardized self-rated questionnaire that provides a retrospective index of sleep quality for a 1-month interval. It is composed of 19 self-rated questions and 5 questions rated by a bed partner or roommate (only the self-rated items were used in scoring the scale). The PSQI generates seven component scores corresponding to different domains. Each component score ranges from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). Component scores are summed to produce a global score (range: 0–21), and a PSQI global score greater than 5 is considered to be suggestive of significant sleep disturbance.</p>

<sec id="section11-0081246312474417">
<title>Addendum to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-A)</title>
<p>The Addendum to the PSQI for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (PSQI-A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0081246312474417">Germain, Hall, Krakow, Shear, &amp; Buysse, 2005</xref>) was used to assess the existence of any disruptive nocturnal behaviours that may be a result of traumatic experiences. The PSQI-A consists of seven items and assesses the frequency of these behaviours during the month preceding completion of the questionnaire. It yields a global score obtained by adding participant ratings of the seven items and has a range of 0–21. In the normative study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0081246312474417">Germain et al. (2005)</xref> reported that a global PSQI-A cut-off score of 4 had high sensitivity, acceptable specificity, and high-positive predictive value for discriminating participants with PTSD from those without PTSD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0081246312474417">
<title>Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</title>
<p>Daytime sleepiness was measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0081246312474417">Johns, 1991</xref>). The measure requires participants to rate the likelihood of falling asleep in eight commonly encountered situations. Each of the eight items is rated on a 0–3 scale with 0 = <italic>would never doze</italic> and 3 = <italic>high chance of dozing</italic>. Possible scores range from 0 to 24, with high scores suggesting prevalence of daytime sleepiness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0081246312474417">
<title>Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes About Sleep Scale (DBAS)</title>
<p>The Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes About Sleep (DBAS) Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0081246312474417">Morin, Stone, Trinkle, Mercer, &amp; Remsberg, 1993</xref>), a 28-item scale tapping various beliefs, attitudes, expectations, and attributions about sleep and insomnia was used to evaluate participants’ sleep cognitions. Participants rated agreement or disagreement by placing a caret mark on a 100-mm Visual Analogue Scale anchored at each end by descriptors ‘strongly disagree’ and ‘strongly agree’, except for Item 23, for which the score was reversed, so that a higher score always indicated a more dysfunctional belief. Five cognition cluster themes, namely, (a) ‘misattributions or amplifications of consequences of insomnia’, (b) ‘diminished perceptions of control and predictability of sleep’, (c) ‘unrealistic sleep expectations’, (d) ‘misconceptions about the causes of insomnia’, and (e) ‘faulty beliefs about sleep promoting practice’ were generated through combinations of items on the measure. Comparison of participants’ cognitions was done based on the data from these thematic clusters (refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0081246312474417">Morin et al., 1993</xref>, for item clusters of each theme). The DBAS has good internal consistency with Cronbach’s α = .8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0081246312474417">Morin et al., 1993</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section14-0081246312474417">
<title>Short Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey questionnaire</title>
<p>Sleeping well is associated with good physical and mental health. In this study, the Short Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0081246312474417">Ware, Kosinski, &amp; Dewey, 2000</xref>) was used to assess participants’ physical and mental health status at the time of the study. The SF-36 Health Survey is a self-report measure containing 36 items. It measures health on a multi-item dimension, covering functional status, well-being, and overall evaluation of health. For each of the dimensions, item scores are coded, summed, and transformed on to a scale from 0 (<italic>worst health</italic>) to 100 (<italic>best health</italic>). The measure provides two aggregate summary scores, namely, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). These components have been shown to have test–retest reliability (Cronbach’s α) as follows: PCS = .92 and MCS = .91, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0081246312474417">Ware et al., 2000</xref>). Lower scores indicated poor health on both scales.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0081246312474417">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>All data analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics Graduate Pack version 17.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0081246312474417">SPSS Incorporation, 2008</xref>). Descriptive statistics such as means (<italic>M</italic>), <italic>SD</italic>s, and percentages were used to summarize the data. Comparisons of differences were performed using parametric and nonparametric techniques such as <italic>t</italic> test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Kruskal–Wallis test. Only participants with complete data sets on all measures were included in the analyses, and the level of significance was set at <italic>p</italic> = .05 for all inferential statistics.</p>

<title>Demographic variables</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0081246312474417">Table 1</xref> presents demographic details of the participant groups. BZW and BGH participants evenly matched their CAA counterparts on education, age, and gender ratios (with slight bias towards more female CAA). Given that education and employment are key indicators of economic status and there were no significant differences (using ANOVA analyses) between the groups, it was concluded that there was no impact of socio-economic status (SES) in comparing these groups. In all, 42% of participants had achieved a higher education qualification. At the time of the survey, all BZW and BGH participants were working, while 17% (<italic>n</italic> = 10) of CAA participants reported that they were not working. Further inspection of the Caucasian data revealed that it included seven female full-time university students, a retired male, and two male Technical and Further Education (TAFE) graduates actively seeking work. The majority of the BZW (59.3%) and BGH (49.2%) participants were employed in professional occupations (e.g., nursing and teaching) compared to 44.8% CAA. On average, BZW participants had been in Australia for a shorter period compared to BGH and CAA.</p>

<title>Subjective sleep quality</title>
<p>The PSQI was analysed in terms of one global score (Global score of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [GPSQI]) and seven component variables, namely, subjective sleep quality (SSQ), sleep onset latency (SOL), sleep duration (SLD), habitual sleep efficiency (HSE), use of hypnotic drugs (MED), daytime dysfunction (DTD), and sleep disturbance (SDIS). A summary of mean scores for the PSQI is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0081246312474417">Figure 1</xref>. A 3 × 2 between-group ANOVA was used to evaluate between-group differences in sleep quality among the three ethnic groups. The total GPSQI was entered in the analysis as the dependent variable. Ethnicity and gender were entered in the analysis as the fixed factors (independent variables). Levene’s test for equality of variances was significant, <italic>F</italic>(5, 170) = 2.63, <italic>p</italic> = .03, suggesting that the data had violated the assumption of equality of variances between the groups on this variable. Due to this violation, a nonparametric alternative – the Kruskal–Wallis test – was used to analyse these data. The test returned no statistically significant differences in sleep quality (GPSQI) among the three ethnic groups, χ<sup>2</sup>(2, <italic>N</italic> = 176) = 0.41, <italic>p</italic> = .82.</p>

<p>Furthermore, an independent-samples <italic>t</italic> test was conducted to investigate differences in sleep quality (GPSQI scores) between males and females irrespective of ethnic origin. A statistically significant difference in GPSQI scores was found, <italic>t</italic>(172) = −2.09, <italic>p</italic> = .04, two-tailed. Review of mean GPSQI scores – <italic>M</italic> = 5.31, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.47 for males and <italic>M</italic> = 6.21, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.42 for females – suggested that females reported poorer quality of sleep compared to males. However, the magnitude of the differences in the means was very small (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = −0.3) (mean difference = −0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [−1.75, −0.05]).</p>
<p>No significant effect of group on the combined PSQI variables was found, <italic>F</italic>(14, 328) = 0.725, <italic>p</italic> = .75; Wilks’s lambda = 0.94. However, there was a significant effect of gender on the combined PSQI variables, <italic>F</italic>(7, 164) = 2.25, <italic>p</italic> = .03; Wilks’s lambda = 0.91; partial η<sup>2</sup> = 0.09 (medium effect). Further inspection of the individual component scores, followed by univariate ANOVA analysis revealed significant difference between male and female participants on the DTD variable, <italic>F</italic>(1, 170) = 5.89, <italic>p</italic> = .02, but the effect was small (partial η<sup>2</sup> = 0.03). Comparison of means for gender indicated that female participants (<italic>M</italic> = 1.03, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.71) were likely to report more DTD than males (<italic>M</italic> = 0.78, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.63). No group by gender interaction effect on the combined variable, <italic>F</italic>(14, 328) = 0.644, <italic>p</italic> = .82; Wilks’s lambda = 0.95, was found.</p>

Furthermore, no statistically significant gender differences on the scale, <italic>F</italic>(1, 170) = 0.45, <italic>p</italic> = .50, and no interaction effects between ethnicity and gender, <italic>F</italic>(2, 170) = 1.43, <italic>p</italic> = .24, were found.</p>
<p>A 3 × 2 between-group ANOVA was conducted to explore ethnic and gender differences on mental health status measured by the SF-36 Health Survey.

<title>Sleep quality</title>
<p>No group differences on SSQ were found. By comparison, previous ethnic studies in the United States and New Zealand (NZ) reported ethnic differences in sleep quality (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0081246312474417">Durrence &amp; Lichstein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0081246312474417">Gander, Marshall, Harris, &amp; Reid, 2005</xref>). Importantly, in the studies where ethnic differences in sleep quality were found, SES was acknowledged as a possible confounding factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0081246312474417">Gander et al., 2005</xref>). This study was unique because, unlike other previous studies of ethnic differences in sleep, there was no SES difference between groups. Present findings would suggest that when SES does not differ across ethnic groups, sleep quality does not differ.</p>
<p>The finding of gender differences in sleep quality, with females reporting more sleeping difficulties, is consistent with findings reported in literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0081246312474417">Lichstein, Durrence, Riedel, Taylor, &amp; Bush, 2004</xref>). In this study, the majority of women were working full-time in the health sector, and some had young children. One likely explanation of the difference in SSQ reported by women may be related to work (e.g., shift work) as well as their role at home (looking after young children).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0081246312474417">
<title>Daytime sleepiness</title>
<p>No ethnic differences were found in self-reported daytime sleepiness. This finding contradicts findings reported in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0081246312474417">Sanford et al., 2006</xref>) and NZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0081246312474417">Gander et al., 2005</xref>) where ethnic minorities were found to have higher ESS scores compared to their Caucasian counterparts. Possible explanations of the ethnic differences in ESS scores in the NZ sample include prevalence of sleep disorders among ethnic minority groups, overall health status, and work-related risk factors such as shift work or unemployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0081246312474417">Gander et al., 2005</xref>). Unlike in the previous studies, the groups in this study did not differ in terms of SES and health status, and thus, the finding of no difference suggests both variables had no confounding effect on the ESS scores.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0081246312474417">
<title>Cognitions about sleep</title>
<p>This study found significant group differences on beliefs and attitudes about sleep. In particular, the two Black immigrant groups were significantly more likely to express dysfunctional views on the <italic>misconceptions about causes of insomnia</italic> theme than the CAA group. In general, the immigrant groups were less likely to acknowledge a possible non-physical (psychological) role in sleep difficulties. One possible explanation may be lack of or lower awareness about possible causes of sleep problems in their country of origin than in Australia – a lower awareness that might have remained with them in their new homeland.</p>
<p>Cross-ethnic variations in sleep belief profiles have potential implications for the treatment of insomnia and potentially intertwined psychological illnesses such as depression in patients of different ethnic backgrounds. In particular, part of the cognitive-behavioural treatment of insomnia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0081246312474417">Harvey, 2002</xref>) includes a focus on tackling negative cognitions (beliefs about sleep). The finding of negative cognitions about insomnia among the immigrants indicates a need to emphasize cognitive restructuring in group or individual treatments of insomnia to address these negative percepts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0081246312474417">
<title>Health</title>
<p>Physical health was not found to differ across the groups and thus exerted no confounding effect on the outcomes of this study. It was expected that CAA would have better mental health than the immigrant groups. This expectation was based on previous research evidence suggesting a link between migration and poor mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0081246312474417">Cernovsky, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0081246312474417">Voss &amp; Tuin, 2008</xref>), existence of elevated levels of psychological distress in new migrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0081246312474417">Markovizky &amp; Samid, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0081246312474417">Ponizovsky, Ritsner, &amp; Modai, 2000</xref>), and the association between poor mental health and poor sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0081246312474417">Hamilton, Nelson, Stevens, &amp; Kitzman, 2007</xref>). However, this study found statistically significant differences in mental health, with CAA reporting poorer mental health relative to both BZW and BGH participants. Among the Caucasian participants, 17% reported that they were not working. A review of their demographical data revealed that most of them were full-time students. It is possible that stress arising out of academic demands and/or looking for part-time work may have had an impact on their mental health status, similar to conclusions reported in earlier studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0081246312474417">LeBlanc et al., 2007</xref>). Another possible explanation could be that the immigrant groups had better mental health compared to their Caucasian counterparts due to belonging to tight-knit and supportive (immigrant) community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0081246312474417">Voss &amp; Tuin, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0081246312474417">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study used self-administered surveys where participants were required to retrospectively report on their typical sleep. Previous studies have reported that this method is problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0081246312474417">Riedel &amp; Lichstein, 1998</xref>), with retrospective reports being less accurate compared to prospective reports such as sleep diaries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0081246312474417">Ellis, Hampson, &amp; Cropley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0081246312474417">Laessle, Tuschl, Schweiger, &amp; Pirke, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Instruments used to measure the constructs were all developed and widely used but normed with a predominantly Caucasian sample. The questionnaires have not been normed with an African population except in two exploratory studies with the PSQI: one in South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0081246312474417">Reid &amp; Baker, 2008</xref>) and the other in Nigeria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0081246312474417">Aloba et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>On a cautionary note, first, it is unknown whether the current findings on dysfunctional sleep beliefs can be generalized to other African immigrant groups in Australia. Second, we also do not know whether the current findings can be generalized to immigrants’ countries of origin, and third, whether generalizations across Africa may apply on the basis of these data. Specifically, it should be recognized that immigrant groups in this study were highly selected due to the Australian government’s stringent migration criteria, in particular, health status. Therefore, generalizability of their data to populations of their home countries may not be possible.</p>

<title>Conclusions and implications</title>
<p>This study was unique because, unlike previous studies that reported ethnic differences in sleep quality and daytime sleepiness, there was no SES difference between groups investigated. In those previous studies, it may be concluded that differences in SES had a confounding effect on the results. Presence of differences in relation to dysfunctional beliefs about insomnia among the immigrant indicates a need for further investigations into perceptions and values of sleep among these groups, including interventions. Such studies would help clinicians understand perceptions of sleep problems in these ethnic minority groups, as well as inform development of appropriate interventions and treatment guidelines.</p>
<p>Findings from this study suggest that awareness about the possible role of psychological factors in sleep difficulties may be low among immigrant African populations, an area that may need further investigation. Dysfunctional beliefs, particularly about the causes and consequences of insomnia, were higher in immigrant groups than in CAA. Thus, in sleep education targeting immigrant Africans, placing more emphasis on the link between sleep and psychological problems would be helpful. Furthermore, the findings in this study suggest possible somatization of sleep problems and/or psychological phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0081246312474417">Vega &amp; Rumbaut, 1991</xref>) among the immigrant groups, a factor that may be associated with an increased desire for sleep medication. Against this background, there is a need to investigate whether use of hypnotic medication is higher in these immigrant groups. From available intervention studies, there is compelling evidence attesting to the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural strategies such as psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, and behavioural changes in treating sleep-related beliefs and insomnia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0081246312474417">Harvey, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0081246312474417">Morin, Blais, &amp; Savard, 2002</xref>). The current findings point to the need for such intervention studies in sleep with immigrant minority groups aimed at informing best practice in management of sleep.</p>

<p>The researcher is a member of the Zimbabwean community and migrated to Australia in 2002. During the recruitment of participants, attempts were made to ensure that recruitment was not differentially affected by membership of the Zimbabwean community; hence, the Zimbabwean Association in Victoria was used to handle data collection. In addition, use of the association ensured that the researcher had no access to the names of the participants thus reducing the potential effect of the researcher influencing participation as well as maintaining privacy and confidentiality of participants’ data. A similar approach was followed for the recruitment of the Ghanaian sample.</p></fn>
