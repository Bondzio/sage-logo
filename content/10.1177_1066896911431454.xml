<abstract>
<p>We describe a rare case of malignant teratoma involving the entire right lung. A 28 years old man was admitted to the hospital with severe respiratory failure and general malaise. Chest X-ray showed a dense opacity of the entire right lung, accompanied by pleural effusion. At autopsy, the right lung was completed replaced by a mass of variegated appearance combining cystic spaces and solid areas. Microscopically, the lung tumor exhibited a polymorphous histological picture. Most of the tissue had a malignant mesenchymal appearance, which included areas of chondrosarcoma, chondroblastic osteosarcoma, well differentiated liposarcoma, and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. Other areas of the tumor showed malignant epithelial components consistent with bronchial and urothelial mucosa with also scattered islands of pigmented epithelium of probable neuronal or retinal nature.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Teratoma is a common tumor of the mediastinum, but primary malignant teratoma of the lung is exceptionally rare.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911431454">1</xref></sup> To substantiate the diagnosis, one has to exclude the most likely alternative of a lung metastasis or direct extension from a teratoma arisen in another site, particularly testis, mediastinum, and retroperitoneum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911431454">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>We report here a case of primary malignant teratoma of the right lung in a 28-year-old man that filled out the entire right thoracic cavity.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 28-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with severe respiratory failure and general malaise. Chest X-ray showed a dense opacity of the entire right lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911431454">Figure 1</xref>), accompanied by pleural effusion. Pleural fluid obtained at thoracocentesis was negative for malignant cells. This was followed by a biopsy through a small thoracotomy, which was interpreted as consistent with a malignant teratoma.</p>

<p>Clinicoradiographic examination of testes, mediastinum, and retroperitoneum showed no abnormalities. Whole-body computed tomography confirmed the presence of a large right lung tumor but did not reveal other lesions elsewhere.</p>
<p>The patient’s condition rapidly deteriorated, and he died a few days after admission.</p>
<p>At autopsy, it was seen that the right lung was completely replaced by a mass of variegated appearance combining cystic spaces and solid areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896911431454">Figure 2</xref>). The hilar lymph nodes and the left lung were normal. There was no evidence of tumor or other lesions in the testis, mediastinum, or retroperitoneum.</p>

<p>Microscopically, the lung tumor exhibited a polymorphous histological picture.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Primary malignant teratoma of the lung is an extremely rare condition. To the best of our knowledge, only 8 cases have been published so far (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1066896911431454">Table 1</xref>). All these patients had by definition a tumor located in the lung with no evidence of an extrapulmonary source. The origin of this tumor is not clear, but it has been suggested that it is anatomically related to the thymus. According to this theory, in early embryo the primordial teratomatous focus originally located in the thymus may lie in such a position in the potential mediastinum that it is caught up and carried by the respiratory outgrowth from the foregut.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911431454">3</xref></sup> Most teratomas occurred in the left upper lobe, but the exact reason for this predominance was not known, particularly whether it was associated or not with the histogenesis of the tumor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911431454">9</xref></sup> In fact, 5 of the reported cases of intrapulmonary teratoma were located in the upper lobe of the left and right lung, and only 2 were in the lower lobes. All patients were male, of wide-ranging ages.</p>

<p>Most of the patients were adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911431454">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911431454">4</xref></sup> Only 1 case has been described in an infant (10-month old)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911431454">5</xref></sup> and another in a child (12 years).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911431454">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896911431454"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896911431454"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911431454">9</xref></sup> In none of the previously reported cases was there involvement of the entire lung, as it happened in our case.</p>
<p>The prognosis was generally poor, with death usually occurring days or months after presentation. Only 2 cases were associated with a good prognosis after surgical excision, with no evidence of recurrence at the time of the last follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911431454">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911431454">9</xref></sup> One patient was treated with a combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy but with poor results: The disease spread widely to the other lobe and recurred on the same side.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911431454">1</xref></sup> Evaluation of the reported cases suggests that postoperative radiation therapy should be used if there is residual disease or nodal metastasis, whereas preoperative radiation therapy should be considered if there is evidence of chest wall involvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911431454">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 2 cases the tumor presented with regional lymph node metastasis, associated in 1 case with vein and lymph vessels dissemination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911431454">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911431454">9</xref></sup> The other cases, including ours, presented with a single, well-demarcated mass involving an entire lung or part of it. It has been pointed out that this tumor type has a prognosis similar to that of lung carcinoma, with a tendency for metastases to occur in association with the epithelial component of the tumor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911431454">9</xref></sup> Indeed, 2 of the 3 cases associated with lymph node dissemination had an epithelial component in the primary tumor.</p>
<p>In summary, we describe a case of malignant teratoma apparently primary in the lung characterized by a very rapid growth rate and the variegated morphologic appearance that typifies teratomas in general.</p>
