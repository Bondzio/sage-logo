<p><italic>Taking Charge of Adult ADHD</italic> by Russell A. Barkley, PhD, with Christine M. Benton is a book written for adults with ADHD. Given that as many as two thirds of children with ADHD will continue to suffer symptoms into adulthood and given that there are many adults with ADHD who failed to get diagnosed as children, Barkley—a preeminent clinician, researcher, and teacher in the area of ADHD—is making an important contribution by supplementing his <italic>Taking Charge of ADHD</italic> with a book that will help adults with the condition recognize the need for assessment, learn how to receive evaluation and treatment as well as gain useful tips on how to manage their condition in an effort to lead happier and more successful lives.</p>
<p>The strength of the book lies in the attitude that Barkley has toward those who suffer from ADHD. He understands how much they (and their loved ones) suffer from their disorder and how discouraged they can get about being able to improve their lot in life. Throughout, he conveys an optimistic attitude about the possibilities for success. And, most importantly, he openly and persistently addresses patients’ resistances to seeking and following through with professional help. He devotes a whole chapter to the question, “Can You Handle the Problem on Your Own?” in which he encourages patients to seek professional help and not think they can solve their problems simply by labeling them and reading “a couple books like this one” (p. 13). Subsequent chapters address “Taking Along an Open Mind” to the evaluation (p. 22) and “Accepting the Professional’s Conclusions” (p. 31).</p>
<p>Barkley’s empathy for those with ADHD, as well as his appreciation for the difficulties people with ADHD might have seeking and accepting treatment, takes on a poignant personal dimension when he talks candidly about the devastation ADHD wreaked in his own family. Although the book starts with a dedication to birth in his family—to his grandson, “a new light and love in my life,” it movingly ends with a revelation of death in his family—the tragic death, in a one-car accident, of his brother Ronald, the death “attributable indirectly to his ADHD” (p. 242).</p>
<p>Given the author’s expertise, it is not surprising that the information in the book is, overall, reliable. However, I question whether it is presented in the most useful way, especially for people with ADHD. On the surface, it is extremely well organized. The chapters are divided into five sections named “Steps,” each with a title and (except for the first) a subtitle. The titles of the chapters in each Step have a consistent format. Thus, for example, the chapters in Step 1 are all questions, the titles of the chapters in Step 4 are all rules, and the titles of the chapters in Step 5 are all areas of functioning in life. From there, however, the layout gets frenzied. In any given chapter, one is likely to encounter subchapters, italicized items, bolded items, checked items, items with arrows pointing to them, items with boxes pointing to them, items with bold circles pointing to them, numbered items, items highlighted by an “i” within a circle, items highlighted with a corkboard pin, items in shaded boxes with arrows in circles pointing to them, items with question marks in shaded boxes, and more. Unfortunately, the information Barkley is trying to convey gets confused and often lost in this dizzying display of an array of facile writing tools, which ironically one has to assume were designed to help a disorganized and distractible reader.</p>
<p>In the introduction, Barkley mentions that he has developed a theory about the nature of ADHD (p. 2). This is to be the theoretical underpinning of the self-help recommendations, “A collection of strategies that can turn your life around” (p. 2). Unfortunately, the presentation of the theory is as confusing as the formatting of the book, leaving the reader tossed one way and then another and then back again:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>ADHD appears to be a combination of: Poor Inhibition Poor self-control Problems with executive functioning . . . Poor inhibition leads to poor self-control, and problems with executive functions can produce four different types of self-control problems. <italic>I now believe that it all comes down to self-control.</italic> However, I think you’ll find it easier to understand your own unique version of ADHD if you look at it within the framework of these three problem areas. (pp.46-47)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>What is a reader to do with this? Are these three independent but interrelated factors? Is there one overarching concept? If there is an overarching concept, why is it easier to understand the problem without it? It all becomes a jumble.</p>
<p>The sloppiness is more ubiquitous than one would like. Another example is his basis for determining a high likelihood of ADHD based on a list of nine symptoms: “Did you check off four of the first seven symptoms on this list, or six of all nine symptoms?” (p. 11). A moment’s thought will lead one to realize that one cannot get six of all nine without getting four of the first seven so, if four of the first seven will do, there is no need to include numbers eight and nine!</p>
<p>I would have liked to have seen some discussion of how ADHD can lead to other conditions, including anxiety, depression, oppositionality, and disordered conduct. To view these conditions as comorbid rather than secondary is to leave out an important way of understanding their prevalence in people with ADHD.</p>
<p>And I felt that the usefulness of psychotherapy was not given sufficient weight. While I agree that psychotherapy is not helpful for the direct treatment of a neuropsychiatric disorder, it can be invaluable for the treatment of its sequelae. To advise patients to “avoid talk- or insight-oriented therapy, psychoanalysis, weekly group therapy focusing on complaining [!], etc.” (p. 93) does a disservice to patients with ADHD.</p>
<p>Throughout the book, Barkley makes it clear that medication is a mainstay of the treatment of ADHD. This would make the section on medication quite important, yet, while good overall, it had some significant failings. For one, using the method of delivery (pills, pump, pellets, patch, prodrug—maybe the alliteration was too hard to give up) as the organizing factor does not jibe with my clinical experience, in which the duration of action is much more often a deciding factor in choosing a medication, especially in adults, for whom swallowing pills is rarely an issue.</p>
<p>More disturbing, because of its potential to misguide patients, I detected a bias toward atomoxetine. For example, the chapter on nonstimulants starts with “When doctors and talk about ‘the nonstimulants’ for ADHD, they are typically talking about atomoxetine” (p. 131). While atomoxetine may be the first nonstimulant that one thinks of, it certainly should not be the only one. The only other medication he discusses in the chapter is buproprion; he chooses not to discuss the alpha-2 adrenergic agonists on the grounds that they have not been Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for adult ADHD—a flimsy reason in my opinion because FDA approval is far from the sine qua non for the usefulness of a medication to treat a condition—and he makes no mention of the tricyclic antidepressants, which were the first-line nonstimulants before the development of atomoxetine and are still good medications to keep in mind as alternatives to stimulants.</p>
<p>He claims that atomoxetine is as effective as stimulants, a claim that is hard to justify. And his “bottom line,” as he calls it, implies that atomoxetine is preferable to stimulants because it can have sufficient effectiveness with fewer side effects (p. 135). Most disturbing to me about this apparent bias in favor of atomoxetine is that he is a paid consultant to and speaker for the manufacturer of Strattera, the only available atomoxetine compound (p. 109). He is also a paid consultant and speaker for companies that manufacture other medicines for ADHD, but the disclosure in the book does not indicate the extent to which he has been paid by the different companies, so we cannot know how much he might be influenced in favor of one or another medication. Regardless, it is regrettable that any influence has to be considered.</p>
<p>Given that the book was put together in conjunction with a writer and editor, I would have expected better writing and organization. The important question, however, is whether a better written and organized book—with essentially the same content, but with fewer distractions—would allow the information to be better used by adults with ADHD or for that matter by anyone. If that is the case, it is a shame, for it means that much of what the author has to offer, which is considerable, is lost to the reader.</p>
