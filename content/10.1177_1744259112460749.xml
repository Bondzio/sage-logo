<p>All things still can go wrong (as they usually do with new software) but as the next printed issue appears in October and we are switching to this website now, I can talk about computerized uploading system. The authors will go to the website by typing <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/jen">http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/jen</ext-link></p>
<p><italic>Jen</italic> is the internal name of this journal because we had the building enclosure in the previous title. Yet, it is still a journal about enclosure (envelope in Canada), energy, and environment, so the name <italic>Jen</italic> is appropriate.</p>
<p>SAGE Corporation also instituted a website called “Editor’s Choice Collection” where a few selected papers per year (since 2007) are placed for your access. They can be accessed directly at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jen.sagepub.com/cgi/collection/editorchoice">http://jen.sagepub.com/cgi/collection/editorchoice</ext-link> or accessed from the last issue of the journal on the SAGE website. The International Association of Building Physics is thinking about electronic publication of the conference papers, while the overview of the conferences and the best papers will be published in this journal.</p>
<p>The automatic upload has some advantages: it will eliminate the need for a paper copy and marking the date of original submission—reviewers will be able to read and upload reviews directly to the website, and the editor will notify the authors about the acceptance or rejection of their submission by sending a letter from the central computer. Yet, all computer systems have also a dark side. I have been frustrated many times when the website told me—your password should have a minimum of 7 and a maximum of 11 characters, some capital letters, contain at least one alphanumeric character but no marks like “@#&amp;,” and so on. When I finally typed this strange thing, the next time the system’s response was “either name or password” does not match our records. Therefore, we will not tell you what name or password you should use. The frustrated reviewers can always send the review directly to me by e-mail: <italic><email>mark.bomberg@gmail.com</email></italic> and <italic><email>mark.bomberg@ymail.com</email></italic>, the latter only when Google tells you that I am not responding for a week implying that I am in China (Gmail goes to China only if you speak Chinese). Speaking about language, I am now teaching at the Civil Engineering Department of McMaster University (Mac) in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, and at Architecture, Southeast (SEU) in Nanjing, China, where I also speak English.</p>
<p><italic>Journal of Building Physics</italic> (JBP) has the pleasure of announcing</p>
<list id="list1-1744259112460749" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>CESBP 2013—Central European Symposium on Building Physics (toward sustainable built environment), 9–11 September 2013, Vienna, Austria, that is organized by the Department of Building Physics and Building Ecology of the Vienna University of Technology: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cesbp2013.org">www.cesbp2013.org</ext-link> and contact <email>cesbp2013@tuwien.ac.at</email></italic></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In addition to the standard list of topics in building physics, including acoustic and lighting, we highlight urban physics because our colleagues deal with quite a few buildings simultaneously. Deadline for abstracts is 1 November, but if you sent soon after this deadline and claim that you read it only in the JBP editorial, they may still consider your paper. The best papers will be invited to expand for the journal publication, but we recommend a simpler solution—upload your full paper at the journal’s website, as soon as possible but before 15 February (the machine sends me two e-mails as soon as you have finished uploading), we will review it fast, and if accepted, you need to publish in the conference proceedings only an extended abstract.</p>
<p>Even though this time the JBP does not cosponsor the International Vacuum Insulation (IVI) Symposium, the journal has the great pleasure of announcing</p>
<list id="list2-1744259112460749" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>11th International Vacuum Insulation IVIS on 19 and 20 September 2013: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.empa.ch/ivis2013">www.empa.ch/ivis2013</ext-link>, contact <email>ivis2013@empa.ch</email>, Conference Secretary, Martina Koch, EMPA, Überlandstrasse 129, CH-8600, Dübendorf.</italic></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Finally, the JBP has the pleasure of announcing and will partly cosponsor the conference papers in our scope of interest (again printing online before the conference, while the extended abstract is printed within the limits of the conference paper).</p>
<list id="list3-1744259112460749" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>8th International Symposium on Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning—ISHVAC 2013, to be held at Xi’an University of Architecture &amp; Technology, Xi’an, China, from 10 to 13 October 2013.</italic></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>More information about ISHVAC 2013 can be obtained from Prof. Angui Li, Chair of ISHAVC2013, School of Environmental and Mechanical Engineering, Xi’an Architecture &amp; Technology University, P.R. China or through the e-mail: <email>ishvac2013@gmail.com</email>.</p>
<p>Since 1991, this conference has been the premier international heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) conference initiated in China and played a significant role in the development of HVAC and indoor environment research and industry in China. It has always been well attended by researchers and academics from worldwide.</p>
<p>The conference will be focused on such issues as sustainable buildings, indoor environment, climate, power and energy systems, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration (HVAC&amp;R) components, modeling and simulation, building information and management, and renewable and recycled energy utilization.</p>
