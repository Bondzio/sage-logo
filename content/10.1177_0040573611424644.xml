<abstract>
<p>The problem of evil, or the question of how evil can exist with a God that is benevolent and omnipotent, has challenged theologians and moralists through the ages. Many have attributed evil to the gods; most theistic theologians have attributed it to humankind; a better, ontological solution is to attribute it to being. Three ontological solutions are reviewed, the traditional arguments, the modernist of Heidegger/Tillich, and postmodernist of Derrida. Building upon the thought of Heidegger, Tillich, and Derrida, a neo-ontological solution is proposed, which locates evil and suffering within a complex structure of being that is analyzed from the standpoints of experience and practice. God may be beyond being, but being best qualifies the benevolence and omnipotence of God.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0040573611424644" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Evil takes many forms, such as the four apocalyptic horsemen, purges of tyrants, or the transgressions of a Faust or Bernie Madoff. The existence of evil and suffering presents the problem of believing in the existence of a God that is both able (omnipotent) and willing (benevolent)—namely the theistic God of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. The problem is recognized by David Hume who refers to the early argument by Epicurus:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573611424644">1</xref></sup><disp-quote>
<p>If God is willing to prevent evil but not able, then he is impotent.</p>
<p>If God is able but not willing, then he is malevolent.</p>
<p>If God is both able and willing, then whence come evil?</p>
<p>Is he neither able nor willing, then why call him God?</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>John Mackie states the problem simply: “God is omnipotent; God is wholly good; and yet evil persists.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040573611424644">2</xref></sup> Alvin Plantinga acknowledges that the inconsistency of these three propositions usually represents the problem of evil, one which requires reconsideration of evil, omnipotence, and/or beneficence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040573611424644">3</xref></sup> Similarly, Charles Raven states, “Either God is neither able nor willing to eliminate evil; or he is able but not willing; or he is not able though willing; or he is both able and willing—of which only the last seems worthy of a deity—and the last does not happen.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040573611424644">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The problem is not unique to Christianity but rather exists for all theistic religions. It was raised for Brahmanism by the Buddha: “If God is good then why do men become murderers, thieves, unchaste, liars, slanderers, abusive babblers, covetous, malicious and perverse?” He then asked rhetorically, “Is this possible with the existence of a God who is good?” He pointed to the larger inconsistency of a perfect God creating an imperfect world: If Brahma “is permanent, consistent, eternal, unchanging, and will remain so for ever and ever. Then why are we who are created by that Brahma have come hither, all impermanent, transient, unstable, short-lived, destined to pass away?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040573611424644">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Having an importance warranting the designation of “theodicy,” the question is, Why would a perfect God create, cause or design an imperfect product, a product that included or tolerated evil? The apparent answer is that God cannot be perfect, at least not in the conventional sense of theistic perfection. The challenge for theists (and for deists who acknowledge divine design) is clear: To acknowledge the existence of evil and yet to explain and qualify how God can be both benevolent and omnipotent.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0040573611424644"><title>Solution #1: Traditionalist and Modernist Ontological Solutions</title>
<p>Traditional acknowledgements include the implausible denial that evil exists or the equally implausible admission—consider the Holocaust—that evil exists here but as part of a transcending scheme of divine love and justice. Such a scheme defies the understanding of mere mortals, which means if the scheme of God cannot be understood neither can the nature of God, which is the unsatisfactory conclusion of agnosticism.</p>
<p>The prevailing traditional acknowledgement is that evil originates from divine and/or human agencies. Both appear to be involved in the biblical Garden of Eden in which an omniscient God has to know the outcome of Adam’s “test” and is therefore complicit with the misuse of free will that results in sin and evil. This evil-originating, divine-human relationship suggests that God attends to the transgression, suffering, and evil of original sin from which arguably results the historical record of massive suffering and evil.</p>
<p>Not content just with the biblical Hebrew accounts of the genesis of the world and fall of humankind, early Christian theologians also sought out the rational explanations of Greek philosophers, particularly Plato’s eternal ideas and Aristotle’s syllogistic logic. Both were employed in early ontological arguments addressing the existence and nature of God; to wit, if eternal ideas exist and God is an eternal idea, then God must exist. The same applied to theistic traits such as the idea of perfection (or goodness, substance, omniscience, etc.) existing, so God being their exemplification, also must exist with these traits. Such arguments are advanced by many of the medieval theologians such as St. Anselm, also by Descartes in his fifth meditation, and even today such as by Kurt Gödel and Alvin Plantinga. Because the idea of evil also might be exemplified by God, such ontological arguments are considered here to be inconclusive and of only historical interest.</p>
<p>Of interest is the modernist ontology introduced by Martin Heidegger and developed by theologians such as Paul Tillich who concluded that God had no essence, indeed had no existence. This was not the traditional, syllogistic ontology, as Tillich acknowledged: “There are no valid arguments for God.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040573611424644">6</xref></sup> There are no valid arguments because “God does not exist. He is being-itself beyond essence and existence. Therefore, to argue that God exists is to deny him.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040573611424644">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The non-existence of God was a radical idea for most theologians still in the mid-twentieth century, but not altogether new. Karl Barth had concluded in his <italic>Epistle to the Romans</italic> that God was a “wholly other” that was inaccessible to humankind. The idea of such a remote God was appealing, given the horrible evils of twentieth-century wars and genocide. Barth wrote his book at the ending of World War I and suffering of a destitute Germany. Tillich grew up in post-war Germany, left with the start of the Nazi regime in 1933, and then witnessed the destruction of World War II, dividing of Germany, and the threatening nuclear annihilation of the Cold War. Existence had become very flawed, experientially by unimaginable evil and conceptually by existentialists such as Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre who regarded existence to be absurd and smitten with angst. Reading Tillich, one gets the feeling that the world is a dangerous mess and that theology is best served by placing God as far away as possible.</p>
<p>Tillich sought his non-existent, infinite God through the Heideggerian being that includes the distinction between the divine infinitude of “<italic>sein</italic>” and worldly finitude of “<italic>dasein</italic>.” In his discussion of “the reality of God” in <italic>Systematic Theology</italic>, Tillich repeatedly stated that God is being itself, and so transcends non-being as well as human beings. He then added the idea of the “power of being,” to combat non-being and enable transcendence from the worldly finitude of <italic>dasein</italic> to the divine infinitude of <italic>sein</italic>.</p>
<p>Evil occurs through the debilitating power of non-being, resulting in the long-recognized Christian belief in human sin or imperfection or what Saint Augustine called the privation of man. As the goodness of God fought with the evil of Satan, based on the earlier Zoroastrian struggle between Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu that led to Manicheanism and present-day apocalyptic Christianity, so humankind must counter non-being. For non-being has the power of nihility; thus, “Existence is continuously threatened and saved by things and events which have no ultimate concern;” the results are the loss of “being and meaning,” separating “infinity,” “totality” disrupted in time and space, limiting “conditions,” and necessity over “destiny.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0040573611424644">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Tillich wrote more about anxiety and suffering than about evil, as have most existentialist-minded theologians. Suffering is the effect of evil, and more importantly because of its direct link to being, suffering is a necessary cause of evil, individually as well as collectively. The evil of the mid-twentieth century wrought by Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin followed from both being beaten constantly and severely as boys by their hateful fathers, so severely that they were in comas and expected to die.</p>
<p>“Non-being” is a voluntaristic term that offers little insight into the complex structure (the finitude, boundaries, impermanence, and deconstruction) of existence or being. It is also something of a Protestant term in the sense that suffering believers must tough it out, through stern Nietzschean <italic>wille zur macht</italic>, which is a doomed project. Tillich fails to overcome the ontological chasm between divine infinitude and human finitude, and so eventually must depend upon a theology of divine manifestation.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0040573611424644"><title>Solution #2: Postmodernist Ontological Solution</title>
<p>Ontology became a better theological tool forged and provided by Derrida than what Heidegger provided prior to the 1960s when Tillich wrote his <italic>Systematic Theology</italic>. Like Heidegger, Derrida balked at using ontology to solve theological problems such as the existence of evil, first for being an avowed atheist, although something of a mystic that John Caputo emphasizes in his provocative book <italic>The Prayers and Tears of Jacques Derrida</italic>. Second is Derrida’s criticism that Heidegger’s ideas such as spirit (<italic>geist</italic>), promise (<italic>versperchen</italic>), and fallenness (<italic>verfall</italic>) resembled Christian ideas, making his ontology like a theology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0040573611424644">9</xref></sup> Heidegger’s method of unconcealment or <italic>destruktion</italic> required a more radical deconstruction of ontology and metaphysics as well as ontotheology.</p>
<p>Derrida’s being does not consist of Tillich’s eternal moments, infinitude, non-being, power of being, and other meta-theological idealizations. And it certainly does not include the modernist thought about being still prevailing at the start of the twentieth century prior to the calamitous evil of two world wars, such as Bertrand Russell’s description of being in 1912 as “unchangeable, rigid, exact, delightful to the mathematician, the logician, and builder of metaphysical systems.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0040573611424644">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Being is what is pregiven and preconceptual to all idealizations and logocentric constructions of essence. Its contents consist of sensory data; instincts such as fear and desire; sensations, impressions, perceptions, and noumena; emotion, sentiment, affect; subconscious delusions and other phantasms; subconscious/conscious memory. Its supporting conditions (without which there would be no sense or order) consist of matter, energy, the forces, time/space, body/brain; also the mental conditions include consciousness, experience, language, and memory. Being is subtle, varied, and complicated, especially the contents of being (to the unfortunate neglect of the conditions of being) that have been the basis for the theology of postmodernists such as John Caputo, Kevin Hart, Jean-Luc Marion, Mark Taylor, and Gianni Vattimo.</p>
<p>Derrida agrees with Tillich that humans are made imperfect, finite, and generally denied the authenticity of their being, a common theological understanding dating back to Saint Augustine’s recognition of human privation. But Derrida locates this imperfection not in human or divine subjects but rather in being, particularly in the <italic>différance</italic> permeating the relation between the essence of language and the contents of being. As a semiotic concept, <italic>différance</italic> is the absence of linkage between identifier and identified or referent, as indicated earlier through the notion of <italic>arbitrare</italic> by Ferdinand de Saussure. As an ontological concept, <italic>différance</italic> is the disconnection between the essence constructed through words and the bare being of unconstructed things and events. Words and images are only traces with no origins, making etymology a self-enclosed history with no etiology.</p>
<p>For Derrida, the aim of theology to name or describe God is futile; for here there is no material or actual referent, no demonstrable link between the referent and signifier. What exists between signifier and referent is <italic>différance</italic> plain and simple. And there is no avoiding <italic>différance</italic>; for it “is not only irreducible to any ontological or theological—ontotheological—reappropriation, but as the very opening of the space in which ontotheology—philosophy—produces its system and its history, it includes ontotheology, inscribing it and exceeding it without return.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0040573611424644">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Clutching to his Derridean faith, John Caputo may remonstrate, “God is not <italic>différance</italic>.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0040573611424644">12</xref></sup> Nonetheless, even the most vague image or general idea is relativized and finitized by <italic>différance</italic>. God is just another construction that can be and must be deconstructed, and unlike other terms, “God” has no referent that is material or even existential. For Derrida—and this is why he professes atheism—God is a potentiality that will never be actualized and a becoming that will not come, that will never address <italic>différance</italic> and the disconnection between God and humankind.</p>
<p>Evil and suffering result from the failure to recognize <italic>différance</italic> and its practice of deconstruction to keep open the many arbitrary meanings of words or signifiers. This is not just a forgetful moment or overlooked incident resulting from individual failure as assigned by Tillich. Instead, it results from the collective and institutional program to close and control memory, to control history, ultimately to control meaning and to close down open-ended, free thinking. Derrida illustrates the point in his essay <italic>Archive Fever</italic>, which refers to the deliberate attempt by the keepers of archives to maximize the natural disconnection between the essence constructed through words and the bare being of things and events, to stamp the official version of essence upon whatever had happened. Archive fever infects all of society, done by politicians, intellectuals, educators, advertisers, et al. Caputo concludes, “Archive fever is not a finite, limited threat, not one threat among others, but an in-finite threat. Archive fever ranges over and infiltrates every evil, <italic>engageant l’in-fini</italic>, getting itself involved in everything.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0040573611424644">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Archive fever also affects theologians and practitioners of religion. What happened in religious history is sanctified in scriptures and by religious-organized societies, to be disbelieved at the peril of guilt and damnation. This is not the evil of non-being attributed to the disbeliever as presented by Tillich and most theologians, but rather is the evil of being inculcated in the memory and thought of all believers and of the failure to recognize <italic>différance</italic> and maintain a measured skepticism and open-mindedness about religious narratives and practices, starting with “God” as their chief referent.</p>
<p>For Derrida, evil appears to thrive at the heart of being through the routine disconnecting of the words and forms of essence and the things and events of being, deliberately disconnected by all controlling institutions including religion—easily done, perhaps inevitably done, because constructed histories, stories, narratives and perspectives misconstrue and conceal being anyway. Much of this is not new; for example, religions oppose scientific findings that conflict with the stories or narratives of their scriptures. Whether attributed to the disbelievers or believers, individuals or societies or cultures, or to deficiencies of human understanding regarding the divine, evil results from that which is finite and relative, less than whole, from the lack of power to attain being (whether by believers such as Tillich and disbelievers such as Nietzsche), going back to what Paul called sin and Augustine called privation. And for postmodernists, evil results in the failure to recognize the actual disconnection or <italic>différance</italic> between the essence of language and contents of being and to keep the possibilities of language open.</p>
<p>Is the postmodernist God only an impossible possibility? As Derrida admits, the potentiality and becoming are always out there, or indeed being-there (<italic>dasein</italic>), that always takes on the conceived essence of a future that Camus says does not exist, but still there in the image of the deconstructed and formless desert that is Derrida’s own metaphor for being—something out there beyond, formless and non-existent, silently calling.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0040573611424644"><title>Solution #3a: Neo-ontological Solution and Experience</title>
<p>The neo-ontological solution favored here has its own question for theology: How might God be experienced through the experience and practice of being? The answer has to suppose that experiencing God is subject to the “structure” of being that includes boundary and form, being-there (<italic>dasein</italic>) in time and space, Derridean <italic>différance</italic>, and the dynamic structure of the constant construction and deconstruction (condestruction) of essence. It has to suppose further that God cannot be perfect and theist (omnipotent, benevolent, responsive, etc.), not if subject to such an ontological structure. Onto-divine imperfection would cause suffering, loss of faith and Edenic innocence, Kierkegaardian angst, and eventual evil.</p>
<p>All ontotheologies link God to being; so with the proper theological understanding and practice, theoretically, the experience of being may be the experience of God. But being is not God but rather is minimally the province of God, and the experience of being has boundaries of identity, of what it is and is not regarding otherness, and it has the limits of spatial-temporal context. Identity has the boundaries of difference and negation; space has the limits of distance and finitude; time the limits of duration and perishing. The ultimate and ubiquitous limit is death, which is not of life <italic>in toto</italic> but rather is of my life as the <italic>sine qua non</italic> for experience and being. Death involves <italic>dasein</italic>, which Heidegger says is not of another or all life but is of my life; therefore the death of <italic>dasein</italic> is my death.</p>
<p>For Derridean theology, being and God are a constant process of becoming, which differs from the theologies that range from Plato to Tillich and that speak of being as being-itself, being-in-itself, being-for-itself, and so forth. The preconceptual contents of being—pregiven to essence and supported by necessary conditions such as mind and matter—nonetheless become constructed (also deconstructed) as essence. Being is essentialized—and concealed, as Heidegger understood so well—through everyday language or even the more reality-based or empirical languages such as scientific equations or artistic forms. Analogically, the God experienced through being as the ultimate referent becomes constructed experienced as essence.</p>
<p>An essentialized god is preferred because it is constructed as a craven form that is experienced “here” and “now.” The real God is formless and not experienced directly in a “here” and “now” but indirectly in a distant “there” and “then.” The real God is always becoming and never arriving, always in the future that never becomes the present, and always at a distance beyond experiential horizons. It is Joseph Campbell’s God of a thousand craven faces and therefore of no face. It prompts Caputo to confess, “I do not know whether what I believe in is God or not.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0040573611424644">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The problem of not knowing what to believe in God is an old one, confessed by Augustine 1,500 years ago. But it now can be recognized as the construction and deconstruction (condestruction) of God as an ongoing experiential process. The condestructed God continually arises from construction, abides in the experiential event of the present, and then ceases from deconstruction, perishing completely or returning to the past.</p>
<p>Suffering derives not from non-being, as supposed by Tillich, but from the perpetual perishing of the condestruction of God. Attached to an illusory god of essence, humans experience anxiety, privation, pain, fear of death, and other suffering. The term “anxiety” derives from the Latin “<italic>angustiae</italic>,” which means “narrows,” which refers to the boundaries and limits of essence. Anxiety sets in, not only because of attachment to an illusory god, but also because of the fear and trembling of not being able to experience the real God. This is the existential angst described by Kierkegaard: “If the eternal is posited, the present becomes something different from what a person wants it to be. He fears this, and thus he is in anxiety about the good.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0040573611424644">15</xref></sup> Similarly, Sartre refers to God as an ultimate referent or totality:<disp-quote>
<p>The being of human reality is suffering because it rises in being as perpetually haunted by a totality which it is without being able to be it, precisely because it could attain the in-itself without losing itself as for-itself. Human reality is therefore by nature an unhappy consciousness with no possibility of surpassing its unhappy state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0040573611424644">16</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>What both Kierkegaard and Sartre recognized results from the recognized <italic>différance</italic> between the eternal and present and the impossibility of experiencing a totality.</p>
<p>However, the neo-ontological solution comes in the apparent form of a Derridean aporia that applies to suffering that results from all things essentialized but especially to God who is never realized or completed, consummated or achieved, never something fulfilled, but rather a non-actualized actuality that is always in a future that never comes. Caputo calls such becoming an “event,” which occurs when being becomes essence and God becomes god. He provides the reminder that events are not actualities but possibilities: “Events are never present, never finished or formed, realized or constructed.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0040573611424644">17</xref></sup> God is always in the future, and the future never comes.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0040573611424644"><title>Solution #3b: Neo-ontological Solution and Practice</title>
<p>Just as theology matters to practice, practice matters to theology. Most people subject God to the essentialist structures of ordinary prayer that draws upon narratives, liturgies, testaments, prophecies, and Platonic ontologies and theologies. There is an ontological difference between an ordinary prayer conducted by Pat Robertson and meditation conducted by the Dalai Lama, which is the difference between the forms and craven images of essence and the contents of being.</p>
<p>A theology based on neo-ontology requires the alternative of a contemplative or meditative practice. Whereas the God of conventional prayer is defined and usually personalized, the God of contemplative prayer or meditation is not defined, usually depersonalized as a nameless presence or being. No longer a personalized or essentialized object, God is opaque in nature. The word “God” is often considered a metaphor for an indefinable being or spirit that mortal humans cannot name and objectify.</p>
<p>Contemplative or meditative practice harkens back to Meister Eckhart: “I pray God to rid me of God.” The proper practice is the stoic one of acquiescing, by accepting and appreciating what is already given and not requesting interventions and changes. Some acquiescing can be found in Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, particularly in monasteries, but it is emphasized in Buddhism and other Eastern practices.</p>
<p>Contemplative and meditative practice became widespread as an alternative practice, starting with the advocacy of Thomas Merton and spurred by the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, New Age movement, growing popularity of Buddhism, increasing demographic-cultural importance of Asian Americans, and growth of “progressive” Christianity. An example is Thomas Keating’s practice of “centering prayer” that is silent and receptive. Increasing numbers of Christians use contemplative or meditative prayer as a method to clear their minds of self, emotion, and essence. Asking little or nothing of God, they seek to access the immanent truth, beauty, and goodness of God. They are passively taking stock of the being that is here, passively accepting what is given rather than actively seeking what is wanted.</p>
<p>Most conventional believers suspect this unity and passivity with God and self and reject it as mysticism. Christians disregard the unity in the name of Gnosticism; Muslims contain it in the name of Sufism, and Jews in the name of Hassidism. Their theological reason is that people aspire to be like gods. Their institutional reason is that people as gods no longer need churches or their teachings.</p>
<p>Neo-ontological-based theology assumes that being is a window to God that is seen after the covering curtains of human constructed essence have been pulled away. It recognizes that the clearing away or penetration of essence involves all sorts of aporias spinning around the central problem of how to penetrate the essence of experience and thought without constructing, as Derrida has cautioned, yet another layer or folding or covering of logocentric thought.</p>
<p>An opening strategy is the Buddhist concept of “right effort,” which when applied in meditation results in no (essence-constructing) effort, or metaphorically speaking by entering the gate to nirvana that when once entered is no longer a gate. Such effort suggests that the being of nirvana lies beyond essence and that once-passed essence is no longer essence, which points to the experience claimed by Christians who practice “centering” or other contemplative prayer. Whether nirvanic, divine, or otherwise, being is assumed to prevail before and after the condestruction of essence, and realized through right effort.</p>
<p>Other than Buddhist emptiness and nirvana, what else might right effort find? The deconstruction of essence such as a constructed “god” does not produce a complete vacuum. There are remainders of the being before and after condestruction, remainders that are the conditions or lights of being that lie beyond the horizon of existence and illuminate the forms of essence. Although bare of the formal language and thought involved in the construction of essence, being is the ground, plane or milieu that is absolutely necessary and pregiven for essence to occur and be constructed, such ground consisting of physical/bio/mental absolutes such as matter, energy, body, and mind. This pregiven absoluteness of being realized through right effort corresponds with the contemplative experience of the pregiven absoluteness of God. Some practitioners such as Philip Kapleau believe that the eight-fold path is too short, that a ninth-fold is needed to go beyond mere emptiness or nirvana in the direction of some transcendental entity or force.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0040573611424644">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The ever-skeptical Derrida would insist that such ontic or divine remainders are only linguistic “traces.” But even as the arbitrary, impermanent traces of language, remainders as well as contents are the referents of being, and they are revelatory clues. After the experiential moments of essence have come and gone, ontic remainders stay to tell the ontologist their story about the absolute conditions of being and the events of its becoming, as rocks remain to tell the geologist about the origins and events of the earth or as cosmic background radiation lingers to tell physicists about the origin of the universe. And they tell the theologian that the God of being is always already there, making unnecessary the consequent construction of a god of essence.</p>
<p>Of course, finding being is no mean task, and still less so for finding the being of God. To go beyond the suffering and illusions of essence, practice requires bracketing and penetrating the familiar, reassuring everyday essences and gods that most people take for granted, indeed want to take for granted, in lieu of seeking something unnamed, uncanny and strange, with non-recognizable limits or boundaries and unintelligible infinitude. And it requires the proper practice and exertion of “right effort” exercised by hermetic masters and monastics in remote settings.</p>
<p>Practice starts with the deconstruction of I as self. Without the deconstructed “I” of the practitioner, a sense of God would not exist—“God is” requires “I am” (not as a Cartesian idea but as a condition of being). Following Descartes, Jacob Needleman states, “Genuine thought about God both demands and supports a definite change of consciousness within oneself. A definite glimpse of the experience ‘I am’.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0040573611424644">19</xref></sup></p></sec>

<p>Heidegger and Derrida probably would take issue with the structuralism of the neo-ontological perspective proposed here for evil. Suffice it to say that not all of the structures of ontology are mere metaphysics or traditional ontologies, that glib and oily art of philosophers who predicate and deconstruct not. Heidegger’s own <italic>dasein</italic>-centered ontology is not all metaphysics, nor are the postmodernist ontotheologies by some of Derrida’s most inventive supporters such as John Caputo.</p>
<p>Another issue is ontotheology—“past,” “post,” or “neo.” As Merold Westphal points out, Heidegger was anti-onto-theo-logical (to say nothing of Derrida), and so rejected ontology that comprises a theology that depends on logic rather on than on faith, which was the critical position of Kierkegaard and which now will require “overcoming onto-theology.” He suggests that onto-theology “refuses to accept the limits of human knowledge.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0040573611424644">20</xref></sup> But what are the limits of human knowledge such as those of ontology to theology, and where would we be if Galileo had accepted the limits of Pope Paul V or Father Georges Lemaître accepted the limits imposed on the creation of the universe in his day? We have the opportunity for faith, and hopefully the opportunity to continue to acquire new knowledge to guide our faith in the future.</p>
<p>Regarding the basic issue of evil, our neo-ontology finds its origin in the suffering resulting from <italic>différance</italic> and other structural elements of being—not in God or mankind as such, nor in theories about natural biological aggression, decadent culture, or fated providence. But the damage still is done to a theistic God, one that appears to be uninvolved (and therefore non-benevolent or impotent to be benevolent) in the structure and dynamics of being. Nonetheless, God and being share a pregiven absoluteness. Furthermore, being (if not God) can be experienced through proper practice.</p>
<p>While resisting becoming ontotheological, this neo-ontology raises the question of the link between being and God. Certainly, humankind is subject to <italic>dasein</italic> in its essential forms and thrownness into the world. Perhaps <italic>sein</italic> has theological implications, as Tillich believed. Ontologies vary, but the static, unchanging, eternal ontologies inspired by Plato and described by Russell are no longer acceptable, especially given the calamitous evil of the twentieth century. Like theologies, ontologies also must be modified to account for evil.</p></sec>
