<abstract>
<p>The surface modification of a porous silicon membrane is presented in this paper. The base porous silicon membrane is fabricated by anodization and has a range of pore sizes and porosities. In order to change its wettability, the surface of the porous silicon membrane is modified using silane-octadecyl-trichlorosilane. The average contact angle of the modified porous silicon membrane against water exceeds 126°. This modified membrane is incorporated to form part of the anode plate in a novel passive micro direct methanol fuel cell. Its use leads to a decrease in methanol crossover and an increase in the operating time.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As a result of its large specific surface area, low reflectivity, adjustable pore size and porosity, porous silicon has found use in many applications, such as a carrier for catalysis reactions and a plate in water and gas testing instruments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740349912451222">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740349912451222"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740349912451222"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740349912451222"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740349912451222"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740349912451222">6</xref></sup> Additionally, the anodization process used to form porous silicon, is cheap and is compatible with the standard microfabrication techniques used in the semiconductor industry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740349912451222">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740349912451222">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The nanometer-scale structure of electrochemically fabricated porous silicon has a high reactivity in an oxidative environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740349912451222">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740349912451222"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740349912451222"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740349912451222">9</xref></sup> There are numerous Si–H bonds on the surface and the walls of the pores in freshly etched porous silicon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740349912451222">7</xref></sup> After the oxidation process, the Si–H bonds are replaced by Si–O bonds, and thus –OH groups are formed naturally, making the surface of the porous silicon hydrophilic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740349912451222">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In order to meet different needs in various fields, the wettability of an ideal material should be able to be changed using simple methods. Both chemical processing and physical methods have been studied in the literature. A simple method is surface adsorption, however, in this case the adsorbed layer tends to flake off.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740349912451222">10</xref></sup> Another physical approach for hydrophobization is to enhance the surface roughness using tribological methods, however, in this case any existing porous structure can be destroyed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1740349912451222">11</xref></sup> Considerable attention has been paid to the use of chemical approaches because they are easy to perform and have excellent properties, including stable physical and chemical properties and good covalent bonding with the substrate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740349912451222">12</xref></sup> The principle behind the chemical approach is to graft organic molecules onto the hydrophobic groups using covalent bonding. It has been reported that fluorinated organic thin films, which were determined by the –CF<sub>3</sub> group, were a good candidate for surface modification due to their unique chemical stability and anti-adhesive properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1740349912451222">13</xref></sup> Dodecylamine, which readily reacts with carbonate groups to produce a hydrophobic surface, has also been successfully used to create surface modifications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1740349912451222">11</xref></sup> The excellent stability properties of alkylsilane molecular films, which contain a hydrophobic alkyl group, have resulted in their widespread use in surface modification studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1740349912451222">14</xref></sup> In addition, it has been reported that silicane which has a long carbon chain and is hydrophobic, can create modified surfaces with excellent hydrophobicity properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1740349912451222">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1740349912451222">16</xref></sup> Thus, it appears that an alkylsilane with a carbon chain is an ideal system for surface modification of porous silicon. The combination of the rough structure of porous silicon which aids hydrophobization and the hydrophobic self-assembled organic films formed by alkylsilane means that it might be possible to form a surface of porous silicon that was super hydrophobic.</p>
<p>In this paper, silane-octadecyl-trichlorosilane (OTS) is used to realize the hydrophobization of porous silicon. The contact angle of water, pure methanol and methanol solution against a surface-modified porous silicon membrane are measured. The membrane is hydrophobic for water but wettable for methanol, and thus it is an appropriate material for use in a passive micro direct methanol fuel cell (µDMFC).</p>

<title>The principle of surface modification</title>
<p>The chemical formula of OTS is CH<sub>3</sub> (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>17</sub>SiCl<sub>3</sub>, and the molecule contains a long chain alkyl group (–C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>37</sub>), which is hydrophobic, and a hydrophilic functional group (–SiCl<sub>3</sub>). The OTS modification is a silanization process following a three step reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1740349912451222">Figure 1</xref>). In step 1, the Si–Cl bond hydrolyzes in water to form a Si–OH bond, in step 2, the hydrolyzed OTS molecule is absorbed onto the substrate, and in step 3 adjacent hydroxyl groups (–OH) undergo a condensation reaction and eliminate water. After the polymerization reactions, a self-assembled OTS film forms which is hydrophobic as a result of the –C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>37</sub> functional group.</p>

<title>Experiments</title>
<p>Considering the prposed experimental program, the porous silicon membrane was fabricated on an anode plate of a µDMFC. The detailed process can be found in Zhu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740349912451222">5</xref></sup> The porous silicon membrane was formed by anodization (40% HF solution: pure ethanol = 2:1, volume ratio) under a current density of 120–240 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, an inductive coupled plasma was applied to etch the cathode side of the plate and form pores in the membrane.</p>
<p>For surface modification, the plates were cleaned in H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (3:1) solution at 120 °C for 30 min. Then the samples were rinsed in deionized water and dried in a flow of N<sub>2</sub>. After that the samples were modified to be hydrophobic using OTS/ toluene solution (OTS: toluene = 1:500, volume ratio), at a temperature of 18 °C for 30 min. Finally, the samples were rinsed in chloroform and then in acetone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740349912451222">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>The porous silicon membrane</title>
<p>The morphology of the porous silicon was analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1740349912451222">Figure 2</xref>). The average diameter of pores ranges from 10 to 30 nm and the calculated porosity ranges from 35% to 60%, for an anodization current density value between 120 and 240 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. This shows that a high current density creates large pores. In fact the pores almost perforate the porous silicon membrane.</p>

<title>The surface contact angle of the porous silicon membrane</title>
<p>The contact angles of the samples were measured to determine whether or not the self-assembled OTS film is hydrophobic. The bigger of contact angle, the more hydrophobic is the material. Both the growth start side and the growth termination side of porous silicon were chosen to measure the surface contact angles, and the results show that there is no difference between the surface contact angles on these two sides.</p>
<p>The contact angle against H<sub>2</sub>O is 126.0°, indicating that the self-assembled OTS film formed on the porous silicon is hydrophobic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1740349912451222">Figure 3(a)</xref>). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1740349912451222">Figures 3(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1740349912451222">(c)</xref>, the self-assembled OTS film is not only unwettable for H<sub>2</sub>O but also for methanol solutions. However, it is wettable for pure methanol since the contact angle against pure methanol is only 56.1° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1740349912451222">Figure 3(d)</xref>). This indicates that the surface of the self-assembled OTS film formed on the porous silicon membrane allows methanol diffusion but prevents water diffusion.</p>

<title>Analysis of hydrophobization on the inner wallsof the pores</title>
<p>The thickness of the porous membrane is about 200 µm, thus the contact angle of the inner wall of a pore cannot be measured directly. The scattering energy spectrum of the porous silicon membrane was measured to investigate if a self-assembled OTS film was formed on the walls of the pores. The percentage of carbon in the porous silicon membrane is only 2.18% before hydrophobization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1740349912451222">Figure 4(a)</xref>) whereas it is 8.96% after the hydrophobization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1740349912451222">Figure 4(b)</xref>). Thus, the only explanation for the increasing percentage of carbon is that it is caused by the OTS film. In other words, there are self-assembled OTS films formed on the inner walls of the pores in the porous silicon membrane, indicating that the hydrophobization was successful.</p>

</fig>
<p>The chemical nature of a pore wall in porous silicon depends on the chemical bond formed on the surface of the pore wall. It has been reported in the literature that several bonds, such as Si–O and Si=O bonds, exist on the surface of the pore walls in porous silicon after an oxidation process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740349912451222">12</xref></sup> These Si–O and Si=O bonds make the structure of the pore wall similar to the Si/SiO<sub>2</sub> interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1740349912451222">13</xref></sup> and thus the contact angles for both Si and SiO<sub>2</sub> substrates were measured to analyze the wettability of the pore walls of the porous silicon. The Si and SiO<sub>2</sub> samples were surface modified using the same conditions as for the porous silicon membrane.</p>
<p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1740349912451222">Figure 5</xref> the contact angles for the Si sample against H<sub>2</sub>O, 1 M methanol solution and 3 M methanol solution are all larger than 90°, indicating that the self-assembled OTS film formed on the silicon substrate has good hydrophobicity properties, however, the contact angle against pure methanol is only 44.8°. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1740349912451222">Figure 6</xref> shows that the surface wettability of the SiO<sub>2</sub> sample is similar to that of the Si sample. Thus, it can be inferred that the inner wall of the pore is also hydrophilic to methanol but hydrophobic to water. We can draw the conclusions that the OTS coating technique can be used to create a porous membrane and that this membrane could be used in a passive µDMFC.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This paper presented a surface-modified porous silicon membrane that contained pores with sizes between 10 and 30 nm and a porosity level between 35% and 60% depending on the fabrication conditions. The created porous silicon membrane was subsequently hydrophobized using OTS. The contact angle of H<sub>2</sub>O against the hydrophobized porous silicon membrane exceeded 126°. A prototype of a passive µDMFC containing the membrane was assembled and shown to have an OCV of 0.7 V and a maximum power density of 12.5 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> at room temperature. The membrane could also find use in microfluidics systems and diffusion membrane applications.</p>
