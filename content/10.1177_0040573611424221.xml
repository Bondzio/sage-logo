<abstract>
<p>North American Christians increasingly spe	ak of the church’s missiological task in a post-Christian context. The situation of the church in Eastern Germany offers us important insights. This area, once the heart of the Reformation, is now among the most secularized parts of the world. Most people no longer know basic Christian language or practices. They are either indifferent about matters of faith or suspicious that Christianity, like all religion, is bizarre and life-denying. This essay argues that the church as minority nevertheless has creative possibilities within a secular society. In such a situation, the church will commit itself to breaking down the walls that keep people away. Non-Christians must see that Christians are truly committed to others’ well-being. They must experience in the lives of Christians that God brings to life everything that lets humans be truly human. Advertising campaigns, appeals to a vague interest in spirituality, or musical and cultural events in church buildings will be less important than personal contact. Every church member has a responsibility to know the gospel and to represent it at work and in society. Theology plays an essential supporting role in this process. As Christians think critically about the gospel and the church’s responsibility to humanity, they see possibilities for justice and peace that the wider society does not recognize but desperately needs. The church even as minority is a wellspring of hope.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0040573611424221"><title>Atheism as the Social Milieu</title>
<p>In 2006, the Evangelical Church in Germany issued an “impulse paper” entitled “Church of Freedom.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040573611424221">2</xref></sup> The paper addresses the question of how the Evangelical Church can prepare for the future. Right at the beginning, it declares, “the social situation is favorable.” “People are asking about God again. Religious themes are drawing a great deal of attention… . The widespread indifference toward the Christian faith that characterized the last decades is yielding [!] to a new interest in viable, foundational values and reliable orientation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040573611424221">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>This description of the current situation is—in brief—false for Eastern Germany. More than 20 years since the end of “real existing Socialism” (Communism), over three quarters of the population in the new federal states profess no faith and are not religious in any serious sense of the word. In East Berlin, only 9.1 percent of the population belongs to the Evangelical Church; in many parts of the city, is it barely 2 percent. The “return of religion” or the “respiritualization” of society that is observed in Western Europe and other parts of the world is not evident here. The expectation that people would return to the churches or any other religious worldview after the collapse of the 40 year-old atheistic dictatorship proved false. Even religious sects have had little success here, despite initial fears. The eastern part of Germany has become a religious desert. While the so-called “achievements of Socialism” have rapidly disappeared, Communism nevertheless left behind a special kind of atheism in the overwhelming majority of the population. It created a social climate in which life without the Church and without faith has become a basic, self-evident assumption. Most of the population has simply grown accustomed to living for the long haul without faith in God.</p>
<p>This getting used to life without God has led to a deep spiritual rupture with the past and therefore with Christian traditions and values that once imprinted themselves on the wider culture. Christian faith and Christian piety are no longer present in families. It is already the case that one’s grandparents, perhaps even great-grandparents, were not in the church; neither are one’s neighbors, friends, or work colleagues. A social milieu has arisen that pushes aside everything that has to do with “religion.”</p>
<p>This milieu has continually regenerated itself since the changes in society 20 years ago. Today it impacts the new generations especially by way of the public schools. Most teachers were able to keep their jobs after the “Wende” (the velvet revolution of 1989). Formed by their old habits, they still transmit atheistic convictions. They give new life to the assertion, for example, that religion is “unscientific” and belongs to the past. Under such circumstances, it is very hard to establish religious education in the schools, even though it is guaranteed by the German Constitution. In Berlin, religious education is presently pushed to the side by a required class on “ethics.” The schools get away with it, because both teachers and parents are overwhelmingly of the opinion that “religion” does not belong in the schools.</p>
<p>It would be misleading, however, to equate this resistance to the church’s educational tasks with a militant campaign against believers from the side of the non-confessing population. The atheism that has become habit or custom is quite different from the kind of European atheism impassioned by the call for freedom or liberation. To encounter that kind of atheism today, you have to go further west, for example, to the so-called “new atheists,” who enlighten people about the depravity of religion and belief in God. The non-confessing population in Eastern Germany has, overall, no interest in that kind of enlightenment. Their atheism is characterized much more by a complete indifference about belief in God. Such people no longer lose sleep over how to repudiate belief in God or to ground atheism. For them, belief in God is no longer worth fighting about. Characteristic are the responses that young people gave to a survey conducted at the central train station in Leipzig. When asked if they understand themselves “more as a Christian or more as an atheist,” they replied, “Neither one, we’re just normal.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040573611424221">4</xref></sup> Ah, but what is “normal”?</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0040573611424221"><title>The Task of Preparing the Way for Faith among Atheists</title>
<p>The question of which foundational convictions are “normal” in a non-confessional milieu is of great relevance for the church’s task of speaking about God and, therefore, for its mission in society. Clarification of this question could help the church to find the right way to speak about God in relation to what the non-confessing population of Eastern Germany takes to be a “normal” life. It turns out, however, that despite various surveys and experiences on the ground, it is not so easy to determine what is “normal” for those who live without God but are also not explicitly atheistic. We can nevertheless name several key factors that frame a way of life in which God has been forgotten and atheism, too, has become uninteresting.</p>
<p>First of all, the worldview of dialectical and material atheism, which during the socialist times undermined people’s faith, doesn’t play a significant role anymore. Only a few old party members still hold to that complicated worldview, in which “matter” has developed itself through a series of “dialectical jumps” to the level of human consciousness. This worldview also depicts the laws by which history develops according to “class struggle.” These constructions have with good reason almost completely disappeared from the discourse of our time about the basic conditions of humans’ earthly existence.</p>
<p>But, second, the “normal” of which the young people in Leipzig spoke is not a complete denial of all inherited values. It is not nihilism. To be sure, in the non-confessional milieu there are occasional phenomena of moral deterioration that generate concern. These phenomena result when people experience life as meaningless. Isolated expressions of right-wing extremism in Eastern Germany belong in this category. But we can be certain that the vast majority of the non-confessing population will have nothing to do with this kind of extremism. On the contrary, it regards “anti-fascism” as part of its Socialistic socialization. Atheistic non-confessionalism is characterized instead by an attitude that resists all extremism and just wants to “get along with everyone.”</p>
<p>The third factor is that those people who accommodated themselves to Socialism as it was practiced in the German Democratic Republic interiorized values of cultivating community, including a readiness to help others, a sense of solidarity, a strong affirmation of everyone’s place in society, and a commitment to justice. This non-confessional milieu contributes strongly to social harmony. Where this milieu, however, has been and continues to be deficient is in respect to the possibilities of innovation and freedom in a democratic, pluralistic society. Personal, free involvement in social causes that go beyond one’s own familiar circle is not highly valued. In addition, many people still live with the disappointment of having once trusted in a totalitarian worldview that failed to deliver what it promised. Institutions that promulgate a comprehensive worldview therefore have a hard time finding members. Political parties and trade unions suffer as much as the churches do. Even an organization like the “humanist society,” which has atheism as part of its official program, is nothing more than a splinter group, even though it claims to represent the whole non-confessing population.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the non-confessional milieu seems unresponsive to questions about the great challenges facing humanity as a whole. This indifference is reflected in recent findings of the “Identity Foundation” (corresponding in large part to the “Religion Monitor” of the Bertelsmann Foundation).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040573611424221">5</xref></sup> In regards to “spirituality in Germany,” 40 percent of the population can be designated as “unworried everyday pragmatists.” While this phenomenon is on no account limited to the East, it is broadly apparent here. People understand themselves to be nothing more than a product of nature. They find meaning by making the best that they can, for as long as they can, of their limited existence. They care for themselves and their children, and then hope to disappear from the world with as little pain as possible.</p>
<p>One can question whether a life that claims to be satisfied with the limitations of earthly existence, and that exhausts itself within those limitations, is really “unworried.” Even this kind of life inevitably becomes “worried” by problems that a moderately hedonistic conception of life cannot avoid. The non-confessional milieu is not exempt from failures in career and society, loss of social recognition, experience of human evil, shattering of human relationships, physical or spiritual illness, and ultimately death. People therefore need an ethic that will teach them how to deal with their problems in a way that deepens their humanity, instead of repressing their disappointments for as long as possible, only to find themselves before a pile of rubble. But in the non-confessional milieu, such an ethic appears only as the respectable life wisdom of a few select individuals. The multiplication and individualization of worldviews that a pluralistic society brings about everywhere also turn this milieu into a choir of diffuse voices.</p>
<p>One conviction nevertheless unifies the East German choir. Neither God nor institutional religion is needed to master the fundamental problems of human existence. Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s critique of a Christian apologetic that would demonstrate to “religionless people” their need for God as a problem-solver and “gap-stopper” for the unanswered questions of human existence remains relevant in this context.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040573611424221">6</xref></sup> Whoever knocks on the door of the non-confessional milieu to proclaim God as problem-solver can reckon with the door being slammed in his face, which according to Bonhoeffer is exactly what should happen. He calls it “ignoble” to try to pressure people into faith by digging around in their weak places.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040573611424221">7</xref></sup> Moreover, he found it unworthy of God when we cheaply sell him as a product to help people feel better. If genuine faith in God is to arise, it must occur by means of the freedom in which God’s Spirit encounters us, and not as a religious mechanism that mere humans set into action.</p>
<p>What the Evangelical Church can do to fulfill its task of preparing the way for God’s free encounter with people in a non-confessional climate is therefore the principal question before the church in Eastern Germany.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0040573611424221">8</xref></sup> What is to be said about God and how is faith in God to be represented in the life and behavior of Christians, so that people who have long forgotten God and yet are not truly atheists can again become attentive to God? How do we approach “everyday pragmatists,” who while thoroughly respecting humanistic values just busy themselves with their own existence? How can people who are content with themselves again sense God’s Spirit as a living reality? Those are the most urgent issues before the church in an atheistic milieu—a church that must act missiologically if it is to be true to its task. The question is whether the churches and congregations in the new federal states are in any kind of condition to undertake this mission.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0040573611424221"><title>The Difficulties of Mission</title>
<p>In view of the immensity of this task, many people are skeptical about placing mission at the center of church and congregational service. Mission appears to be an illusion in the garb of abstract theological correctness. In reality, the churches and congregations do already have their hands full in maintaining themselves as part of a national organization with all of its buildings and institutions. But since the time of the early church, mission has meant that the apostles of Christianity go out to non-believers and make a home among them. Nothing less needs to happen in the religionless atmosphere of Eastern Germany. In my opinion, faith in God can emerge only when people make personal contact with people who believe.</p>
<p>In this atmosphere, distance from faith cannot be resolved from the outside. A media sound blitz just bounces off. For typical “Ossis” (East Germans), news reports only confirm that religion and the religions have to do with something absurd. People throw everything into the same pot: the supposed miracles of the late Pope, and the Islam of suicide bombers; those trampled to death next to the Kaaba in Mecca, and those who attend huge church congresses in Germany; belief in the resurrection, and the journey of the soul after death; the Dalai Lama, and the Jesus-freaks on the Kurfürstendamm in West Berlin; the blood orgies of the Passion of the Christ à la Mel Gibson, and the Da Vinci Code. If anyone in the non-confessing population asks about religion, he or she asks about this sort of thing, and not about the ways in which religion gives meaning to us as Christians and is deeply humane.</p>
<p>People in Eastern Germany therefore need conversation partners to help them find their way through this religious mess and determine what constitutes genuine belief in God and what is religious nonsense. Presently, however, members of the Evangelical Churches in Eastern Germany are able to serve as such conversation partners only to a limited degree. Church and congregational realities in the East are the same as farther west. The congregation has a small, actively involved core, while most members are only loosely connected to the church and regard it as a religious services provider to which they turn if and when they have need, as for baptisms, weddings, and funerals—and perhaps on Christmas Eve. Church leaders in called positions can hardly respond adequately to the non-confessional context. They are completely loaded down with maintaining congregational life, accomplishing administrative tasks, and dealing with financial and building matters that really do not belong to their calling.</p>
<p>Pastors, Christian educators, church staff members, church deacons, and others are overburdened because of the dramatic downsizing of positions since the “Wende.” The low levels of church membership in the new federal states do not support the personnel and program that the church needs to fill its inherited structures with new life. The churches in West Germany help out with a so-called “financial compensation.” Individual congregations often show great willingness to donate money. Local foundations raise money for church buildings and special projects. But none of these efforts reverse the trends that undermine the church’s missionary task.</p>
<p>Because the number of church leaders in called positions is shrinking, the church has had to eliminate entire areas of ministry. Parishes have been made larger in size, in order to finance the called positions that remain. Some parishes are now the size of a former diocese. I know a pastor who is responsible for 13 congregations; most of their buildings are in dire need of repair. The churches in Eastern Germany seek to compensate for their weakness on the ground through a process of “fusion.” Even the deeply anchored <italic>Landeskirchen</italic> (regional church bodies) with their important local traditions have had to pay the price, as demonstrated in the case of the union of the Berlin-Brandenburg Church with the Schleisian Oberlausitz Church, or the new Central German Church Union.</p>
<p>As sensible as this strategy is at the regional level, it is deeply problematic over the long haul in relation to congregations. While there are similar developments elsewhere in Germany, they are occurring at such a rapid pace in the East that they affect the church’s ability to fulfill its commission to every member of society. In many places, only the minimum can be done to preserve congregational life. Especially in rural areas, which suffer under a continuing exodus of young, working-age people to the West, empty spaces are already appearing on the church map.</p>
<p>In order to counter this situation, one diocese of my <italic>Landeskirche</italic> has developed and implemented a new model of church service. The diocese now consists of only four general pastorates. Other pastors in the diocese are assigned particular functions—for example, youth work, adult education, or women’s work. This project has understandably upset many people and has been partially halted. The problem is this: pastors are no longer personally present in a particular place. They are not living among the people. They make an appearance only as religious “functionaries,” thus robbing themselves of the very basis for communicating faith in God. During the communist East German time, we lost people by the masses. They will be won back again only one by one. Our churches must get used to this reality. But since most individuals have contact with the church only accidentally, church membership is stagnant or shrinking. Efforts to promote the church’s contributions to German cultural life do not alter the situation. Musical or other cultural activities in churches are like plays in theatres. They do not commit the non-confessional population to anything. If the churches in Eastern Germany are to grow significantly, the church’s focus must fall squarely on building up congregations, quite apart from the matter of attending to people who are sympathetic to the church’s cultural function.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0040573611424221"><title>A Minority with a Future</title>
<p>Given the current situation and according to human judgment, we can expect in the foreseeable future no “megatrend” of non-confessing people moving toward faith or the church. We have to reckon with the reality that several generations of the non-confessing population now see life without faith and church as final. It is nevertheless doubtful that future generations will experience this atheistic non-confessionalism as a fixed social fact. The non-confessionalism that expresses itself as indifference about faith and the church has no inherent spiritual or cultural power to shape the future. It is only a negation. It relies on ethical and cultural borrowings from elsewhere to provide orientation for the future. One can recognize this phenomenon in the <italic>Jugendweihe</italic> (youth dedication ceremony) that continues to flourish in Eastern Germany. During the communist days, it functioned as a religious-like substitute for the church’s confirmation ceremony, which only proves that this non-confessionalism does not have the ability to organize itself in any comprehensive manner out of its own resources.</p>
<p>In contrast, church congregations even in their minority status have significant religious, intellectual, and cultural potential. One can even say that they are a jump ahead in relation to those matters that deeply touch human existence. This potential must not be underestimated. This country would look entirely differently if there were no church. The important impulse paper of 1995 in the East German Church did not simply repeat an article of faith, when it said <italic>quod una sancta ecclesia perpetuo mansura sit</italic> (the one holy church continues perpetually).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0040573611424221">9</xref></sup> Rather, it made clear that the church has a longer future than any “unworried everyday pragmatism” or any surrender to pseudo- or substitute religiosity. A church that trusts in this future will get beyond just maintaining itself, and will begin even now to make a priority of familiarizing the non-confessional, God-forgetful population with faith in God.</p>
<p>I cannot give even an overview of all the good, innovative, and creative things that are happening in and thanks to congregations, such as the establishment of Christian schools and kindergartens. These initiatives draw public attention to the church, help people to overcome fear of contact with the church, and radiate Christian faith into society. There is also reason to be thankful for everything that has been done in recent years to give congregations a more inviting appearance from the outside. I wish, however, to focus on three points that deserve much more attention.</p>
<p>First, the fact that church leaders in called positions—especially pastors—can no longer fulfill the church’s commission all alone has resulted in greater attention to the so-called “honorably serving” (volunteers, without pay). It is wonderful that so many church members are ready to help out. But we should be aware that the category of “honorably serving” comes from the world of voluntary associations. By contrast, the Reformation insight of a “priesthood of all believers” means that every believer is responsible for the proclamation of the gospel and for representing his or her faith in a world that he or she shares with non-believers. Because people lacked such ability in communist times, it took little pressure for the state to separate them from the church. Congregations should therefore do everything possible to help Christians understand their responsibility to set forth the faith outside of the church, where one works and lives and spends his or her free time. It is essential in Eastern Germany that faith manifest itself in those places where people distant from the church actually live their lives. The Church should encourage and enable this active expression of the Christian life in preparing people for baptism, in Christian education, in confirmation classes, and (desirably) in religious education in school. The lazy, passive consumer of religious services will not help the church in Eastern Germany move ahead.</p>
<p>Second, children’s and youth work, including ministry to parents and young adults, should logically be the focal point of the church’s service on the ground. When we think of the coming generation, we see the chance to begin anew, without the ballast of prejudices and bad experiences that many German people had with the church in the past. We can again emphasize what gives the Christian message its strength, namely, that God in his humanity brings to life everything that lets us be truly human—in brief, faith in God’s clarity and clarifying power, hope in the future, and love for our fellow human beings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0040573611424221">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Third, in order to hold these two things together—God and true humanity—the church must acquire intellectual and spiritual concentration. The religious pluralism of contemporary society tempts the church to experiment with whatever approaches the transcendental, the mysterious, the esoteric, the meaningful, or the uplifting. We should not simply negate these dimensions of life. The truth of Christian faith is supported by the discovery that we humans are more than those things that we can control. But this pluralism can also entangle us in a jungle of religious vines that choke the voice of the gospel. To keep a clear eye for what is possible or not possible in this regard may be harder now than it was in relation to the monistic worldview of communist East Germany. In any case, the church must develop an ability to answer critically for the truth of the gospel, and to be self-critical of its own practices.</p>
<p>Given the church’s many tasks, its ability and willingness to do this critical work has—to put it mildly—not grown since the “Wende.” When I think about the way in which theological books that made it across the Wall in communist times were so eagerly snapped up, today’s disinterest in theology is deeply troubling to me. We East German Christians have gotten too stuck in our difficult, everyday church work. Theology is no miracle cure. It cannot take the place of faith, hope, and love, or the spiritual life. But when it focuses us on the truth of the Christian faith, it helps sustain the spiritual expansiveness that we need for our task. Theology helps clarify the questions that have to be clarified if we are to invite other people to faith.</p>
<p>These questions include whether God is almighty or powerless, a person or an impersonal power; whether he rules over the world and our life, or leaves us and the world alone to our own devices; whether he is the same God whom other religions honor, or not. If congregations give the impression that they themselves don’t know what to say about such fundamental matters, they will have a hard time attracting others to Christian faith.</p>
<p>What is needed, then, is a church in which a growing number of people are capable of taking responsibility for the truth of the Christian faith. Such a church concentrates on the coming generation and remains spiritually and intellectually awake. A church that is really on the way to other people and enters into their world has no reason for resignation, even when the work of reminding people about God makes only slow progress. To be sure, the Christian churches in Eastern Germany have become a minority. But that quarter of the population that concentrates on the riches of God’s humanity already has a huge jump ahead into the future in comparison to the diffuse non-confessional milieu.</p></sec>

Ziegler, <italic>Doing Theology When God Is Forgotten: The Theological Achievement of Wolf Krötke</italic> (New York: Peter Lang, 2007); and Christopher Holmes, <italic>Revisiting the Doctrine of the Divine Attributes: In Dialogue with Karl Barth, Eberhard Jüngel and Wolf Krötke</italic> (New York: Peter Lang, 2007).</p></fn>
