<p>Cost-benefit analysis is commonly understood to be intimately connected with utilitarianism and incompatible with other moral theories, particularly those that focus on deontological concepts such as rights. We reject this claim and argue that cost-benefit analysis can take moral rights as well as other non-utilitarian moral considerations into account in a systematic manner. We discuss three ways of doing this, and claim that two of them (output filters and input filters) can account for a wide range of rights-based moral theories, including the absolute notions of moral rights proposed by Hayek, Mayo, Nozick, and Shue. We also discuss whether the use of output filters and input filters can be generalized to cover other non-utilitarian theories, such as Kantian duty ethics and virtue ethics.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is applied in numerous situations for weighing the benefits against the costs of a decision in a systematic way. Examples range from minor decisions taken in private firms to large-scale societal decisions affecting thousands or millions of citizens. By performing a CBA one can estimate the total surplus of benefits over costs and thereby rank the available options before a decision is made. In this article, we consider the application of CBA to large-scale societal decisions and explore what ethical assumptions, if any, advocates of CBA are committed to. The standard view is that CBA is intimately connected with utilitarianism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470594X11416767">

</xref>
</sup> However, in contrast to this widely accepted view, we argue that there is enough flexibility within a CBA to accommodate moral rights as well as other non-utilitarian moral views. It is a mistake to think that advocates of CBA are, or ought to become, utilitarians.</p>
<p>When we claim that CBA can ‘accommodate’ or be rendered ‘compatible with’ some non-utilitarian moral theory, we mean to say that it can be designed to take into account the same ethical considerations as that moral theory. To be more precise, we take a CBA to be compatible with a (utilitarian or non-utilitarian) moral theory M if and only if an advocate of M has no good reason to object that societal decisions are guided by the CBA, and in particular, has no good reason to believe that the CBA would recommend other action(s) than M.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470594X11416767">

</p>
<p>CBA is often taken to be incompatible with moral theories that focus on deontological concepts such as rights and duties because on the face of it, there will be many occasions on which a course of action will produce more benefits than costs, while at the same time violating rights and shirking duties. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470594X11416767">Adler and Posner (2006</xref>: 157) write that ‘we happily concede that CBA does not track deontological, egalitarian, or non-welfare-based values. Nor do we see how CBA might be rebuilt to do so.’ Kelman takes this to be a serious objection to CBA. In his words:<disp-quote>
<p>The notion of human rights involves the idea that people may make certain claims to be allowed to act in certain ways or to be treated in certain ways, even if the sum of benefits achieved thereby does not outweigh the sum of costs. In areas of environmental, safety, and health regulation, there may be many instances where a certain decision might be right even though its benefits do not outweigh its costs. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470594X11416767">Kelman, 1981</xref>: 36)</p>
</disp-quote>Kelman’s conclusion is that non-utility-based considerations cannot be reduced to a question of whether benefits outweigh costs. Caney makes a similar point with regard to risking the violation of people’s rights through our failure to make proper efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change. He claims that it is inappropriate to adopt CBA ‘when we are considering cases where <italic>some</italic> (high emitters who are affluent) are exposing <italic>others</italic> to grave risks and jeopardising their rights' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470594X11416767">Caney, 2009</xref>: 177).</p>
<p>We believe that the sceptical conclusions put forward by Adler and Posner, Caney, and Kelman regarding the possibility of rendering CBA compatible with non-utilitarian moral theories can be overcome. The aim of this article is, consequently, to show how CBA can be rendered compatible with a number of rights-based as well as some other non-utilitarian moral theories. To be more precise, we shall provide a detailed account of how CBA can be rendered compatible with rights-based moral theories proposed by leading scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470594X11416767">Hayek (1960)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470594X11416767">Mayo (1960)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470594X11416767">Nozick (1974)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470594X11416767">Shue (1996)</xref>. We shall also explain why CBA cannot be rendered compatible with some other non-utilitarian moral theories. The conclusion of the article is thus that CBA can, contrary to what several authors have claimed, take <italic>some</italic> moral theories which emphasize rights and other non-utilitarian moral considerations into account in a systematic manner.</p>
<p>The structure of this article is as follows. In Section 2, we recapitulate some of the main characteristics of utilitarian theories and CBA, and point out that the latter is not a single well-defined methodology, but rather a set of more or less intimately connected ideas and techniques. Thereafter, in Sections 3 to 5, we discuss three proposals for how to include moral rights in a CBA. We argue that by adopting two of these three methods, which we call ‘output filters' and ‘input filters', CBA can be rendered compatible with the key elements of a wide range of rights-based moral theories, including the theories proposed by Hayek, Mayo, Nozick, and Shue. In Section 6, we broaden the scope of the discussion by arguing that non-utilitarian considerations other than rights, such as Kantian duties, could be accounted for in a CBA.</p>

<title>2. Utilitarianism and mainstream CBA</title>
<p>We define utilitarianism as the ethical theory holding that an action ought to be performed if and only if the surplus of (appropriately defined) good consequences over bad ones is at least as great as that of all alternative actions. In this context the term ‘action’ is used in a very broad sense and includes, for instance, regulatory decisions taken by government agencies as well as the introduction of new pieces of legislation. The term ‘consequence’ is also used in a broad sense. In principle, everything that affects human welfare, and possibly animal welfare too, as a result of a previously taken decision should be included in the list of consequences. Some utilitarians defend preference-based accounts of welfare, whereas others defend hedonistic views.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1470594X11416767">

</xref>
</sup> Consequentialism is a more general moral theory holding that the consequences of our actions, but nothing else, determine their moral status. Not all consequentialists agree with utilitarians that the total surplus of good over bad consequences is all that matters. Some consequentialists believe, for instance, that an equal distribution of good consequences is better than an unequal, but larger one. It has also been claimed that consequences not affecting anyone’s welfare, such as knowledge or beauty, should be added to the list of morally relevant consequences.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1470594X11416767">

</sup>
</p>
<p>It is not easy to suggest an uncontroversial, but yet substantive, definition of CBA. The reason for this is simple. CBA is not a single, well-defined methodology, but rather a set of slightly different (formalized) techniques for weighing costs against benefits in a systematic manner. We, however, take the following four principles to be key in what we shall call ‘mainstream CBA’: (1) Mainstream CBA assesses benefits and costs solely in terms of how they directly or indirectly affect people’s welfare; (2) mainstream CBA measures welfare by way of measuring people’s stated or revealed preferences, as reflected in their ‘willingness to pay’; (3) in mainstream CBA, benefits and costs are therefore assigned a common numeraire (money) in order to allow them to be weighed against each other; (4) mainstream CBA prescribes that the decision maker ought to choose an option that maximizes the net surplus of benefits over costs.</p>
<p>When formulated as above, there indeed seems to be a close connection between mainstream CBA and utilitarianism. The connection appears to be particularly strong between mainstream CBA and preference-based accounts of utilitarianism. This is because advocates of mainstream CBA measure welfare by observing stated or revealed preferences. Mainstream CBA is, in fact, sometimes seen as an institutionalised decision procedure corresponding to a utilitarian criterion of rightness. What ultimately makes a morally right action right is the fact that it brings about optimal consequences, but in order to find out whether an action is right or not one has to assess the available information in a systematic way by performing a (mainstream) CBA.</p>
<p>It would, however, be a mistake to think of principles 1–4 above as a list of necessary and sufficient conditions. It is, for instance, not always the case that all costs and benefits are measured in a common numeraire, although this is indeed very common. In multi-attribute CBAs, different benefits and costs are measured in separate numeraires.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1470594X11416767">
5
</xref>
</sup> It is thus more plausible to regard 1–4 as a set of interconnected ideas that are frequently, but not always, accepted by practitioners of mainstream CBA. Wittgenstein’s concept of family resemblance might help to illustrate this point: any two particular mainstream CBAs may share one or more of the key ideas, but there is no hard core of ideas that all advocates of mainstream CBA have to commit to. Questions about how different a CBA can be from mainstream CBA, but still remain a CBA are thus difficult to answer: all that can be said is that there must be enough family resemblance between the modified CBA and mainstream CBA. (We take it to be evident that the modified version of CBA to be developed here satisfies this criterion, that is, the modified CBA we propose is indeed a genuine CBA.)</p>
<p>The theoretical foundations of mainstream CBA rest on the Kaldor-Hicks criterion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1470594X11416767">
6
</xref>
</sup> This criterion is a weakened version of the Pareto principle.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1470594X11416767">
7
</xref>
</sup> The Kaldor-Hicks criterion holds that a redistribution that benefits some people while making others worse off is permissible if (and, possibly, only if) the benefits are so large that those who benefit could hypothetically compensate those who lose. No actual compensation is required. A mere possibility to compensate the worse off is sufficient. Suppose, for instance, that the government is considering expropriating a glass of tomato juice from Alice, who loves tomato juice, and giving it to Bob, who also loves tomato juice. This would make Alice worse off while making Bob better off, so the new state is not Pareto better. However, if the market price for tomato juice in Bob’s neighbourhood is much higher than in Alice’s, Bob could hypothetically sell a fraction of the tomato juice at a high price and give part of the profit to Alice. Suppose Alice could hypothetically receive an amount that would compensate exactly for the loss of the tomato juice. Then, since Bob would not have to sell <italic>all</italic> the tomato juice the government gave him in order to compensate Alice, this redistribution satisfies the Kaldor-Hicks criterion: after this hypothetical redistribution of goods, it would be possible for those who benefit to compensate those who lose.</p>
<p>The Kaldor-Hicks criterion is a non-utilitarian, albeit consequentialist, principle.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1470594X11416767">
8
</xref>
</sup> The claim that CBA can accommodate non-utilitarian moral views is thus, strictly speaking, trivially true: even mainstream CBA is based on a non-utilitarian moral theory. The fact that mainstream CBA is based on the Kaldor-Hicks criterion rather than some version of utilitarianism thus indicates that the link between mainstream CBA and utilitarianism is not as tight as many moral philosophers have claimed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1470594X11416767">
9
</xref>
</sup> People who actually perform mainstream CBAs do not think that their analyses are based on a strict utilitarian moral theory.</p>
<p>That said, the Kaldor-Hicks criterion is, of course, not used because people consider it to be morally superior to utilitarianism, which it most certainly is not. The reason why the Kaldor-Hicks criterion has become so influential is presumably that it is simple and easy to apply to real-world cases. However, many of the objections that can be raised against utilitarianism can also be raised against the Kaldor-Hicks criterion. So from a theoretical point of view, little is gained by pointing out that the Kaldor-Hicks criterion is a non-utilitarian principle. The question still remains whether CBA is compatible with some minimally plausible non-utilitarian moral theory, that is, with some theory someone might be willing to defend.</p>
<p>It is sometimes unclear what the normative status of the recommendations produced within mainstream CBA are supposed to be. While some scholars clearly think that mainstream CBA should be the sole guide when making decisions, others defend the much weaker claim that mainstream CBA should be just one factor to consider when making decisions. Those who hold this second view believe that other non-consequentialist aspects, such as rights, must be considered before a decision is made.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1470594X11416767">
10
</xref>
</sup> On this view, instead of prescribing that some particular option ought to be performed, mainstream CBA should be used merely for illuminating one aspect that is relevant when making decisions (namely, costs and benefits measured in terms of willingness to pay), while leaving it open to the decision maker to address other moral aspects at a later stage. This proposal thus seems to entail that there is a trivial way in which people who believe in, for example, moral rights could endorse CBA: people holding such views could first perform a mainstream CBA to learn about the costs and benefits of all options, measured in terms of willingness to pay, and thereafter take into account virtually any other moral aspect or principle before making a decision. However, although we agree that this is indeed possible, we believe that rights should instead be directly incorporated into CBA, allowing CBA to be the sole guide when making decisions. This is preferable to informally including rights and other non-utilitarian considerations separately from CBA because it enables the decision maker to clarify and assess factors considered to be relevant to a decision in a precise and transparent way. Transparency typically increases the legitimacy of a decision; it does so by making the decision more accountable to the public. In this way, CBA can be a means of preventing an agency or government from serving its own purposes; it gives outsiders the capacity to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the different proposals. If CBA is the sole guide when making decisions it will thus make these decisions more accessible to public discussion: it offers a language accessible to people who are not experts. This is because mainstream CBA converts all values into one numeraire, thus providing an accessible language. This is particularly important given that many decisions reflect the inputs of a variety of experts, whose information may not be accessible to those outside their fields. In order for the public to be part of the process of making such decisions, these judgements must be offered and debated in language accessible to non-experts. In contrast, if we accept the proposal that CBA is merely meant to inform, but not to guide decision makers, the moral considerations not included in the CBA will not be as transparent as the moral considerations directly addressed in the CBA. The public will not be able to ensure the legitimacy of decisions and non-experts may be unable to engage in debate about these decisions. So what appears to be a trivial solution to the problem of making CBA compatible with non-utilitarian considerations is, upon closer reflection, not an attractive solution. We thus proceed with the aim of directly incorporating non-utilitarian considerations into CBA.</p>

<sec id="section3-1470594X11416767">
<title>3. First proposal: Can we assign meaningful numbers to rights?</title>
<p>The first proposal for incorporating rights into CBA is to assign numbers to rights violations, as suggested by, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470594X11416767">Hansson (2007)</xref> as well as Zamir and Medina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470594X11416767">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470594X11416767">2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470594X11416767">Hansson (2007</xref>: 164 n. 2) writes that ‘Deontological requirements can be included in a CBA, for instance by assigning negative weights to violations of prima facie rights and duties, and including them on the cost side in the analysis.’ As long as we are able to assign the appropriate number to the violation of prima facie rights, such violations can then be treated just like any other kind of cost. Zamir and Medina develop an explicit proposal for how to do this for moral views that treat violations of rights and duties as non-absolute.</p>
<p>On Zamir and Medina’s proposal, ‘Incorporating deontological constraints into economic analysis entails the characterization of a threshold function, <italic>T</italic>, such that an act is permissible only if the value of this function is positive’ (2008: 352). They argue that the general form of the threshold function should be as shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1470594X11416767">Equation 1</xref>, where <italic>b</italic>(…) is an act’s relevant net benefit and <italic>d</italic>(…) is ‘the size of the minimum amount of benefits that is required to justify the infringing act (the threshold)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470594X11416767">Zamir and Medina, 2008</xref>: 352).<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1470594X11416767">

</disp-formula>Zamir and Medina’s approach is designed to appeal to what we shall call a ‘moderate deontologist’: someone who believes that rights (or some other deontological concept) are important, but also thinks that they can be overridden if other benefits are large enough. The theory of prima facie rights and duties put forward by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470594X11416767">Ross (1930)</xref> is a paradigmatic example. Practitioners of CBA can, in principle, use the Zamir-Medina approach to account for all of Ross's well-known examples of prima facie rights. Although people have a prima facie right not to be harmed, it may turn out that because of various mitigating factors, one’s all-things-considered obligation may actually be to harm someone in order to achieve something that is morally more important.</p>
<p>Assigning the appropriate numbers to violations of prima facie rights (or any other kind of moral right) is not, however, an easy task. This can be illustrated by considering one of Zamir and Medina’s own examples (2008: 375). Suppose that we wish to determine ‘whether state officials should be authorized to shoot down an airplane suspected of being used as a weapon against human lives'. Zamir and Medina propose that in this choice problem the following functions <italic>b</italic>(…) and <italic>d</italic>(…) are appropriate:<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-1470594X11416767">

</disp-formula>They explain that</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The variable <italic>x</italic> is the expected number of people who will be killed or severely wounded as a result of the terrorist attack; <italic>y</italic> is the expected number of innocent people killed or severely wounded as a result of the preventive action; <italic>p</italic> is the probability that the terrorists will successfully carry out their plan if no preventive action is taken; <italic>q</italic> is the probability that the preventive action will kill the passengers; and <italic>K</italic> and <italic>K'</italic> are two constants, jointly constituting a combined, additive and multiplier threshold. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470594X11416767">Zamir and Medina, 2008</xref>: 375)</p>
</disp-quote>The constants <italic>K</italic> and <italic>K'</italic> are designed to capture certain intuitions about rights and duties. Clearly, the numerical values of <italic>K</italic> and <italic>K'</italic> will have a significant impact on what decision is taken. Government officials will be authorized to shoot down the airplane if and only if <italic>K</italic> and <italic>K'</italic> are sufficiently small in relation to the net benefit of doing so.</p>
<p>So how do we determine the correct numerical values of <italic>K</italic> and <italic>K'</italic> then? Although Zamir and Medina acknowledge that this is a crucial issue, they have surprisingly little to say about it. Their main point is that we should search for the answers in the ethics literature. The problem with this view is that moderate deontologists, such as Ross, are typically unwilling to state <italic>exactly</italic> how many innocent lives one must save for being permitted to violate someone’s right not to be shot dead by government officials. This means that the kind of information we need for determining the correct numerical values of <italic>K</italic> and <italic>K'</italic> is not available. Note, for instance, that if we are judging the badness of an action on the basis of its violation of prima facie rights, we cannot appeal to revealed or stated preferences. This is because, unlike actions whose negative value is dependent on how much people care about them and thus on their willingness to pay (for instance, the value of a local park may be determined by what people are willing to pay to prevent it from being bulldozed), the value of protecting prima facie rights is not reducible to the price people are willing to pay to ensure that they are respected. It is the nature of prima facie rights that they make justified claims on others, even if others fail to observe or value these rights. A prima facie right is morally valuable no matter what people are willing to pay to ensure it is respected. Consequently, if animals have a prima facie right not to be tortured, this right should be respected, valued, and, on the current proposal, represented in a CBA. However, as pointed out above, this is true even if people are not willing to pay for the protection of animals. We cannot therefore appeal to people’s willingness to pay as a criterion for assigning numbers to rights violations.</p>
<p>An alternative measure of the disvalue of a rights-violating action could be the total number of prima facie rights that are violated by the action. For example, an act which violates 200 people’s rights may be worse, <italic>ceteris paribus</italic>, than an act which violates 100 people’s rights. However, such violations may not have a constant value. If a person has more than one prima facie right violated, further violations of that person’s rights might count more heavily than the first violation (because the person’s overall liberty is more restricted). This may create difficulties, for if we commit to variable levels of disvalue of rights violations, it will not be a straightforward task to determine <italic>non-arbitrarily</italic> how much more disvalue to give to further violations (that is, violations beyond the first). For example, should a person’s second rights violation count twice as much as her first rights violation? Perhaps it should count one and half times as much? Moreover, should not the kind of prima facie right that is being violated count? It seems that some rights, such as the right not be tortured, should be assigned a higher value than, say, the right not to have your mobile phone stolen.</p>
<p>A third measure of the disvalue of a rights-violating action may be the number of years over which a person’s rights are violated. This is because long-term oppression may be worse than temporary restraints on liberty (because it may lead to negative impacts such as despondency, poor self-image, and so on). Again, the problem is that the number of years is not all that matters. Other aspects are also important. As pointed out above, other things that are also plausibly part of the disvalue in the violation of rights is the number of rights that are violated and the status or importance of these rights (most rights theorists maintain there is some kind of hierarchy of rights).</p>
<p>Given the various factors that may contribute to the disvalue involved in rights-violating actions, and the problems with assigning non-arbitrary numbers to these actions, it seems difficult to implement the Rossian idea of prima facie duties in CBA. In order to represent Ross's view accurately, very precise numbers will need to be assigned to various prima facie duties, and the final verdict would be very sensitive to the numbers one chooses.</p>
<p>It is also worth stressing that even if we did arrive at a comprehensive way to assign numbers accurately, this method would not work for those who think that rights are absolute, such as Nozick. This is because no matter what finite negative number is assigned to the violation of a right, such a violation could in principle always be compensated by sufficiently large advantages. This will not cohere with the view that rights are absolute. For instance, this group of moral theorists will insist that if we kill you, and thus violate your right to life, this cannot be morally compensated by, for example, donating some huge amount of money to the Red Cross that would enable them to save thousands of lives. An absolute right is indeed absolute.</p>
<p>It might be thought that a way to cater for absolute rights would be to assign an infinitely large negative number to the violation of such a right. There is a problem with assigning infinite negative numbers, however, because of the following type of case. Suppose there are two alternatives, to kill someone with certainty or impose a risk of one in a million which will, if the risk materializes, kill the same person. If a CBA were to take absolute rights into account by assigning an infinite negative number to rights violations, then there would be no moral difference between killing a person with certainty and killing her with a probability of one in a million, at least as long as a CBA takes the expected value to guide choices: if we multiply an infinite number with a small probability (the probability that a person will be killed), we get the same result as when we multiply an infinite number with one. Very few rights theorists would think of this as a genuine moral dilemma, in which the agent will do something wrong no matter what she does. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470594X11416767">Nozick (1974</xref>: 74–87) explicitly states in <italic>Anarchy, State and Utopia</italic> that there is a clear moral difference between these two cases: to impose very small probabilities of harm on people does not violate their rights, but killing a person for certain does.</p>
<p>In summary, the method of directly assigning numbers to rights yields implausible results for deontologists who think that rights are absolute. It is also difficult to see how this method can be non-arbitrarily applied to reflect the views of those who take rights to be moderate, that is, think they can be overridden in certain circumstances. We thus need a more promising method if we are adequately to accommodate views about rights in CBA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1470594X11416767">
<title>4. Second proposal: Output filters</title>
<p>Another way to incorporate considerations about rights into CBA is to view the exercise of rights as placing limitations on the actions that we are allowed to perform. This way of looking at rights does not posit rights violations as costs to be weighed alongside other costs and benefits. Instead, it views the exercise of rights as restrictions on what we are permitted to do. Nozick’s account of natural rights seems to align with this suggestion. He argues that we should think of rights as a <italic>constraint</italic> on the set of alternatives that society should be allowed to make decisions about. In his words, ‘Individuals have rights, and there are things no person or group may do to them (without violating their rights)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470594X11416767">Nozick, 1974</xref>: ix). Nozick’s idea is that rights fix those features of the world that we are not morally permitted to alter and it is within the constraints of these fixed features that we are permitted to act. Rights thus exclude certain options, and in this way help to define the set of options which we may choose from. Shue’s view of ‘basic rights' also conceptualizes rights as constraints on the set of permissible actions. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470594X11416767">Shue (1996</xref>: 18):<disp-quote>
<p>Basic rights are a restraint upon economic and political forces that would otherwise be too strong to be resisted. They are social guarantees against actual and threatened deprivations of at least some basic needs. Basic rights are an attempt to give the powerless a veto over some of the forces that would otherwise harm them the most.</p>
</disp-quote>Basic rights, on Shue’s view, specify the line beneath which no one is permitted to fall. In this way, having our rights fulfilled requires that there be constraints on the states of affairs that may be brought about. Along similar lines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470594X11416767">Mayo (1960</xref>: 188) has described rights as functioning as a ‘no-trespassing sign’, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470594X11416767">Hayek (1960)</xref> claimed that rights create a ‘protected sphere’.</p>
<p>This view about rights leads us to our second proposal, according to which the exercise of rights defines the set of options in which an option’s doing well on a CBA counts in favour of implementing that option. It does this by excluding certain options (those that involve moving morally fixed features, such as rights-violating actions) from the set of options that we are permitted to implement. By claiming that the exercise of rights defines the set of options in which an option’s doing well on a CBA counts in favour of implementing that option, we debar certain options from being recommended by CBA. Described in a different way, we apply an ‘output filter’ to decisions that may be recommended by CBA. In his discussion of social decision functions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470594X11416767">Goodin (1986</xref>: 78) explains that ‘Output filters can be conceptualised as barriers erected at the back end of the social decision machinery, preventing policies predicated on perverse preferences from ever emerging as settled social choices.’ We propose that this general point about output filters in social decision making can be applied in a CBA for accounting for rights.</p>
<p>The point we seek to make about the use of output filters in CBA is that we should not, contrary to what is proposed by advocates of the first method, understand rights in terms of the negative value they bestow on an action were they to be violated, but instead as placing constraints on the actions we are permitted to perform. We can view output filters as devices that fix features of the world whose movement would constitute rights violations.</p>
<p>An option’s doing well on a CBA thus counts in favour of implementing that option just in case that implementation will not involve moving fixed features and thus will not involve violating rights. In this way, the moral fixedness of certain features ensures that rights are not violated. However, this claim can be spelled out in at least two ways, namely, a non-permissive and a permissive way. We might apply the kind of non-permissive output filters discussed above: the exercise of rights fixes some features of the world, and an option’s doing well on a CBA counts in favour of implementing that option just in case its implementation does not involve the moving of these features. This proposal is compatible with the view that there are absolute rights. Note also that according to this proposal it is possible to reach an impasse in which all features of the world may be morally fixed. For instance, if we delay action on climate change for too long, all potential actions may involve the violation of future people’s rights, and in such a case, the view that the exercise of rights makes features of the world morally immovable prevents us from performing any action. This, of course, need not be a problem: for theorists holding the view that we sometimes face genuine moral dilemmas, in which all options are morally wrong, such an impasse is acceptable. The CBA will be merely reflecting the theory’s view that in such cases all acts are morally wrong.</p>
<p>However, it is also possible to construct a more permissive, alternative kind of output filter, which can be used by theorists denying the existence of moral dilemmas. According to such a permissive output filter, a proper consideration of people’s rights requires us to recognize that there are some features of the world that we are allowed to shift only under certain (possibly very rare) circumstances. Permissive output filters may appeal to ethicists who believe that rights are non-absolute. Perhaps it is, for instance, morally permissible to harm one person in order to save a thousand others. A permissive output filter accurately reflecting this moral view would then not delete this alternative (harming one in order to save a thousand) from the set of options that CBA can recommend. Another example in which the permissive output filter may allow us to violate someone’s rights (that is, to shift those otherwise morally immovable features), may be when there are no choices left (that is, when all actions will involve a violation of rights), or if the choices left are undesirable enough in a non-rights-violating way, such as in a case of extreme devastation to nature. Unlike a non-permissive output filter, this permissive filter prevents us from reaching an impasse. Whether this is a normatively plausibly proposal depends on which particular theory of rights one happens to subscribe to.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1470594X11416767">

</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Accommodating considerations about rights in CBA by thinking of the exercise of rights as permissive or non-permissive output filters is preferable to assigning numbers to rights violations, as described by the first proposal, for four reasons. First, this option will be preferred if one believes there is something inherently wrong with assigning numbers to rights or other entities that are ‘specially valued’. For instance, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470594X11416767">Kelman (1981</xref>: 36), ‘many environmentalists fear that subjecting decisions about clean air or water to the cost-benefit tests that determine the general run of decisions removes those matters from the realm of specially valued things'. Kelman argues that the very act of putting specific quantified values on things that are not normally quantified may serve to reduce the value of those things. In Kelman’s words (1981: 39):<disp-quote>
<p>When something is priced, the issue of its perceived value is constantly coming up, as a standing invitation to reconsider that original judgment. Were people constantly faced with questions such as ‘how much money could get you to give up your freedom of speech?’ or ‘how much would you sell your vote for if you could?’, the perceived value of the freedom to speak or the right to vote would soon become devastated as, in moments of weakness, people started saying ‘maybe it’s not worth <italic>so much</italic> after all.’ Better not to be faced with the constant questioning in the first place.</p>
</disp-quote>Non-permissive output filters clearly avoid Kelman’s objection. These filters do not require that a price be placed on the value of rights. But what about permissive output filters? We must concede here that permissive output filters require the CBA user to take a stance on the <italic>commensurability</italic> of rights violations and other costs. (This is because the recommendation of a rights-violating action must be based on information about which situations warrant shifting those features which are otherwise fixed. So, the CBA user employing this more permissive proposal must rely on this information when using the CBA to assess whether a rights-violating action can be recommended.) However, even permissive output filters do not involve assigning a price (or any other number) to rights violations which are to be weighed alongside other monetary costs. Permissive output filters thus avoid Kelman’s concern that assigning prices to ‘special things' serves to reduce the value of those things.</p>
<p>The second reason why accommodating considerations about rights in CBA through output filters is preferable to assigning numbers to rights violations is that output filters would be relatively easy to implement in current CBA methodology. Although radical rights theorists such as Nozick maintain that rights are <italic>all</italic> that matters, it seems plausible to maintain that a reasonable strategy for reaching societal decisions would be to ensure, first, that no rights are being violated and thereafter maximize welfare among the remaining options. This at least seems more attractive from a moral point of view than totally ignoring rights.</p>
<p>The third reason for using output filters rather than directly assigning numbers to rights is that it avoids implausible results for deontologists who think that rights are absolute. Output filters can be accepted both by those who think that rights are absolute and by those who think rights are moderate and can sometimes be outweighed by other considerations.</p>
<p>The fourth reason for using output filters rather than directly assigning numbers to rights is that it is quite informative about the structural conditions normatively reasonable output filters must fulfil. In order to see this, it is helpful to analyse output filters formally. From a formal point of view, an output filter can be conceived of as a function, f, that takes a formal choice problem as its argument and returns another formal choice problem.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1470594X11416767">

</xref>
</sup> A formal choice problem is defined as a set of ordered pairs, in which each element consists of a proposition representing an alternative course of action and a set of propositions describing the morally relevant features of that alternative, for example, the costs and benefits in terms of preference satisfaction, but also information about whether the action violates any moral right (according to the moral theory preferred by the decision maker).<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Definition 1:</italic> Let Ω be a set of formal choice problems. Function f is an <italic>output filter</italic> on Ω if f is a function such that for all formal choice problems <italic>ω</italic> ∈ Ω, it holds that f(<italic>ω</italic>) ∈ Ω.</p>
</list-item>
</list>A <italic>composite</italic> output filter is an output filter that is made up of other output filters. Consider, for instance, an output filter that first removes all alternatives that violate a certain type of right and thereafter removes all alternatives that violate some other type of right. This composite output filter can be conceived of as a composite function, (f ○ g)(<italic>ω</italic>) = g(f(<italic>ω</italic>)), where f removes alternatives that violate the first type of right and g removes alternatives that violate the second type of right.<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Definition 2:</italic> If f and g are output filters, then (f ○ g)(<italic>ω</italic>) = g(f(<italic>ω</italic>)) is a composite output filter.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Although the design of an output filter will, of course, ultimately depend on which moral theory one accepts, it can be argued that all normatively reasonable output filters must satisfy certain basic structural properties. Let us briefly consider what these structural properties might be.</p>
<p>We shall assume that the decision maker is able to rank formal choice problems (ordinally, not cardinally) with respect to how attractive they are from a moral point of view. For example, a formal choice problem comprising no rights-violating actions will be more attractive than one that does, everything else being equal. Let [Ω, ≽] be a comparison structure for formal choice problems, in which Ω is a set of formal choice problems, and ≽ is a binary relation on Ω corresponding to the English phrase ‘at least as morally attractive choice problem as'. We shall assume that ≽ is a complete, reflexive, and transitive relation. The relations ≻ and ~ can be defined in terms of ≽ in the usual way. We furthermore assume that all sets of filters discussed here are <italic>closed</italic> under composition.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1470594X11416767">

</sup> We propose that the following axiom, first formulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470594X11416767">Peterson and Hansson (2005)</xref>, holds for all output filters and all <italic>ω</italic> ∈ Ω.<list list-type="bullet">

<p>
<italic>Weak monotonicity:</italic> (g ○ f)(<italic>ω</italic>) ≽ f(<italic>ω</italic>) ≽ (f ○ f)(<italic>ω</italic>).</p>
</list-item>
</list>The left inequality, (g ○ f)(<italic>ω</italic>) ≽ f(<italic>ω</italic>), states that an output filter g should never throw a spanner in the work carried out by another output filter f. The choice problem obtained by first applying g and then f has to be at least as good as the representation obtained by applying only f. The right-hand inequality, f(<italic>ω</italic>) ≽ (f ○ f)(<italic>ω</italic>), states that nothing can be gained by immediately iterating an output filter. For example, an output filter that is designed to remove all alternatives that violate someone’s right to life must remove all such alternatives in one step, rather than remove just one right-violating alternative every time the filter is applied.</p>
<p>Why should we accept the weak monotonicity axiom? In our view, the best argument for the right-hand side of the axiom, f(<italic>ω</italic>) ≽ (f ○ f)(<italic>ω</italic>), is the following. Since CBA is a decision-making procedure, agents cannot be required to apply an output filter an infinite number of times, not even if the decision maker is choosing among an infinite number of alternatives (which is theoretically possible). Filters should therefore be convergent in the sense that for every <italic>ω</italic> ∈ Ω there is some number <italic>n</italic> such that for all <italic>m</italic> ≥ 1 it holds that (f ○)<sup>n+m</sup>(<italic>ω</italic>) ≽ (f ○)<sup>n</sup>(<italic>ω</italic>), where (f ○)<sup>n</sup> denotes <italic>n</italic> iterations of filter f. Otherwise the output filter could be repeated indefinitely and yet its full capacity for improving the choice problem would not have been used. However, in case an output filter is convergent in the sense just defined, it can be replaced by a single output filter that satisfies (f ○ f)(<italic>ω</italic>) ≽ f(<italic>ω</italic>) for all f and <italic>ω</italic>.</p>
<p>This brings us to the left-hand side of the weak monotonicity axiom. Why should we believe that, for all f, g, and <italic>ω</italic>, (g ○ f)(<italic>ω</italic>) ≽ f(<italic>ω</italic>)? As explained above, intuition is that a filter g should not interfere with the improvements achieved by another filter f. One way of guaranteeing this is to require that each output filter must always return a formal choice problem that is as morally attractive as the one it was applied to, that is, no filter is allowed to have a negative overall impact on the formal choice problem. It takes little reflection to see that output filters satisfy the left-hand side of the weak monotonicity axiom.</p>
<p>The weak monotonicity axiom guarantees that output filters will have a number of attractive properties. Consider the following theorem.<list list-type="bullet">

</sup> Property (i) states that the application of an output filter to a formal choice problem will always yield a choice problem that is at least as morally acceptable as the one it was applied to. Property (ii) states that the acceptability of a formal choice problem will remain constant no matter how many times (greater than or equal to one) an output filter is iterated. Property (iii) establishes that output filters are order independent: they can be applied in any order. Lastly, property (iv) makes it clear that nothing can be gained by applying f more than once, no matter what other output filters were applied between the two applications of f.</p>
<p>Let us compare what we have said about output filters with the first proposal, that is, the idea that we can incorporate rights into CBA by directly assigning numbers to them. What, exactly, is the practical difference between output filters and the first proposal? In order to see this, consider a concrete proposal to set a standard for the emission of particulate matter from smokestacks.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1470594X11416767">
15
</xref>
</sup> Very few rights theorists think the standard must be set to zero. Therefore, no matter what standard we arrive at by using output filters, it seems that precise numerical information will be implicit in the output filters. For instance, if the filter tells us that the highest permissible emission is 50 units per ton, then this means that the use of output filters will also require numerical information. Therefore, since we criticized advocates of the first proposal for relying on numbers that are very difficult to determine, it seems that one could object that there is no or little point in using the second approach over the first.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1470594X11416767">
16
</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Our response to this objection is that it is important to distinguish between different ways in which numerical information is used in CBA. We note that advocates of both proposals need to be able to determine the number describing emissions of particulate matter that violates the rights of the public. Suppose, for instance, that we accept a rights-based moral theory according to which emissions of particulate matter from smokestacks violates the rights of the public just in case people will be severely damaged by the particulate matter. What counts as ‘severe damage’ is, we assume, something that medics can determine objectively. For instance, cancer or a detectably increased risk of cancer counts as severe damage. Then, advocates of both approaches could agree that emissions above that level violate the rights of the public. However, in addition to this number, advocates of the first proposal need to determine a number which describes the disvalue of the rights violation. In contrast, advocates of output filters do not need to determine any such number; they merely need a theory about when (if ever) such rights violations are justified.</p>
<p>This point can also be made in a more general way. In order to implement the first proposal in a practical way, we need to know (1) when something is a rights violation and (2) what negative number to place on a rights violation so that it can be weighed with other costs and benefits. In contrast, according to the second proposal, we need to know (1) and (3) the circumstances under which we are permitted to violate rights. Now, our point is that (3) is easier to ascertain than (2). In order to ascertain (2) or (3), we still, of course, have to first decide which moral theory to adopt. (It is beyond the scope of this article to come up with a method for deciding which moral theory should be adopted.) However, once we have done this, the second proposal will be much more amenable to use in practice, because it is easier to ascertain (3) rather than (2). That is, it is quite conceivable that a rights-based moral theory might contain enough information to enable us to infer from the theory the circumstances under which we are permitted to allow emissions of particulate matter from smokestacks which will cause an increased risk of cancer (and thus violate the rights of the public). On the other hand, it would be very unusual for a rights-based moral theory to contain enough information that would allow us to infer that a rights violation has the same negative value as, say, a loss of US$1000. Given this, the practical problems faced by the second proposal are mild in comparison to the practical problems faced by the first proposal.</p>
<p>We conclude the discussion of output filters by summarizing the four advantages over the first proposal (which directly assigned numbers to rights violations). First, the use of output filters merely requires qualitative comparisons. In this way, we avoid Kelman’s concern about placing prices on people’s rights. Second, output filters would be reasonably easy to implement in current CBA methodology. All we assume is that the decision maker subscribing to a (non-utilitarian) moral theory is able to adjudicate whether the application of an output filter to a formal choice problem returns a formal choice problem that is at least as attractive from a moral point of view. In many situations, it seems that decision makers would actually be able to make such comparisons. For example, a decision maker considering how to deal with a civil aircraft that has been taken over by terrorists could apply a Nozick-style output filter that removes the option of shooting down the aircraft, since that would violate the rights of the passengers. A third advantage of using output filters rather than directly assigning numbers to rights and duties is that this approach can be accepted both by those who think that rights are absolute and by those who think rights are moderate and can sometimes be outweighed by other considerations. In order to make CBA compatible with these views we must merely define the output filter in the right way. Finally, the fourth advantage of using output filters rather than directly assign numbers to rights, despite the relatively weak assumptions our approach is based upon, is that it is quite informative about the structural conditions normatively reasonable output filters must fulfil. However, despite the four improvements that output filters have over the first method, in which numbers are assigned to rights violations, the CBA framework can accommodate rights in further ways. The next section demonstrates this by introducing input filters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1470594X11416767">
<title>5. Third proposal: Input filters</title>
<p>According to some accounts of rights, output filters cannot ensure that all rights are respected in CBA. On one such an account of rights, the mere counting of certain consequences as a benefit in a CBA may constitute a rights violation, regardless of whether the CBA culminates in action. Consider the following example of Hansson’s.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Suppose that a CBA is made of a programme against sexual assaults. The sufferings of the victims should clearly be included in the analysis. On the other hand, few would wish to include the perverse pleasures experienced by the perpetrators as a positive factor in the analysis. Generally speaking, we expect a credible CBA to exclude positive effects that depend on immoral behaviour or preferences. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470594X11416767">Hansson, 2007</xref>: 173–4)</p>
</disp-quote>Hansson does not explain why we expect a credible CBA to exclude positive effects that depend on immoral behaviour or preferences. For him, this seems to be a claim in need of no further justification. However, it seems plausible to maintain that this is because it may sometimes constitute a rights violation. For instance, suppose we have a ‘right to dignity’, then it is plausible that we violate this right if we include the perverse pleasures experienced by the perpetrators as a positive factor in a CBA. Similarly, by including the satisfaction of racist preferences as a positive factor in a CBA, we may violate people’s rights to be free from prejudice, given that such a right exists.</p>
<p>We can relate this line of thought to a point made by Goodin about the disrespect that may be caused by giving official cognizance to certain preferences. According to Goodin, at times it may not merely be that we allow certain decisions to emerge out of a social calculus, but that we allow certain preferences as inputs to a social calculus, which disrespects people. When discussing the laundering of preferences in a democracy, he claims that we ‘show people respect or disrespect through our attitudes and motives, even if they do not culminate in actions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470594X11416767">Goodin, 1986</xref>: 80). Goodin’s point is that we need to filter not just the outputs, but also the inputs of a social decision function if we are to ensure the protection of people’s self-respect. In his words, ‘Input filters might be regarded as barriers erected at the front end of the social decision machinery, preventing perverse preferences from ever entering into consideration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470594X11416767">Goodin, 1986</xref>: 78). The function of input filters is not to stop people from giving voice to their preferences, but rather to refuse to take official cognizance of, or to socially sanction, perverse preferences. ‘Input filters will be required if we are to prevent the sort of humiliation that comes from the social sanctioning of mean motives' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470594X11416767">Goodin, 1986</xref>: 78).</p>
<p>This same point may be applied to CBA. To prevent the sort of rights violation that occurs when we count effects that depend on immoral behaviour as positive factors in a CBA, we may adopt input filters. In particular, we might preclude the satisfaction of certain kinds of preferences as counting as a benefit. For instance, we might exclude certain prejudiced preferences from counting as benefits in a CBA, because we may think that by recognizing the satisfaction of such preferences as a benefit in a formal process, we thereby show disrespect and violate people’s rights to be free from such prejudices.</p>
<p>If we deny that the satisfaction of certain preferences counts as a benefit, then such ‘benefits' never enter into the weighing of costs against benefits in a CBA. Importantly, however, this does not mean that the satisfaction of such preferences will not occur. There may be other reasons, independent of perverse preferences, for implementing a project, and this may result in the satisfaction of perverse preferences. But these perverse preferences should not in any way influence the outcome of a CBA. The use of this third method will be favoured if we think that the mere recognition of certain satisfied preferences as benefits in a formal process constitutes a rights violation, and thus while the second method is necessary for making CBA compatible with a respect for rights, it is not sufficient.</p>
<p>From a formal point of view, an input filter f can be conceived of as a function that takes a formal choice problem <italic>ω</italic> as its argument and returns another formal choice roblem <italic>ω′</italic>. Input and output filters are thus quite similar from a formal point of view. However, while output filters alter the set of alternative actions of the initial choice problem, input filters alter the propositions describing the morally relevant features of the alternative actions, for example, by removing propositions describing morally objectionable preferences. By broadening the definition of an output filter given in Section 4, we can provide a general analysis of both types of filters. We stipulate that f is a <italic>filter</italic> on Ω if and only if f is a function such that for all formal choice problems <italic>ω</italic> ∈ Ω, it holds that f(<italic>ω</italic>) ∈ Ω.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1470594X11416767">

</xref>
</sup> The definition of a composite filter is parallel to that given in Definition 2: if f and g are filters, then (f ○ g)(<italic>ω</italic>) = g(f(<italic>ω</italic>)) is a composite filter.</p>
<p>We propose that the weak monotonicity axiom applies to all normatively reasonable filters, that is, not just to output filters, but also to input filters. It takes little reflection to see that every reasonable combination of the two types of filters discussed so far, that is, output filters that remove rights-violating actions (irrespective of people’s preferences) and input filters that remove perverse preferences, satisfies the weak monotonicity axiom.</p>
<p>An issue not addressed by Theorem 1 is how <italic>many</italic> filters in a set of filters F the decision maker should apply. The theorems below show that all permutations obtained from the <italic>largest</italic> subset of filters satisfying weak monotonicity are optimal, that is, the decision maker is well advised to apply <italic>all</italic> filters that satisfy weak monotonicity, but may do so in any order she wishes. Formally, a permutation of F is any composite filter that makes use of every element in F exactly once. Hence, the permutations of F = {f, g} are (f ○ g) and (g ○ f).<list list-type="bullet">

</sup> In summary, the formal results discussed here show that if a set of filters satisfies weak monotonicity, then the agent may apply all filters in this set, in any order she wishes, and there is no requirement to apply any filter more than once. Furthermore, there is no other sequence in which the filters could be applied that would return a choice problem that is strictly better.</p>

<title>6. Is CBA compatible with all moral theories?</title>
<p>We have argued that considerations about moral rights can be accommodated in CBA by using output and input filters on formal choice problems. In this section, we address the question of whether CBA can only be rendered compatible with rights-based theories or whether some similar approach could be adopted for rendering CBA compatible with some, or all, other non-utilitarian moral theories.</p>
<p>We take it to be fairly uncontroversial that some other moral theories, such as a Kantian theory of perfect duties, could easily be rendered compatible with CBA by applying output and input filters along the lines described in Sections 3 and 4.<sup>

</sup> Kantians believe that some actions, such as lying and committing suicide, are always wrong no matter what the overall consequences are. This could easily be captured by an output filter that deletes all impermissible actions from the set of permissible alternatives. It is thus possible to render CBA compatible with some other non-utilitarian moral theories.</p>
<p>Can CBA be rendered compatible with all non-utilitarian moral theories? One reason we may think so is that a growing number of consequentialists believe that virtually every non-consequentialist moral theory can be ‘consequentialized’ and turned into a version of consequentialism (compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470594X11416767">Dreier, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470594X11416767">Peterson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470594X11416767">Portmore, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470594X11416767">Portmore (2007</xref>: 39) describes the process of consequentializing a non-consequentialist theory in the following way:<disp-quote>
<p>Take whatever considerations that the nonconsequentialist theory holds to be relevant to determining the deontic status of an action and insist that those considerations are relevant to determining the proper ranking of outcomes. In this way, the consequentialist can produce an ordering of outcomes that when combined with her criterion of rightness yields the same set of deontic verdicts that the nonconsequentialist theory yields.</p>
</disp-quote>Portmore’s point is that every moral theory that has traditionally been conceived of as non-consequentialist, can be reformulated and shown to coincide with some version of consequentialism by broadening the notion of good and bad outcomes (that is, costs and benefits). To do this, we take whatever considerations that, on the non-consequentialist theory, determine the deontic statuses of actions and let those considerations determine how different outcomes rank. On this view, consequentialists and non-consequentialists merely disagree about what ordinal rankings to assign to various outcomes.</p>
<p>Portmore’s point is relevant to our argument about the compatibility of CBA with non-utilitarian moral theories: if we have a ranking that corresponds to some non-consequentialist moral theory, we can then construct an output filter such that an act is morally permissible if and only if its outcome is not outranked by that of any other available act alternative. This would then demonstrate that this new form of consequentialism is compatible with CBA in the sense defined in Section 1. Moreover, if we can produce such rankings for every non-utilitarian moral theory, and then construct an output filter on the basis of such rankings, we can demonstrate that all moral theories are compatible with CBA in the sense defined in Section 1.</p>
<p>All that said, CBA is a decision-making procedure, not a criterion of moral rightness. This has implications for how we should think about the consequentializer’s claim. As mentioned in Section 1, we take a CBA to be compatible with a moral theory M if and only if advocates of M have no good reason to object that societal decisions are guided by the CBA. However, a good reason for the moral theorist to reject CBAs in which consequentializing plays an important role is that societal decisions guided by such CBAs may be very poor decision-making procedures. This is because it may be practically impossible for us to construct a precise ranking, and thus output filters, for some non-utilitarian theories. For instance, consider Aristotelian virtues. According to Aristotle, we have a special obligation to be generous to our friends, but because of various mitigating factors the most virtuous option is sometimes not to assist a friend in need of help, for example, if she asks you for help to commit suicide. If one were to consequentialize Aristotelian virtue ethics and then try to render it compatible with CBA, one would have trouble constructing a precise ranking for various virtues and the final selection of output filters would be very sensitive to these rankings. We do not claim that this is entirely impossible. Perhaps Aristotle did actually provide sufficient information in the <italic>Nicomachean Ethics</italic> to allow us to select the correct ranking, but at the moment there is a lot of disagreement in the scholarly literature of how Aristotle should be interpreted, especially when applied to contemporary, real-world cases. This seems to be a good reason for the virtue theorist not to let societal decisions be guided by a CBA that attempts to mirror virtue-theoretical decisions. Our point is thus that virtue theory is not, at least not yet, sufficiently easy to apply to real-world scenarios.</p>
<p>Consequently, it does not follow from Portmore’s view that CBA can accommodate every non-utilitarian moral view. For those theories for which it is not practically plausible to construct an accurate ranking which reflects the non-utilitarian theory, advocates of such theories will have good reason to object that societal decisions are guided by the CBA. This indicates that some sufficiently complex moral theories cannot be rendered compatible with CBA, in the sense stipulated by our criterion in Section 1, by using output and input filters.</p>
<p>One might ask, however, whether the virtue theorist might render her theory compatible with CBA in some other way, for example, by applying an output filter which does not permit actions that virtuous agents would not perform to be recommended. Our answer, again, is that from a structural point of view this seems unproblematic, but from a practical point of view it will be difficult to construct accurate output filters. Since virtue ethics is a very complex ethical perspective, the virtue theorist would have a good reason for not basing a societal decision on a CBA that mimics virtue theory – the risk is too high that the translation of the theory into concrete policies will go wrong. However, we do not exclude that this may change in the future. If virtue theory were to develop into a theory that is less complex, and thus easier to apply to real-world cases, we would be willing to revise our opinion about the compatibility of this theory with CBA.</p>

<p>This criterion directly entails that mainstream accounts of CBA are compatible with utilitarianism: although we might never be able to know for sure that a CBA (or any decision procedure for that matter) would recommend the same action(s) as utilitarianism, it is nevertheless true that the decision maker has no good reason to believe that her CBA would recommend other action(s) than utilitarianism. Whenever the decision maker has reason to believe that one option rather than another will maximize the sum total of utility (defined as aggregate preference satisfaction), that consideration will also be reflected in the CBA, as we explain in the next section. For a recent discussion of the view that we are never able to know for sure that a CBA or any decision procedure recommends the same action(s) as utilitarianism, see, for example, Feldman (2006).</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the Kaldor-Hicks criterion does not require any interpersonal comparisons of welfare. What counts as sufficient compensation for Alice depends solely on Alice’s preference between tomato juice and money, and what counts as a benefit for Bob depends entirely on Bob’s preferences. Economists who feel uneasy about the possibility of interpersonal comparisons have therefore argued that costs and benefits in a CBA should be evaluated according to the Kaldor-Hicks criterion. To be more precise, these economists argue that for each individual we should establish her compensation variation (CV). The CV measures how much money (or some other valuable good) the individual requires for feeling indifferent between the original distribution of resources and the new one; for people who benefit from a redistribution, the CV is negative and for those who lose, it is positive. If the sum of all CVs for all individuals is positive, the benefits of the redistribution outweigh the costs. According to many economists this is the most plausible way to interpret and measure costs and benefits in a CBA. Unsurprisingly, there are a number of well-known objections to the normative plausibility of the Kaldor-Hicks criterion. All objections essentially make the same point: the fact that individuals who benefit from a redistribution could hypothetically compensate those who lose does not guarantee that the total benefits of the redistribution actually outweigh the costs, and this is because Kaldor-Hicks does not take interpersonal comparisons into account. Suppose, for instance, that we could make life a little better for very rich people at the expense of the poorest ones; a law that forbids poor and ugly people from visiting the local city park, thus making visits more pleasurable for rich people could be an example of such a piece of legislation. Because the rich have plenty of money, their CV for introducing the new legislation would be quite high and because the poor people are so poor, they would be wiling to give up their right to visit the park for a relatively small amount, which means that their CV is low. Hence, it might very well be the case that the sum of CVs for all individuals is positive. That is, there exists a hypothetical redistribution of resources that would be Pareto better, so the Kaldor-Hicks criterion entails that the new piece of legislation should be adopted.</p>

<p>The following offers proof of Theorem 2. It follows from Theorem 1(iii) that if F’ has two elements, the claim is true. (In the case that F’ has only one element the claim is trivially true.) In order to prove the inductive step, suppose that the claim holds in the case that F’ has n (n ≥ 2) elements. Let f be element n + 1; let H be a sequence of v elements; and let G be a sequence of w elements, such that v + w = n. We have to show that (f ○ H ○ G)(<italic>ω</italic>) ~ (H ○ f ○ G)(<italic>ω</italic>) ~ (H ○ G ○ f)(<italic>ω</italic>) ~ (f ○ G ○ H)(<italic>ω</italic>) ~ (G ○ f ○ H)(<italic>ω</italic>) ~ (G ○ H ○ f)(<italic>ω</italic>). First, consider the case in which both H and G have a non-zero number of elements. Note that the number of elements in (f ○ G) is less than or equal to n. Hence, since the theorem was assumed to hold for up to n elements and H(<italic>ω</italic>) ~ Ω, it follows that (H ○ f ○ G)(<italic>ω</italic>) ~ (H ○ G ○ f)(<italic>ω</italic>). Next, we show that (f ○ F ○ G)(<italic>ω</italic>) ~ (F ○ G ○ f)(<italic>ω</italic>) by substituting g for H ○ G in the proof of Theorem 1(iii). So far, we have shown (since ‘~’ is transitive) that (f ○ H ○ G)(<italic>ω</italic>) ~ (H ○ f ○ G)(<italic>ω</italic>) ~ (H ○ G ○ f)(<italic>ω</italic>); by applying analogous arguments, we find that (f ○ G ○ H)(<italic>ω</italic>) ~ (G ○ f ○ H)(<italic>ω</italic>) ~ (G ○ H ○ f)(<italic>ω</italic>). Finally, since the number of elements in (H ○ G) is equal to n, it follows that (f ○ H ○ G)(<italic>ω</italic>) ~ (f ○ G ○ H)(<italic>ω</italic>). The second case, in which the number of elements in either H or G is zero, is trivial, since (f ○ H ○ G)(<italic>ω</italic>) ~ (H ○ G ○ f)(<italic>ω</italic>) as shown above. QED.</p>
<p>The following offers proof of Theorem 3. Let C = B – A. From the right-hand side of the axiom it follows that for every p<sub>b</sub>(<italic>ω</italic>) there is a permutation p<sub>c</sub>(<italic>ω</italic>) such that p<sub>a</sub> ○ p<sub>c</sub>(<italic>ω</italic>) ~ p<sub>b</sub>(<italic>ω</italic>). Hence, because of Theorem 1(i), p<sub>b</sub>(<italic>ω</italic>) <bold>≽</bold> p<sub>a</sub>(<italic>ω</italic>). QED.</p>
