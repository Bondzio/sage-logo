<title>Objective</title>
<p>The pulsed dye laser (PDL) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids in dermatology. On the basis of histopathologic similarities between sulcus vocalis and scar tissue and numerous reports on the treatment of laryngeal lesions, especially scar tissue, with PDL, we evaluated the efficacy of treating sulcus vocalis with PDL. We named this surgical procedure <italic>PDL glottoplasty</italic>.</p>

<p>This study was conducted on 25 patients diagnosed with sulcus vocalis by videostroboscopy at the Gangnam Severance Hospital Otorhinolaryngology Department between August 2006 and February 2012. Energy delivery was fixed at 0.75 Joules (J) per pulse, and each vocal fold was administered 60 to 110 pulses (average 72.5 pulses) during each procedure.

<p>Sulcus vocalis is a condition caused by a groove at the free edges of the vocal folds. This groove induces a heterogeneous defect in the normally pliable vocal fold covering and bowing of the vocal folds during phonation. This condition, often referred to as “spindle-shaped glottis,” is one of the factors of organic dysphonia created by glottic leakage and mucosal stiffness during phonation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813479909">1</xref></sup> Based on clinical and histopathologic features, sulcus disorders of the vocal folds have been classified into 3 groups: physiologic sulcus (type I), sulcus vergeture (type II), and pocket-type sulcus vocalis (type III). The latter 2 conditions are considered pathologic sulcus vocalis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813479909">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813479909">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The currently used surgical treatment methods for pathologic sulcus conditions show limited improvement in glottis efficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813479909">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813479909"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813479909"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813479909">6</xref></sup> Moreover, the postoperative voice may be worse than the preoperative voice due to recurrent adhesions and/or scar formation at the incision site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813479909">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The 585-nm pulsed dye laser (PDL) is an angiolytic laser that was developed based on the concept of selective photothermolysis. The PDL beam is selectively absorbed by hemoglobin, which allows for photocoagulation of microvascular lesions with minimal damage to surrounding tissues. The laser light absorbed by hemoglobin is converted into heat, which damages the endothelium and surrounding vessel walls and causes thrombosis, vasculitis, and eventual ablation of abnormal venules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813479909">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The PDL was adopted from its original use in treating vascular malformations such as port-wine stains and telangiectasias. Recently, there have been a number of reports highlighting the effectiveness of PDL for the treatment of hypertrophic (keloid) scarring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813479909">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813479909">9</xref></sup> and scarring resulting from acne excoriee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813479909">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The PDL was adopted for laryngeal pathology treatment in the late 1990s. It has demonstrated excellent results in the setting of laryngeal papillomatosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813479909">11</xref></sup> leukoplakia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813479909">12</xref></sup> vocal process granulomas,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599813479909">13</xref></sup> and glottal dysplasia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813479909">14</xref></sup> In addition, a recent study showed tissue softening and improved mucosal wave measurements after treatment of vocal fold scars with PDL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599813479909">15</xref></sup> Softer and more pliable vocal folds may result in improved vocal fold vibration and dysphonia.</p>
<p>On the basis of the similarities between the histopathology of sulcus vocalis and scar tissue, as well as numerous reports on the treatment of laryngeal lesions with PDL, we evaluated the efficacy of treating sulcus vocalis with PDL.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>This study was conducted on patients diagnosed with pathologic sulcus vocalis (type II and type III) with videostroboscopy by the Otorhinolaryngology Department at Gangnam Severance Hospital between August 2006 and February 2011. All patients presented with no expectations of further spontaneous improvement despite persistent voice therapy. Patients enrolled in the study had no other laryngeal diseases. Among 34 PDL-treated consecutive patients, 7 patients did not undergo postoperative voice analysis until 12 months after treatment and were excluded from the data analysis. Additional exclusions include 2 patients who underwent unilateral vocal cord surgery with PDL and received additional procedures such as hyaluronic acid injections. For the remaining 25 patients, all voice assessments and laryngeal stroboscopy studies were conducted 1 week preoperatively and at 6, 9, and 12 months postoperatively. The PDL surgical procedure for sulcus vocalis treatment was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board (IRB) in the Korea Institute and new medical technique evaluation of the Health Insurance Review.</p>

<title>PDL Glottoplasty</title>
<p>Patients underwent PDL-based treatment of sulcus vocalis, named <italic>PDL glottoplasty</italic>, after a thorough informed consent process. The laser used for this surgery was the PhotoGenica SV 585-nm PDL model made by Cynosure (Chelmsford, Massachusetts). The laser was delivered from the PDL unit through the 600-µm flexible fiber and hand piece. Total energy per PDL pulse delivered was inversely proportional to the distance between the laser fiber and the tissue. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia, and we achieved optimal larynx exposure with a suspension laryngoscope and observed the lesion with a microscope. The upper surface of the vocal fold was palpated, and the lesion was exposed by grasping or pushing the free edge of the vocal folds with micro-instruments. To properly detach the vocal cord epithelium, the PDL was pulsed with its tip positioned as close as possible to the sulcus lesion. To spare the epithelium, the tip was placed at a distance of 1 to 4 mm from surrounding bowed tissue. A custom-made rigid micromanipulator was used during the procedure due to the pliability of the laser fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813479909"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). The delivery energy was fixed at 0.75 Joules (J) per pulse, and each vocal fold was administered 60 to 110 pulses (average 72.5 pulses) during each procedure. The PDL glottoplasty was not repeated in any patient analyzed in this study.</p>

<title>Laryngeal Videostroboscopic Findings</title>
<p>Preoperative and postoperative laryngeal videostroboscopy were performed in all patients using the LxStrobe 2 (Laryngograph Ltd, London, UK). Two otolaryngologists (C.S.H. and H.-S.C.) evaluated the presence of capillary ectasias, vocal fold stiffness, degree of mucosal wave, and pattern of glottic closure in a blinded manner.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0194599813479909">
<title>Voice Analysis</title>
<p>Voice analysis was performed using auditory perceptual, aerodynamic, and acoustic evaluation methods. Auditory perceptual judgment was carried out in a recorded sample called “autumn,”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813479909">16</xref></sup> which was approximately 2 minutes in length, with the use of the GRBAS scale (G, grade; R, roughness; B, breathiness). The recorded samples were evaluated in a blinded manner by a speech pathologist skilled in voice training, as well as an otolaryngologist (C.S.H). The evaluation scale of each category was 0 to 3 points, and the mean of 2 values obtained from 2 graders was used for the analysis. When the evaluations of 2 graders were different by more than 1.5 points, they were reevaluated. If the same evaluations were obtained in the reevaluation, the value was used as recorded. A voice handicap index (VHI) was also administered to evaluate patient perception of his or her voice. Aerodynamic measures included mean flow rate (MFR) and subglottic pressure (Psub). Patients were asked to insert the mouthpiece of a phonatory function analyzer (Model PS 77H; Nagashima Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) into their mouth and produced the vowel /o/ for approximately 2 seconds. The maximum phonation time (MPT) was measured with a stopwatch. Acoustic and electroglottographic (EGG) evaluations were performed simultaneously using the Lx speech studio program (Laryngograph Ltd). Focusing on jitter %, shimmer %, and noise-to-harmonic ratio (NHR), these parameters were analyzed from a 300-ms stable range of /a/ vowel phonation. The EGG analysis consisted of the mean fundamental frequency (FxM), the mean closed quotient (QxM), the percentage irregularity of frequency (Fx% irregularity, CFx), and the percentage irregularity of amplitude (Ax% irregularity, CAx) from the quantitative analysis (Qa) of the “autumn’”passage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813479909">16</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section12-0194599813479909">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p>The Statistical Analysis System (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) program was used for statistical analysis. The pretreatment vs 12-month posttreatment data were statistically analyzed by a paired <italic>t</italic> test for the group as a whole. Statistical significance was considered to be at <italic>P</italic> ≤ .05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The distribution of ages was unimodal, and the range was between 11 and 62 years (mean age, 37.6 years). Seventeen patients (68%) were male and 8 were female (32%). Laryngeal videostroboscopy was evaluated in 25 patients who received PDL glottoplasty. Capillary ectasia tended to disappear or decrease. Although the method of assessment was necessarily subjective, our study indicated that vocal folds treated with PDL glottoplasty showed a decrease in the size of the groove on the medial surface of the vocal folds, an alleviated vocal fold stiffness with restored mucosal wave, and decreased vocal fold hyperemia compared with the preoperative examination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813479909"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). During the average follow-up period of 24.2 months, there were no significant complications from the PDL glottoplasty, including web formation, postoperative bleeding, or fibrotic healing processes.</p>

<p>Twenty-five of 34 PDL glottoplasty patients completed pre- and postoperative voice analysis at least 4 times (preoperative, 1 week; postoperative, 6, 9, and 12 months). Comparative analyses are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599813479909"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. Most PDL glottoplasty patients showed statistically significant improvements in postoperative voice analysis indices when compared with preoperative indices. Auditory perceptual judgment demonstrated improved indices in all G, R, and B scales (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Voice handicap index improved from 64.35 pretreatment to 38.43 at 12 months posttreatment (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Following the same trend, aerodynamic measures revealed an increased MPT (<italic>P</italic> = .947) and a decreased MFR (<italic>P</italic> = .043) and Psub (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). In addition, acoustic and EGG analyses illustrated ameliorated indices, which includes decreased FxM (<italic>P</italic> = .006), jitter % (<italic>P</italic> = .003), shimmer % (<italic>P</italic> = .425), NHR (<italic>P</italic> = .443), CFx (<italic>P</italic> = .017), CAx (<italic>P</italic> = .382), and QxM (<italic>P</italic> = .285). The only postoperative voice parameter indices that were not statistically significantly different from preoperative measurements were MPT, shimmer %, NHR, and CAx.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Sulcus of the vocal folds has been a known condition since the 19th century. Sulcus vocalis is a long, thin groove running lengthwise along the free edge of the vocal fold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599813479909">17</xref></sup> It may involve all or any segment of the vocal fold edge and may be confined to the superficial layer of the lamina propria or penetrate into the vocal ligament. Sulcus vocalis is associated with a breathy voice quality, voice fatigue, and effortful voice. The severity of dysphonia is determined by the number of layers of the vocal fold defect. Moreover, glottic insufficiency combined with compensatory hyperfunctional voice behavior, such as ventricular phonation or subglottic squeezing, results in a strained and harsh voice.</p>
<p>The etiology of sulcus vocalis has not yet been clearly defined, and several mechanisms have been proposed in previous research studies. Recently, in a study of 100 cadavers, Sunter et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813479909">2</xref></sup> reported sulcus vocalis and pathological sulcus rates of 39% and 23%, respectively.</p>
<p>Effective treatment of sulcus vocalis results in functional improvement through reconstruction of the stiffened and volumetrically deficient lamina propria and reestablishment of the vocal fold microarchitecture. Various techniques, including type I thyroplasty, incision with undermining, incision with slicing, sulcussectomy, and injection laryngoplasty, have been introduced but have shown disappointing results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813479909">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813479909">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813479909"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813479909"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813479909">6</xref></sup> Surgical management of sulcus vocalis is difficult and should only be undertaken by trained operators. It is common for the mucosa at the bottom of the pouch to be torn or even stripped off the vocal ligament. Postoperatively, these defects can lead to recurrent adherence, and recovery of mucosal pliability as determined by stroboscopic examination has rarely been documented. Vocal fold augmentation methods using collagen, fat, commercialized hyaluronic acid, implants such as AlloDerm (LifeCell Corp, Branchburg, New Jersey), and temporalis fascia to increase the vocal fold volume and pliability have been attempted but have been shown to have little or no effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813479909">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599813479909">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Pulsed dye laser has shown to be effective for the treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids. Scars are softened and improved aesthetically after PDL treatment. The mechanism of improvement of hypertrophic scars and keloids with PDL treatment has not yet been elucidated; however, several mechanisms have been proposed. One such mechanism is that PDL denatures surrounding blood vessel collagen and softens scar tissue through selective photothermolysis. Pulsed dye laser energy is absorbed by the chromophore oxyhemoglobin, which influences the vascular proliferation of injured tissue in hypertrophic scars and keloids. In addition, it has been proposed that PDL energy absorbed specifically into the vessels of injured tissue produces heat and induces coagulative necrosis of scar vasculature, leading to target tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia. This would cause neo-collagenesis, collagen fiber heating with disulfide bond dissociation, collagen fiber realignment, and release of histamine or other factors that may influence fibroblast activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599813479909">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599813479909">20</xref></sup> This series of events influences intratissue collagen synthesis. The 585-nm wavelength has been shown to be the wavelength most capable of decreasing hypertrophic scar growth (compared with 590, 595, and 600 nm), presumably because of its increased vascular specificity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599813479909">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>A preliminary study of PDL and its use in patients with established vocal fold scarring has been published. This study showed increased scar softening and improved acoustic and aerodynamic measurements. Mortensen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599813479909">15</xref></sup> evaluated the efficacy of PDL treatment of vocal fold scars in 11 patients and demonstrated favorable results. The functional, physiological, and emotional VHI improved with statistical significance when compared with preoperative measurements.</p>
<p>Sulcus vocalis shows characteristic scarring induced by chronic inflammation of the vocal folds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599813479909">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599813479909">23</xref></sup> Our study used the PDL in patients with sulcus vocalis and showed an improvement in dysphonia in patients who underwent PDL glottoplasty. As observed by videostroboscopic examination, the pliability and vibration of the vocal folds improved after PDL treatment. In terms of objective assessments, most postoperative averages of auditory perceptual judgment, aerodynamic data, and acoustic and EGG analyses were significantly correlated with postoperative stroboscopic findings. The postoperative voice parameter indices of MPT, NHR, shimmer, and CAx were improved, but without significance.</p>
<p>As the PDL energy is delivered through a flexible laser fiber, laryngologists are able to perform in-office procedures on many kinds of laryngeal lesions. Although PDL may be a safe and effective in-office procedure, it does have limitations, including difficulty exposing the medial aspect of the vocal fold and the constant movement of the larynx in conscious patients. Sulcus vocalis characteristically appears longitudinally along the free edge of the vocal fold, which may not be fully exposed in awake patients. Thus, all procedures were carried out under general anesthesia with a suspension laryngoscope to allow for the use of the PDL with full exposure of the groove by grasping or pushing the free edge of the vocal folds using micro-instruments.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599813479909"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref> shows a schematic of the postulated mechanism of PDL glottoplasty. Direct contact of the laser fiber was made at a point at the center of the sulcus (ie, the area of adhesion of the epithelium to the vocal ligament) to vaporize or induce denaturation of the epithelium and so that a greater energy density could reach deep below the sulcus. We adopted a typical laser tissue interaction for PDL by selective photothermolysis at the sunken area near the sulcus, sparing the epithelium. To accomplish this, the tip distance was maintained at a distance of 1 to 4 mm from the mucosal surface. Around 40 to 50 pulses were administered to the area of the sulcus itself, whereas 20 to 30 pulses were administered to the surrounding sunken area. In this series, an average of 72.5 pulses were administered on each side. As the exact mechanism of action remains still unknown, further studies, including histopathologic studies using an animal model, as well as more clinical trials, are needed.</p>

<p>Despite the need for studies with longer follow-up, PDL can safely be used in the treatment of vocal fold sulcus through recovery of normal lamina propria by noninvasive and physiologic mechanisms. Further research is necessary to optimize the indications and determine the limitations of PDL glottoplasty.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Pulsed dye laser treatment is an effective method for patients with sulcus vocalis. Results of other, elaborate techniques have been disappointing, with some significant negative side effects. Our study of PDL glottoplasty takes advantage of photoangiolysis of the sublesional microcirculation and is a favorable alternative for the treatment of sulcus vocalis.</p>
