<title>Electrophysiological and Neuroimaging Research in Psychiatry: Setting a New Agenda for Schizophrenia</title>

<p>Schizophrenia is a clinical syndrome and no proof is available, so far, that it is a single disease entity. Decades of biological research based on a dichotomous approach, in which schizophrenia and affective psychoses represent discrete categories, failed to identify diagnostic markers for either class. Differences in prognosis and treatment between affective and non affective psychoses are increasingly blurred. Contributions from genetics, structural and functional neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and neuropsychology suggest the opportunity of overcoming the dichotomous approach. At the same time, the possibility that heterogeneity of clinical phenotypes within the syndrome reflect different etiopathogenetic mechanisms has not been ruled out. In spite of this, biological research is still approaching schizophrenia as a class, and even a homogeneous one. Studies conforming to the following requirements might foster the translation of the theoretical debate in research findings and clinical applications: (1) Include subjects with functional psychoses regardless of whether they meet or do not meet the criteria for schizophrenia; (2) Adopt multiple psychopathological descriptors reflecting both dimensional and categorical approaches; (3) Identify electrophysiological and brain imaging markers of psychopathological dimensions resistant to treatment; 4) Identify markers of transition from At Risk Mental States to overt psychosis</p>

<title>Cognitive Tasks or the Default State: Probing the Trait Deficits in Schizophrenia</title>

<p>Schizophrenia is an illness characterized by a triphasic and variable lifetime course, typically beginning in adolescence, with either a fulminant or insidious course, peaking in young adulthood, and waning in later life. While physical strength may wane with age, social skills and some cognitive functions may improve in parallel, white matter may increase in volume up to middle age or later. This sphinx-riddle pattern may be more prominent in older patients with schizophrenia with a diminution of psychotic symptoms, fewer hospitalizations, and improved psychosocial functioning. Functional, morphometric and diffusion tensor imaging has suggested that young patients may resemble older healthy subjects. Poor outcome patients may show greater longitudinal change in white matter volume with age than good outcome patients. Data on aging and relative metabolic rate of white matter in 103 normal volunteers and 68 unmedicated patients with schizophrenia show normal subjects with increasing prefrontal metabolic rate with age and patients remaining low but unchanged. Taken together, the findings suggest that these apparent paradoxes might be exploited in predicting prognosis, adjusting psychotherapeutic and cognitive training interventions, and possibly altering pharmacological treatment. Identification of aging trajectories in both white and gray matter activity is an important prerequisite.</p>

<p>Mental fatigue is a severe and frequently disabling chronic condition following upon eg, head trauma, stroke, and multiple sclerosis. The underlying pathogenetic mechanisms are not known. No effective treatment of this disorder is available. To test the possible efficacy of (-)-OSU6162, a partial agonist acting on dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors, on mental fatigue symptomatology. According to our hypothesis the stabilising influence to be expected from a partial agonist acting on both dopaminergic and serotonergic systems will alleviate mental fatigue. Comparing (-)-OSU6162 with placebo in a double-blind crossover study of 4 + 4 weeks in escalating dosage. Effect measurement by means of self-assessment scales and a battery of neuropsychological tests. Twelve patients with mental fatigue following upon head trauma (N = 6) or stroke (N = 6) completed the study. Seven patients showed a significant, in some cases marked improvement following (-)-OSU6162 in comparison with placebo. The response came already within a few days of treatment with the lowest dose (15 mg once or twice daily). The difference in self assessment was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05), and a distinct trend for improvement showed up in certain neuropsychological tests. An extended study is warranted and is very likely to show significant improvement, when measured both by self assessment and neuropsychological tests.</p>

<p>A dysfunctional cerebral glutamate system in schizophrenia is a current hot spot of neurobiological research [1] and several glutamate modulating therapeutics are in phase I and II trials. Improved proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS) with increasing field strength [2] allows the assessment of biological effect of glutamate modulating agents during therapy. In a RCT, 17 acute and 13 chronic schizophrenic patients (DSM-IV) on stable risperidone therapy were measured with H-MRS at baseline and after 6 weeks (T2) of add-on of memantine or placebo. Absolute glutamate concentrations [3] were measured (left hippocampus, cingulate). At baseline, patients showed increased hippocampal glutamate concentrations (11.9 mmol/l vs 10.7 mmol/l in healthy controls, p = 0.007). After therapy glutamate decreased in acute schizophrenics (p = 0.023), but remained unchanged in chronic patients (p = 0.45). The differential effect of memantine/placebo will be presented at the conference after unblinding. The study shows abnormal glutamate concentrations in a key region of schizophrenia pathophysiology. The normalization of glutamate during add on therapy may rely on modulation of the NMDA-receptors in response to memantine. The results indicate a different pathobiology between acute and chronic patients and favor H-MRS as an interesting in vivo tool for biological monitoring of glutamate functions.</p>

<p>Dopaminergic systems play a major role in numerous neuropsychiatric disorders. They have been representing important targets for molecular imaging approaches. Dopamine receptors, transporters, and metabolism have been quantified in a variety of diseases such as schizophrenia, substance abuse, affective and movement disorders. Furthermore, imaging of dopamine receptors with benzamide radiotracers has been the prototypic paradigm for the elucidation of neurotransmitter interactions in the living human brain. We presented data on the functional status of dopamine metabolism and D2/3 receptors in normal physiology and in schizophrenia, nicotine and alcohol dependence, and Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. The influence of ageing on the respective parameters as well as relationships with disease states was discussed. Furthermore, the acute effects of opioidergic stimulation on dopaminergic neurotransmission in healthy volunteers and in patients with alcohol dependence were demonstrated. Finally, examples for D2/3 receptors as targets for antipsychotic drug action were given, and the regulation of dopamine metabolism by these drugs was illustrated. These examples taken together exemplify that molecular imaging of dopamine systems has provided enormous insights into the neurobiology of health and disease.</p>

<title>EEG Gammaband Oscillations in the Diagnosis of Psychiatric Diseases</title>

<p>Evoked gamma-band responses (GBRs) were shown to be involved in different aspects of human cognition and behavior. They have been linked to the integration and processing of incoming information leading to an adequate behavioral outcome. Consequently, altered evoked GBRs have been associated with impaired cognitive and behavioral states present in a variety of psychiatric disorders. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports directly comparing evoked GBRs of different clinical groups in the same experimental setting. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to shed light on the question, whether evoked GBRs, as a kind of a neurophysiological biomarker of pathological states, might serve for characterization and distinguishing of groups suffering from diverse psychiatric disorders. We measured EEG during a passive auditory oddball-paradigm. Participants were patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, mood disorder, and personality disorders as well as a fourth group consisting of healthy participants. Our results indicate that evoked GBRs significantly differed from healthy participants only in schizophrenic patients whereas no difference could be observed for the other clinical groups. Our findings support the notion that early evoked GBRs could be indeed a trait variable of schizophrenia and are not a general marker of pathological brain states.</p>

<p>Neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression or anxiety disorders are far from being adequately recognized and treated despite their high socio-economic burden. This is not least of all due to the often unknown pathogenesis and due to phenomenological heterogeneity of the disorders. Molecular imaging methods such as PET serve here as potentially powerful tools in basic and clinical research of identifying phenotypes that are associated with, or indicative of, a vulnerability to developing neuropsychiatric illness. They also help to disentangle the complex phenotype of neuropsychiatric disorders to reveal distinct sub-types ready for efficient individual treatment strategies. Such a concept also includes that imaging data are tested against the data of gene-environment interactions (ie, gene polymorphisms, stress response) and drug-effects. Here, the data of [123I]β-CIT SPECT and [11C]DASB PET studies of the Leipzig site in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (Hesse 2005 &amp; 2011), ADHD (Hesse 2009), depressive disorders, stress-related conditions, and other neuropsychiatric impairment (Hesse 2004) including data from ongoing studies were presented.</p>

<title>Contribution of Gene-Brain Interaction to Language Abnormalities in Schizophrenia</title>
<p>Kircher T.<sup>1</sup>

<sup>1</sup>Universitätsklinikum Marburg, Germany</p>
<p>Schizophrenia is an ethologically heterogeneous disorder with a complex gene environment interaction as the most likely cause. A number of susceptibility genes, such as DTNBP, NRG1, DISC1, G72 and others have been identified. However their pathophysiological mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Speech and language disorders, such as concretism or formal thought disorder are core symptoms of the disorder. In this contribution, the impact of genetic variance on brain activation will be reviewed with a particular stress on speech and language paradigms. We will draw on own data of 429 healthy individuals who performed a verbal fluency task and a subsample of 85 subjects who did a similar task in a functional MRI study. Schizophrenia risk gene status such as NRG1, DTNBP, COMT, DISC1 was determined and correlated with verbal fluency and brain activation. Further, groups of patients with schizophrenia also underwent fMRI imaging and genotyping. In summary, we found an influence of several risk genes on signal change in BOLD response during a semantic verbal fluency task which can also be found in patients. The results more generally suggest an influence of some genes on semantic speech production ability in healthy subjects, ie, a gene-language capacity interaction.</p>

<p>Research on anhedonia in schizophrenia has demonstrated an impairment of the anticipatory component (anticipatory anhedonia), rather than a deficit in the pleasure experience itself (consummatory anhedonia). Reward anticipation and feedback processing were investigated using event-related potentials (ERPs) in stabilized patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. ERPs were recorded during anticipation and feedback processing for 5 different outcomes, small (SR) or large (LR) reward, small (SP) or large (LP) punishment or no-outcome (NO). Patients had lower scores on anticipatory pleasure and Fun seeking, and higher scores for anhedonia and punishment sensitivity, than controls. The anticipation-related negativity was reduced in patients. Controls, but not patients, showed a larger amplitude for LP versus N-O and LR. FZ amplitude in patients was inversely correlated with TEPS anticipatory pleasure. The feedback-related negativity had a lower amplitude for LR than for other conditions in controls but not in patients. Only in controls FRN was inversely correlated with TEPS consummatory pleasure. The frontal negativity during outcome anticipation discriminate punishment from other outcomes only in controls. The lower the amplitude of this component the greater the deficit in anticipatory pleasure. As to FRN, only controls modulate the frontal negativity during processing of outcome and this modulation is associated with consummatory pleasure.</p>

<p>Within 100 ms after error commission a frontomedial negativity occurs in the EEG (error-related negativity, ERN), which has been linked to dopamine (DA). The Val vs. Met allele of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism is associated with reduced DA levels in prefrontal cortex. We hypothesized that COMT Val158Met, by affecting DA would relate to individual differences in ERN amplitude. N = 169 male participants were genotyped for COMT Val158Met and either received a selective DA D2 receptor antagonist (sulpiride, 200 mg) or a placebo pill. Participants performed an Eriksen Flanker task while EEG was recorded. EEG was decomposed into temporally independent brain components (ICs) using Independent Component Analysis. ICs source localized to anterior midcingulate cortex showed error-specific activation within 100 ms following behavioral responses (IC-ERN). At the behavioral level individuals slowed down after error commision. IC-ERN and post-error slowing were enhanced in Val vs. Met/Met carriers who had received placebo. IC-ERN and post-error slowing were decreased by sulpiride in Val but increased in Met/Met carriers. A DA-related polymorphism predicted electrophysiological and behavioral indices of error-processing and a dopaminergic substance modulated these genotype effects. These findings provide strong support for a prominent role of DA in error processing.</p>

<title>Gamma Oscillations, Cognition and Interaction of Glutamatergic and GABAergic Neurons</title>

<sup>1</sup>UKE Hamburg, Germany</p>
<p>Disturbed synchronization in the gamma-band range is a key mechanism of disturbed cognitive functions in schizophrenia. Since disturbed gamma oscillations have also been found in unaffected siblings of patients with schizophrenia, a genetic background of disturbed oscillations in the gamma-band range can be assumed. One of the most often replicated risk genes for schizophrenia is neuregulin-1. Neuregulin-1 is necessary for inhibitory synapses of parvalbumin-positive interneurons on glutamatergic pyramidal cells. These inhibitory synapses are part of a feedback loop that is required for the synchronization within the gamma-band range. We presented data demonstrating a close relationship between genetic polymorphisms in the neuregulin-1 gene and oscillations in the gamma-band range. Our findings suggest that neuregulin-1 is related to pathophysiological mechanisms underlying disturbed gamma oscillations and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.</p>

<p>The introduction of molecular imaging in drug development has had a positive impact in decision making during various phases of drug development. Molecular imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) can be used as a tool in drug development to assess the in vivo distribution and pharmacological properties of a drug. The first PET tracers used for studying dopamine receptors were developed almost thirty years ago. The dopamine hypotheses for antipsychotic drug action could be studied in vivo for the first time in patients with schizophrenia. These earlier in vivo studies led to the introduction of a combined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic outcome measure which has become an important tool for the development of new antipsychotic drugs. Recent developments of dopamine D2 receptor agonist PET tracers may allow further pharmacological characterization of new antipsychotic drugs. Receptor occupancy studies utilizing a dual radioligand approach (ie, radiolabeled agonist (eg, [11C]MNPA) and antagonist (eg, [11C]raclopride)) may provide a functional profile of the new drug candidate's intrinsic activities. Finally, molecular imaging studies can provide valuable in vivo insight into the mechanism of action of non-dopaminergic drugs (ie, metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs)) acting as anti-psychotics in patients with schizophrenia.</p>

<title>Cerebral Correlates of Neurological Soft Signs in Schizophrenia</title>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>Ruprecht-Karls-University, Heidelberg, Department of General Psychiatry, Section of Geriatric Psychiatry, Germany</p>
<p>Neurological soft signs (NSS) are subtle motor and sensory deficits, which include repetitive motor acts or complex sensory tasks. Increased NSS scores are frequently found in schizophrenia and refer to the genetic liability towards the disease. Since NSS scores typically decrease with remission of psychotic symptoms it is generally accepted that NSS share a state character. NSS are associated with volume losses in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum and changes in frontal and parietal cortices including the motor strip and premotor areas. fMRI studies identified decreased activation of the sensorimotor cortices with a diminished lateralization effect under ipsilateral movements and partly reduced activation of the SMA. Training of NSS did not ameliorate these activation deficits; only the decreased lateralization effect of sensorimotor cortex activation was confirmed in the clinical course following remission. This variety of cerebral sites involved corresponds to the heterogeneity of NSS, which comprise motor and sensory deficits. While the morphological changes may primarily refer to the trait characteristics of NSS, the functional deficits may vary in the clinical course and correspond to the decrease of NSS scores with remission. NSS may therefore be used to investigate cerebral changes important for the pathogenesis and course of schizophrenia.</p>

<p>Animal and human studies suggest that NMDA antagonists such as S-ketamine-induced psychotic symptoms through a disturbance of the glutamate, GABA, and dopamine systems within cortico-striato-thalamic pathways. To explore the relative contribution of the dopamine system in the S-ketamine model psychosis, we investigated whether S-ketamine (0.006-0.012 mg/kg/min iv) increases striatal dopamine concentration in healthy volunteers using PET and 11C-raclopride (n = 10). Second, using H2O-PET and psychometric measures, we explored whether the D2-antagonist haloperidol (2 mg iv) is capable to reverse S-ketamine-induced changes in brain activity and to ameliorate associated psychotic symptoms in healthy subjects (n = 10). Results: First, S-ketamine increased striatal dopamine concentration associated with depersonalisation phenomena. Second, S-ketamine significantly increased brain activity in prefrontal cortex including the anterior cingulate, limbic and striatal structures, and the thalamus. Haloperidol reduced the S-ketamine-induced activation to a various degree in left and right basal ganglia and increased brain activity in circumscribed prefrontal cortical regions. Furthermore, haloperidol moderately reduced S-ketamine-induced depersonalisation phenomena. The present results suggest that increasing the dopaminergic tone in ventral striatum by S-ketamine leads to a disruption of the functional integrity and interaction of prefrontal, striatal and thalamic structures which in turn may underlay, at least in part, psychotic symptom formation.</p>

<title>The Concept of Coherent Imaging of Cognitive Activity in the Human Brain</title>
<p>Burton P. G.<sup>1</sup>

<sup>1</sup>Illawarra Health &amp; Medical Research Institute, University of Wollongong, Australia</p>
<p>New theory on the modus operandi of the human brain, elucidating the contingent and modular structure of the operations of the system of human higher brain function, raise the possibility of attaining a new standard of neuro-imaging, the Capture of Coherent Imaging of Cognitive Activity (CCICA), which may offer objective diagnostic capability of explanatory causes of certain psychiatric and psychological disorders. The paper suggests new ways to migrate imaging protocols from current standards broadly reflective of typical or averaged local brain activity (cognitive work-in-progress) towards a potentially far more informative standard quite directly associated with successful memory capture events. Preliminary data in respect of objective characterisation of learning disabilities such as Dyslexia complex and ADHD syndrome, showing clear dissociation of these both from each other and from more normal cognitive processing characteristics are presented. Neuro-imaging linked to cognitive gating events creates the opportunity to qualify some of psychiatry's chronic workload as cognitive disorder rather than neurological disorder, and if the theory-based proposal proves to be sound, at least some of that workload should be able to be better managed by collection of highly discriminating, fully objective kinds of potentially explanatory evidence. Data representing a blinded retro-analysis of an ADHD clinical trial (46 subjects; 47 controls), using solely blinking data captured during an executive function (hidden trail maze) task, showed with high discrimination the dissociation of ‘dyslexia' and ‘ADHD' cognitive processing characteristics, and both were clearly characterised as objective outliers from ‘normal' cognitive processing.</p>

<p>Executive functions comprise various cognitive abilities including response inhibition, flexibility and voluntary decisions. Functional MRI studies revealed that lateral and medial frontal brain region including the anterior cingulate cortex and the inferior frontal gyrus are of particular importance for these processes. Deficits in executive functions are prominent in various psychiatric diseases eg, schizophrenia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and substance use disorder. We examined neuronal correlates of executive functions and dysfunctions in psychiatric patients (ADHD, alcohol use disorder) using EEG and functional MRI. In addition, therapy related changes in electrophysiological responses were investigated. The results indicated decreased activity in lateral and medial frontal brain areas in non-medicated patients with ADHD during voluntary selection processes. By contrast, alcohol dependent patients did not show reliable dysfunctions during voluntary selection. However, the inhibition of planned responses was related to fronto-central dysfunctions. These dysfunctions were diminished after successful detoxification. Distinct networks of brain regions have been demonstrated to be associated to various executive processes. In addition, functional dissociations between various psychiatric disorders were demonstrated: patients with ADHD showed significant dysfunctions in lateral and medial frontal brain responses. Alcohol-dependent patients predominantly demonstrated fronto-central abnormalities.</p>

<p>This study was developed to investigate the white matter tract in late-onset drug-naïve panic disorder patients. Twenty-seven patients and fifteen normal controls were enrolled into our study. They all received 3 Tesla Siemens magnetic resonance imaging of brain for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 30 directions. The DTI images of patients and controls were preprocessed and analyzed to estimate the differences of white matter tracts between patients and controls. We utilized the FDT (FMRIB’s Diffusion Toolbox v2.0) function implemented in the FSL (FMRIB Software Library) to output the fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity. Then the outputs of the above 3 parameters of patients and controls were compared using independent t test with global brain volume, age, gender and duration of illness as covariates. Late-onset drug-naïve panic disorder patients had altered integrity of white matter tracts in bilateral superior longitudinal fasculi, inferior longitudinal fasculi, superior fronoto-occipital fasculi, anterior thalamic radiations, body and splenium of corpus callosum when comparing to controls (corrected p &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, the widespread white matter tract abnormalities might represent the structural pathophysiology of white matter in late-onset drug-naïve panic disorder patients.</p>

<p>Both, recognition of previously encoded stimuli and change detection enhance the P3. The current study contrasted these opposite influences on the P3 using a delayed matching-to-sample task, which included requirements of commonly used working memory as well as change detection tasks. Mean P3 amplitude and delta activity was analysed from participants who classified probe stimuli as either being identical or modified. The P3 amplitudes were larger for modified than for identical probes, with both eliciting a larger P3 than during encoding. Enhanced single-trial amplitude and trial-by-trial consistency of delta activity contributed to the larger P3 for the modified probe. Fronto-parietal phase coherence of delta activity was also more enhanced for modified than for identical probes. The results indicate that the P3 reflects an adaptable process of attentional resource allocation to optimize memory-guided decision-making.</p>

<p>The human hypothalamus is involved in many aspects of autonomic, endocrine, and behavioral responses. Up to now, parcellations of hypothalamic subnuclei have only been feasible with histological techniques in post-mortem brains. In the present study we investigated the directionality information inherent in high-resolution DTI data to map subregions of the hypothalamus in healthy volunteers. We scanned 10 healthy subjects (5 males, age 26.4 ± 2.5 years, 5 females, age 24.5 ± 5.7 years) with a Siemens 3 Tesla TimTrio MR scanner, acquired diffusion-weighted and T1-weighted scans. We computed the similarity of fiber orientations between all voxels and subjects, and clustered the similarity matrix in 3 regions using a k-means algorithm. The clustering in 3 regions resulted in a reproducible and anatomically coherent arrangement of clusters across hemispheres and subjects. We found an anterior, a posteromedial, and a lateral subdivision with consistent microscopic tissue orientations across subjects. A comparison of their topography with the literature reveals a plausible anatomical correspondence between the subdivisions and the anterior, medial, and lateral nuclear cell groups of the hypothalamus. This is to our knowledge the first study that demonstrates the fine-grained microstructural organization within the human hypothalamus noninvasively in living subjects.</p>

<p>We studied human semantic learning of Kanji characters in 18 healthy German adults. Forty Kanji characters were presented visually before and after a learning session of 20 minutes duration. In this learning period subjects learned the meaning of 20 of the stimuli while the other stimuli served as control. Brain activity was recorded from 30 electrodes and averaged offline. All subjects learned stimulus meaning with a recall rate of &gt; 90%. The comparison of evoked potential topography revealed that learning was accompanied by significant changes of evoked components. Field strength (global field power) of the first component showed significant differences before and after learning. In addition, at a mean latency of 112.3 ms significant topographical changes were observed. The pattern of scalp distribution in the left-right direction changed significantly only for ERPs elicited by learned stimuli while no effects were seen in the control condition. Our findings show that successful learning of the semantic meaning of Kanji characters occurs rapidly within 20 minutes. Such learning is directly related to neurophysiological changes at early processing stages in primary visual areas. This is reflected by systematic changes in scalp topography of electrical brain activity.</p>

<p>In most cases conventional psychiatric treatment may not be effective in this population leading to the decline in their quality of life. The object of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of neurofeedback in post concussion syndrome (PCS). Forty subjects (23 Males, 17 Females) ranging in age from 19 - 53 years old (mean: 28.9y, ± 8.1y) who had a history of at least one head trauma and all had sought psychiatric treatment which was ineffective were included. After medication withdrawal, all 40 subjects’ QEEG was recorded and analyzed using both  FDA approved  Nx-Link Neurometric and NeuroGuide analysis. The subjects were all treated with neurofeedback. Overall improvement was seen in all the primary and secondary measures and when 39 of the 40 subjects were followed up long term (average: 3.1 years ± 1.2y), all but 2 subjects were stable and medication free. Overall NF treatment was shown to be effective in this group of subjects. PCS is usually never screened for, and when found currently an effective treatment does not exist.  The study showed that QEEG is an effective screening tool and based on the outcome measures neurotherapy was found to be effective.</p>

<p>The research of the neural processing for perceptual rivalry is one of the important topics in neurosciences. We measured EEG associated with subject’s perceptions of the ambiguous figures to investigate the time course of the oscillatory activity. Visual stimuli were perceptually ambiguous Necker cube. Two experiments were performed. Each experiment consisted of two kinds of stimulus presented consecutively. The first stimulus was presented unambiguous stimulus in both experiments. In the one experiment, second stimulus was presented ambiguous stimulus (Ambiguous condition). The other one is that second stimulus was presented also unambiguous stimulus (Control condition). We compared endogenous reversals activity of ambiguous stimuli with exogenously reversals. Ten healthy subjects participated in the present study and electroencephalographic activity was recorded with a digital 128-channel amplifier using the international 10-20 system.  The oscillatory activity showed the different activity between exogenously and endogenous changing. When the ambiguous stimulus was perceived differently from the first stimulus, the right-occipital beta band activity (16-23 Hz) was increased between 50-100 ms following the onset. The results suggest that the right hemisphere brain activity is the same as found in other ERP studies on ambiguous figures because the right-occipital beta band activity reflected spontaneous switching between rivaling percepts.</p>

<p>In music, melody is arranged according to harmonic regularities. Especially, tonic tone or chord have the role of the goal tone of the melody, so that tonic tone at the end of the melody forms sense of completion. It means that inappropriate ending tone disturbs listeners' sense of completeness automatically. Numerous experiments have investigated neural correlates of such a tonal processing ability and tonal processing ability is suggested to be innate. Even when participants do not pay attention to melody stimulus, inappropriate ending elicited larger negative potentials around 100 ms followed by positive potentials around 200 ms. In mismatch negativity paradigm, infrequent inappropriate ending elicit early anterior (right) negativity around 180 ms. However, especially in MMN paradigm experiments, response of infrequent ending contains response of infrequent stimulus. In the present study, we controlled the stimulus presentation rate. At first, we measured neuromagnetic response of frequent completed melody and infrequent uncompleted melody in a conventional manner, in order to confirm the neuromagnetic response. Then, we compared response of infrequent completed melody to frequent uncompleted melody. From this paradigm, we tried to solve the problem of rate effect and investigate the pure response of inappropriate ending.</p>

<p>Aging is typically associated with both structural and functional brain changes. These changes are usually described in hippocampus and thalamus but also concern the frontal lobe. In our study, we investigated 43 middle-aged (age = 53 +/− 0.9 years) and 28 old-aged (age = 72 +/− 1.0 years) subjects. The subjects were participants in the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study on Adult Development and Aging (ILSE). Participants with a diagnosis of dementia or of mild cognitive impairment were excluded. Structural brain images were obtained using MRI 1.5 T. Our preliminary results showed a significant reduction of both gray matter and white matter volumes in old-aged compared to middle-aged group. Significant atrophy was found in left hippocampus, pallidum and frontal lobe especially in the motor areas. Moreover, the volume of the parietal and occipital lobes was significantly decreased in old-aged compared to middle-aged participants. These results suggest that brain changes following normal aging are not restricted to hippocampus and prefrontal regions but also extend to motor regions and posterior regions.</p>

<p>Little is known about the neurobiological background of motor symptoms in schizophrenia. Our aim was to investigate structural white matter abnormalities of loops of the motor system in schizophrenia and to relate our findings to objectively measured motor activity. 21 schizophrenics and 21 healthy controls underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and actigraphy the same day. Probabilistic fibre tracking was started from key regions of the motor system. Resulting probability maps were combined using an extended multiplication of probabilistic maps to identify the most probable anatomical pathways connecting these structures. We found higher probabilities of connectivity in schizophrenia in cortico-cortical and in cortico-basal ganglia pathways. Schizophrenia patients had lower activity levels. Using a general linear model, we found a linear positive association of probability of connectivity and AL in cortico-cortical connections in schizophrenia. This effect was not seen in healthy controls.  Conversely, in healthy controls we found a linear positive association probability of connectivity and activity level in cortico-basal ganglia pathways. In conclusion, we found widespread structural alterations in motor related brain circuitries in schizophrenia. The identified association with motor behaviour in cortico-cortical connections and the missing association in cortico-basal ganglia connections might contribute to dysfunction of motor control in schizophrenia.</p>

<p>The aim of the study was to investigate associations between cortical information processing assessed by the P300 potential and kinematic parameters of automated hand movements. Healthy volunteers were recruited, who underwent neurophysiological experiments comprising EEG/event related potential studies using an oddball paradigm and computerized hand motor analyses of handwriting movements. Thirty-nine right handed male volunteers (mean age 25.69 ± 3.17 years) underwent electroencephalography under stimulation with an auditory oddball paradigm. P300 amplitudes and latencies were determined at Fz, Cz and Pz. Hand motor analyses were performed using a digitizing graphic tablet and software for the analysis of movement dynamics during standardised handwriting movements. There were statistically significant correlations between P300 amplitudes and kinematic parameters in rapid circle drawing. Correlations of P300 and kinematic variables are in line with earlier reports of alterations of either parameter in patients with dopaminergic dysfunctions. Significant correlations in healthy volunteers are suggestive of a potential dopaminergic link between information processing and fine motor function.</p>

<p>The STROOP-paradigm provides one of the most robust experimental and clinical approaches in psychological sciences and diagnostics. However, reliability in individual physiological data has not been examined in both experimental intra- and inter-session arrangements. Based on previously published data, we applied adapted forms of the classical STROOP-task in an EEG-study to estimate individual intra- and inter-session reliability of behavioural and electrophysiological data. Preliminary behavioural data showed both consistent split-half as well as re-test reliability in 15 healthy young female study participants. There was an expected interference effect in the incongruent condition reflected in longer response times compared to both congruent and baseline conditions, and a facilitation effect in the congruent condition reflected in shorter response times compared to the baseline condition. Finally, behavioural data from an updated sample of 22 individuals was discussed in relation to the respective electrophysiological findings.</p>

<p>We compared three widely used brain volumetry methods: FSL, SPM, and Freesurfer to analyze the accuracy of gray (GM) and white matter (WM) volume measurements. We analyzed 60 MCI patients, 34 AD patients and 32 healthy controls (real data). The groups did not differ significantly in age, gender and education. The T1-weighted MRI-data were recorded with a 1.5 T Magneton Symphony MR. In addition the volume of the Normal Brain from the BrainWeb database was determined (synthetic data). The MRI-data were analyzed with default settings of current software versions. Synthetic data: The calculated brain volumes of the three volumetry methods were too low compared to the Brainweb volumes but provided similar results for GM, WM and total brain volume. Real data: For all three subject groups Freesurfer calculated the largest GM volume and the smallest WM volume. SPM and FSL provided similar results for GM and WM volume. Despite the different GM and WM volumes, the volumetry methods produced similar total brain volumes. In addition, they showed a decreasing total brain volume with increasing brain atrophy. Taking into account the results of synthetic and real data, SPM is the probate tool for analyses of brain volume.</p>

<p>Schizophrenia is associated with a range of cognitive deficits and cerebral volume alterations, but little attention has been directed to the deficits and structural correlates of autobiographical remembering. The aim of this study is to identify the patterns of structure-function relationships within this patient group. We examined the cerebral correlates of autobiographical memory in 35 chronic schizophrenic patients and 24 age and education matched healthy volunteers. MRI data were obtained at the German Cancer Research Centre with a 3-T Siemens Magnetom scanner and were analysed via two methods of automated region-of-interest analysis. Personal episodic memory and personal semantic memory were investigated using a semi-structured interview. Both methods showed significantly decreased hippocampal volume in the patient group. Compared with control participants, patients had significant lower memory scores for autobiographical episodic detail memory. In patients, but not in controls, the proportion of autobiographical episodic details was significantly correlated with volume of predominately left hippocampus. No correlation was found for autobiographical semantic memory. These findings indicate that in chronic schizophrenia deficits in autobiographical memory performance are related to volume reductions in hippocampal regions. Further analyses may compare the cerebral correlates of autobiographical memories of varying remoteness.</p>

<p>In the last decade Independent Component Analysis (ICA) of fMRI BOLD data became a widely applied tool to extract synchronized large scale brain networks during task and rest conditions. However, the BOLD lacks the possibility of quantifying absolute network activity, which is of particular interest in diseases. In contrast, MR Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) allows the quantification of absolute cerebral blood flow (CBF) non-invasively. Here we explored the ability of identifying networks in ASL and to quantify network activity. Twelve healthy subjects performed a finger-tapping block-design experiment while pseudo-continuous ASL was acquired. After CBF quantification, the individual datasets were concatenated and subjected to the ICA algorithm. The component with the strongest temporal correlation with the task predictor was selected and the time courses for the individual subjects were reconstructed. Additionally, the network activity for rest and finger-tapping were calculated separately for the Motor-Network (MN) and the Default Mode Network (DMN). ICA proved capable to identify both networks. Moreover, absolute network activity (in quantified CBF) for networks and condition could be quantified. This novel approach opens a new strategy to evaluate absolute network activity and thus allows quantifying inter-individual differences in the resting state and task-related (de-) activations in healthy subjects and patients.</p>

<p>Frontal (F) and posterior-parietal (PP) cortices are part of the distributed system of voluntary saccades (Bodis-Wollner et al 1997, 1999, Rieger et al 2003). Parieto-occipital perisaccadic gamma (35-45 Hz) reorganization (gamma modulation index, GMI) may represent realignment of visual space to the predicted saccade target (Forgacs et al 2008). We quantified perisaccadic (1)_F and PP power differences and (2)_F-to-PP; theta-gamma and alpha-gamma phase amplitude coupling (PAC). Theta = 6-8 Hz, alpha = 9-11 Hz. EEG was recorded over F and PP scalp sites in 44 healthy subjects (19-72 years, 14 females). Saccades were recorded with electro-oculogram and infra-red ISCAN camera. Subjects executed horizontal voluntary saccades to a mark; 15 degree rightwards (R) or leftwards (L), then back to the center and so on, for 2 minutes. Perisaccadic EEG segments were wavelet and Hilbert transformed (5-70 Hz). The perisaccadic power spectra were trial averaged and registered to saccade initiation, independently for rightwards and leftwards saccades. Results showed PP-GMI &gt;F-GMI (p &lt; 0.05). GMI lateralized with saccade direction only posteriorly ie, R saccade GMI&gt;L saccade GMI over left PP p = 0.001 and vice versa for right PP p = 0.004. Perisaccadic PAC was present F-to-PP and lateralized with saccade direction. Non-linear cross-frequency PAC could potentially subserve fronto-parietal cortical communication for voluntary saccade control.</p>

<p>The structure of the brain is constantly changing through lifespan, meaning that normal aging, free from dementia, is associated with structural brain changes. Aging is also known to later cognition. Therefore we aimed to explore aging-related cognitive impairment and their structural brain correlations. We investigated 43 middle-aged and 28 old-aged subjects. The subjects were participants in the interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study on Adult Development and Aging (ILSE). This German prospective study is based on two birth cohorts born during 1930-1932 and 1950-1952. Structural brain images were obtained using MRI 1.5 T and analyzed by FSL software. Analyses focused on four substructures: hippocampus, amygdale, thalamus and caudate. Results showed that significant verbal memory, executive and attention deficits in old-aged compared to middle-aged participants. Old-aged participants had significantly lower hippocampus and thalamus volumes than middle-aged participants whereas amygdale and caudate did not differ significantly between groups. Significant correlations were found between episodic memory performances and hippocampal volumes in the old-aged group but not in the middle-aged group. Our results provided evidence for significant brain changes with aging which partially account for aging-related cognitive impairments.</p>

They all received 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging acquisition for the structural imaging of brain. All the structural images were preprocessed and analyzed to estimate the differences of gray matter volumes between patients and controls. We utilized the optimized voxel-based morphometry function established in the FSL (FMRIB Software Library) with global brain volume, age, gender and duration of illness as covariates. We also estimated the correlation between clinical rating scale scores and gray matter volumes to confirm the results of optimized voxel-based morphometry. Late-onset drug-naïve panic disorder patients had deficits of gray matter volumes in left orbitofrontal cortex, left inferior frontal cortex, left superior temporal gyrus and right pre-central gyrus when comparing to controls (corrected p &lt; 0.005, cluster threshold: voxels). The scores of panic disorder rating scales were negatively correlated with total gray matter volumes. In conclusion, fronto-temporal gray matter deficits might represent the structural pathophysiology of late-onset panic disorder.</p>

<p>Neuroimaging evaluations in evolutionary dynamics of schizophrenia revealed calcification of the choroid plexus and pineal gland, changes considered as “normal”, thus without significance by neuroimaging specialists. The calcifications of the choroid plexus have been considered a possible indicator for the role of serotonin in the etiopathogeny of schizophrenia, in the depression and persistence of hallucinations in schizophrenia, cognitive dysfunction and suicidal behavior. In the etiopathogeny of the choroid plexus calcification there are two major factors that may trigger this effect: the biochemical and the vascular changes. Our neuroimaging data confirm that the presence of calcifications in the choroids plexus is associated with therapeutic resistance, cognitive dysfunction, persistant hallucinations and weight gain. Calcification of the pineal gland may be implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia while the reduced melatonin secretion could be associated with a specific pathological pattern for schizophrenia that is characterized by onset in puberty, negative symptoms, cerebral atrophy, ventricle enlargement, impaired cognition and poor response to antipsychotic medication and a possible increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms. The calcification of choroid plexus and pineal gland requires a re-evaluation, as it may constitute a valid indicator for the neurobiology and course of schizophrenia.</p>

<p>Bulimia nervosa (BN) is associated with a deficit of self-regulatory control and impulsivity. The present study was aimed to clarify, using electrophysiological techniques, whether impulsivity in BN subjects is related to hyperarousal, which impairs inhibitory control. Event-related potentials were recorded in 17 female patients with BN and 17 healthy controls, during a three-tone oddball task. ERP components related to response inhibition, effortful and automatic processing were analyzed. ERP topography and tomography were analyzed by means of the microstate and LORETA techniques. With respect to healthy controls, BN patients showed reduced amplitude and shorter latency of the N200; increased amplitude and shorter latency of the target SW;  higher activity of the distracter P300 generators in left fronto-parietal-temporal cortex and bilateral cingulate; lower activity of the target SW generators in right frontal gyrus, left parieto-temporal regions, and bilateral cingulate. The electrophysiological abnormalities correlated with the Barratt scores for impulsiveness. The observed electrophysiological abnormalities suggest a condition of hyperarousal, with impaired suppression of irrelevant stimuli due to abnormal cortical activation, with reduced signal-to-noise ratio. Our findings point to functional abnormalities within a neural system that subserves self-regulatory control and reward, which may contribute to binge-eating and other impulsive behaviors in women with BN.</p>

<p>In recent years, neurotechnology, the methods of utilizing brain activations based on the fruit of neuroscience, has advanced. Especially, brain-machine/computer interface (BMI/BCI) to provide a direct link between the brain and external devices has been greatly developed. We have developed neurocommunicator system for people with serious motor disabilities to communicate what they think to others using BMI technology. Neurocommunicator is a practical BMI system that interprets the intention in real time based on EEG with a small device and enables the users to convey 512 kinds of message (8×8×8). This system combines the following three core technologies: small wireless EEG amplifier, high-speed and high-accuracy BMI algorithm and user interface for efficient communication. In this study, we compared the performance and fatigue in 4 kinds of methods: two kinds of characters (Japanese characters (HIRAGANA) and Chinese characters (LOLO)) and two kinds of pictures (a human face and a house). As a result, our proposed method HIRAGANA, which is simple and familiar to us, is suggested to be the most efficient and fatigue by using the system is not significantly different among 4 methods.</p>

<p>Abnormalities of emotional processing have been reported in anxiety and depressive disorders. While anxiety might be related to a hyperactive preattentive fear response or to a reduced efficiency of late regulatory processes, depression might be related to reduced response to positive emotions. In the present study, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 30 unipolar leads, to investigate the involuntary processing of visual stimuli with different emotional valence in 33 healthy controls [HC] and 55 clinically stable patients (16 with panic disorder [PD], 15 with obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD], 13 with unipolar depression [UD] and 11 with bipolar depression [BD]). The ERPs were recorded during a target detection task, in which erotic, threatening, disgusting and neutral stimuli were used as distracters. Patients with PD showed abnormalities of the early components in response to threatening stimuli. Patients with BD showed abnormalities of both early and late ERPs components. OCD and UD patients demonstrated abnormalities of the late ERP components in response to erotic stimuli. According to our results, abnormalities of emotional processing are present in both anxiety and affective disorders, but there are both shared and distinct features in the two groups of disorders.</p>

<p>Mismatch negativity (MMN) of evoked potentials consistently showed deficits in pre-attentive information processing in schizophrenia. As opposed to the traditional “oddball” paradigm Näätänen et al. (2004) proposed an “optimized” multifeature design operating 5 different deviants. While these procedures were primarily employed in non-clinical samples we assumed a particular benefit for clinical assignments with the advantage of shorter duration, higher sensitivity and multitude of characteristics. In our first controlled study MMNm was fastest and reduced in schizophrenia in the optimized paradigm reaching mean effect sizes of 0.85 (max. 1.5) as opposed to 0.65 in the traditional MMN profile recorded with EEG (Thoennessen et al. 2008). However, changes in the early auditory processing of multiple components would also be of relevance to human speech including prosody. Therefore, further investigation of pseudowords arranged in MMN pattern with either emotionally neutral, positive or negative intonation in healthy individuals showed stronger bilateral MMNm of the latter, with predominance on the right hemisphere in the traditional and optimized designs (Thoennessen et al. 2010). These findings have implications for the early information processing and detection of physical and emotional contents of sounds, speech and social cognition of different psychiatric populations that are currently being studied.</p>

<p>Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a novel variant of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, which induces long-lasting changes in neuronal excitability. When achieved in the primary motor cortex, such physiological modulations might also produce effects on motor behavior. In the present study we applied TBS in combination with pseudo continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) in order to address the questions of whether TBS has an effect on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and if TBS-induced plasticity can modify motor behavior. Twelve right-handed healthy subjects were stimulated using an inhibitory TBS protocol at subthreshold intensity over the right motor cortex. The control condition consisted of within subject Sham treatment in a crossover design. PCASL was performed before and immediately after treatment. During the pCASL runs, the subjects performed a finger-tapping task with the left hand at individual maximum speed. We found a significant increase of CBF in the motor cortex after TBS, but not after Sham. Analysis of the behavioral data yielded no TBS-specific modulations in finger-tapping amplitude or frequency. The increase in CBF might indicate that inhibitory TBS induced a “local virtual lesion” which leads to the mobilization of more neuronal resources reflecting a compensatory response.</p>

<p>The present study investigated, if the disconnection theory of the schizophrenia (SZ) disorder can be extended to the coupling between the resting state networks (RSN) dynamics seen in fMRI, and the topographic spectral power distributions of the standard EEG frequency bands. The combined resting state EEG/fMRI of eleven SZ patients was therefore compared to 20 healthy controls (HC). Data was analyzed using Covariance Mapping (CovMap). Ten distinct RSNs were identified for each subject. Only the CovMaps for six RSNs (Default-Mode-Network (DMN), Left- Working-Memory-Network (LWMN), Somato-Motor-Network, Auditory-Cortex-Network, and two Visual Networks) proofed to be consistent and were further analyzed. The CovMaps of SZ and HC showed a significant difference for the LWMN at Theta2. Furthermore, we observed that in the DMN and the LWMN, the coupling of RSNs with higher frequency bands in HC was shifted to lower frequencies in the SZ group. These results suggest that the coupling between the functional networks and their driving frequency is aberrant in SZ. This altered coupling might enhance failures in the processing of internal and external stimuli.</p>

<p>The P300 is a cortically generated event related potential (ERP) related to cognitive functions and central information processing. Intracerebral recordings demonstrated that this potential is generated by various brain regions including frontal, temporal and parietal cortices. Clinical and genetic investigations suggest that dopaminergic neurons could be involved in the generation of the P300. Aim of this study was to elucidate dopaminergic aspects of the P300 by combining neurophysiological and nuclear medicine assessments in vivo. Patients with depression underwent both P300 recordings and [123I]IBZM SPECT for evaluation of striatal dopamine receptor availability. There were significant positive correlations of striatal dopamine receptor status with P300 amplitudes (Pearson's r = 0.746; p&lt;0.01) and negative correlations with P300 latencies (r = −0.761; p &lt; 0.01). Using a combined approach, the study presents evidence that the central dopaminergic system might play a role in P300 generation and that central dopaminergic activity could be involved in the modulation of P300 parameters. This association might be of relevance for the interpretation of P300 studies in psychiatric disorders with dopamine related pathophysiology.</p>

<p>Previous experiments in patients with phobia have shown that the administration of glucocorticoids reduces fear in phobic situations. Extensive evidence indicates that elevated glucocorticoid levels inhibit memory retrieval processes. In patients with phobia, exposure to a phobic stimulus provokes retrieval of stimulus-associated fear memory that leads to the fear response. It is therefore possible that glucocorticoids reduce phobic fear through an inhibition of fear memory retrieval. This is the first study investigating the acute anxiolytic effect of cortisol administration in spider phobic patients with fMRI when exposed to a phobic stimulus. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 30 spider phobic patients receive either 20 mg hydrocortisone or placebo 1 hour before the confrontation with a phobic stimulus in the scanner. Psychological and physiological measures are repeatedly assessed. Results: The cortisol group shows a greater amygdala activation (amygdala right: <italic>t = 2.983, p &lt; .003; </italic>amygdala left<italic>: t = 2.997, p &lt; .003</italic>) in the fast fear reaction but less amygdala activation (amygdala right: <italic>t = −2.762, p &lt; .006; </italic>amygdala left<italic>: t = −1.911, p &lt; .058</italic>) in the late fear reaction than the placebo group. Furthermore, only the cortisol group shows a reduction of subjective fear over the course of the experiment. The analysis of the preliminary data show that the administration of glucocorticoids enhance the activation of the amygdala during the fast fear reaction while it reduced the amygdala activation of the late fear processing in the cortisol group compared to the placebo group. The finding supports the view that glucocorticoids reduce phobic fear through an inhibited retrieval of fear memory in patients with phobia.</p>

<p>Twenty subjects completed the implicit association test (IAT), a common method to assess unconscious associations, while 70-channel-EEG was measured. In the IAT, stimuli from four semantic categories must be mapped to response keys in a way either congruent or incongruent with implicit associations. Event-related potentials for congruent and incongruent stimuli were compared regarding global field power (GFP) and topography, significant effects were also investigated with sLORETA source localization. Our results indicate a latency shift in left frontal networks involved in selection and preparation of rule-based, task-conform behavioral responses. During an early topographic effect (232-348 ms) these networks are already activated in the congruent condition. In a following signal-strength-effect (374-566 ms) similar left frontal networks are activated in both conditions, however activation is still stronger in congruent processing. We thus conclude that the match between associative bias and task rules in the congruent condition leads to a faster goal-directed selection and preparation of the necessary behavioral response. Contrary to this, processing in the incongruent condition more extensively activates the parahippocampal gyrus during the early (232-348 ms) as well as during a late (602-976 ms) topographic effect, possibly due to the necessity to encode and process less familiar contextual associations.</p>

<p>This study aims at the identification of the neurophysiological fingerprint of the psychological construct of motivational incongruence (mINC), which, according to Grawe’s consistency theory, is defined by insufficient realization of a person’s motivational goals. For 20 healthy subjects, individual levels of approach incongruence (apINC), avoidance incongruence (avINC) and overall incongruence (ovINC) were assessed with the INC questionnaire and 70-channel-resting-state-EEG was recorded. For 6 frequency bands (δ, σ, α1, α2, β1, β2), the following two analyses were performed: First, Spectral band power maps were correlated with INC-values in a Topographical analyses of variance and significant results were further investigated with LORETA source analyses. This yielded a significant association between α2 and apINC and Generators were localized bilaterally in the insula where activation increased with increasing apINC. Secondly, Global Field Synchronization (GFS) was extracted and correlated with INC-values, which yielded a significant correlation between α2 and avINC as well as with ovINC. Our results indicate that the Alpha2-Frequency band is most sensitive to increasing levels of incongruence. This is not only reflected by reduced functional connectivity, as measured with GFS, but also by activation changes in specific brain regions as the insula, as TANCOVA and LORETA analyses showed.</p>

<p>It is known that cognitive impairments can be observed in some patients with migraine. To clarify the neurophysiological mechanism of cognitive impairments in migraine patients, we evaluated the relationships between event-related potentials (ERPs) and various behavioral data such as performance, subtype, severity, duration, and usage of preventive medicine. Thirty one patients suffering from migraine without and with aura were enrolled in headache-free periods. Severity of the headache was assessed by headache impact test-6 (HIT-6). Two tones counting auditory oddball paradigm was used for the ERPs. EEG was recorded from 20 channels on the scalp and recomputed global field power (GFP) from the all channel. We assessed by standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). sLORETA proposed by Dr. Pascual-Marqui have employed generalized inverse solutions that estimate the current distribution in the full three-dimensional space of the brain. Forty-eight percent of patients (n = 15) were classified into the good performance group. In prefrontal lobe decreased activation of compared medication group to non-medication group, and increasing attack frequency. These findings suggest that ERPs abnormalities may reflect abnormal information-processing for the attention preceding target recognition in migraine patients. Migraine patients might have cognitive impairment even attack-free periods as well as during attack.</p>

<p>Excitatory anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (A-tDCS) over the left dorsal prefrontal cortex (DPFC) is known to improve language production. The present study examined possible neurophysiological underpinnings of this effect. The single-blinded within-subject design traced electrophysiological and behavioural correlates of A-tDCS compared to sham stimulation over the left DPFC during overt picture naming. During (online) A-tDCS the semantic interference (SI-) Effect was measured - a marker that denotes the functional integrity of the language system. After (offline) effects of A-tDCS were assessed in the delta frequency band, a marker of neural inhibition. Online A-tDCS modulated the semantic interference: The behavioural SI-Effect was found to be reduced, whereas the electro-physiological SI-Effect was enhanced over left compared to right temporal scalp-electrode sites. The modification is suggested to reflect a superior tuning of neural responses within the language system. Offline A-tDCS induced a reduction in the delta activity, interpreted to indicate neural des-inhibition. Our findings suggest that A-tDCS is capable to enhance functional and neural processes presumably within the prefrontal region. The selected markers may advance the understanding of positive A-tDCS effects in the neurorehabilitation of language production.</p>
