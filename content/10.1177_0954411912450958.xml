<abstract>
<p>Stiffness and contracture of the periarticular tissues are common complications of a post-traumatic elbow. Arthrodiatasis is a surgical technique that uses an external fixator for initial immobilization and subsequent distraction. The two prerequisites for an ideal arthrodiatasis are concentric distraction (avoiding bony contact) and hinge alignment (reducing internal stress). This study used the finite element (FE) method to clarify the relationship between these two prerequisites and the initial conditions (pin placement, elbow angle, and distraction mode). A total of 12 variations of the initial conditions were symmetrically arranged to evaluate their biomechanical influence on concentric distraction and hinge alignment. The humeroulnar surface was hypothesized to be ideally distracted orthogonal to the line joining the tips of the olecranon and the coronoid. The eccentric separation of the humeroulnar surfaces is a response to the non-orthogonality of the distracting force and joining line. Pin placement significantly affects the effective moment arm of the fixing pins to distract the bridged elbow. Both elbow angle and distraction mode directly alter the direction of the distracting force at the elbow center. In general, the hinges misalignment occurs in a direction opposite to the distraction-activated site. After joint distraction, the elastic deflection of the fixing pins inevitably makes both elbow and fixator hinges to misalign. This indicates that both joint distraction and hinge alignment are the interactive mechanisms. The humeroulnar separation is more concentric in the situation of the 120° humeral distraction by using stiffer pins with convergent placement. Even so, the eccentric displacement of the elbow hinge is a crucial consideration in the initial placement of the guiding pin to compensate for hinge misalignment.</p>

<p>Prolonged fixation of a post-traumatic joint might lead to stiffness and contracture of the bridged joint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912450958">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912450958">3</xref></sup> The solutions for these postoperative problems include physical therapy and surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912450958">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912450958"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912450958"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912450958">4</xref></sup> Arthrodiatasis is a surgery technique in which the joint is initially immobilized by an external fixator and subsequently distracted by the same fixator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912450958">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912450958"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912450958"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912450958"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912450958">6</xref></sup> The intra-operative distraction stretches the shortened ligaments and stiffened capsule and permits the separation of articular surfaces, thus decreasing resistance to joint articulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912450958">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912450958">6</xref></sup> The external fixator used in arthrodiatasis provides initial stability and later mobility for the treated joints.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912450958">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912450958"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912450958"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912450958"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912450958">9</xref></sup> Recently, arthrodiatasis has been widely used in the treatment of elbow, hip, knee, or interphalangeal joints.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912450958">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912450958">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912450958">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912450958"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912450958"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912450958"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912450958">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The two prerequisites of an ideal arthrodiatasis are concentric distraction and hinge alignment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912450958">13</xref></sup> For concentric distraction, the articular surfaces of the bridged joint are uniformly distracted to avoid undesired bony contact during joint articulation. For the elbow joint, Morrey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912450958">5</xref></sup> and Shih et al. showed that the direction of the concentric distraction is theoretically orthogonal to the line joining the tips of the olecranon and the coronoid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912450958">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912450958">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912450958">14</xref></sup> However, the load-transferring mechanism is initially driven by the distractor(s) and finally balanced by the periarticular tissues, through the fixing pins. For a stiffened elbow, the strength of the periarticular tissues and the elastic deflection of the fixing pins significantly affect the actual distraction between the articular surfaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912450958">14</xref></sup> From the biomechanical viewpoint, the elbow, fixator, and pins form a three-dimensional (3D) structure that is often constructed on the unilateral side. However, a biomechanical problem can occur if the distracting force activated by the fixator and transmitted through the pins cannot eventually be orthogonal to the joining line (i.e. concentric distraction).</p>
<p>After joint distraction, the relaxation of the periarticular tissues allows fixator-assisted dynamization to be more easily performed. During joint motion, Madey et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411912450958">15</xref></sup> showed that the hinge alignment of the distracted elbow–fixator–pin construct is necessary to eliminate postoperative resistance to motion and internal stress within the bone–fixator construct. This requires that the hinge-aligned construct is smoothly articulated, along a single hinge axis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912450958">13</xref></sup> In practice, the hinges of elbow and fixator are initially aligned, using the guiding Kirschner-pin under the control of an image intensifier. However, the elbow, fixator, and pins form a close linkage system. It is uncertain if this subsequent distraction affects the hinge alignment. This doubt was noted in the clinical studies of Jupiter and Ring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411912450958">16</xref></sup> and Ring et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912450958">17</xref></sup> They reported that one in six patients with unreduced elbow dislocation experienced breakage of a humeral pin; the reason for this complication may have been that the elbow center was not exactly aligned to the hinge distractor, causing undue torque on the pin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411912450958">16</xref></sup> The current authors further hypothesize that the interactive mechanisms of both hinge alignment and joint distraction might be also related to the initial conditions (i.e. pin placement and elbow angle) of the bridged elbow–fixator construct.</p>
<p>To the authors’ knowledge, few reports have investigated the mechanism of the interaction of both concentric distraction and hinge alignment for an initially hinged elbow–fixator–pin construct. Using the FE method, this study systematically varied the initial conditions of pin placement and elbow angle to evaluate how to arrange them for both uniform separation and smooth articulation of humeroulnar surfaces. The results aimed to provide the information about the ideal situation for the occurrence of concentric distraction and to improve the use of a hinged fixator with arthrodiatasis.</p>

<title>FE model of a bridged elbow–fixator–pin construct</title>
<p>A unilaterally hinged fixator was used and consists of two pin clamps, two ball joints, two distractors, two telescopic joints, and one rotary unit at the fixator’s center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912450958">Figure 1</xref>). The telescopic joint provides the axial adjustment, and the ball joint allows unlimited axial rotation and limited rotational adjustability in any direction about the perimeter. The distractor produces controlled elongation within the immediate postoperative period. In this study, the center of the rotary unit was precisely placed to achieve coaxial alignment of both elbow and fixator hinges. The left elbow of a 24-year-old male without any elbow disease was <italic>in vivo</italic> scanned by computerized tomographic (CT) imaging system. The anthropometric data of the subject was 76.5 kg in weight and 176.7 cm in height. The CT-scanning images with 1-mm slice separation were 3D reconstructed as an elbow model with triangular surface meshes using the software PhysiGuide Version 2.3.1 (Pou Yuen Technology Co., Ltd, Changhua, Taiwan). The elbow surface model was further transformed into a solid model with smooth and seamless surfaces using the software, SolidWorks, Ed. 2011 (SolidWorks Corporation, Concord, MA, USA).</p>

<p>The anatomical configuration of the elbow ligaments cannot be not clearly defined by the CT-scanning and even magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. Hence, the anatomical shape, origin, and insertion of each periarticular ligament were visually checked in literature reports and CT-scanning images and manually sketched, in the SolidWorks environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912450958">Figure 2(a)</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912450958">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411912450958"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411912450958">20</xref></sup> There were five ligaments in the elbow models, including the anterior medial collateral ligament (AMCL), the posterior medial collateral ligament (PMCL), the annular ligament of radius (AL), the radial collateral ligament (RCL), and the lateral ulnar collateral ligament (LUCL).</p>

</fig>
<p>Two 5.5-mm pins were instrumented at the deltoid insertion of the humerus. For the ulna, the entry points of two 4.5-mm pins were on the dorsal side.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912450958">21</xref></sup> Both sides of the fixator were secured to the humerus and ulna by four fixing pins through the clamps. After the pins were fixed, each telescopic joint of the fixator was aligned parallel to the longitudinal axis of the humerus and ulna from the view of the coronal plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912450958">Figure 2(b)</xref>). The hinges of both elbow and fixator were set to initially coaxial in the SolidWorks environment. In order to simplify computation, the threads, fillets, and chamfers of the pins and fixator were neglected in the FE model.</p>
<p>In this study, two Cartesian coordinate systems (<italic>X-Y-Z</italic> and <italic>x-y-z</italic>) were established with origins at the elbow center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912450958">Figure 2(c)</xref>). The elbow center was defined as the center of three concentric circles fitting to the bottoms of the trochlear sulcus, capitulum, and medial facet of the trochlea. After joint distraction, the <italic>X-Y-Z</italic> system was used to describe the movement of elbow and fixator hinges projected onto the sagittal plane. The distraction of the humeroulnar surfaces was calculated and expressed in terms of the <italic>x-y-z</italic> system. In this study, the longitudinal axis of the humerus was vertically fixed in space and defined as the <italic>Z</italic>-axis. The <italic>Y</italic>-axis was aligned with the elbow hinge in the lateromedial direction. For the <italic>x-y-z</italic> system, the <italic>x</italic>-axis was defined as the line joining the two tips of the intact olecranon and coronoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912450958">Figure 2(c)</xref>). The <italic>y</italic>-axis was coaxial with the elbow hinge. For concentric distraction, the relative movement between humerus and ulna only occurs along the <italic>z</italic>-axis. Otherwise, the eccentric distraction causes 2D and even 3D movement between the articulating surfaces.</p>
<p>In practice, joint distraction can be activated at any variation of pin placement and elbow angle. Three pin placements were purposely arranged to evaluate the biomechanical effect of the effective moment arm on joint distraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912450958">Figure 3</xref>). The effective moment arm was defined as the distance between the bone–pin intersection point (<italic>A</italic> for humerus and <italic>B</italic> for ulna) and the pin–clamp intersection point (<italic>C, D</italic>, or <italic>E</italic> for humerus and <italic>F, G</italic>, or <italic>H</italic> for ulna). The fixing pins were placed at three different insertion angles: convergent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912450958">Figure 4(a1)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912450958">(b1)</xref>), orthogonal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912450958">Figure 4(a2)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912450958">(b2)</xref>), and divergent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912450958">Figure 4(a3)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912450958">(b3)</xref>) types. The inclined angle of both convergent and divergent models was 10° with respect to the longitudinal axis of the fixed bone. In this study, the elbow angle was defined as the inclined angle between the humeral and ulnar axes projected onto the sagittal plane. The clinical and anatomical reasons make this study consider only two elbow angles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912450958">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411912450958">22</xref></sup> For the clinical reason, the orthopedic clinician often manipulates the fixator distractors to the situation that both humerus and ulna are nearly orthogonal. The flexed elbow with 120° was chosen in response to the anatomical fact that the line joining the tips of the olecranon and coronoid is inclined about 30° to the ulnar axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912450958">Figure 2(c)</xref>). A previous study by the current authors concluded that the concentric distraction occurs at the 120° elbow angle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912450958">14</xref></sup> The distraction of the bridged elbow was performed on both the humeral and the ulnar sides.</p>

<p>In this study, the mechanical contribution of the cancellous bone is neglected and the humerus, radius, and ulna are simulated as cortical shells with thickness determined from the CT-scanning images. All materials were assumed to have linearly elastic, homogeneous, and isotropic material properties throughout their composition. For the fixator, pin, and bone, the values of Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio were respectively estimated to be 200 GPa and 0.3 (316L stainless steel), and 15 GPa and 0.3 (cortical bone).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912450958">14</xref></sup> In this study, the ligaments were used as the stiffener for the elbow complex. To the authors’ knowledge, there is no literature data to quantitatively provide the stiffened properties of the adherent elbow joints. Furthermore, there is still insufficient detailed information about the material nonlinearity of the periarticular ligaments.</p>
<p>For the healthy ligaments, the pre-tension exists between the bridged bones to constrain the excessive motion of the bones. However, the long-term bony immobilization induces the ossification of the periarticular ligaments; thus leading to the elbow stiffness. Consequently, the current authors assumed the ligament properties of the stiffened elbow to be strengthened rather than pre-tensioned much more. In this study, the stiffened elbow was simulated by increasing the Young’s moduli of the healthy and elder ligaments with linearly elastic properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912450958">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912450958">18</xref></sup> The Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio of the healthy and elder ligaments were given as: 118 MPa and 0.49 (AMCL), 97 MPa and 0.49 (PMCL), and 54 MPa and 0.49 (AL, RCL and LUCL). However, the Young’s moduli of the periarticular ligaments were increased 25% and 50% to simulate the different extent of the elbow stiffness (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411912450958">Table 1</xref>). The calculated stresses of fixator and pins were compared with the yielding strength (=896 MPa) of the 316L cold-worked stainless steel to validate the assumption of linear elasticity.</p>

<p>In this study, the elbow distraction was simulated by immobilizing the humeral head and deriving the distractors with constant elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912450958">Figure 2(b)</xref>). The induced displacement between the articular surfaces of the humerus and ulna was calculated with respect to the <italic>x-y-z</italic> system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912450958">Figure 2(c)</xref>). There are two distractors on two sides of the fixator center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912450958">Figure 1</xref>). For humeral distraction, a total elongation of 10 mm was applied equally at both the humeral telescopic rod and tube in this study. A similar method was assumed for ulnar distraction.</p>
<p>In this study, an automatic mesh generation algorithm is used with the software Simulation Ed. 2010 (SolidWorks Corporation, Concord, MA, USA). A special element density, which is twice that for the rest of the model, was used for the fixing pins and ligaments. The overall average element size was 2 mm. Furthermore, there was a refinement of the mesh in the vicinity of the fixing pins, to improve the modeling accuracy until excellent monotonic convergence behavior (h-adaptive method) with&lt;1% difference in the total strain energy was achieved. The meshing strategy achieves a curved element boundary, so that there are no sharp discontinuities that induce an unrealistically high stress concentration. Using aspect ratio and Jacobian checks, all ten-node tetrahedral elements were observed to be within acceptable distortion limits, maximizing the accuracy of the results. The final meshes averagely consist of 335,029 elements (convergent), 339,481 elements (orthogonal), and 345,459 elements (divergent) for the 120° model and 343,813 elements (convergent), 343,366 elements (orthogonal), and 351,423 elements (divergent) for the 90° model. The differences in node and element numbers were attributed to the variations in pin length and ligament volume among the six models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912450958">Figure 4</xref>). The interaction of the contact surfaces within the distractors and fixator was simulated with surface-to-surface contact elements without friction. A similar assumption holds for the articular surfaces of the bridged elbow. The other interfaces were modeled as perfectly bonded. The solver used in this study was the direct sparse method, which can provide more accurate results for the model with higher strength difference between metal, bone, and ligaments. Three investigated parameters included elbow angle, pin placement, and distraction mode. Totally, there were 12 variations of the initial conditions for the parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912450958">Figure 4</xref>). There were two elbow angles (90° and 120°), three pin placements (convergent, orthogonal, and divergent), and two distraction modes (humerus and ulna).</p>

The separation of the articular surfaces for 12 variations are schematically illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411912450958">Figure 6</xref>.

The ulnar distraction even induced a higher value of eccentric than concentric distraction. Both indicate that 3D eccentric distraction occurred for all variations. On average, the effective distraction (i.e. along the <italic>z</italic>-direction) was 27.2% of the initial distraction (= 10 mm) driven by the distractor. This loss of distraction was significantly higher than the reported value (50%–60%) of the study by Mader et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912450958">21</xref></sup></p>

<p>Compared with the orthogonal and divergent types, the convergent type of humeral distraction leads to the highest value of concentric (i.e. <italic>z</italic>-directed) and eccentric (i.e. <italic>y</italic>-directed) distraction for both 120° and 90° bridged elbows. For ulnar distraction, the <italic>z</italic>-directed distraction for the convergent type was still somewhat higher than the other types. Of the two distraction modes, concentric distraction of the 120° elbow was more effective than its counterpart for all pin placements. On average, the <italic>x</italic>-distraction for the ulnar mode was about 11.9 and 3.8 times that of the humeral mode for the 120° and 90° elbow, respectively. However, the aforementioned results were only 0.8 and 0.6 times for the <italic>z</italic>-directed distraction.</p>

<title>Hinge alignment</title>
<p>After distraction, the misalignment of the elbow and fixator hinges were expressed in terms of the relative movement of the two hinges projected onto the <italic>Z–X</italic> plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912450958">Figure 7</xref>). All variations of each humeral and ulnar distraction consistently showed the occurrence of hinge misalignment for the distracted elbow–fixator–pin construct. For humeral distraction, the values of hinge misalignment for all six variations were almost equal (≅5.20 mm). In comparison, the 120° elbow with ulnar distraction showed a remarkably lesser value (≅4.03 mm) of hinge misalignment than the 90° elbow (≅7.92 mm). The misalignment of the humeral distraction was most evident in the <italic>Z</italic>-direction. For ulnar distraction, the <italic>X</italic>-misalignment of the 90° elbow was significantly larger than that of the 120° elbow, but the <italic>Z</italic>-misalignment was less than that of the 120° elbow. From convergent to divergent placement, the average difference in the <italic>X</italic>- and <italic>Z</italic>-misalignment for the variations of elbow angles and distraction modes were 0.33 mm and 0.18 mm, respectively. The elbow angle was a determinant of affecting the eccentric distraction. In comparison with elbow angle and distraction mode, pin placement plays quite a minor role in hinge misalignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912450958">Figure 7</xref>). For the other stiffened elbows, the results of joint distraction and hinge alignment were given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411912450958">Table 1</xref>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>During the intra-operative period, the concentric distraction of the bridged joint is expected to avoid improper bony contact. After distraction, the ideal articulation is defined as the condition where both elbow and fixator hinges coaxially align and smoothly rotate, thus eliminating internal stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912450958">13</xref></sup> However, the achievement of both prerequisites present demands for the technique and the device, which were the motivation for this study. In this study, some initial conditions were systematically varied to numerically evaluate their biomechanical effect on joint distraction and hinge alignment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411912450958">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Joint distraction</title>
<p>For concentric distraction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411912450958">Figure 8(a)</xref> showed that the movement line of the elbow center should be along the <italic>z</italic>-axis and eccentric displacement should be minimized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912450958">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912450958">14</xref></sup> However, all variations of the initial conditions consistently demonstrated the existence of eccentric displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912450958">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411912450958">6</xref>). This indicated that the resultant distracting force at the elbow center is not exactly orthogonal to the joining line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411912450958">Figure 8(b)</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411912450958">(d)</xref>. This can be explained in terms of the fixator placement and distractor orientation. In contrast to a bilateral system, the unilateral distraction simulated in this study inevitably induced a <italic>y</italic>-directed displacement, between the humeroulnar surfaces. In clinical practice, the telescopic tube orientates nearly parallel to the bone axis and distracts the pins along the <italic>x</italic>- and <italic>z</italic>-directions, except for the 120° elbow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912450958">Figures 2(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411912450958">8(a)</xref>). Nevertheless, eccentric distraction can be further reduced by proper arrangement of the initial conditions and the related mechanism can be discussed in terms of biomechanical, surgical, and anatomical factors.</p>

<p>From the biomechanical viewpoint, both loss and eccentricity of actual distraction at the elbow are the major concerns for the arthrodiatasis technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912450958">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912450958">14</xref></sup> The pin deflection of the distracted elbow–fixator–pin construct has been observed and results in distraction loss along the load-transferring paths.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912450958">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954411912450958">23</xref></sup> The distraction for convergent placement was more concentric than that for other types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912450958">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411912450958">6</xref>). This can be explained by the fact that the effective moment arm and the induced pin deflection of convergent placement is the least, compared with the other types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912450958">Figure 4</xref>). On the humeral and ulnar sides, the moment arm of convergent placement averaged 25.0% less than that of divergent placement. Another rigidity-induced problem was the difference in diameter between the humeral and ulnar pins. Owing to limited space, the fixing pin at the ulnar side was 4.5 mm in diameter, thus leading to a greater deflection than that for the 5.5-mm pin at the humeral side. Consequently, the distraction loss for the ulnar distraction was higher than that for the humeral distraction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912450958">14</xref></sup> From the surgical viewpoint, this implies that the distractor at the humeral side should be preferable for decreasing the distraction loss through the fixing pins.</p>
<p>From the anatomical viewpoint, the distracting force of the 120° elbow is comparatively orthogonal to the joining line, thus resulting in the more concentric distraction than the 90° counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912450958">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411912450958">6</xref>). Overall, the static distraction of a stiffened elbow should be activated in the situation of humeral distraction with convergent placement and at a 120° angle. However, there exists a potential problem that the articulating elbow continuously alters the inclined angle between the humeral axis and joining line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411912450958">Figure 8(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411912450958">(d)</xref>). This reveals the design information about how to ensure that the distracting force is always orthogonal to the joining line during elbow articulation. Until now, however, such a complicated fixator with arthrodiatasis has not been developed for clinical use.</p>

<sec id="section9-0954411912450958">
<title>Hinge alignment</title>
<p>As a close-linkage system, the distraction of the initially hinged elbow–fixator–pin construct inevitably affect the initial alignment of both elbow and fixator hinges. For all variations, the results of the current study demonstrate the phenomena of hinge misalignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912450958">Figure 7</xref>). For humeral distraction, the hinge of the distracted fixator shifts toward the ulnar side (<italic>Z-</italic>direction). Similarly, the fixator hinge is shifted to the humeral side (<italic>X-</italic> and <italic>Z</italic>-directions) while the ulnar distractor drives the elbow distraction. This finding is also supported by a technical manual of the fixator manufacture and clinical studies of the post-traumatic elbows of children and adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912450958">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411912450958">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411912450958">25</xref></sup> For humeral distraction using the Orthofix system, it is suggested that the guiding pin be inserted at the proximal border of the ring structure to compensate for the distal shift of the fixator hinge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912450958">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411912450958">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411912450958">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hinge misalignment for humeral distraction is concentrated in the <italic>Z</italic>-direction, but ulnar distraction leads to the more diverse misalignments in the <italic>Z–X</italic> plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912450958">Figure 7</xref>). For the clinician, the <italic>X</italic>- and <italic>Z</italic>-directed misalignments make the adjustment of the guiding Kirschner-pin complicated prior to distraction. Additionally, the hinge misalignments for the 90° and 120° elbows are more consistent for the humeral than the ulnar distraction. The predicted results reveal that the control of misalignment of humeral distraction is better than that of ulnar distraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912450958">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>Two reasons make the current authors exclude the muscular contractions from the FE analysis. The first reason was the clinical fact that the clinician often drives the distractor(s) of the arthrodiatasis fixator in the manner of passive distraction. It means that the elbow distraction is performed in the situation of no muscular contractions. The second was the indefinite information of the muscular contractions. To the authors’ knowledge, the literature reports cannot provide the detailed data of the muscular kinetics at different elbow angles.</p>
<p>Similarly, two reasons made the authors simulate the periarticular ligaments as the linearly elastic materials. The first reason was that there is no literature data to provide the definitive information about the material properties of the stiffened ligaments. This made the authors difficult to further assume the nonlinear properties of the ligaments. In this study, the ligament was modeled as the block material rather than as the spring element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912450958">Figure 3</xref>). From the authors’ experience, the numerous elements of the nonlinear ligaments lead to the excessive calculation of the nonlinear analysis. This was the second reason that the convergence problem constrains the simulation of the nonlinear ligaments. Overall, this study varied the extent of the stiffened elbow by increasing the elastic moduli of healthy and elderly ligaments by two increments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411912450958">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the eccentric separation between the humeroulnar surfaces always exists in response to the non-orthogonality of the distracting force and joining line. The initial conditions, such as pin placement, elbow angle, and distraction mode, significantly affect the direction of the distracting force at the elbow center. Both joint distraction and hinge alignment of the bridged elbow are the interactive mechanisms that the eccentric distraction inevitably induces the misalignment of the elbow and fixator hinges. For the elbow arthrodiatasis, the humeroulnar separation is more concentric in the situation of distracting the 120° elbow on the humeral side and using stiffer pins with convergent placement.</p>
