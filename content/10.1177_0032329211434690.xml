<body>
<p>The crisis of 2007-09 was prefigured by bubbles in the housing and mortgage credit markets of major Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Conventional wisdom has it that the excesses of subprime mortgage lending in the United States triggered the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored enterprises (GSE) that were instrumental in making housing affordable for low- and middle-income households, had to be nationalized in order to prevent a collapse of U.S. mortgage markets. This could not prevent a surge in foreclosures and in mortgage credit defaults. Markets for household debt as well as affordable housing policy became part of the larger crisis and one may well wonder which is to blame.</p>
<p>A comparison of the United States with the United Kingdom and France can shed light on this question. It reveals that, contrary to popular perception, the two European countries arguably had a bigger housing price bubble, more volatility, and a more short-termist mortgage market. Yet, the fallout of the crisis—in terms of overindebtedness of mortgage holders, foreclosures of homes, and the extent to which the “nest-eggs” of households were diminished—has been worse in the United States. First of all, this suggests that the buildup of the crisis was a broader trend and not made in the United States, as many Europeans like to believe. Moreover, once the risks materialized, it was not preordained that in mean, lean Anglophone welfare states the less well off must take all the pain. Social policy interventions can distribute hardship more equitably, as the United Kingdom shows, and a similar potential for crisis need not lead to the same damage, as the French case illustrates.</p>
<p>This article explores which differences in the social policy of financial inclusion can account for this puzzle, namely a similar buildup of a crisis in very different welfare states and stark differences in mitigating its consequences, even between Anglophone countries. How have welfare state interventions supported or even instigated the creation of markets for affordable housing finance? What was done to contain the risks involved for vulnerable households? And what insurance is given when households become overindebted? For answers, one can look at the broader welfare state changes that made the promotion of homeownership look attractive to policymakers, their constituencies, and supporting market forces.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0032329211434690">1</xref></sup> Here, the main features of promoting homeownership in each country are analyzed in more detail to see how policies enlist market forces and attract or repel the political representation of interests that can explain the differences in how severely the crisis affected homeowners.</p>
<p>Comparative welfare state research has barely started analyzing social policies in their relationship with financial markets generally, and mortgage credit in particular.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0032329211434690">2</xref></sup> Under the influence of Esping-Andersen’s famous typology of welfare capitalisms, the literature focused on how interventions served to more or less decommodify labor in the sense of making living standards less dependent on earnings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0032329211434690">3</xref></sup> This dominant tradition thus ignores the commodifying effect that social policies have, notably in allowing unemployed, poor, or discriminated against households to participate in markets other than that for labor. The use of financial markets for providing old-age security or opportunities for families and minorities has been registered in this social policy tradition only as commodification, retrenchment, and a retreat of the welfare state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0032329211434690">4</xref></sup> This misses the point that the welfare state spends vast amounts on tax expenditure to give households an incentive to save for nest eggs and that governments have become deeply involved in social regulation of pension funds and insurers. The responses to the financial crisis have revealed that privatized welfare is backed up by implicit or explicit social insurance, even if unconventional social policymakers, such as central banks, provide it.</p>
<p>The spread of homeownership is one of the universal trends of the twentieth century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0032329211434690">5</xref></sup> Once a privilege of the rich, it has become an aspiration of many. This makes it a useful policy to study if one is interested more generally in how social policies create and shape (financial) markets, not merely compensate for their failure. Social policies around homeownership are typically commodifying and decommodifying at the same time. Low- and middle-income families are given access to mortgage credit and, by acquiring this asset, can afford to retreat permanently from rental markets for accommodation services. This leads to an expansion of the not-for-profit household economy. Tax systems often create the impression that a shift to homeownership represents decommodification because rental income is taxed but the imputed rent from homeownership is not. All three countries studied here have this homeownership bias in their tax systems, which makes it a popular social policy for middle-class families. At the same time, homeownership is commodifying because it ties and stabilizes the labor force, and shapes political preferences toward private property.</p>
<p>The next section outlines the puzzle that the comparative case study of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France poses in the context of the housing and mortgage credit crises. The following section summarizes how the promotion of homeownership evolved in each country. The fourth section presents a general framework for analyzing how social policy affects markets; that framework is then applied to analyze how the various ways of promoting homeownership may have made a difference to the outcome of the financial crisis in each country. The conclusion discusses these findings in terms of how policies created the politics that can account for these differences.</p>

<title>The Puzzle of U.S., U.K., and French Housing Bubbles</title>
<p>The comparison of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France presents a straightforward puzzle. The United States was not the OECD country with the worst housing bubble and the most myopic mortgage credit market (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0032329211434690">Table 1</xref>). On the contrary, another Anglophone country (the United Kingdom) and a prototypical continental European country (France) had arguably more overvalued and volatile housing markets as well as short-term oriented mortgage markets. And yet the crash of both housing prices and mortgage lending was much more devastating for households in the United States than in either of the others.</p>

<p>The housing market peaked and tanked earlier in the United States than in Europe. But even different years of indexation would show that the United Kingdom and, more surprisingly, France experienced more rapid growth of house prices over the last fifteen years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0032329211434690">6</xref></sup> This holds also when measured against average income and rents, arguably more relevant indicators for households considering a change in housing arrangements than general housing price increases. The fall in housing prices was not so deep and has recovered in both European countries, even though volatility of real housing prices was higher in both during the period that preceded this spectacular rise. Finally, when it comes to the mortgage market, it turns out that households tend to get, on average, a longer maturity for repayment in the United States, although early repayment can change the effective maturity of loans considerably (see below). Although each indicator is just a snapshot and a statistical reality that the average homebuyer may not be aware of, the indicators should at least give pause to someone who thinks that the housing crisis was made in the United States. The potential for it was present elsewhere.</p>
<p>Whereas <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0032329211434690">Table 1</xref> shows that the two European countries had higher crisis potential, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0032329211434690">Table 2</xref> shows that the damage done was greater in the United States. Indicators show for each country, first, how vulnerable households were to debt default and losing their homes and, second, how much they were actually hit by the crisis.</p>

<p>In terms of debt exposure, U.S. households were less vulnerable than U.K. households and somewhat more than French.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0032329211434690">7</xref></sup> A similar picture is given by the fall in house prices: U.S. households experienced a lesser fall over two years than British households and a somewhat—but not drastically —higher fall than the French. There is no evidence for negative equity being a widespread problem for French households, but the British problem is considerable (about one in ten homes in the first quarter of 2009), yet still less compared to in the United States, where about one in six properties were “under water” at the end of 2008. The problem leveled off in the United Kingdom and never became as dramatic as in the United States where about a quarter of all homes had gone under water by the first quarter of 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0032329211434690">8</xref></sup> The one indicator that can explain why U.S. households were more susceptible to debt default was the rapid rise in unemployment, from a lower level than both the United Kingdom and France. Default on mortgages in the United States is double the rate of the United Kingdom, and the number of foreclosures is staggering. In France, foreclosures are low and have not been rising.</p>
<p>The next two sections cannot hope to give a full explanation of this puzzle. But they explore—in the spotlight of crisis—to what extent social policy might have played a role, both in contributing to a similar potential for crisis and to the rather different manifestations. Comparative welfare state research, which defines social policy by its contribution to decommodification, is not much help in this respect; that is why we need to develop our analytical framework to analyze the relationship between welfare interventions and markets. Before that, I show that in all three countries of interest promoting homeownership was social policy by somewhat unusual means.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0032329211434690">
<title>The Evolution of Social Policies around Homeownership</title>
<p>The long-established policy of promoting homeownership in the United States is by now a familiar example of social policy conducted outside the labor market. Fannie Mae (FNMA or the Federal National Mortgage Association) was founded in 1938 but turned into an off-budget vehicle with an implicit government guarantee in 1968. The primary mortgage market served by depository institutions (“thrifts”) was considered by the Johnson administration to be too fragmented to lead to a significant change in homeownership. In 1970, Freddie Mac (the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Cooperation) followed to break the monopoly of Fannie Mae and securitize mortgages issued by the thrifts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0032329211434690">9</xref></sup> The “new” Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were to create a secondary market in mortgages, with liquidity and security supported by Congressional charter. In order to do so, the GSEs got privileges, tax exemptions, and a federal government credit line if needed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0032329211434690">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the 1980s, a cross-party consensus emerged that the policy to support mortgage markets should become more targeted. In 1992, the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act was passed to create an “affordable housing mission” for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This legislation asked the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to implement three quotas that the GSEs must fulfill by allocating certain shares of their yearly mortgage purchases to loans with affordable characteristics such as the low or moderate income of the borrower or residency in deprived areas. The mortgage market expanded rapidly in the 1990s, as investment banks finally got interested in this market. The financial innovation of mortgage-backed securities that made trading in high risks possible had been invented much earlier, in 1970. The inventor was not a bank but Ginnie Mae (the Government Mortgage Loan Association), split off when the “old” Fannie Mae was privatized, so as to keep a mortgage insurance function inside government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0032329211434690">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>We can thus see the promotion of homeownership as a continuation of social policy for the Great Society in the United States. But does this apply to welfare states in Europe? Or do we have to see homeownership there as a retreat from social policy, given that safeguards for low-rent accommodation were a well-developed intervention in many European countries, necessitated by the devastation of the housing stock in World War II? After the 1960s, rent control for private accommodation and direct provision of social housing fell out of favor with policymakers and the public at large; these interventions became associated with low-quality accommodation and the spatial concentration of social problems. In France and the United Kingdom, the promotion of homeownership was politically sold as modernizing and liberalizing well-established affordable housing policies.</p>
<p>The right-to-buy policy of the Thatcher administration in the late 1980s marked this change in characteristically contentious fashion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0032329211434690">12</xref></sup> It was retrenchment but also social policy in that flats were not simply auctioned off to the highest bidder. Up to 2.2 million occupants of council estates bought their accommodations at highly subsidized prices between 1980 and 2003.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0032329211434690">13</xref></sup> This policy of “social privatization” by the Thatcher administration also allowed building societies to engage in high loan-to-value lending so that low-income households could afford the mortgages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0032329211434690">14</xref></sup> It was an early U.K. variant of highly leveraged subprime lending. Yet, to this very day, “social renting” provides shelter to about 20 percent of British households, down from more than a third of the population but still higher than in France (17 percent) and in the United States (3 percent).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0032329211434690">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In France, reforms since the mid-1990s were incremental but had a discernible thrust.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0032329211434690">16</xref></sup> The promotion of homeownership for low-income households was a response to targeting problems in public housing, which increasingly provided cheap, fixed-rent accommodation to households that were no longer poor but exercised their right to stay. This happened with the approval of urban planners as the social mix from upward mobility of residents prevents ghettoization. Homeownership for low-income households was promoted through loans at fixed interest rates that were negative in real terms when inflation was high. As inflation fell and real interest rates rose, a means-tested zero-interest rate loan, mainly for buying a new dwelling, was introduced, covering up to 20 percent of the housing cost and up to 50 percent of credit. It has to be paid back only once all other credit is paid back and thus amounts to a subsidy of the down payment, addressing the borrowing constraints of this clientele.</p>
<p>Thus, in all three countries the promotion of homeownership was social policy and became in some ways more explicitly so as the measures were increasingly directed at excluded or financially constrained households. But important differences still existed between them, which would be lost and misspecified if we looked at them only through the lens of the dichotomy between commodification and decommodification. Compared to the <italic>status quo ante</italic>, where governments either ignored the issue or had a public housing sector, all these measures to promote homeownership were commodifying. Yet, commodification does not exclude that the measures were social policy by other means and that governments became ever more involved in social regulation of market provisions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0032329211434690">
<title>Creating, Correcting and Compensating Mortgage Markets in Three Countries</title>
<p>In any one social policy area—such as affordable housing or, even more narrowly, the promotion of homeownership—governments apply a myriad of policy instruments, some of which tackle social problems and others market failures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0032329211434690">17</xref></sup> Yet they do so at different stages of the welfare provision and this is presumably decisive for the overall thrust and effect of the policy. Comparative welfare state research tends to take generic instruments, such as insurance, means testing, and universal public goods provision as the defining characteristic of a social policy. Esping-Andersen’s “Worlds of Welfare Capitalism” labeled insurance as conservative, means testing as liberal, and universal benefits as of social-democratic pedigree, respectively. Yet, this classification cannot help in identifying the thrust of a welfare state intervention overall, let alone of an entire welfare state, if all of these supposedly conservative, liberal, and social-democratic instruments are deployed in every major policy area such as pensions or health care—and even in some minor ones, as we will see.</p>
<p>Hence I propose to take the relationship to markets as the defining characteristic of a social policy, here: of promoting homeownership. Specifically, one might distinguish between market-creating, market-correcting, and market-compensating social policies. This distinction is inspired by Titmuss’ division of welfare, which implicitly distinguishes between interventions into the distribution of primary income (occupational welfare), the translation of primary into taxable income (fiscal welfare), and the redistribution of tax revenue between persons (social welfare). They can obviously be provided at the same time and, as Titmuss notices, this layering makes the overall redistributive effect of the government’s various policy interventions quite hard to determine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0032329211434690">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Market-creating social policies distribute resources or shift risks such that a virtual market demand can meet a virtual market supply, generating primary income. Direct mortgage subsidies to households with borrowing constraints are an example for the distribution of resources that can create (a particular segment of) a retail credit market. The segment is identifiable in terms of the product traded, say small size and with a particular timeline of debt service. In a similar vein, the creation of a market for mortgages through government guarantees is a classic example of socializing (credit) risk and thus creating a (primary) mass retail market for housing finance; this is what the government-sponsored entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac did.</p>
<p>Market-correcting or shaping social policies come into play at the point of contracting and try to create a level playing field between unequal market parties or to shift risk to the side with presumably higher risk-bearing capacity. Financial consumer protection is the most obvious example. This “shaping” may actually take the form of reining in markets for certain products considered too dangerous, such as mortgages with low teaser interest rates that give households the misleading impression of cheap credit. Restrictions on loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios are also common market-correcting policies that are meant to prevent overindebtedness of households.</p>
<p>Market-compensating social policies include all policies where the intervention serves to alleviate the hardships associated with a particular market outcome or serves to prevent a particular outcome such as the loss of a home. Overindebtedness is the casualty relevant here. Social protection in this case can mean debtor-friendly rules that give prompt discharge or make foreclosure difficult. Compared to laissez-faire, these regulations shift the provision of insurance to the lender or the public purse. The public purse invariably bears some of the risk, indirectly through foregone tax revenue and general support for households who became overindebted due to an income shock like unemployment or divorce. The insurance may be even more direct, namely when transfers actually cover interest on the mortgage of an overindebted household that has fallen behind in its debt service.</p>
<p>In the following section, these three constitutive roles of social policy for markets and the particular rationale for intervention are used to identify the emphasis or thrust of homeownership promotion in the three countries relative to each other. This also requires looking at the connections and possible tensions between market creating, correcting, and compensating interventions. As already mentioned, even a small policy area such as the promotion of homeownership consists of a myriad of expenditure, tax, and regulatory instruments. So a selection had to be made that ensures coverage of these generically relevant social policies. Moreover, instruments were chosen that are important for at least one country and have a comparator in at least one other.</p>

<p>One longstanding policy to create mortgage markets for excluded aspiring homeowners is to subsidize them into affordability, either through direct subsidies or more hidden tax allowances. Another is for the government to provide guarantees—in other words social insurance—either to the lender in the case of borrower’s default or to the borrower when income shocks such as illness or unemployment strike. Neither the United Kingdom nor France had significant tax subsidies for homeowners, but homeowners enjoy very substantial tax breaks in the United States. In the United Kingdom, insurance for lenders is entirely private; in France it is public; and both public and private mortgage insurance is available in the United States. The discussion of social insurance for borrowers is left to subsection III below, despite its potential market-creating functions (the guarantee of a basic income that covers debt service can make lenders inclined to give credit in the first place).</p>
<p>Tax subsidies to homeowners in the United States are among the highest in the OECD world, reducing the actual debt financing costs by about 1 percent (data for 2009),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0032329211434690">19</xref></sup> a considerable subsidy if capitalized over the lifetime of a mortgage. These tax subsidies are also extremely regressive, allowing households to deduct from their taxable income interest for loans of up to $1,000,000 and real estate tax at the marginal (highest) rate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0032329211434690">20</xref></sup> They therefore benefit predominantly households who could already afford a mortgage and do not amount to much market creating through social policy. In France, by contrast, general tax relief for mortgages held by owner-occupiers, which reduced interest costs by 25 percent, ended in 1997-98. It was, in any case, a tax credit (rising with family size, up to a certain loan amount), which made it less regressive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0032329211434690">21</xref></sup> Shortly before, in 1995, a zero-interest loan was introduced for low-income households, so a direct and open subsidy replaced the hidden tax measure. It amounts to a subsidy of the down payment for households with borrowing constraints. It can be used only for the purchase of new dwellings, which means that the supply of relatively cheaper or smaller dwellings has been stimulated in this way; and it led to the emergence entire neighborhoods of so-called “PTZ homes” in new urban centers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0032329211434690">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The mortgage guarantees that the U.S. Federal Housing Administration (FHA) gives to this very day have historically been important market makers, providing a boost to residential construction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0032329211434690">23</xref></sup> Borrowers pay a fee that insures the loan in case of default. Taking this insurance is mandatory for high loan-to-value mortgages and is particularly attractive for low-value homes. Although private mortgage insurance has reduced this central role of the FHA guarantee somewhat, it has not eliminated it, because the GSEs like Fannie Mae refinance only federally guaranteed loans. This has given the FHA a role in helping more subprime borrowers obtain mortgages.</p>
<p>In France, government guarantees play a crucial role for housing finance because the guarantee often substitutes for the mortgage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0032329211434690">24</xref></sup> Hence, about half of all housing finance comes from personal long-term loans. The conditions are more favorable for the lenders in the case of default—given that repossessions are difficult—and cheaper for a borrower who pays back rapidly. But the selection criteria of the guarantors tend to be stricter than those of the lenders; thus the insurance amounts to a second credit assessment and reinforces lending that assesses the ability of the borrower to repay rather than the value of a security. The downside of this guarantee, provided mostly by the state-owned Credit Foncier, is that it can be seen as creating financial exclusion. So, in 1993, another guarantee scheme was founded, provided by FGAS (Le Fonds de Garantie de l’Accession Sociale à la propriété), in which the government is a member alongside banks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0032329211434690">25</xref></sup> Only loans to low-income borrowers qualify for this guarantee, and lenders pay the fees. Since it is safe to assume that the lenders pass on this fee, this means that all their customers have to contribute to the insurance pool for mortgages of low-income households.</p>
<p>This suggests that in France, subsidies and insurance create niche markets for specific target groups while also keeping market forces in check. The changes were all introduced in the early to mid-1990s when housing inequality, and the failure of public rental housing programs, had become very public concerns. In the United States, market creation was more ambitious, not narrowly targeted. The majority of middle-class households may not notice at all that they receive a housing benefit in the form of tax reductions and an implicit guarantee to their lenders. This has allowed for rather regressive redistribution, obscured by the conspicuous promotion of subprime markets.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom stands out in that it has none of these market-creating policy interventions to promote homeownership. And yet, it is the only European country that has a near equivalent to the U.S. market for subprime mortgages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0032329211434690">26</xref></sup> It will be argued below that this market evolved in the United Kingdom as a consequence of permissive consumer protection that was not motivated by social policy concerns.</p>
<p>What were the political drivers of the targeted measures adopted in the United States, which deliberately created a subprime mortgage market? A critical report, undertaken by a committee of the House of Representatives, summarizes the politics of this legislative change: “Congress granted HUD the authority to adjust these three affordable housing quotas for the GSEs over time allowing both Democratic and Republican Administrations to consistently make campaign promises to boost homeownership through government intervention in the market.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0032329211434690">27</xref></sup> The affordable housing policy created the opportunity for pork-barrel politics without immediate budgetary consequences; it was popular across party lines because it was social policy on display that at the same time created market opportunities for financial firms.</p>
<p>The market-creating social policy was spectacularly successful in terms of its own goals. Federal Reserve Bank Governor Edward Gramlich—known for his opposition to Greenspan’s sanguine views on financial exuberance—conceded as much in 2004, even then reluctantly and with hints to potential problems. But not only did subprime mortgage loans rise by the “whopping” rate of 25 percent per year over the 1994-2003 period, which amounted to a nearly tenfold increase in just nine years, but the distribution of this increase was as intended: “More than half of these new home owning households are minorities. […] Nearly half of all black and Hispanic households now own their own home. These homeownership rates are still well below those of whites but are catching up.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0032329211434690">28</xref></sup> The perceived success was such that several European banks proposed to create a European Fannie Mae. But exactly around the time when these ideas were floated, the image of the GSEs was tarnished by reports about forging accounting rules and outrageous earnings of the management. Their mission was considerably curtailed in the wake of these scandals. After that, from 2004 onward, the subprime market went into complete overdrive, also fueled by so-called Alt-A mortgages in which prime borrowers took secondary mortgages that did not fulfill all the criteria for triple-A rating.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0032329211434690">29</xref></sup> The proactive market-creating social policy had made itself largely redundant and was no longer in control of the agenda.</p>

<title>II. Financial Consumer Protection to Correct Mortgage Markets</title>
<p>Financial consumer protection can be social policy. Its defining features are that the “vulnerable” consumer is the benchmark for intervention and responsibilities are shifted to the financial industry as the presumably stronger market party. A most obvious example for the first is the prohibition of certain lending practices as predatory. “Asset-based lending” was the euphemism for such a practice in the U.S. subprime market, i.e., lending to borrowers of whom it was safe to predict that they would not be able to repay and seizing their collateral once they had been pushed into default.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0032329211434690">30</xref></sup> Under a product safety or responsible lending approach that authorities in the United States, the United Kingdom, and at the EU level proposed since the crisis broke, such a practice would be outlawed, for instance by detailed prescriptions on credit assessment or maximum loan-to-value or loan-to-income ratios. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0032329211434690">Table 4</xref> gives an overview of relevant regulations before the crisis in the three countries under consideration here.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>First of all, lax assessment of affordability permitted asset-based lending in the United States, despite serious warnings from financial supervisors, which were dismissed by the Federal Reserve Bank under Chairman Greenspan. This was more formally regulated in the United Kingdom, although British authorities have now reviewed their standards and admitted that enforcement was less than strict. In France, the use of personal loans rather than mortgages ensured that housing finance was restricted to those who could afford it. Loan-to-value ratios were also low in France, protecting households against the situation of negative equity when housing prices fall. In the United States and the United Kingdom, ratios for new loans were similar—at around 75 percent—in the early 2000s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0032329211434690">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fixed interest rates provide consumer protection against interest rate volatility, placing that risk on the lender. But this comes at a cost, even from a social policy point of view. In France, borrowers can be locked into high-rate loans since early redemption and refinancing is not possible. Nor can housing loans be used for general consumer finance since equity withdrawal and thus leveraging is curtailed. Safety is the overriding objective, which confines both consumer choice and financial inclusion.</p>
<p>The United States is at the opposite end of the spectrum, providing maximum consumer choice with financial inclusion, due to permissive rules on equity withdrawal, loan redemption, and refinancing. The combination of refinancing opportunities with fixed-rate mortgages pushes considerable risk on the banking system<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0032329211434690">32</xref></sup>: when interest rates fall, more borrowers want to refinance; but when interest rates rise, the lender has increasing financing costs but borrowers do not want to refinance. This creates a financial stability problem whenever interest rates rise relatively fast. High refinancing activity may also stimulate higher equity withdrawal, especially in an environment of rising housing prices. All this gives an indispensible role to GSEs: they help to maintain this risky regulatory combination at low interest cost to end-users. This highly inclusive system presents households with favorable choices, with the government in the background allocating the risk among actors who can bear it—or so most observers thought until proven wrong.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, the prevalence of variable-rate mortgages has contributed to periodic housing crises in the past, as interest rate hikes leave highly indebted households vulnerable. This has not happened in the current crisis because interest rates fell to historically very low levels—although banks had to be leaned on at times to pass on their low borrowing costs. Regulations on equity withdrawal and prepayment are permissive; fees are usually charged for refinancing, however. These regulations have less to do with social policy than with ensuring competition in banking, making sure that financially literate households force banks to pass on falling interest rates.</p>
<p>Other consumer protection issues, which are harder to measure and tabulate, have affected the U.S. market. The use of low introductory teaser rates has sometimes shaded into outright fraud and deception. These abuses led to the Dodd-Frank reform bill of 2010, which established a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to replace several other U.S. agencies on which the mandate for consumer protection is dispersed. The CFPB was set up as an independent agency with the sole mission of financial consumer protection. It was placed within the Federal Reserve Bank, an institutional feature that won over some Republican opponents to this agency of activist consumer protection, but came under attack from Republican Senators for exactly that reason shortly afterwards.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0032329211434690">33</xref></sup> The background to this odd construction is to secure a reliable and independent source of funding for the new bureau, to be paid out of the central bank’s profits rather than annual appropriations by Congress or contributions by the industry. Its mandate is extensive and hence costly in that it encompasses going resolutely after malpractices in nonbanks and banks alike, building up databases to monitor the risky tails of the credit distribution, and doing primary research on consumer protection. The debate on the institutional design and the nomination of a first director for the CFPB was an epic struggle in and outside Congress. President Obama’s candidate for the first director of the CFPB, Elizabeth Warren, proved too contentious; she had to be made a senior advisor for setting up the CFPB until a first director could be appointed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0032329211434690">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>The regulatory approach that Elizabeth Warren and others developed is self-consciously redistributive and market correcting; it favors allocating rights in favor of the weaker party. Warren has advocated applying product safety regulation to financial markets, likening the dangers of credit card debt to an exploding toaster. To succeed against fierce industry opposition, the product safety approach requires continuous political mobilization of consumer interests and a strong agency that acts as an advocate for consumer interests against others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0032329211434690">35</xref></sup> Although regulated industries have sometimes benefited from product safety regulation—for example by dominating standard-setting processes—the financial services industry has not embraced it, allegedly because it prefers innovation, which means of course the status quo of permissive regulation.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, a strong supervisory institution, the Financial Services Authority (FSA), existed before the crisis. When the conservative-liberal government came to power in 2010, however, it announced from the start that it would abolish it. By 2012, prudential regulation goes back to the Bank of England whereas the conduct of financial businesses is to be regulated by a new agency, first called Consumer Protection and Markets Authority, then Financial Conduct Authority.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0032329211434690">36</xref></sup> Having nothing to lose, the FSA announced a resolute change in regulatory thrust toward “Responsible Lending” in July 2010: “We are prepared to take a much more robust and interventionist approach to regulating firms and markets, intervening early where necessary to shape the market to deliver appropriate outcomes and address problems before they cause substantial consumer detriment.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0032329211434690">37</xref></sup> The cornerstone is a more strictly regulated assessment of affordability, for instance household expenditure must be taken into account and self-certification of income is banned. But the FSA does not recommend a prohibition of high loan-to-value or high loan-to-income mortgages because this “would unfairly deny borrowers a mortgage without assessing their ability to repay.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0032329211434690">38</xref></sup> In line with its previous practice, the financial regulator does not want to shut off the market for subprime borrowers completely, for fear of being accused of financial exclusion. The political debate was not acrimonious, helped by the fact that both the Chairman of the FSA, Adair Turner, and the Governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, had come out repeatedly against the financial industry since 2008. This seemed to assure parliamentarians that these authorities take on the lenders—but also not too harshly, given their institutional self-interest as financial regulators. Like the CFPB, the FSA and its successor are set to tighten their permissive approach to financial innovation but in contrast to their U.S. counterpart did not have to go against an entrenched market-creating agenda at odds with such tightening.</p>
<p>In France, by contrast, incremental reforms of financial consumer protection prevailed. Even before the crisis, affordability had to be assessed rigorously so that debt service did not exceed a third of a household’s income.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0032329211434690">39</xref></sup> The measures being taken concerned mainly small short-term loans; for instance, revolving credit came to be curtailed by “modernizing” the regulation of usury.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0032329211434690">40</xref></sup> This segment of revolving consumer credit market is likely to have flourished before the crisis not least because home equity withdrawal is very restricted. The reforms were implemented in March 2011 by ordinance from the minister after some public consultation. Evidently, the French authorities felt that their approach to consumer protection had been validated by events and did not need major revisions. Financial supervision was also reformed in 2010 but less with a view to financial consumer protection than to overcome the segmentation between banking and insurance. The new Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel merges four supervisory agencies and is an independent agency under the auspices of the central bank.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0032329211434690">41</xref></sup></p>

<title>III. Compensating Interventions to Regulate and Prevent Foreclosure</title>
<p>The standard risk in financial markets is overindebtedness. In the case of mortgage markets this carries the ultimate threat of losing one’s home. The liberalization of capital markets had gone hand-in-hand with households gaining easier to consumer credit, which in turn led to a higher incidence of overindebtedness. The level of overindebtedness since the 1980s led to governments introducing and reforming personal bankruptcy legislation, which acknowledged—in Europe for the first time—that debtors, not creditors, need social protection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0032329211434690">42</xref></sup> The universal feature is that declaring bankruptcy stops the creditor from taking action against the debtor, such as imposing penalty interest rates or seizing property, until a solution is worked out. Governments can also try to prevent foreclosure and encourage forbearance instead. They provide insurance by paying for the debt service on the mortgage or they can impose or incentivize loan modification to substitute for foreclosure. Both are available in the United Kingdom and France. The U.S. government does not help unemployed or jobless households to pay their mortgages,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0032329211434690">43</xref></sup> but the Obama administration has launched several loan modification programs. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0032329211434690">Table 5</xref> gives an overview of available instruments.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The United States has a supposedly “debtor-friendly” consumer bankruptcy law, although debtors are not protected against high arrear charges that may push them over the edge even if the amount of debt would not. The rules were tightened in 2005, mainly to deter moral hazard related to credit card debt. Yet the vast majority of debtors can still get immediate discharge of any debt remaining after valuables have been sold under Chapter 7. Debtors need not negotiate with the creditors but can impose a repayment plan under Chapter 13. The Bankruptcy Act allows for property exemptions, notably for a car and a home, which must not be liquidated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0032329211434690">44</xref></sup> The federal homestead exemption is low, but it is preempted by state exemptions, amounting to between $50,000 and $150,000 in New York and without limit in Florida.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0032329211434690">45</xref></sup> However, consumer bankruptcy law does not cover defaulting on mortgage debt. Foreclosure can be swift, provided the mortgage-holding lender has proper documentation of the legal title.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0032329211434690">46</xref></sup> Most states do not allow recourse; for example, in a situation of negative equity, a debtor whose home has been foreclosed and sold does not owe the remaining shortfall. In such a situation, a debtor can also return the keys and thus stop accumulating arrears on which penalty interest must be paid; this “deed in lieu of foreclosure” has, in principle, to be agreed upon with the lender. The idea is to give debtors “a fresh start,” quickly restoring their abilities to engage fully in market transactions again—although a bankruptcy impairs the credit record for ten years and a foreclosure for seven years. Interestingly, this liberal bankruptcy law has its historical origins in a political movement against imprisonment of debtors and indentured servitude to employers who paid the passage to America.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0032329211434690">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>France as well as England and Wales (Scotland and Northern Ireland have different legislation) share basic traits of European bankruptcy law. Debtors cannot get immediate discharge, at the earliest after two years in France or one year in England and Wales. Property exemptions are much more restricted to the necessities of daily life and do not protect homeownership. There is typically recourse and subsequent wage garnishment if the proceeds of a house sale fall short of the amount of debt owed. In turn, repossession is not a swift procedure; it is delayed by close monitoring of independent commissions (France) or courts (England and Wales).</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that all this applies in England and Wales even though the introduction of codified personal bankruptcy in 1990 was inspired by the U.S. example. The focus of the procedure is court-administered discharge rather than debt adjustment negotiated between borrowers and lenders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0032329211434690">48</xref></sup> The courts have a lot of discretion. In November 2008, the government reinforced the “guidance” the FSA offered to banks by telling courts that they must admit repossession orders only if lenders can demonstrate in a “pre-action protocol” that they have exhausted all other possibilities to make debt service manageable. This led immediately to a significant drop in cases admitted by the courts, although the guidance had to be tightened again in October 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0032329211434690">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>French bankruptcy law, also introduced in 1990, holds for secured and unsecured debt alike. This is not surprising given that housing finance is often based on guaranteed personal loans rather than mortgages and the guarantee is a claim that must also be honored. The picture that emerges from a periodical inquiry by the secretariat of the commissions on overindebtedness<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0032329211434690">50</xref></sup> is that overindebtedness does not affect homeowners but predominantly low-income tenants who have experienced an income shock. The share of overindebted individuals or households with housing property is low and has been falling continuously from 15 percent in 2001 to 8 percent in 2007, although the amount owed has risen and the study attributes this to rising home prices. In almost three quarters of cases the commissions recommend an ordinary debt adjustment and repayment plan that the courts regularly confirm. Personal bankruptcy—which has been made successively less cumbersome to declare over recent years—is the outcome in only 5 percent of cases. Seizure of housing property is a costly and time-consuming procedure that lenders rarely find worthwhile pursuing.</p>
<p>Apart from regulating repossessions, governments can ask for lenders’ forbearance. In France, jobless households can get help with their mortgage payments, but this affects only small numbers of people. In the United Kingdom, successive governments tried to replace help from social assistance with private mortgage payment protection insurance. However, inadequacies in the terms and coverage of private insurance for borrowers have resulted in the maintenance of a scheme that pays interest directly to the lenders for homeowners on means-tested benefits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0032329211434690">51</xref></sup> It is confined to mortgages that do not exceed a certain amount (raised to £200,000 in 2009). There is a waiting period (of thirteen weeks at present) and only the average variable mortgage interest rate, as published by the Bank of England, can be paid (a positive difference can be credited to the mortgage account). Recipients of means-tested unemployment benefits can get this support for mortgage interest for up to two years. A new scheme, the Homeowners Mortgage Support Scheme introduced in March 2009, was more contentious. It allows any homeowner who experienced a sharp drop in income to switch to an interest-only mortgage and defer up to 70 percent of interest payments on an outstanding mortgage not exceeding £400,000. In case of eventual default, the Treasury pays the deferred interest payments. This amounts to a partial insurance scheme, introduced ex post for all those who have not taken out private insurance. It was neither popular with those who did pay private insurance for years nor with the insurance industry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0032329211434690">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Obama administration implemented several loan modification programs that are a mixture of regulatory and budgetary policy but do not take up the debt service for overindebted households. A program like the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), announced in March 2009, provides a standard protocol for an acceptable procedure and pays an incentive fee to the lender in return for complying with certain conditions, such as reducing debt service to 31 percent of gross income. But even such a modest attempt at loan modification has not met with much success. The Treasury had hoped that HAMP—funded partly by the Troubled Asset Relief Program and partly by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—would help 3 to 4 million households. Yet, only 1.4 million began trial modifications by November 2010 and of these less than 550,000 turned into permanent modifications. The status of a loan modification program specifically for unemployed homeowners is unclear: not even the number of borrowers is known.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0032329211434690">53</xref></sup> The reasons for this failure are still a matter for research. One problem with evaluating performance is that there may be another social policy agenda behind these programs. Although their official goal is to restructure the debt of millions of homeowners, they also serve to throw sand in the wheels of foreclosure procedures until labor markets have recovered and people can move on. By maintaining the nest egg, the government thus compensates partially for the lack of adequate unemployment benefits.</p>

<title>Conclusion: A Crisis of What?</title>
<p>This article argued that financial markets have been a more salient target of social policy efforts than comparative welfare state research and its preoccupation with the decommodification of labor lead us to expect. Because of these efforts that created, corrected, and compensated mortgage markets, social policies are now implicated in the worst financial crisis of postwar history. Yet simple attributions of guilt—to social policy or to financial markets—will not do. The comparative case study presented here showed that none of them prevented the buildup of a considerable crisis potential, indeed some positively contributed to it. It risked impoverishing households through falling house prices and contributing to homelessness through foreclosures. But only the United States came near this dismal picture on a large scale, and even in the United States, the nationalization of the GSEs among other measures—such as resolute macroeconomic stabilization—prevented another Great Depression.</p>
<p>What does a focused comparison of policies to promote homeownership contribute to an explanation of why the same potential had such different effects? <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0032329211434690">Table 6</xref> tries to summarize. First of all, the comparison showed that it is important to distinguish the various roles that social policy can play in and for markets. In the United States, the emphasis was on creating mass retail markets for financing homeownership for low-income minorities as well as the mainstream middle classes. The rather explicit public underwriting of the risks provided an all-too-attractive market opportunity for lenders in search of higher yields. Governments in the United Kingdom emphasized market compensation and the crisis revealed just how much the policy had implicitly underwritten risks, helping households who were hit by income shocks to meet their obligations and leaning on mortgage lenders to exercise forbearance. It was social policy ex post; successive governments abstained from actively promoting financial inclusion of high-risk borrowers but let it happen as a consequence of not using consumer protection as a social policy tool. This is often seen as a continuation of Thatcherism but Thatcher’s right-to-buy policy actively made markets and sought to end the market-compensating welfare state as we know it. In France, most efforts went into correcting housing finance markets such that they do not create risks that households find hard to bear. The financial exclusion and the housing inequality that go with this restrictive approach have become more problematic ever since social renting became unpopular. This has led to more targeted intervention to provide access to housing finance as a residual welfare state measure, creating niche markets.</p>

<p>It is thus tempting to explain the differences in outcome when homeownership policies were severely tested in this crisis with the different combination of market creation, correction, and compensation in the three countries. But the comparison suggests that it is more plausible to argue that it was the absence of other social policies to go along with the push for market creation that was the problem in the United States. French authorities have also been selectively active in creating markets. But in the United States, the only other intervention is a fresh-start approach to mortgage creditor default. This is social policy only in a limited regulatory sense in that it assigns the role of insurers to banks (and their customers at large, who ultimately pay). This leads them, in turn, to aggressively seek foreclosure. The depth of the crisis may have been in this regard a blessing in disguise, as low home prices and the collapse in housing demand made seizure of assets less attractive; abandoned houses quickly lose value.</p>
<p>The U.K. government’s forbearance policy indicates that there is an alternative to the hands-off stance when things go wrong that is built into the U.S. approach to personal bankruptcy. This is all the more telling given that the United Kingdom is a political economy with a similarly pro-market outlook and a financial industry with immense political clout. But the U.K. government could reasonably demand that mortgage lenders show restraint until the worst is over by contributing its share and ensuring regular interest payments of households on benefits or guaranteeing interest payments for any household that has temporarily fallen on hard times. This risk-sharing arrangement acts on the insight that the reality of the financial system’s disproportionate political influence cannot be ignored but tries to work with this reality to attain certain (modest) social policy goals, such as keeping families in their homes.</p>
<p>The comparison with France shows that the difference in outcomes when the bubble burst cannot be explained by social policy activism that creates (mass or niche) markets. Both the French and the U.S. administrations were active, confronted with criticism that the benefits of expanding financial markets did not trickle down. This is a sensitive issue with respect to a basic need like housing that both reinterpreted as an entitlement to homeownership. Both countries used instruments of financial engineering for social policy, such as securitization invented by Ginnie Mae and public guarantees to complement or substitute for private mortgages in France. Yet, the French state compromised on financial inclusion by striking the balance in favor of restrictive consumer protection rather than making credit readily available. Also, by making homeownership promotion a highly targeted policy creating niche markets, the policy was politically marginalized, a matter for clever civil servants devising clever schemes. Social movements that fight the cause of homelessness and housing deprivation were at best lukewarm about promoting homeownership through cheap credit.</p>
<p>In the United States, the combination of market creation and permissive consumer protection attracted commercial interests as stakeholders of their policy, so powerful because these interests could rely on the median voter’s preference for homeownership as a legitimating backup. When these financial interests turned toward high-risk borrowers—actually merging them with near-prime (Alt-A) borrowers through securitization—a policy meant to lift all boats came to sink them. But, again, it was not the market-creating activity as such that was the problem but the complacency of not protecting the same vulnerable households that were promoted into taking mortgages. The lenders, the foremost stakeholders of the policy, of course, actively requested this complacency. This tells us that policymaking may give rise to politics that are the policy’s undoing. The CFPB is, at long last, an attempt to overcome this complacency. The agency is bound to fight an uphill struggle in its attempt to strengthen market-correcting social policy against an entire infrastructure of mortgage market creation that has headed so far in another direction. Yet, for better or worse, the struggle will be one over the direction of how social policy should create and correct financial markets, but not about the principle whether the welfare state should go against financial markets.</p>

<p>The housing price bubble in France is also not merely a statistical artifact, driven by a bubble in Paris. While house prices relative to disposable income (not average as in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0032329211434690">Table 1</xref>) peaked at 200 for Paris, they reached 170 for France without Paris, both up from about 100 in the late 1990s.
