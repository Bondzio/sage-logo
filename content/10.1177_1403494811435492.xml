<p><italic>Aims</italic>: The association between a low socioeconomic position and disability retirement is established in the literature, but the interrelationships between various subdomains of socioeconomic position are poorly understood. We examined the independent and interdependent effects of education, social class, and income on disability retirement. <italic>Methods</italic>: Using nationally representative register data we followed up over 260,000 Finns aged 30–63 at the end of 1995 for disability retirement from 1996 to 2004. Cox regression analysis was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and relative indices of inequality (RII). <italic>Results</italic>: Each socioeconomic indicator had a linear negative association with disability retirement. The socioeconomic gradients were stronger in the younger age groups. The effect of education was largely mediated through succeeding social class. Social class was largely explained by preceding education, but was only moderately mediated through income. Income was largely explained by education, and even further by social class. The independent effects of education, social class, and income on disability retirement as measured by the RII were 1.74 (95% CI 1.60–1.90), 1.95 (1.78–2.15), and 1.35 (1.25–1.47) for men and 1.76 (1.61–1.92), 2.14 (1.95–2.34), and 1.14 (1.05–1.24) for women. <bold><italic>Conclusions</italic>: The effects of socioeconomic position on disability retirement may not be fully captured if the pathways between the various subdomains are disregarded. Our results suggest that efforts to delay and prevent disability retirement should focus on lifestyle and cognitive factors associated with education, as well as on factors associated with social class such as working conditions and power resources.</bold></p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Population ageing has fostered concerns about prolonging working careers through the prevention of early exit from the labour market due to disability. Previous population- or employee-based cohort studies have shown that besides loss of health and work ability, a low socioeconomic position strongly increases the risk of disability retirement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435492">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494811435492">18</xref>]. A comprehensive understanding of socioeconomic differences in disability retirement would be helpful in tackling these challenges. Previous studies have used education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435492">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494811435492">11</xref>], occupational social class [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435492">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494811435492">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494811435492">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494811435492">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494811435492">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494811435492">18</xref>], and income [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494811435492">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494811435492">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494811435492">11</xref>] as indicators of adulthood socioeconomic position.</p>
<p>Socioeconomic position is a complex multidimensional theoretical and empirical construct, which is based on diverse social and economic circumstances. Although each subdomain of the construct is likely to reflect one’s general position in the socioeconomic hierarchy, it also represents specific, but often interrelated, dimensions. Education, occupational social class, and income are considered the key subdomains of a person’s current socioeconomic position. Education is generally acquired by early adulthood and it provides knowledge, skills, and other non-material resources, as well as the formal qualifications required for the successful exploitation of employment opportunities. Social class relates people to the social structure and the labour market, thereby contributing to their social standing and power resources. It also reflects material circumstances related to paid work such as working conditions and income. Income contributes to material living conditions and purchasing power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494811435492">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494811435492">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Non-material resources attained through education promote healthy lifestyles and behaviours, including use of health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494811435492">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494811435492">22</xref>]. The physical and psychosocial working conditions associated with social class not only influence health but also shape job requirements, and these together determine working capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494811435492">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494811435492">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494811435492">9</xref>]. Income provides material resources, which facilitate the maintenance of good health and functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494811435492">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494811435492">22</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition, high compensation for labour-force participation is likely to be associated with low economic incentives to retire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494811435492">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494811435492">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494811435492">24</xref>]. Furthermore, socioeconomic position may affect retirement decisions by influencing working opportunities or shaping attitudes, values, and preferences related to work and leisure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494811435492">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Education, typically acquired early in the life course, contributes to social class and income [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494811435492">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494811435492">23</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494811435492">Figure 1</xref> schematically presents the assumed time sequence and pathways between the three key subdomains of adulthood socioeconomic position. The effect of education on disability retirement is assumed to be mediated though the succeeding social class and, mainly through this pathway, also through income. The effect of social class is assumed to be explained by preceding education or to be mediated through income. Finally, the effect of income is assumed to be explained by education and social class. Reverse causality is also possible: poor health eventually leading to disability retirement may have impeded the achievement of a higher socioeconomic position or led to downward career mobility.</p>

<p>Several previous studies on disability retirement have focused on more than one key subdomain of socioeconomic position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435492">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494811435492">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494811435492">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494811435492">11</xref>]. However, these studies have typically assessed the independent effects of each subdomain while controlling for others. They thus fail to focus on the interdependence among the various socioeconomic subdomains. By way of an exception, Hagen <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494811435492">6</xref>] found occupational social class to be largely explained by education as a determinant of disability retirement due to back pain, whereas the effect of education was only modestly mediated through social class.</p>
<p>The pathways between various subdomains of socioeconomic position that lead to disability retirement are still poorly understood. Our general aim was thus to examine the independent and interdependent effects of education, social class, and income on disability retirement. We used nationally representative register data in following up Finns aged 30–63 at the end of 1995 for disability retirement by the end of 2004. Previous studies suggest that the associations between socioeconomic position and disability retirement may vary by gender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494811435492">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494811435492">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494811435492">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494811435492">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494811435492">10</xref>] or age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435492">1</xref>]. Consequently, we stratified our analyses by gender and examined the risks of disability retirement in different age groups.</p>

<title>Participants and disability follow up</title>
<p>We obtained longitudinal register data from Statistics Finland (permission TK 53-508-09), which included information from various registers linked together via unique personal identification numbers. The data comprised a nationally representative 11% sample of Finns aged 30–63 with an additional 80% random oversample of all deaths that occurred in Finland during the study period. Because of stratified sampling with different sampling probabilities in the two strata, analytic weights were used in all analyses.</p>
<p>The study population at baseline, 31 December 1995, was followed up for disability retirement from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2004. The lower age limit was set at 30 as young adults may not yet be firmly established in terms of socioeconomic position. The upper limit was set at 63 as retirement data were available only at the end of each year, and those aged 64 at baseline reached 65, the age limit for old-age pension, before the end of the first follow-up year. Those in receipt of any form of pension at baseline or who did not belong to the work force were excluded (<italic>n</italic>=105,597). Because of the unavailability of retirement data throughout the year, those who died or were lost to follow up before the end of 1996 were also excluded (<italic>n</italic>=3392). A total of 262,984 people were included in the analyses.</p>
<p>In Finland, disability pensions are covered in the statutory earnings-related pension scheme as well as in the national pension scheme that covers all permanent residents and is proportional to the earnings-related pension. The decision to grant a disability pension is based on a medically confirmed reduction in a person’s earning ability due to illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494811435492">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494811435492">25</xref>]. Disability retirement as the outcome measure of this study was formed from information on whether a study person received any form of disability pension at the end of each year. The date of retirement was set at the midyear of the first year the pension was paid.</p>
<p>A study person was censored at the time of retirement (9.1% due to disability and 10.9% due to other reasons), at the end of the year a person reached the age of 64 (2.2%), at the end of the year preceding the year of death (1.7%), at the time a person was lost to follow up (0.7%), or at the end of the follow up (75.5%).</p>

<title>Socioeconomic indicators</title>
<p>The data on all the independent variables were from 1995. Education was measured in terms of the highest educational level attained, consisting of four categories: primary school (up to 9 years), secondary school (up to 12 years), lower tertiary education (up to 15 years), and higher tertiary education (16+ years).</p>
<p>The occupational social classes used were: (1) upper non-manual, (2) intermediate non-manual, (3) lower non-manual, (4) manual workers, specialised, (5) manual workers, non-specialised, (6) entrepreneurs, and (7) others or unknown. Earlier recorded information on social class was used in the case of economically inactive people or those with no occupational information at baseline.</p>
<p>Income was measured in terms of household disposable income per consumption unit, consisting of the individual income of all household members including wages, capital income, and income transfers, taking taxes into account. For data-protection reasons, the highest 3% of incomes were combined and given a constant of 1.25 times the minimum income in this group. Total household disposable income was divided by the number of consumption units in order to adjust for household size. The first adult in the household was given the consumption unit value 1.0, all other adults the value 0.7, and all children aged 0–17 the value 0.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494811435492">26</xref>]. The measure was then divided into income quintiles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1403494811435492">
<title>Other variables</title>
<p>Age was included as a continuous variable, except in the descriptive statistics for age (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494811435492">Table I</xref>) in which it was included in seven groups. Three age groups were used in the analyses in which the study population was stratified by age. Marital status comprised the married, never married, divorced, and widowed. Dependent children included three categories: no children, all child(ren) over the age of six, and at least one child under the age of seven. Employment status consisted of employed and unemployed.</p>

<title>Statistical methods</title>
<p>Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Additionally, relative indices of inequality (RII) and their 95% CIs were calculated for socioeconomic differences in disability retirement. The RII facilitates comparison between the sizes of the effects of different socioeconomic indicators because it takes account not only of the relative differences in disability retirement between socioeconomic groups, but also the differences in socioeconomic distribution. In the RII calculations the original values of each socioeconomic indicator were replaced by the midpoint of the cumulative proportion of the socioeconomic group. These indicators were then used as continuous variables in the regression models. The RII could consequently be interpreted as the outcome difference between the hypothetically worst-off and best-off person in the population in terms of each socioeconomic measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494811435492">23</xref>]. It imposes linearity on the associations between socioeconomic indicators and disability retirement: the groups that could not be hierarchically ranked (e.g. entrepreneurs) were excluded from the RII calculations.</p>
<p>The effects of the socioeconomic indicators on disability retirement were first adjusted for age and considered in three age groups. The interrelationships between education, social class, and income were then subjected to successive adjustments for different combinations of these determinants. The final step was to adjust for further potential explanatory and mediating factors. All analyses were performed using Stata 10.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The risk of disability retirement was higher among men and women with a low education, social class, and income, who were older, unmarried, had no children, and were unemployed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494811435492">Table I</xref>). The associations between the socioeconomic indicators and disability retirement followed a steeper gradient for education and social class than for income. The age-adjusted risk of disability retirement was somewhat weaker for women than for men (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.86–0.91).</p>
<p>There were statistically significant interactions between age and each socioeconomic indicator. The relative effect of each socioeconomic determinant was consistently strongest among those aged 30–44 and weakest among those aged 55–63 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494811435492">Table II</xref>). Nevertheless, there were clear socioeconomic gradients for all age groups with the exception that the effect of income was rather weak and inconsistent among those aged 55–63.</p>

<p>Among men the age-adjusted HR for low education was 3.63 (95% CI 3.25–4.04), for the non-specialised manual class 3.05 (95% CI 2.84–3.27), and for the lowest income quintile 1.81 (95% CI 1.72–1.92) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494811435492">Table III</xref>, Model 1). Adjustment for social class attenuated the relative differences between educational groups to a great extent (Model 2), and adjustment for income less so (Model 3). Furthermore, income had minor independent effects on the association between education and disability retirement following adjustment for social class (Models 2 and 5). Adjustment for education attenuated the social-class gradient considerably (Model 2), whereas the attenuation was much smaller following adjustment for income (Model 4). The social-class gradient was only slightly steeper following adjustment only for education (Model 2) than when income was also included (Model 5). The income gradient attenuated to almost the same extent following adjustment for education (Model 3) and for social class (Model 4), but there was further attenuation when both were adjusted for simultaneously (Model 5). Adjusting for marital status, children, and employment status had only modest effects on the socioeconomic gradients (Model 6). The HR in the fully adjusted model was 2.15 (95% CI 1.90–2.44) for education, 1.68 (95% CI 1.54–1.84) for social class, and 1.28 (95% CI 1.19–1.36) for income.</p>

<p>Among men the age-adjusted RII was 3.13 (95% CI 2.93–3.35) for education, 3.91 (95% CI 3.64–4.20) for social class, and 2.01 (95% CI 1.88–2.14) for income (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494811435492">Table III</xref>, Model 1). The RII values showed similar interrelationships between the socioeconomic determinants as the HRs in the analyses above. The RII for education attenuated 57% [(3.13–1.91)/(3.13–1)×100] following adjustment for social class and 14% following adjustment for income. The RII for social class attenuated 53% and 15% following adjustment for education and income, respectively, and for income it attenuated 55% and 51% following adjustment for education and social class, respectively. Measured by the RII, around 60% of the effect of each socioeconomic indicator was explained by the other two. In the fully adjusted Model 6 the RII was 1.74 (95% CI 1.60–1.90) for education, 1.95 (95% CI 1.78–2.15) for social class and 1.35 (95% CI 1.25–1.47) for income. The HRs and the RIIs give somewhat different but complementary results on the importance of education and social class as determinants of disability retirement. For example, when examining HRs, the relative differences in disability retirement were larger between those with primary education and higher tertiary education than between those in upper non-manual class and non-specialised manual class. However, since the proportion of people with higher tertiary education is relatively small, the RII as an overall measure of relative inequality that takes the sizes of the socioeconomic categories into account was smaller for education than for social class for which the sizes of the groups are more equal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494811435492">Table I</xref>).</p>
<p>The general socioeconomic patterning among women was similar to that among men (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1403494811435492">Table IV</xref>). Among women, however, the age-adjusted HRs and RIIs were both somewhat weaker for each socioeconomic indicator (Model 1). Furthermore, less of the educational (48% of RII) and social-class (39% of RII) differences and more of the income difference (80% of RII) attenuated after adjustment for other socioeconomic indicators (Model 5). After full adjustment (Model 6), very small gender differences remained for education and social class. The effect of income remained weaker among women, however, the HR for the lowest income quintile being 1.17 (95% CI 1.08–1.26) and the RII 1.14 (95% CI 1.05–1.24).</p>

<p>Further Cox regression analyses were conducted using individual taxable income instead of household disposable income (results not shown). The effect on disability retirement was stronger and a larger part of the effect of education and social class was mediated through this indicator, but even so the independent effect of income was weaker than that of education and social class. Furthermore, the effects of education and social class were similar in the fully adjusted model regardless of the income indicator.</p>

<title>Main findings</title>
<p>Our aim was to enhance understanding of the independent and interdependent effects of the key socioeconomic indicators, i.e. education, occupational social class, and income, on disability retirement. This study brought new insights into the contribution of the different socioeconomic subdomains in simultaneously including information on all three key indicators of adulthood socioeconomic position. They all proved to be determinants of disability retirement, and the associations were consistently stronger in the younger age groups. The independent effect of income was smaller than that of the other two indicators, and it was smaller among women than men, otherwise there were few gender differences. The effect of education was mediated to a great extent through social class, but not much further through income. The effect of social class was largely explained by education, but only modestly mediated through income. The other two socioeconomic indicators explained a considerable part of the effect of income.</p>
<p>This study, in line with previous Norwegian findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494811435492">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494811435492">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494811435492">8</xref>], indicates that education and social class have strong effects on disability retirement even net of each other. In Finland similar findings have been reported when mortality among the working-age population was used as the outcome measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494811435492">27</xref>], whereas the independent effects of these indicators on ill health may vary by gender and the health measure used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494811435492">22</xref>].</p>
<p>To our knowledge, no prior study has investigated the effects of income on all-cause disability retirement independently of education and social class. A study by Holte <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494811435492">8</xref>] on disability retirement due to osteoarthritis among older employees nevertheless suggests that the independent effects of individual income are generally weaker than those of education and social class. Our finding of a relatively weak direct effect of household disposable income on disability retirement, especially among women, is also in accordance with Finnish results on the independent effects of household disposable income on mortality among the general working-age population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494811435492">28</xref>]. However, further measures of ill health are not necessarily fully in line with our findings indicating that the net effect of household disposable income is stronger than that of education or social class among middle-aged working women, whereas the effects of either education or social class are stronger among working men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494811435492">22</xref>].</p>
<p>There is limited information on the effects of socioeconomic indicators on disability retirement net of each other, but there is even less investigation on the pathways between these indicators. Our findings are in accordance with those reported by Hagen <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494811435492">6</xref>] indicating that occupational social class was largely explained by education. In contrast to our results, however, the effect of education was not strongly mediated through social class. A potential reason for the discrepancy in the findings may be that Hagen <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494811435492">6</xref>] examined only disability retirement due to back pain whereas we included disability retirement for any reason. The effects of socioeconomic position on disability retirement may vary depending on the health condition: both education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494811435492">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494811435492">9</xref>] and social class [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494811435492">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494811435492">15</xref>] have stronger effects on retirement due to musculoskeletal diseases than for the majority of other reasons.</p>
<p>We did not find much support for our assumption that the effect of social class on disability retirement would be mediated through income. One reason might be that we used household disposable income. However, although the pre-tax income of individuals or households may be more strongly associated with other domains of socioeconomic position as well as other health outcomes, household disposable income is likely to adequately reflect consumption potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494811435492">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494811435492">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494811435492">29</xref>]. Furthermore, even when individual taxable income was used in our confirmatory analyses, the net effects of education and social class remained the same.</p>
<p>Krokstad <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435492">1</xref>] found that the effects of education and social class on disability retirement were stronger for men and women under 50 years of age than for those who were older. Our results are consistent with this. Even if the overall rate of disability retirement is considerably smaller among younger people, the pronounced socioeconomic inequalities among this group have major implications in terms of financing future pension schemes given that retirement at a young age generally signifies a long period of pension recipiency and permanent exclusion from the labour market. Nevertheless, in our study even in the oldest age group and with the exception of income socioeconomic differences were considerable. Household disposable income among those aged 55–63 may be more likely to have changed during the follow up if, for example, the spouses of these individuals are older and therefore more likely to retire. The smaller socioeconomic differences when approaching normal retirement age may be an indication of the availability of alternative routes to early retirement: up until 2002, those aged 58–64 (60–64 since 2000) were eligible for a disability pension in the form of an individual early retirement pension that had less rigid medical requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494811435492">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494811435492">25</xref>]. It has also been suggested that unemployment and disability retirement have similar risk factors and may partly compensate for each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494811435492">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494811435492">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494811435492">30</xref>].</p>
<p>Studies from Norway indicate that the relative effect of social class on disability retirement is stronger among men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494811435492">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494811435492">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494811435492">8</xref>], whereas the effects of education and income are stronger among women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494811435492">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494811435492">10</xref>]. In our study the relative effects of individual socioeconomic indicators were stronger among men, but this difference remained only for income when all three key indicators were simultaneously accounted for. Women and men have relatively equal educational and employment opportunities in Finland, which may partly explain the similar socioeconomic influences on disability retirement.</p>

<title>Methodological considerations</title>
<p>Our data comprised a sample of the total Finnish work force aged 30–63. The statistical power was high with over 30,000 cases of disability retirement. Because all information was obtained from registers, there was no reporting bias and only a few cases of missing information or loss to follow up. Another strength was that it was possible to determine the social class of economically inactive persons from information on their earlier occupations. Furthermore, the income indicator took into account taxes and income transfers and is therefore likely to adequately reflect household disposable income.</p>
<p>Because retirement data were only available at the end of each year, short-term disability pensions may not have been detected. However, the granting of a disability pension requires incapacity for work for at least 1 year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494811435492">25</xref>], and our data is therefore likely to have covered most cases.</p>
<p>We only measured socioeconomic indicators at baseline, and acknowledge that an individual’s socioeconomic position may have changed during follow up. However, disability retirement is typically a long process that is generally preceded by spells of sickness absence of up to at least a year. Socioeconomic position measured at a time point close to retirement is therefore unlikely to be the best indicator. For this reason we did not treat socioeconomic indicators as time-varying variables.</p>
<p>We used both HRs and RIIs in the analyses to give a more comprehensive picture of the importance of various socioeconomic indicators as determinants of disability retirement. The different magnitudes of the independent effects of education and social class in these two analyses exemplify two approaches to the measurement of inequality. A high level of education may provide more advantage to a relatively small population group, whereas a high social class provides a somewhat smaller advantage but to a much larger number of people resulting in much greater overall inequality between individuals. Both approaches therefore contribute to the understanding of socioeconomic inequalities. The RII also facilitates comparison between various socioeconomic domains because it takes into account the population distributions of the socioeconomic indicators.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study reconfirms the influence of a low socioeconomic position as a major factor leading to disability retirement. It also indicates that various socioeconomic indicators are not interchangeable. Although strongly interrelated, each socioeconomic subdomain nevertheless has its own pathways to disability retirement. Understanding such socioeconomic processes will facilitate interventions directed towards groups at a high risk of early retirement due to problems of health and working capacity. Our results suggest that education contributes to disability retirement not only indirectly through increasing access to better employment opportunities, but also directly by promoting healthy lifestyles and providing knowledge and other non-material resources required for maintaining good health and functioning. Moreover, working conditions and occupation-related power resources may be of greater importance than the material resources typically associated with paid employment. Further investigation is needed on the more proximal behavioural, cognitive, and work-related factors through which low socioeconomic position leads to disability retirement. Finally, there is a need to increase understanding of the socioeconomic circumstances associated with the various reasons for disability retirement.</p>
