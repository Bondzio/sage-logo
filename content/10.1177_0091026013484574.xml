<abstract>
<p>Almost 6 months after winning their U.S. Supreme Court case, a group of New Haven, Connecticut, firefighters celebrated their victory in grand style. The decision in <italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic> proved that the City of New Haven erred when it denied promotions to White firefighters who fared better on promotional examinations than did minority applicants. This article (a) examines the thrust of the <italic>Ricci</italic> decision, which involved two competing facets of the same equal employment opportunity (EEO) statute; (b) discusses the mistakes inherent in the testing procedures of the City of New Haven, Connecticut; (c) addresses the involvement of Justice Sonya Sotomayor in the decision; and (d) examines the implication of the decision for public-sector employers using testing procedures of the nature found in <italic>Ricci v. DeStefano.</italic> The author concludes that the decision underscores the need for use of alternative testing procedures and suggests that <italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic> is but a precursor to further litigation designed to render use of disparate-impact analysis unconstitutional.</p>

<body>
<p>On December 10, 2009, amid blaring bagpipes and a cheering crowd, a group of predominantly White firefighters in the City of New Haven, Connecticut, finally received promotional badges after a 5-year legal battle that ended with a U.S. Supreme Court victory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091026013484574">Christoffersen, 2009</xref>). This promotional celebration was the culmination of one of the more widely publicized rulings of the 2008 Supreme Court term. Of interest to many in this ruling, the Court overturned a lower court’s decision in which its soon-to-be newest member, Judge Sonya Sotomayor, had been a participant. Despite efforts to use this decision to discredit her, Judge Sotomayor’s confirmation process was a success.</p>
<p>Some legal experts have argued that the <italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic> decision will change the landscape of employment law as we know it. This, however, is an often-stated claim in the politically sensitive area of discrimination law. For example (and although not an employment case), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091026013484574"><italic>Board of Regents v. Bakke</italic> (1978)</xref> was perceived by many as signaling an end to affirmative action initiatives, including those employment related. Despite such predictions, the debate over, and use of affirmative action initiatives persist. It is from this perspective that this article will examine, among other things, the implications of <italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic> for applicant testing and the employment-selection process.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs in this case alleged a statutory claim of disparate treatment under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), as amended, and a constitutional claim under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Title VII prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. There were 20 White plaintiffs in this case of which one is also Hispanic.</p>
<sec id="section1-0091026013484574">
<title>Scope of the Case</title>
<p>The central issue in this case involved what the court viewed as a conflict between two provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, namely, disparate-treatment discrimination and disparate-impact discrimination. Under Title VII, illegal discrimination against an individual in an employment setting, on the basis of a specific trait such as their race, sex, color, religion, or national origin, constitutes disparate-treatment discrimination. Title VII also prohibits unintentional discrimination in a promotional test that has the unintentional impact of eliminating a disproportionate number of minorities. This latter form of discrimination is termed <italic>disparate-impact</italic> or <italic>adverse-impact</italic> discrimination, and the two will be used interchangeably in this essay.</p>
<p>The <italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic> case had its origins in late 2003, when the City of New Haven (City) administered a written multiple-choice test to ascertain which of its firefighters were eligible for promotion to lieutenant and captain. Although efforts were made to ensure the exam was fair and job related, the exam led to significant adverse impact on minority applicants. The City’s 2003 exam scores revealed that none of its Black applicants would be eligible for promotion.</p>
<p>After much consternation over the exam results, including a public debate that turned “rancorous” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091026013484574"><italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic>, 2009</xref>), New Haven officials decided not to certify their firefighter’s promotional exam because, in their opinion, there was a likelihood that minority firefighters (Black) would file lawsuits claiming disparate-impact discrimination. However, by following this course of action, the City gave plaintiffs reason to believe they were denied promotions for no reason other than their race. Plaintiffs contended that the actions of the City were a violation of Title VII, as well as the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Plaintiffs were unsuccessful at the district court level as well as before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the case was granted certiorari.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court framed the question before them as “whether the purpose to avoid disparate-impact liability excuses what otherwise would be prohibited disparate-treatment discrimination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091026013484574"><italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic>, 2009</xref>). That is to say, by not promoting the more successful White employees, was this an act of illegal disparate treatment under Title VII? The Supreme Court ruled that, indeed, it was illegal disparate treatment.</p>
<p>The following analysis examines the substance of the Supreme Court decision, as well as Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s involvement in the lower court decision, and provides comments on the implications of the Supreme Court’s ruling in <italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic>.</p>

<title>Historical Overview</title>
<sec id="section3-0091026013484574">
<title>Testing and the Concept of Disparate or Adverse Impact</title>
<p>As the Supreme Court noted in <italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic>, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not include a prohibition on policies or practices that produce a disparate impact. It was in the decision of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091026013484574"><italic>Griggs v. Duke Power Company</italic> (1971)</xref> that the Supreme Court interpreted the Act to prohibit, in some cases, an employer’s facially neutral practices that are discriminatory in effect. In <italic>Griggs</italic>, the employer had a long history of denying its Black employees equal employment opportunities. With the passage of Title VII, the employer was legally mandated to provide Black employees the same opportunities as White employees. However, when its Black employees attempted to transfer into previously denied higher paying jobs, Duke Power imposed a policy requiring a high school education and a minimum score on two separate aptitude tests.</p>
<p>Willie Griggs filed a class action lawsuit against Duke Power Company on behalf of several fellow African American employees. The lawsuit progressed all the way to the Supreme Court, which declared that the new requirements mandated at Duke Power had the intended purpose of safeguarding Duke Power’s long-standing policy of giving preference to its White employees. Moreover, the Court noted that neither the high school graduation requirement nor the two aptitude tests were “shown to bear a demonstrable relationship to successful performance of the jobs for which it was used” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091026013484574"><italic>Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</italic>, 1971</xref>, p. 431). The policy was merely part of a scheme to ensure the continuing effect of past discriminatory practices.</p>
<p>Subsequent Supreme Court decisions would produce legal dicta involving testing issues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091026013484574"><italic>Albemarle Paper Company v. Moody</italic> (1975)</xref>, for example, established legal dicta that states that even when an employer can show that its practice was job related, the plaintiff could prevail by showing a legitimate alternative that would result in less discrimination; that is, if the plaintiff could show “that other tests or selection devices, without a similarly undesirable racial effect, would also serve the employer’s legitimate interest” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091026013484574"><italic>Albemarle Paper Company v. Moody</italic>, 1975</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091026013484574">The Civil Rights Act of 1991</xref> codified the decision in <italic>Griggs.</italic> Thus, the Act contains both a disparate-treatment provision as well as a disparate-impact provision.</p>

<title>Uniform Guidelines on Employment Selection Procedures (UGESP)</title>
<p>Before the passage of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091026013484574">the Civil Rights Act of 1991</xref>, and because testing is such a hot-button issue in employment selections procedures, several government agencies worked together to establish guidelines to address questions of adverse impact in the employment-selection process. The Office of Personnel Management, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and the Department of Labor were tasked to develop a set of guidelines for the nation to follow. They all contributed to the development of the employment-selection process with the 1978 issuance of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091026013484574">UGESP (1978)</xref>.</p>
<p>The UGESP establishes guidelines for employers to follow, among other things, when an employer utilizes any mechanism for selection, and that process has an adverse impact or disparate impact. Section 4(d) of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091026013484574">UGESP (1978)</xref> states,
<disp-quote>
<p>A selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group which is less than four-fifths (4/5) or eighty percent of the rate for the group with the highest rate will generally be regarded by the Federal enforcement agencies as evidence of adverse impact, while a greater than four-fifths rate will generally not be regarded for Federal enforcement agencies as evidence of adverse impact.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In explaining this “Four-Fifths” concept, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091026013484574">EEOC (1997)</xref> technical assistant manuals point out that this concept is merely a rule of thumb adopted by federal agencies to determine whether a group has a substantially different rate of selection that works to their disadvantage as members of a race, sex, or ethnic group.</p>
<p>A simple example of the application on this “rule of thumb” concept offered by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091026013484574">EEOC (1997)</xref> in its manual follows.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If an employer hired 50% of white applicants but only 30% of black applicants, the interpretation under the Guidelines is that the selection has an adverse impact upon blacks because the selection rate for blacks is 60% (3/5) of the selection rates for whites. (pp. K-17-18)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These guidelines are not limited to tests and cover all employee-selection procedures, including hiring, retention, promotion transfer, demotions, dismissal, and referrals. These guidelines include performance tests as well as paper-and-pencil tests as discussed in <italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic>. Importantly, the UGESP guidelines specifically state that the “Four-Fifths Rule” is useful to the issue of adverse impact and does not determine the ultimate question of unlawful discrimination.</p>
<p>In the instance of the <italic>Ricci</italic> case, when the employer ascertained that adverse impact was evident in its testing process, UGESP guidelines dictate that the employer follow validation procedures. Absent validation procedures, the employer should either modify its procedures to eliminate adverse impact or otherwise justify continued use of the procedures in accordance with federal law. That is, the employer must show that the selection procedures are consistent with business necessity. In considering what is required by UGESP, the City of New Haven had the options of validating the test and confirming a linkage to its jobs or considering alternative testing procedures that would not negatively affect its minority employees. They chose neither approach.</p>

<title>The Decision in <italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic></title>
<p>On June 29, 2009, the Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision, reversed the Second Circuit’s decision that upheld a decision by the City of New Haven, Connecticut, to toss out a promotional examination where White firefighter applicants had outperformed minority applicants. As previously stated, then Judge Sonia Sotomayor, who later became the first Hispanic appointment to the Supreme Court, had been a decision maker in that appellate decision. Five of her new colleagues held that the City of New Haven erred in its decision to throw out exam results showing that White candidates had outperformed the city’s minority candidates. A review of the facts of the case is of importance in analyzing this case.</p>
<p>In 2003, the City of New Haven sought to identify candidates for promotion to vacant lieutenant and captain position in its fire department. The City hired Industrial/Organization Solutions, Inc. (IOS) to develop and administer its examination at a cost of $100,000.00. IOS took painstaking efforts to design and develop a test that was fair, job related, and consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p>Job analyses were conducted to identify the tasks, knowledge, skills, and abilities that were essential to the City’s lieutenant and captain positions. IOS interviewed incumbent captains, lieutenants, and their supervisors and also rode with and observed other on-duty officers. Using information garnered from interviews and observations, IOS officials wrote job-analysis questionnaires and administered them to incumbent battalion chiefs, captains, and lieutenants in the City’s fire department. Importantly, IOS officials oversampled minority firefighters to ensure that the results would not intentionally favor White candidates.</p>
<p>After the job-analysis information was developed, IOS developed the written examinations to measure job-related knowledge. Training manuals were compiled, as were department and other materials to use as sources for test questions. With the approval of fire department officials, IOS drafted multiple-choice questions for each position. The exam questions were written below a 10th-grade reading level.</p>
<p>Following the development of the exam, the City opened a 3-month study period and gave candidates a list that identified the source material for the questions. Candidates were given specific chapters from which questions were taken. Every effort was made to ensure the test was fair and not biased against any group of firefighters.</p>
<p>As a final effort to ensure fairness in the testing process, the City assembled a pool of assessors from out of town to evaluate candidates. They were at ranks above the positions being tested, including battalion chiefs, assistant chiefs, and chiefs from departments similar in size to New Haven’s. Sixty percent of the panelists were minorities, and each of the 9 three-member assessment panels contained two minority members. All received training on how to score a candidate’s responses consistently using a checklist of desired criteria.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs were among 118 New Haven firefighters who took examinations to qualify for promotion to lieutenant or captain. Seventy-seven candidates completed the examination for lieutenant. The results showed the following pass rates: Of 43 Whites, 25 passed (58.1%); of 19 Blacks, 6 passed (31.6 %); and of 15 Hispanics, 3 passed (31.6%). Thirty-one candidates completed the examination for captain. The results showed the following pass rates: Of 25 Whites, 16 passed (64%); of 8 Blacks, 3 passed (37.5%); and of 8 Hispanics, 3 passed (37.5%).</p>
<p>The following two figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0091026013484574">figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0091026013484574">2</xref>) with an analysis of the exam results utilizing the UGESP’s “Four-Fifths Rule” show that the City’s exams had a disparate impact on minority applicants.</p>

</fig>
<p>Importantly also, promotion and hiring procedures in the City were governed by a charter. This charter established a merit system that required the City to fill vacancies in its classified civil service ranks with those considered to be the most qualified individuals, as determined by job-related examinations. The City’s firefighters are in the classified civil service system, and the charter requires a “rule of three” promotional process. Thus, the City was mandated to select from the three top scorers on any certified promotional list.</p>
<p>The City of New Haven was also under a collective bargaining agreement with its firefighters union. The union contract required the use of written and oral examinations. The written exam counted for 60% of an applicant’s total score, and the oral exam 40%. New Haven, seemingly, was bound by a set of procedures that was unalterable. Perhaps this explains, in part, the City’s failure to pursue a suitable alternative to its predicament.</p>
<p>Despite established procedures, however, the City, according to UGESP procedures, should have sought to validate their test. Assuming the test proved to be valid, the City could have moved forward and promoted those applicants with successful scores. Considering the rigorous efforts of their contractor to ensure job-relatedness, this outcome was most likely. Absent a finding that the test was valid, the City could have declared the test inappropriate. A third alternative would have been to find a selection procedure that was less onerous to its minority applicants. This option seemingly was blocked by the City’s contract with the firefighters union. Similar cities utilized procedures that did not have the same impact as New Haven’s testing procedures.</p>
<p>In nearby Bridgeport, Connecticut, the employer used selection procedures for its firefighters dissimilar to those of New Haven. The City of Bridgeport utilized methods that rely on the use of assessment centers to make selections. In this approach, applicants are evaluated in simulated real-life situations to assess how they would react in emergencies. Unlike in the City of New Haven, the representation rates of lieutenants and captains in Bridgeport are largely proportionate to the city’s Black and Hispanic populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091026013484574">Greenhouse, 2009</xref>). With nearly 60% of the population of New Haven being both African American and Hispanic, the fire department has few of either group in command positions, a concern of note in the dissenting opinion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091026013484574"><italic>Ricci v. Stefano</italic> (2009)</xref>. Moreover, the City has a history of denying hiring opportunities to minorities and only increased their numbers in its ranks because of litigation and a settlement agreement.</p>
<p>Despite the issues in <italic>Ricci</italic>, the City of New Haven chose none of the potential alternative selection possibilities discussed above. Instead, a decision was made merely to throw out the exam. In doing so, the Supreme Court had justification to find them guilty of illegal disparate-treatment discrimination.</p>
<sec id="section6-0091026013484574">
<title>Strong-Basis-in-Evidence Standard</title>
<p>Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy used the concept of a “strong-basis-in-evidence” to support the Court’s decision. This concept has its origins in the Court’s equal protection cases, as will be discussed.</p>
<p>After considering the pass rates for minority candidates for both the captain and lieutenant exams, the City did not certify any of its exam results. The City contended that had it certified the examination, it surely would have been sued by minority firefighters. At the time, there were assertions by minority firefighters and other minority leaders that if the decision were made to certify the results, they would sue the city. Prominent among this vocal group was a political crony of Mayor DeStefano, Fire Commissioner Boise Kimber, a Black male. Justice Samuel Alito made comments in the <italic>Ricci</italic> as to political implications of this relationship in the City’s decision-making process.</p>
<p>In viewing the City’s contention, Justice Kennedy asserted that the statistical evidence for the exams merely constituted a “threshold showing of significant disparity” as noted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091026013484574"><italic>Connecticut v. Teal</italic> (1982)</xref>. Justice Kennedy’s point here is that the city based its decision to toss out the firefighters’ exams on nothing more than a prima facie case of disparate-impact liability. There was no follow-up to support their belief that there was a valid problem.</p>
<p>The Court ruled that, standing alone, the defendant’s prima facie, statistical evidence was insufficient to provide a “‘strong-basis-in-evidence’ that the City would have been liable under Title VII had it certified the [test] results” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091026013484574"><italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic>, 2009</xref>). The City could only be liable for disparate-impact discrimination “if the examination were not job related and consistent with business necessity, or if there existed an equally valid, less-discriminatory alternative that served the City’s needs but that the City refused to adopt” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091026013484574"><italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic>, 2009</xref>). The Court, therefore, ruled that based on the record of evidence presented, there was nothing to show the examinations in question were deficient in either of these respects. Accordingly, the City’s defense was considered flawed.</p>
<p>The use of the concept of strong-basis-in-evidence was drawn from cases similar to the current litigation. However, they were in the context of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. Justice Kennedy articulated that, in those cases, the legal dicta were that “certain government action to remedy past racial discrimination—actions that are themselves based on race—are constitutional only where there is a ‘strong-basis-in-evidence’ that their remedial actions were necessary” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091026013484574"><italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic>, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0091026013484574">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Justice Kennedy noted that there is a “tension between eliminating segregation and discrimination on the one hand and doing away with all governmentally imposed discrimination based on race on the other” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091026013484574"><italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic>, 2009</xref>). He argued, therefore, that it becomes crucial that appropriate evidentiary evidence be present to support a conclusion that remedial action is warranted, when challenged in court by majority group members.</p>
<p>With the premise that there is the same tension in the interplay between Title VII’s disparate-treatment and adverse-impact theories, it would follow that applying the “strong-basis-in-evidence” standard would be appropriate. Similar to the manner in which the standard is used in equal protection cases, Justice Kennedy reasoned that applying this standard to the Title VII statute, “gives effect to both provisions, allowing violation of one in the name of compliance with the other only in certain, narrow circumstances” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091026013484574"><italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic>, 2009</xref>). Thus, absent some compelling reason to eliminate segregation and/or discrimination, the strong-basis-in-evidence standard would preclude governmentally imposed disparate treatment of any group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0091026013484574">
<title>Concurring Opinion</title>
<p>The separate and concurring opinion offered by Justice Antonin Scalia is significant. Scalia wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>I join the Court’s opinion in full, but write separately to observe that its resolution of this dispute merely postpones the evil day on which the Court will have to confront the question: Whether, or to what extent, are the disparate-impact provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 consistent with the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091026013484574"><italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic>, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Justice Scalia makes it perfectly clear in his opinion that he believes Title VII’s disparate-impact concept is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and in his opinion, the government’s imposition of such a process is unconstitutional.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0091026013484574">
<title>Justice Ginsburg’s Dissent</title>
<p>A rather strong dissent was written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Unlike the majority, she opined that Title VII’s purpose is served by addressing both disparate-treatment discrimination as well as disparate-impact discrimination. Ginsburg wrote that “standing on an equal footing, these twin pillars of Title VII advance the same objectives: ending workplace discrimination and promoting genuinely equal opportunity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091026013484574"><italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic>, 2009</xref>). Moreover, she declared that the “strong-basis-in-evidence standard is drawn from inapposite equal protection precedents” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091026013484574"><italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic>, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091026013484574">Shelly Peffer’s (2009)</xref> analysis of Justice Ginsburg’s comments is that “the Court used inappropriate equal protection precedents and erred in applying those precedents to Title VII.”</p>
<p>Justice Ginsburg argued that, by applying the strong-basis-in-evidence standard, the Court sets at odds Title VII’s core directives, ignores Congress’s design in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091026013484574">1991</xref> Civil Rights Act as well as the <italic>Griggs</italic> line of cases Congress recognized as what she called path marking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091026013484574"><italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic>, 2009</xref>). Ginsburg further cites EEOC’s interpretative guidelines that she found corroborative. The guidelines state, “Congress did not intend to expose those who comply with the Act to charges that they are violating the very statute they are seeking to implement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091026013484574">EEOC, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Justice Ginsburg observed that the strong-basis-in-evidence standard had never been used in Title VII cases involving race-conscious affirmative action plans prior to <italic>Ricci</italic>. Moreover, her tone exhibited outrage over the majority decision rendered in this case because, in doing so, the City was denied any chance to address this newly announced strong-basis-in-evidence standard. Typically, when a new standard is formulated, as in <italic>Ricci</italic>, the case is remanded to allow the lower courts to apply the rule and to allow respondents to address the rule as well. Ginsburg’s dissent strongly suggests that the majority members’ actions showed an alternative intent. Notable in this regard are her comments that the Court, by not remanding the decision to the lower court, the majority “has chosen to short-circuit this litigation based on its pretension that the City had shown, and can show, nothing more than a statistical disparity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091026013484574"><italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic>, 2009</xref>). Justice Ginsburg’s dissent aggressively and defiantly disagreed that there was nothing more that can be shown.</p>

<title>Impact of Justice Sotomayor in Earlier Decision</title>
<p>As to Justice Sotomayor’s input into the case, many negative comments were leveled her way. Much of the commentary was designed (unsuccessfully) to derail her Senate confirmation process. Organizations such as The Traditional Values Coalition claimed that the <italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic> decision was yet another example of Sotomayor’s history of flawed legal thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091026013484574">Lafferty, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Justice Sotomayor’s self-described role as a political activist who “views the role of a judge as an activist who make policy decision” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091026013484574">Lafferty, 2009</xref>) made her an easy target for those who attempted to prevent her confirmation. Her involvement in <italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic> in the Second Circuit was seen as one of her badly reasoned court decisions.</p>
<p>A close examination of the lower court decision, however, gives one pause relative to any claim that Sotomayor was a liberal activist in the decision. Responding to these comments, Lanny J. Davis<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0091026013484574">2</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091026013484574">2009</xref>) took special exception to the negative commentary aimed at Justice Sotomayor. Davis cites what he calls five myths about the case:</p>
<list id="list1-0091026013484574" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The case is not just Judge Sotomayor’s opinion—a three judge panel on the Second U.S. Court of Appeals made the decision with yet the remaining judges voting 7 to 6 against rehearing the appellate arguments;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Justice Sotomayor and other Judges were sympathetic to the White firefighters, as noted in language of the Second Circuit’s decision: “We are not unsympathetic to the plaintiffs’ expression of frustration. Mr. Ricci, for example, who is dyslexic, made intensive efforts that appear to have resulted in his scoring highly on one of the exams, only to have it invalidated”;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>This case is not proof that Justice Sotomayor is a “liberal activist” given that the decision of the Second Circuit was based on 38 years of jurisprudence, beginning with the decision in <italic>Griggs v. Duke Power Co</italic>., the EEOC’s “Four-Fifths Rule” in the UGESP guidelines, and established precedents of the Second Circuit;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The ruling against the White firefighters was not supported by President Obama’s Department of Justice. Instead, the Department of Justice asked the Supreme Court not to affirm the Second Circuit panel or the New Haven District Court, but rather to send the case back to the New Haven court for further evidentiary hearings. The purpose for the remand recommendation was to find out whether alternatives to the testing system could be found that were not as objectionable;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Supreme Court’s reversal of the decision does not reflect negatively on Justice Sotomayor. Here, Davis claims that the decision of the Supreme Court to reverse <italic>Ricci</italic> would not be unusual for the majority for this particular Supreme Court. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091026013484574">Davis (2009)</xref> notes that this group of justices has previously chosen to ignore years of precedent and the conservative doctrine of “stare decisis” (the policy of courts to abide by or adhere to principles established by decision in earlier cases).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In support of Davis’ Point 5, and as noted in Point 3, the decision of the Second Circuit was consistent with its rulings in two prior cases in this court. Moreover, a reversal of <italic>Ricci</italic> is not enough to taint the new justice. A majority of the justices of this Supreme Court, it could be argued, are tainted in the area of equal employment opportunity (EEO). This court ruled against Lilly Ledbetter in her action involving the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, an equal pay case that prompted Congress to immediately pass the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to afford women the right to sue for equal pay violations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0091026013484574"><italic>Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Implications of <italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic></title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091026013484574">David R. Cameron (2009)</xref>, a professor of political science at Yale University, commented that the decision in <italic>Ricci</italic> not only represents a huge success for Ricci et al., but that it also represents an indictment of the City of New Haven. Much of his commentary mirrors recommendations of the UGESP. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091026013484574">Cameron (2009)</xref> notes that when the City of New Haven became aware that its testing procedure had an adverse impact on a protected group, it had three immediate options: “conduct a validity study of the exams and either prepare better exams or come up with a better selection procedure or, if the exams were valid, promote those who qualified for promotion.” The City chose none of these options. Instead, it threw out the exams, and the ultimate result is a Supreme Court decision that leaves very little guidance for employers on how to address situations similar to <italic>Ricci v. DeStefano.</italic></p>
<p>With what seems to be a move from prior precedent decisions, employers are in an untenable position when attempting to decide on a course of action in such cases. What is the solution to addressing the issue of disparate impact in light of this case? Obviously, doing nothing is not an option. In attempting to satisfy the strong-basis-in-evidence standard now applied to Title VII cases, employers, as an initial act, must immediately move to validate their exam and/or find less-onerous methods to test minority applicants.</p>
<p>Justice Kennedy acknowledged that the City was “compelled to take a hard look at the examination to determine whether certifying the results would have had an impermissible disparate impact” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091026013484574"><italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic>, 2009</xref>). However, through conducting a validity study or finding some alternative procedure for the exam, could the City have determined that there was a strong-basis-in-evidence to believe it would be sued by the city’s minority firefighters? The City did not conduct such a study, and it did not find an alternative exam with less impact. Thus, it had no valid defense to its decision to merely throw out the exam results. This “hard knocks” lesson should not go unheeded by other employers.</p>
<p>The 5–4 decision by the Supreme Court would apply largely to the public-sector hiring process and mandated civil service exams, as was the case with the City of New Haven. In light of the results here, however, there may be some inclination not to use written exams like that of the New Haven Fire Department. Some public employers believe assessment centers, where applications are evaluated in simulated real-life situations, better serve fire and police departments. They are considered better in assessing one’s leadership and communication skills in emergency situations.</p>
<p>Other communities of a similar size utilize assessment centers as a major focus in the testing process. The City of Bridgeport, Connecticut, is such an example. Its testing procedures have produced more politically correct results than found in the City of New Haven, Connecticut.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091026013484574">Michael C. Dorf (2009)</xref>, a professor of law at Cornell University, echoes Justice Ginsburg’s dissent that, when a new standard is applied, as in <italic>Ricci</italic>, the practice of the Supreme Court has been to remand the case to the lower court to proceed under the new standard. As noted by Justice Ginsburg in her dissent, the majority departed from this practice. A remand, according to Professor Dorf, would have allowed the lower courts to give the parties an opportunity to present their evidence and arguments under the new standard. By not allowing a remand, the plaintiff could not address the Supreme Court’s articulation that the only record of possible disparate-impact liability was statistical.</p>
<p>Moreover, the remand would have been consistent with the suggestion of the U.S. Department of Justice in its amicus curiae brief supporting vacatur and remand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091026013484574">2009</xref>). In its brief, the department urged the Supreme Court not to affirm the Second Circuit panel decision and the New Haven district court’s decision but rather to send the case back to the New Haven court for further evidentiary hearings.</p>
<p>Perhaps the application of the new standard is part of a design by the conservative majority on the court, headed by Justice Scalia, to prepare for a future case wherein the disparate-impact provision of Title VII can be declared unconstitutional. As Justice Scalia pointed out in his concurring opinion,
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . if the Federal Government is prohibited from discrimination on the basis of race, . . . then surely it is also prohibited from enacting laws mandating that third parties—e.g., employers, whether private, State, or municipal-discriminate on the basis of race. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091026013484574"><italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic>, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One can interpret his intent as being in disagreement with the theory of giving some sort of allowance to minorities who have been unintentionally impacted by otherwise neutral employment practices. Scalia articulates that “[T]he Government must treat citizens as individuals, not as simply components of a racial, religious, sexual or national class” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091026013484574"><italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic>, 2009</xref>). In other words, each person must stand on his or her own merits, as noted in principles encapsulated in the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.</p>

<sec id="section11-0091026013484574">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p><italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic> is not unlike other sensitive cases involving race in this country. As noted in the majority and dissenting opinions, strong points of view are in evidence on both sides. Given the lack of guidance provided by the Court on how to make hiring practices fair, many believe that this decision will merely lead to more litigation in efforts by employers to determine when they have a “strong basis in evidence” for discarding a test. One could surmise that the message in the case is not to utilize a testing method like that used in the City of New Haven. Rather, alternative procedures, such as the use of assessment centers, should be utilized along with a written exam but with assessment-center outcomes having greater weight.</p>
<p>Importantly, <italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic> is a disparate-treatment discrimination case and nothing more. The decision rendered is an affirmation that race-conscious remedies are fraught with risks. Employers should learn what not to do from <italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic> and should make every effort to ensure the validity of whichever selection method is used. The decision does not signal the end of UGESP testing principles.</p>
<p>The more serious consequences of this case may come on that “evil day” that Justice Antonin Scalia speaks of, when one must confront the question of “Whether or to what extent are the disparate-impact provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are consistent with the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091026013484574"><italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic>, 2009</xref>). Already, it would appear, Scalia is preparing for that battle, and it is apparent where he stands on this issue. That day may be the one that will change the landscape of employment law as we know it. We have not yet arrived there with the <italic>Ricci v. DeStefano</italic> case.</p>
