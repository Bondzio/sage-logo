<p>The term ‘Stasi’ really took off in Britain with the arrival of Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’s film <italic>The Lives of Others</italic> in UK cinemas in 2009. Yet already in a speech delivered on 16 December 2008, to the Intellect Trade Association, the then Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, had used the term. She expressed her concern about the activities of some local councils, stating: ‘And it’s these tales of “dustbin Stasi” and examples of excessive intrusion that give the responsible and respectable use of the powers a bad name.’ Conservative MP James Brokenshire (Hornchurch), too, spoke of ‘dustbin Stasi’ on 16 March 2009. Clearly, the term ‘Stasi’ looks to be on its way to becoming just as well-known as Gestapo.</p>
<p>For many foreign and German visitors to Berlin before 1990 the failure of the Soviet ‘socialist’ system was exposed by the Berlin Wall, which prevented East Germans visiting West Berlin or leaving the so-called German Democratic Republic (GDR). Many saw it as a system very similar to that of Nazi Germany. Even the uniforms conspired to give that impression. In these circumstances it is difficult to understand how the intelligence service of the GDR’s <italic>Ministerium für Staatssicherheit</italic> (MfS or Ministry for State Security), now known simply as the Stasi, was so successful in infiltrating West Germany’s politics and society, for as Georg Herbstritt tells us in his authoritative account, the infiltration of the Stasi into West German society and institutions before 1989 was ‘in many respects without parallel’ (338). No fewer than 11 members of the West German parliament were exposed as East German agents. One prominent GDR propagandist, an Auschwitz survivor, Kurt Goldstein, denied the comparison with the Third Reich. He put it to the author that the difference was that ‘Hitler left six million dead, the Stasi just left six million files.’ Although factually correct, this hides as much as it reveals.</p>
<p>Considering the recent flurry of scholarship on this topic, we do now know much more. Let us go back to the beginning, that is to say, to 1945, when Germany faced defeat and occupation. All four victorious allies, the USA, Soviet Union, United Kingdom and France, scrambled to grab as much as possible of Germany’s military and scientific secrets and personnel. When the Americans, in July 1945, pulled out of areas they had occupied that had been allocated to the Soviets under the Yalta agreement, they took with them professional engineers, scientists and technicians and their families. However, as Paul Maddrell in his archive-based study reminds us<bold>,</bold> the Soviets took possession of the German-designed surface-to-surface missiles, the V-1 and the V-2, and much more (25). Indeed, the Soviet Zone had been the core of the Nazi military-industrial complex. The Soviets started early on to reactivate the captured German weapons’ factories, which was contrary to the Four Power Potsdam Agreement. The Soviets also deported key German personnel to work in the Soviet Union. Production facilities were soon moved, too. This prevented such personnel from deserting and made it easier to keep the production facilities secret. Political developments in the Soviet Zone (and elsewhere) also caused alarm. For the British, the forced merger, in April 1946, of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) with the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) to form the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) was a key turning point. It seemed to indicate that Stalin was not interested in a united, democratic Germany. As relations between the West and the Soviet Union deteriorated, the Western powers studied more closely German intelligence assessments of Soviet capabilities in all fields; these included everything from eyewitness reports of captured Soviet installations, to maps, aerial photography and interrogations of Soviet prisoners of war. Soviet deserters, rarely mentioned, also helped. Maddrell, in his tour de force, informs us that, ‘Until 1949, scores of Soviet troops defected to the British every year. The Americans received more deserters than the British did’ (69).</p>
<p>In 1949, the German Democratic Republic (GDR) was created in the Soviet Zone as a competitor to the newly founded Federal Republic of Germany in the West. In 1950, the MfS was officially established. In the West the only semi-official intelligence agency was the re-constituted <italic>Wehrmacht</italic>, <italic>Abteilung Fremde Heere Ost</italic> (FHO, Department Foreign Armies East) in the General Staff, led by <italic>Wehrmacht</italic> Major General Reinhard Gehlen. Its main purpose was to collect information on the Red Army. Not deterred by Germany’s defeat and surrender, in 1945, only months later, Gehlen got to work again, with his own body known as the Gehlen Organization. He recruited some of his former comrades, operatives of Admiral Wilhelm Canaris's military intelligence, <italic>Abwehr</italic>, but he also recruited from the former <italic>Sicherheitsdienst</italic>, SS and Gestapo. The organization worked almost exclusively for the CIA, which contributed funding, equipment, vehicles and other materials. On 1 April 1956, the <italic>Bundesnachrichtendienst</italic> (BND, Federal Intelligence Service) was set up from the Gehlen Organization, as the official body responsible to the West German government. Reinhard Gehlen became President of the BND and remained its head until 1968.</p>
<p>Armin Wagner and Matthias Uhl make a credible attempt to trace the efforts of the BND, to discover the strength and intentions of the Soviet armed forces in the GDR. The work has not been easy as much of the BND’s activities in the period covered remains secret.</p>
<p>Gehlen’s counterpart in the GDR was Wilhelm Zaisser the first Minister of State Security of the GDR. Zaisser was a First World War officer, a schoolteacher by profession and an early member of the KPD. He had a long involvement with the Soviet secret service, especially in the Spanish Civil War. He attempted to depose SED General Secretary Walter Ulbricht after the June 1953 uprising, but in a counter-stroke Ulbricht removed him, and he was replaced by Ernst Wollweber, a former sailor, Spanish war veteran and Soviet secret agent. Wollweber resigned in 1957, after clashes with Ulbricht and Erich Honecker, and was succeeded by his deputy, Erich Mielke. Although a working-class Berliner, Mielke had a similar involvement with the Soviet intelligence service and was also a Spanish war veteran who was a ruthless implementer of Soviet policies. Amazingly, he managed to hold on to the MfS until November 1989. All were pre-war Communists totally trusted by Moscow.</p>
<p>In 1957, Markus Wolf, a key figure in the intelligence war, became head of the <italic>Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung</italic> (HVA, Main Reconnaissance Administration), the foreign intelligence section of the MfS. Wolf was the son of the Communist Jewish writer Friedrich Wolf. He spent the Hitler years in the Soviet Union and was clearly marked out as an international Soviet agent. He worked as a journalist immediately after returning to Germany in 1945 but was soon in the new diplomatic service and then the MfS.</p>
<p>Clearly, the West German intelligence operators and their East German counterparts knew, initially, very much about the other’s terrain. All the old maps and town plans were available, as was statistical data from yearbooks, old reports confidential and public, guide books, rail schedules, reports on canals and waterways, membership lists and so on. As the Cold War got colder this material became more precious, but also out-of-date. Both sides sought to use human intelligence on a massive scale. In the period before August 1961, when the Berlin Wall went up, this was much easier to do. Even so, the MfS had a clear advantage over Gehlen in that about 3 million people left the GDR for the West and the HVA was well represented among them. The most influential of these agents was Günter Guillaume, whose exposure led to the downfall of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt in May 1974.</p>
<p>What were the tasks of these rival intelligence services? In the case of Gehlen/BND, its main job, especially in the early years, was to keep track of Soviet military deployment in the Soviet Zone/GDR. Armin Wagner explains, ‘During the Berlin Blockade the US Air Force in Europe relied on practically every bit of information which the Gehlen Organization delivered about the Soviet 16th Air Army stationed in East Germany’ (223). In this crisis Gehlen had relied on radio intelligence. During the June 1953 revolt he relied on agents in the field and failed. After the shocks of that uprising, both sides attempted to reappraise their activities. Gradually, the Stasi got more control of the GDR’s western frontier but the open sector boundaries in Berlin continued to make its control function extremely difficult. It is remarkable that the ‘Democratic Sector’ of Berlin was only sealed off in August 1961. After this time, it was extremely difficult for Western intelligence agencies to operate in the GDR. In the case of the CIA, it was ‘deaf, dumb and blind’ in relation to East Germany, according to Benjamin B. Fischer (48), former chief historian of the CIA, in his interesting contribution to the excellent Friis/Macrakis/Müller-Enbergs volume. Indeed he tells us that most, if not all, of the CIA’s agents over 20 years were double agents (49). In the case of the BND, according to Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, only 20 of its 180 agents were operating unrecognized by MfS (42).</p>
<p>As Wagner tells us, the MfS became more effective in intercepting letters to BND cover addresses in the early 1960s. Partly in response, the BND turned more to transit and travel spies (226). These were often travellers from West Germany to West Berlin who journeyed by road or rail through the GDR. In the period 1970–5 the BND sought to recruit East Germans with a high degree of freedom in the GDR – that is, truck drivers, rail employees, and West German bargemen. The BND also recruited GDR pensioners, the over 60s, who could travel to visit relatives in the West. So-called <italic>Reisekader</italic> – that is, East German professionals who were trusted to travel – were also targeted. This was further developed in the 1980s. It is likely that we will never have precise figures for the numbers of Western agents in the GDR or Stasi agents in West Germany. However, all are agreed that the Stasi was more successful in the West than were the BND and other agencies in the GDR. According to Wagner ‘for the period 1950–89 it is estimated that 12,000 West German citizens spied for different units of the MfS, approximately half of them for the HVA. In 1989 there were 3000 to 4000 unofficial West German collaborators of the MfS’ (232).</p>
<p>What was the aim of the Stasi with these agents, and who were they? Georg Herbstritt points out that DDR activities in <italic>Operationsgebiet</italic>, operational area, mainly West Germany, went well beyond traditional intelligence gathering in that the aim was to influence Western policy and politics, to infiltrate Western institutions, to disorganize them and, if necessary, destroy them (100).</p>
<p>Herbstritt gives us a comprehensive, compelling and fascinating account of the so-called <italic>Inoffizielle Mitarbeiter</italic> (unofficial collaborators or IM), who were recruited for these purposes. These were individuals who were not officially members of the Stasi. They were simply persons who used their contacts or their trades or professions to further the work of the Stasi in West Germany or, in a few cases, abroad. Herbstritt points out that they were not a homogenous group in terms of their politics, culture or sociological backgrounds (103). Men were more likely to be IM than women. Of the 499 IM in his study, 390 were men. Most of these men were family men whose incomes varied greatly. Only 27 of them had come to the attention of the courts before for everything from motoring offences to fraud and assault (104). Among the 109 women none had been convicted of any previous offences. But women were not regarded highly by the Stasi and no female IM was given a leadership role. Prejudice against homosexuals was noticeable, and only three of the 390 men were gay. The jobs the IMs engaged in varied, including business executives, civil servants, cleaning ladies, engineers, factory workers, hairdressers, medical practitioners, ministers of religion, museum keepers, pensioners, politicians, police officers, professors, prostitutes, soldiers, students, teachers and a butterfly keeper. Stasi talent spotters were on the lookout both for those in sensitive positions and those who appeared to have a bright future. Only about 30 per cent of those recruited were already in positions where secrets were expected to be kept. One third of Herbstritt’s group had studied at a university or college of technology (118). 135 were members of a political party, and although they were more likely to be in the SPD, all parties were represented in the ranks of the West German IM (128). The SPD members sympathized with the GDR’s socialist ideas, believed its rhetoric about the fight for peace, and did not feel West Germany had come to terms with Germany’s Nazi past (132). They were less likely to accept pay for their services. On the other hand, a majority of those who were members of the CDU/CSU worked for financial inducements (131). Pressure was rarely used to gain recruits. Many were flattered to be asked. This activity gave them a feeling of importance, a sense of adventure, buzz, and money. Remarkably, many Western IM became more active as time passed, even working from their beds when ill (290–1). Their case officers knew how to look after them. Birthdays were remembered, medals awarded, ranks given and DDR citizenship offered (294–5).</p>
<p>What happened to the IM who were subsequently exposed? Of the 499 in Herbstritt’s study, 64 were subsequently sent to prison after their exposure and trial (119). Those who were originally citizens of the GDR and continued to claim (secretly) this citizenship while in the West were not normally prosecuted as their GDR allegiance was recognised.</p>
<p>Kristie Macrakis, in her <italic>Seduced by Secrets</italic>, deals very well with a neglected subject, the Stasi’s ‘high tech’ world. As she comments, ‘What the general public does not know is that technology was at the heart of the KGB’s … and the Stasi’s spying operations … Not only did the MfS steal technology from abroad, they also created some of the spy world’s most inventive technological gadgets at home’ (1). Mielke was anxious to get total surveillance, but manpower was short. He aimed to open as many letters as possible and not just those going beyond the frontiers of the GDR. In 1972, as Macrakis reveals, ‘The fully automated 10/10 machine could open six hundred letters an hour as they rolled down a “steam street”’(218). With the increased use of technology in the 1970s, investigations led to the unmasking of 13 CIA and BND spies between 1971 and 1982 (221). It goes without saying that hotels reserved for Western visitors were watched. The newer Interhotels of the 1980s had surveillance equipment built into them. You could not be sure you were alone even when using the bathroom. Places like the Grand Hotel Friedrichstrasse in Berlin, opened in 1987, or the Interhotels in Leipzig were especially targeted. Apparently, the hotels in Dresden were the most high-tech, whereas the Erfurt hotels had no technology. In a Stasi country house in Prenden, 30 miles north west of Berlin, ‘No room was spared – the more private the room, the more surveillance was required. The bathroom had a pinhole camera with a wide-angle lens installed behind the toilet and the ceiling, a pinhole microphone’ (250).</p>
<p>Technology theft was a top priority both for the KGB and the Stasi. A joint KGB-East German team, the Robotron Computer Centre in Dresden, was able to clone the IBM 360 at the end of the 1960s. ‘Bill’ was recruited in 1964 by the HVA’s <italic>Sektor Wissenschaft und Technik</italic> (SWT, Sector for Science and Technology). In 1971 he provided three major deliveries of material related to the IBM 360, ‘including program logic manuals, the disk operating system, and software’(117). IBM appears to have had resident spies transferring technology throughout the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p>‘With the launching of the Microelectronics Program in 1977, the Western computer industry emerged as the MfS’s main target’ (116). According to Macrakis there were a large number of science spies, but few of them were subsequently brought to public light and prosecuted. In 1989 the SWT had agents planted at internationally competitive companies such as IBM, Siemens, AEG/Telefunken, SEL, Texas Instruments and DEC (185).</p>
<p>Bodo Wegmann’s published doctoral dissertation is a sturdy work dealing with an almost unknown aspect of GDR intelligence activities. The HVA is often regarded as the GDR’s main or indeed only organization operating in the West. That the GDR’s armed forces – <italic>Nationale Volksarmee</italic>, or NVA – had their own intelligence service is little known. In this work we get much useful information and also 12 pages of abbreviations, perhaps testifying to the bureaucratic nature of the GDR. Wegmann gives us some interesting biographies of GDR spies who used stolen identities: Heinz Hempel, for instance, whose superiors provided him with the identity of Ludwig Bergmann – the son of a German soldier and a Norwegian mother, who lived as an orphan in what became the GDR (241–2). Unbeknownst to Bergmann, the NVA successfully applied for his Norwegian citizenship papers and gave them to their officer, Hempel. So armed, he went via Oslo to West Germany and worked, not very successfully, as an NVA information gatherer for some years.</p>
<p>One question remains regarding this entire system of intelligence gathering: did it change anything? The military intelligence provided the West with the knowledge that the Soviet Union did not plan an invasion of West Germany in the Stalin years and beyond. The military and political intelligence gained by the HVA revealed to the SED leadership that the West German leadership had no plans to destroy it. The leaderships in Bonn, London and elsewhere appear to have been unaware of the impeding collapse of the GDR. Yet Wagner and Uhl write that the BND was aware of the moribund state of the GDR economy in the 1980s. They quote its head, Hans-Georg Wieck (1985–90), as claiming that his service was well-informed but that the West German political elite it did not want to know because they had come to accept the existence of two German states (192–3).</p>
<p>Finally, a more personal and idiosyncratic account of the ideological struggles that shaped Cold War Germany deserves mention. John Green grew up in a Communist home in Coventry and gained a degree in zoology at Bristol University. He left Britain to study film in the GDR in 1964. He subsequently worked for GDR television in Afghanistan, Chile, Greece, Ireland, Grenada, Turkey, El Salvador, the USA and elsewhere. He worked for the GDR for over 20 years, having grown to love the GDR with its warts, ulcers and scars. Later, he realized he bore some responsibility for ‘the abuses, inhumanity and downright incompetence of the GDR regime’ (220). He would also claim that he and his colleagues ‘were also largely ignorant of the many injustices in the GDR’, but:<disp-quote>
<p>For me, growing up in a capitalist society in which my own parents had been black-listed and sacked for being communists, where trade unionists are jailed for defending their rights, where there is no right to work, housing or economic justice, a socialist society was a wonderful and exciting concept and I felt at the time that the GDR came nearest to a realisation of that goal. (220)</p></disp-quote>Generally, all the works discussed here can be recommended to students of the GDR, Intelligence Studies, Cold War history and German politics who want to delve into the subject area of German–German intelligence between 1949 and 1990.</p>
