<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Stroke has been identified as the most disabling condition primarily because its effect on walking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215513476312">1</xref></sup> Limited ambulatory ability post-stroke leads to physical inactivity, which contributes to cardiovascular deconditioning,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215513476312">2</xref></sup> social isolation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215513476312">3</xref></sup> and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQL).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215513476312">4</xref></sup> The recovery of walking capacity post-stroke has been the topic of a number of studies and a 2002 review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215513476312">5</xref></sup> concluded that more than 50% of people with stroke (over all degrees of severity) will remain with walking deficits, and the proportion with deficits increases with stroke severity. This review also endorsed that most recovery occurs in the first months post-stroke with some improving up to six months post-stroke.</p>
<p>In Canada, only 38% of people discharged home from inpatient stroke rehabilitation have some in-home services,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215513476312">6</xref></sup> and hence the end of rehabilitation usually means the end of access to restorative services. Without adequate supervision and adaptation to the home environment, people with stroke will have difficulty continuing exercise programmes introduced during formal rehabilitation. Several studies have shown that people after stroke walk much less than their age-matched peers, and their walking distance and intensity is insufficient to maintain cardiovascular health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215513476312">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215513476312">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215513476312">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>A recent meta-analysis reported that exercise interventions implemented in community-based settings have significant effects on HRQL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215513476312">9</xref></sup> Safe and effective home-based interventions are of particular importance given the increasing economic pressure to expedite discharge from rehabilitation settings. The few successful trials that were home-based were also personnel intensive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215513476312">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215513476312"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215513476312">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>An earlier study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215513476312">13</xref></sup> from our research group found that persons with stroke have a preference for home-based interventions once back in the community. In fact, the major reasons for refusal to enter a trial of a hospital-based walking intervention programme were fatigue, lack of interest, and inability to travel to the clinic. Based on this finding, there appeared to be a need to identify effective exercise protocols for use at home that require minimal supervision to maintain and enhance long-term mobility and HRQL after stroke. The purpose of this study was to estimate, among persons who had completed stroke rehabilitation, the relative effectiveness in improving walking ability and HRQL of two home-based exercise programmes – stationary cycling (cycle group) versus a task-oriented exercise and walking programme (exercise group). While both exercise regimens require active participation and repetitive training (two key ingredients of effective exercise programmes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215513476312">14</xref></sup>), the cycling regimen offers a simpler exercise protocol, greater opportunity for continuous repetitive training, a visual reminder to exercise, and invulnerability to inclement weather conditions. We hypothesized that, over a one-year period, walking capacity would improve in both groups, but the cycle group would experience greater increases in walking ability, secondarily to developing better exercise habits, and, consequently, greater gains in participation and HRQL, than the exercise group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269215513476312" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A two-site, observer-blinded, stratified, randomized, parallel two-group, pragmatic, design with repeated measures was carried out with clinical assessments for the main outcome at baseline, and after one, six, and 12 months of exercise, and home-based assessments at three and nine months. The trial was of the effectiveness, rather than the efficacy, of two exercise programmes (cycling vs. task-oriented exercise and walking) designed to improve functional walking capacity after stroke. Criteria for inclusion were diagnosis of stroke (based on clinical and radiological evidence) that required hospital admission; time since stroke &lt;12 months; completion of formal rehabilitation; residence in either Montreal or Halifax, Canada; ability to walk &gt;10 meters independently with or without supervision, aid, or orthotic; and ability to follow a three-step command. Exclusion criteria were illness or disability precluding participation in exercise intervention and failure to pass a cardiology screen complemented by an exercise stress test. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of both McGill and Dalhousie University. All participants gave informed consent.</p>
<p>To ensure balance of walking impairment between groups, participants were stratified by gait speed (≥ and &lt;0.72 m/s)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215513476312">15</xref></sup> and randomly assigned to the exercise or cycle group. Group assignment was prepared by a person not involved in the trial using computer-generated allocation of consecutively recruited participants in randomized blocks of two, four, and six, and concealed in opaque envelopes. Participants could not be blinded to their group assignment. After completion of the baseline assessment, group assignment was revealed and family physicians were informed of their patients’ involvement in the trial.</p>
<sec id="section12-0269215513476312">
<title>Interventions</title>
<p>Participants in both groups were instructed by trained physical therapists in interventions that followed a standardized protocol and were equally weighted for attention and participation; the programmes differed only with respect to the mode of exercise. All participants were visited at home 13 times over the course of one year (weekly for month one, monthly for months two to six, twice during months seven to nine, and once during months 10 to 12) to monitor and progress their exercise programme. Each participant was also telephoned weekly during the first month bi-weekly for the next three months and then monthly to discuss progress and any adverse or unexpected events. Participants were instructed to begin with a minimum of 15 minutes of exercise per day, with a goal of building up to 30 minutes per day. They were also counseled to exercise at an intensity of 11–15 on the Borg 6–20 ratings of perceived exertion scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215513476312">16</xref></sup> A simple log of exercise duration and intensity, designed for completion by the participant or caregiver, served as a reminder to exercise and an indicator of adherence. Caregivers or family members supervised the assigned exercise programme, as required.</p>
<p>A stationary bicycle, equipped with electronic monitoring of speed, distance, and heart rate, was given to each cycle group participant. Target thresholds for training were 50%–70% of maximum age-predicted heart rate, based on response to the stress test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215513476312">17</xref></sup> Participants in the exercise group were instructed to divide their exercise time equally between task-oriented lower extremity and mobility exercises and brisk walking (Appendix, available online). Exercise selection was individualized to ensure safe conduct in the home environment without ongoing professional supervision, and progressed by adding repetitions, weight resistance, or degree of difficulty. Brisk walking was progressed in speed and duration (to a maximum of 15 minutes) as tolerated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0269215513476312">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The primary outcome was the distance walked in six minutes (6MWT) with usual assistive devices and rests as needed. This measure reflects three important aspects of walking ability: walking speed, sub-maximal endurance, and balance, and has excellent psychometric properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215513476312">18</xref></sup> Measurement error for the 6MWT in older persons is 20 m;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215513476312">19</xref></sup> 35 m (corresponding to an effect size of approximately 0.5) is the expected value of change following walking interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215513476312">20</xref></sup> The 6MWT was administered by trained physical therapists unaware of group assignment prior to randomization, and one, six, and 12 months later in a research laboratory.</p>
<p>Secondary outcomes related to physical function, participation, and HRQL. Physical function outcomes included comfortable walking speed with usual assistive device (timed five-meter walk), balance (Berg Balance Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215513476312">21</xref></sup> and Community Balance and Mobility Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215513476312">22</xref></sup>), Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) – Physical,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215513476312">23</xref></sup>and Physical Function Index of the Medical Outcomes Study RAND-36 Item Health Survey (RAND-36).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215513476312">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Outcomes related to social and role participation included SIS – participation and the RAND-36 subscales of role physical and emotional, and social functioning. In addition to the SIS and RAND-36, HRQL was measured with the EuroQoL-5 dimensions (EQ-5D), and EQ-5D Visual analogue scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215513476312">25</xref></sup> Depression was assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215513476312">26</xref></sup> (GDS, rescaled 0–100). All secondary measures were reassessed at one, three, six, nine, and 12 months except balance, which was measured at one, six, and 12 months.</p>
<p>Adherence to the exercise regimens was based on review of exercise log books and documentation from the monthly visits. Participants were classified into five categories of adherence: <italic>high</italic> (consistent entries in log with therapist’s confirmation of good compliance), <italic>moderate</italic> (frequent log entries but with gaps and/or documentation of explained gaps in exercise), <italic>low</italic> (no log entries with documentation of poor compliance), <italic>drop-out, missing</italic> (no log and no informative documentation). The GDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215513476312">26</xref></sup> was included to explain adherence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0269215513476312">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The study was designed originally with 80% power (alpha 0.05) to detect a change of 35 m. in the 6MWT (with an estimated standard deviation of 70) based on the results of pilot work and the change achieved in our earlier trial of six weeks of clinic-based training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215513476312">13</xref></sup> This required a sample size of 64 per group.</p>
<p>The main analysis was a mixed-effects linear regression model testing fixed and random effects of time and group, and the interaction of time and group, with sex and gait speed at baseline (above 0.72 or not) included as covariates. Analyses were done with Statistical Analysis System (SAS) 9.2. Because of an imbalance at randomization on sex, all analyses considered sex in the model. Missing data were considered missing at random (MAR), but not missing completely at random (MCAR), and were imputed using proc mi and the mixed-effects model was run with proc mixed combined with proc mianalyse. Missing 6MWT data were imputed using age, sex, all non-missing 6MWT, and all non-missing assessments of gait speed, physical domain of SIS, and physical function and vitality subscales of the RAND-36. Imputation provides a range of plausible values for the one missing; 12 data sets were imputed and the magnitude of the error estimated (standard error, SE). Change status was also assigned based on observed (and imputed) change in the 6MWT. Analysis was based on intention-to-treat and all those randomized were considered in the final analysis.</p>
<p>Given the large number of secondary outcomes, we created a global test for each secondary outcome construct: physical function, participation, and HRQL using generalized estimating equations with SAS proc genmod.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215513476312">27</xref></sup> For each observed outcome, participants were classified as a responder or non-responder based on published values for minimal clinically important difference (MCID)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215513476312">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215513476312">29</xref></sup> or using the 1/2 standard deviation (SD) criterion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215513476312">30</xref></sup> Participants reaching a MCID over baseline at any follow-up interview were classified as responders; those with missing follow-up data were classified as non-responders. This analysis is equivalent to a logistic regression for multiple outcomes and adjusts the variance for the clusters of outcomes within persons. A single summary odds ratio (OR) and associated 95% confidence interval were computed. A significant global response permits testing of outcome specific effects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215513476312">31</xref></sup> whereas specific analyses when the global response outcome is not significant are for explanatory purposes and cannot be interpreted as evidence of an effect.</p>
<p>Impact of degree of adherence on change in 6MWT between baseline and 12 months was examined using linear regression. Mean baseline 6MWT values between those who remained in the study at one year to those lost were compared using a <italic>t</italic>-test. The probability of being a drop-out was modeled using logistic regression, which yielded an OR of the relative odds of being a drop-out associated with a unit change in the baseline covariate. Differences in the proportion of drop-outs by sex within group were compared using Fisher’s Exact Test.</p>

The trend at the six-month interim assessment for higher values for the cycle group was less evident in the final analysis. Imputed values for the cycle group at follow-up were always lower than the observed values, indicating that those who dropped out were likely to have made little improvement.

<p>Five categories of change status in the 6MWT were considered, with “responder” status assigned to participants with &gt;35 m improvement on the 6MWT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269215513476312">Table 3</xref>). Missing data at the one-month assessment for participants in the exercise group were imputed across categories, whereas, for the majority of participants in the cycle group, missing data were imputed into the "no change" category. With missing data excluded, Chi-square test at 12 months revealed a significant difference between groups (X<sup>2</sup> = 10.4; 3 degrees of freedom; <italic>p</italic> = 0.016). However, because 25% of cell sizes were &lt;5, the validity of test results is questionable.</p>

<p>Two global tests for physical function and participation were carried out and, although the global outcome for change in physical function was not significant (OR: 0.65, CI: 0.40, 1.08), the outcomes included in the global response were explored because this construct was targeted directly by the intervention (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269215513476312">Table 4</xref>). The ORs were all &lt;1.0, indicating the probability of positive response was less likely in the cycle group. A significant effect for participation was found in favor of the exercise group. The global OR was 0.51 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.95), indicating that the cycle group was less likely to respond than the exercise group. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269215513476312">Table 4</xref> presents the results for the separate participation outcomes included in the global test.

</table-wrap>
<p>The odds of being a drop-out were greater in the cycle group (OR: 3.30; 95% CI: 1.13, 9.68, adjusted for sex). Although group by sex interaction failed to reach significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.055), there was a significant difference in drop-outs by sex in the cycle group (26% of 34 men vs. 66% of nine women dropped out, <italic>p</italic> = 0.046), but not in the exercise group (19% of 26 men vs. 11% of 18 women).</p>
<p>Drop-outs tended to have a higher depression-symptom score than completers (mean [SD] GDS of 32.7 [24.7] vs. 22.4 [20.3], respectively, <italic>p</italic> = 0.059). Odds of being a drop-out were associated with worse depression scores (OR: 1.02 per unit score, unadjusted: 95% CI: &lt;1.0, 1.04); for participants with GDS scores in the moderate or severe range vs. no or mild range, the OR was 2.73 (95% CI: 0.96, 7.79). There were no associations between retention status and age, 6MWT, or gait speed at study entry.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The study, as originally designed, required a sample size of 64 per group for 80% power and alpha of 0.05. Unfortunately, only 87 subjects were enrolled, so the study was underpowered to detect an effect. However, the differences observed between the two groups, with or without imputation for missing data, did not achieve clinical relevance, and hence, recruiting additional subjects would likely have been futile. Power notwithstanding, the results of this study could be interpreted in two ways are indicated: (i) equally effective in maintaining functional walking capacity and physical function in community dwelling stroke survivors; or (ii) equally ineffective</p>
<p>Our hypothesis that both groups exercising at home would show improvement in most, if not all, outcome measures, and that the cycle group would out-perform the exercise was not supported by this trial. Less than one quarter of the sample improved on the 6MWT over the 12-month period (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269215513476312">Table 3</xref>). Nevertheless, for many participants in either group, the exercise regimens were effective in preventing the previously documented deterioration in functional mobility after discharge from stroke rehabilitation. Within the first year after completing stroke rehabilitation, worsening of function was reported in one-third of the sample in one study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215513476312">32</xref></sup> and decreased mobility in 43% of another study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215513476312">33</xref></sup> Longer-term studies reported reduced mobility in 21% of patients one to three years post-stroke,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215513476312">3</xref></sup> decreased motor function in 71% between completion of stroke rehabilitation and three-yearsfollow-up,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269215513476312">34</xref></sup> and annual declines in functional independence for up to five years after stroke that were independent of age and stroke severity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269215513476312">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study highlights the difficulty in engaging people with stroke in exercise once they have left the hospital. Our earlier study indicated that<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215513476312">13</xref></sup> people preferred a home-based exercise programme, but this did not improve recruitment rates. A potential barrier to recruitment may have been the extent of apathy in stroke survivors. A one-year longitudinal study of over 400 stroke survivors reported that apathy, identified in 50% of survivors, affected recovery; subjects with any degree of apathy had lower scores on the SIS physical function and participation domains compared with those without apathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269215513476312">36</xref></sup> In the present trial, the values for those SIS subscales were similar to the scores in the subgroup without apathy in the Mayo et al. study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269215513476312">36</xref></sup> suggesting that people without apathy were more inclined to participate in the trial.</p>
<p>We had anticipated high adherence to exercising in the home environment because this setting resolves many logistic and transportation difficulties associated with low attendance in outpatient stroke rehabilitation programmes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215513476312">32</xref></sup> However, that only 75% of the sample continued for the 12-month period should not have been unexpected, given the high incidence of deteriorating health status in the chronic stroke population. Also, exercising independently at home may be de-motivating for some participants. A retrospective study of exercise adherence post-stroke reported that participants involved in an organized group exercise programme had significantly higher adherence to the prescribed home-based component than those who had graduated from the group programme.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269215513476312">37</xref></sup> Our findings of more drop-outs in the cycle group than exercise group, greater rate of dropping out among women, and positive association between depressive symptoms and drop-out status, suggest better role participation and adherence might be achieved by offering exercise as part of an integrated community-based group programme that could include gender-specific and mood-sensitive activities to improve all aspects of survivorship.</p>
<p>Participants in the present trial may have been already performing near their physical capacity at the time of recruitment, thus limiting the potential for further improvements. At study entry, mean 6MWT distance was 321 m — greater than the 300 m deemed necessary for functional community mobility,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269215513476312">38</xref></sup> and mean comfortable walking speed 0.9 m/s — greater than the threshold of 0.8 m/s for community ambulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269215513476312">39</xref></sup> In trials demonstrated improved outcomes with home-based exercise programmes participants had lower baseline 6MWT distances (126–247 m)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215513476312">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215513476312">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269215513476312">40</xref></sup> and comfortable walking speeds (0.4–0.7 m/s).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215513476312">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215513476312">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269215513476312">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the uni-modal focus on exercise in this trial, there were downstream effects on one important stroke outcome — participation — that favored the exercise group. Further, although a global response on physical function was not found, positive gains on the physical function outcomes were more likely in the exercise group. There is strong theoretical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269215513476312">41</xref></sup> and empirical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269215513476312">42</xref></sup> support for the relationship between task-oriented activity and participation that explains the greater likelihood of positive effects on participation outcomes in the exercise group.</p>
<p>This was the only stroke exercise trial, to our knowledge, that involved a full year of intervention. The level of supervision (13 home visits by a physical therapist over the course of one year) may not have been adequate to maintain the motivation needed to engage fully in the exercise programme. Previous trials that demonstrated positive effects of home-based exercise programmes on physical function involved more frequent participant–professional interactions over a much shorter duration (eight to 16 weeks).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215513476312">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215513476312"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215513476312">12</xref></sup> Further, greater changes in the RAND-36 physical and social functioning dimensions were reported in patients post-stroke who received a mean of 51 home visits over a 12-month period compared with those who received 28 visits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269215513476312">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>The findings need to be considered in light of study limitations. The extent to which the participants were representative of community-living stroke survivors may have been compromised by involvement of mainly urban or suburban home settings, the inclusion requirement of independent ambulation over short distances, and a smaller than targeted sample size and volunteer enrollment that tends to attract more motivated individuals.</p>
