<p>It is heartening to note that the sensitization to the appeal of religion from bed-time stories could be nurtured via Gangamma Jatras and classroom exposure into a well structured thesis. This research demonstrates that the feature of goddess worship underwent transformations due to the influence of other traditions and changes in social and historical contexts. The range of evidence and sources perused prompts the author to suggest that:
<list id="list1-0257643013477267" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>more than one type of creation of religious traditions is possible;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>dominant sources highlight a single trajectory located in a particular historical context of political expansion and assimilation; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the worship of the goddess culminates in an uneasy spatial, mythical and visual accommodation of these goddesses.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Kunal Chakrabarti’s <italic>Puranas and the Making of a Regional Tradition</italic> and Champakalakshmi’s <italic>Religion, Tradition and Ideology<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0257643013477267">1</xref></sup></italic> are two excellent examples of the recent efforts at constructing regional religious traditions. These efforts are to be understood as responses of professional historians to the larger question of what constitutes Hinduism, and how best it can be defined. The historicity of tradition in India is yet to be satisfactorily comprehended. This would involve serious research on the multiple traditions and complex processes of evolution, interaction, societal formation and change. Mahalakshmi has attempted to study the interaction between the Sanskritic (Brahmanical) and the vernacular (regional) traditions through the features of goddess worship in Tamilakam.</p>
<p>The work is organized in six chapters. The first chapter examines the traditions of goddess worship of the paalai tinai deity Korravai in the body of Sangam literature which encapsulated the possibility of Sanskritic influences. Korravai, the goddess of war and victory during the early historical period got associated increasingly with Durga of the Puranic pantheon from the third century CE onwards. The views of George L. Hart and Kamil Zvelebil are taken into account for the location of goddess worship within the indigenous religious tradition of Tamilakam. The conceptualization of a goddess as a patron deity of a micro-region and a bestower of victory and fertility was important at this stage. The Paattu collection offers the dimension of Ananku, which signifies beauty, youth, sexuality and danger. Perumpanarruppatai eulogizes Korravai as the mother of Murugan. Porunarruppatai describes her as the forest deity. In the pre-Brahmanization stage, the goddess Korravai is to be understood as a symbol of victory and power, deified in the semi-arid tinai by the tribes whose livelihood depended on wars and raids.</p>
<p>We agree with the author on her stance that the process of Brahmanization of the goddess(es) had not yet begun in this region during the Sangam Age. There is no evidence in Sangam literature for any conscious attempt to associate Korravai with Durga during this period. This association has its beginnings in the post-Sangam period (c. 600–900 CE). The researcher raises two relevant questions in this regard:
<list id="list2-0257643013477267" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>When does a goddess get associated with sacred power?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is it possible to equate cultural representations of the goddess with those of women in general?</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The post-Sangam period was one of flux and transition, and integrative forces did not gain momentum. In fact, there was no single axis around which these developments could be consolidated. The texts throw light on epithets, mythic motifs and religious symbols related to goddesses, but these take shape within the patriarchal and burgeoning agrarian society in later centuries.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 draws upon literary sources, both sacred and secular (sixth to thirteenth century), to situate the manner in which goddess traditions are represented. Primary conceptualizations are on the basis of Puranic and Sakta traditions, while the texts of particular sites reveal the complex interweaving of Tamil traditions with Brahmanical ones. Historians look beyond the written text and strive to locate the context in which the texts were produced. The author has identified the processes of change in the Tamil region during the early medieval period. The Bhakti tradition did develop on sectarian lines with Maal and Siva as major subjects of devotion. Voluminous literature was produced with extensive use of Puranic myths and ideas. Even hymns were institutionalized in temple rituals during the tenth to thirteenth centuries.</p>
<p>The author readily admits that the goddess tradition(s) current in early historical Tamil traditions were not only appropriated but marginalized and reworked within the Saiva tradition. Champakalakshmi<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0257643013477267">2</xref></sup> has projected two major transformations as a result of the Bhakti movement:
<list id="list3-0257643013477267" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Vedic Brahmanical tradition was supplanted by Puranic ones and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Brahmadeya was superceded by the Temple as an institutional mechanism for integration.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The author has examined the continuities and transformations of the Goddess tradition during the phase (tenth to thirteenth century <sc>AD</sc>).</p>
<p>The Tamil Puranas carry the weight of both Sanskritic and Tamil traditions in relation to the goddess. The resolution was arrived at either through the medium of marriage or through displacement, thereby severing her association with her original cultic spot. The moot point to note is that the goddess tradition does not get eclipsed; the literary traditions carry forward the motifs for them to reappear in the religious culture from the twelfth century onwards. The theme of dance in Tamil Saiva hymns provides an example of the conflicts and contestation at work for cult assimilation in the Brahmanical tradition which the author has referred to in Chapter 6.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 is appropriately titled as ‘Inscribing the Goddess’. It is a study of inscriptional references to the goddess, from about the eighth century to the thirteenth century. Inscriptional data cannot suggest or answer questions like marginalization of female deities. At best, one can work out the nature of the gift and donors of the gift. The author counts at least 42 instances of land grants in honour of independent goddesses out of a total of 120 inscriptions related to such gifts.</p>
<p>Mahalakshmi admits that she gets an asymmetrical picture when one looks at the total number of images consecrated according to inscriptional record. She is also conscious about the limitations of the exercise undertaken when she offers the following comments:
<list id="list4-0257643013477267" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>‘There is a difference between two types of female deities, based on their dependence on male deities or the lack of it.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘Many more records can exist when a comparative survey is undertaken. The author is happy that the goddess is inscribed and not proscribed from the record.’</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In Chapter 4, the focus is on construction of shrines for goddesses. Was there a difference in the kinds of goddesses to whom temples were built across the time frame of Sangam to the Cholas? Structures meant for divine consorts appear only in the second half of the early medieval period. The author contends that shrines for independent female deities appear to be representative of the processes of appropriation, while the construction of temples for spouse goddesses was one of assimilation. Her engagement with issues of the origins of Kamakottam is to prove the fact that there was no permanent eclipse of the goddess tradition in the Tamil region. The author also grapples with the methodological issues connected with ‘appropriation’ and ‘assimilation’ in the process of integration. She takes the position that while there are indications for assimilative processes, the assimilations (?) were uneasy ones. She is positive in her statement that ‘the goddesses were recognized by the aspirants of political power, in terms of building shrines for the goddesses, as a means to gain legitimacy for themselves’ (p. 241). It is during the eleventh to thirteenth centuries that the ‘feminine sacred’ is recognized as a distinct entity within the Tamil Brahmanical tradition.</p>
<p>After accommodating the Goddess, the author proceeds to image the goddess in terms of iconography in stone and bronze. In this chapter, the author tries to locate spaces accorded to goddesses within the temple, the manner of their representation in particular niches and their conformity or divergence from prescriptive and sacred literary descriptions. The author maintains that in terms of conceptualization, the Saiva and Vaishnava temples were prejudiced in favour of male icons. Limited spaces were allotted to female deities. The exhaustive survey reiterates the author’s position that the goddess has been marginalized in iconographic representations also.</p>
<p>The most interesting chapter in the work is Chapter 6 titled ‘Dance as Metaphor. Siva vanquishes the Goddess’. ‘The importance of performative traditions in cultural transmission and their utility as a metaphor to cultivate meanings of dominance and subjugation is explored’ in this chapter (p. 38, ‘Introduction’). Narratives, both literary and visual, refer to the dance competition between Kaali and Siva. At the functional level, it is taken as the triumph of Siva over Kaali, and at another level it denotes cultic contestation. For the author, it harmonizes gendered difference. After all, dance and music were also institutionalized into daily rituals during this phase. The iconic development of Siva as a dancer, par excellence, got interwoven with the local tradition. The dance competition between the two deities is a crucial metaphor for the contestation of cults. The ‘victor’ in the dance contest is essentially the symbolic claim of cult superiority of one deity over the other. The author uses this metaphor to convey patriarchal notions of control of the male over the female, the social subjugation of the individual to the patriarchal family and temporal hegemonic influences of the regional identity over the locality. In the process, Korravai gets accommodated in the dominant Brahmanical narratives centreing around Siva and gets subordinated and marginalized.</p>
<p>The search for alternatives to academic histories is on. Academic history with ideological presuppositions, scientific methodology and debates is bound to be a corrective to such alternatives. The book under review is a good example of academic history from the pen of an industrious and talented researcher.</p>
<p>A couple of errors have crept in despite efficient copy-editing. For example, on Page 14, in the text KR Srinivasan is cited while Footnote 63 mentions Spencer instead of Srinivasan. On the whole, the book is well produced, readable and is indeed a good addition to goddess tradition studies.</p>
