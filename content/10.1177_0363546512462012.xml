<title>Background:</title>
<p>To date, no study has investigated the biomechanical consequences of glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD) at values seen in symptomatic athletes.</p>

<sec id="section2-0363546512462012">
<title>Hypothesis/Purpose:</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine the biomechanical changes that occur with a full spectrum of GIRD in a cadaveric model with passive loading.

<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Controlled laboratory study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512462012">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Six specimens were tested using the following conditions: (1) native state (“intact”); (2) after external rotation (ER) stretch (“stretched”); and (3) GIRD of 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%. For each condition, maximum ER, maximum internal rotation (IR), and total range of motion were measured. Kinematic data were obtained to determine the position of the humeral head apex (HHA), the highest point on the articular surface of the humeral head, relative to the geometric center of the glenoid. The amount of translation was measured in the anterior, posterior, superior, and inferior directions.</p>

<sec id="section5-0363546512462012">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>External rotation significantly increased compared with the intact condition for the stretched and 5% GIRD states, and IR decreased significantly beginning with 5% GIRD. At maximum ER, the HHA shifted significantly in the superior direction compared with the intact condition for all GIRD states, and at maximum IR, the HHA shifted significantly in the inferior direction compared with the intact and stretched conditions starting at 10% GIRD. The amount of posterior translation decreased significantly starting at 10% GIRD, and the amount of inferior translation decreased significantly starting at 20% GIRD.</p>

<p>Glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD) is a common finding in overhead athletes. However, this loss of internal rotation may or may not be pathological. In 2003, Burkhart et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512462012">4</xref></sup> defined an acceptable amount of GIRD as less than 20° or less than 10% of the total rotation seen in the contralateral shoulder. Recent studies have reported that throwers with GIRD of greater than 20° compared with their contralateral shoulder are at a greater risk for upper extremity injury,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512462012">29</xref></sup> and a 4-fold greater risk for injury has been reported in players with greater than 25° GIRD compared with those with smaller degrees of GIRD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512462012">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Multiple studies have postulated that GIRD is associated with undersurface rotator cuff tears, posterosuperior labral tears, and irreversible posterior capsular contracture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512462012">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512462012">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512462012">14</xref></sup> One clinical study found that there was a greater incidence of ulnar collateral ligament tears in overhead athletes with significant amounts of GIRD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512462012">8</xref></sup> Specifically, the investigators found that those athletes with ulnar collateral ligament tears had GIRD measuring 18.8% compared with GIRD of 8.8% in their asymptomatic counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512462012">8</xref></sup> Another clinical study showed greater amounts of GIRD in patients with symptomatic internal impingement (11%) compared with asymptomatic controls (6.2%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512462012">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Previous biomechanical studies have attempted to recreate GIRD in cadaveric models by creating a simulated posterior capsular contracture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512462012">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512462012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512462012">15</xref></sup> However, none of these studies created the degree of GIRD that is actually seen in patients with the condition. More precisely, the study that created the largest amount of GIRD in vitro achieved a value of only 7.0° or 4.6% of the total range of motion for the normal shoulder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512462012">10</xref></sup> This value is considerably less than the amount of GIRD in throwers with symptoms, which has been reported as greater than 20° or 11% compared with the nondominant contralateral shoulder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512462012">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512462012">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512462012">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512462012">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of this study was first, to create a cadaveric model that could recreate values of GIRD seen in throwers with pathologic conditions, and second, to test a full spectrum of glenohumeral internal rotation deficits to investigate what biomechanical changes occur. We hypothesized that there is a critical percentage of GIRD that will result in a decrease in posterior glenohumeral translation and shift of the humeral head apex at the extreme ranges of motion.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section9-0363546512462012">
<title>Specimens</title>
<p>Six fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulder specimens (5 male, 1 female; average age, 66.3 years; range, 51-84 years) were used for this experiment. All specimens were free of any underlying lesions. Each specimen was dissected free of all overlying soft tissue with the exception of the glenohumeral capsule, the coracoacromial ligament, and the rotator cuff tendon attachments. The humerus was cut 2 cm below the deltoid tuberosity and mounted in a polyvinyl chloride pipe with plaster of Paris. The scapula was also potted with plaster of Paris into a custom scapular box with the glenoid oriented parallel to the surface of the box. Three small screws were placed into both the scapula and the humerus to reproduce kinematic measurements throughout the trials. The 3 screws on the scapula were placed on the coracoid, anterior acromion, and posterior acromion. The 3 screws on the humerus were placed in line with the bicipital groove: 1 proximal, 1 distal, and 1 posterior to the second point.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512462012">17</xref></sup> The specimens were then mounted onto a custom shoulder testing system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0363546512462012">
<title>Shoulder Testing System</title>
<p>A custom shoulder testing system was created to measure humeral rotational range of motion, the position of the humeral head apex with rotational range of motion, and glenohumeral translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512462012">Figure 1</xref>). The specimens were mounted in 60° of glenohumeral abduction (corresponding to approximately 90° of humerothoracic abduction) in the scapular plane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512462012">16</xref></sup> The system allowed the humerus to rotate, and the humerus can be locked at varying degrees of humeral rotation.</p>

</fig>
<p>The base of the apparatus consisted of 2 translation plates that allowed translation in both the anterior-posterior and superior-inferior directions. Attached to these plates were screws for attaching ropes that led to individual pulleys for applying forces in the anterior, posterior, superior, and inferior directions. Before any testing, a 22-N compressive load was applied to the glenohumeral joint through the linear bearing system and lever arm attached to the top of the translation plate. Joint compression of a 22-N load has been shown to be an adequate force to consistently center the humerus in the glenoid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512462012">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512462012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512462012">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512462012">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512462012">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512462012">28</xref></sup> The glenohumeral joints were vented and lubricated with normal saline to be certain each condition was performed with a vented joint since the stretching or plication procedure may have vented the joint. Each specimen was tested under sequential conditions of “intact,” “stretched” (to simulate increased external rotation seen in throwers), and 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% GIRD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0363546512462012">
<title>Glenohumeral Rotational Range of Motion</title>
<p>Before the total range of motion was measured of each specimen, the neutral position was determined by drawing a line 12 mm posterior to the bicipital groove and aligning this line so that it was at the most lateral position relative to the scapula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512462012">9</xref></sup> After the specimens were preconditioned with 1.1 N·m of torque for 7 cycles in the external and internal rotation directions, maximum external rotation was measured using a torque wrench with 1.1 N·m of torque. This amount of torque was adequate to reproduce a consistent end point of rotation while being small enough not to cause capsular damage. In a similar manner, maximum internal rotation was then measured. Each measurement was repeated to ensure reproducibility within 2°. The values of maximum internal and external rotation were then used to calculate the total intact range of motion of the specimen.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0363546512462012">
<title>Humeral Head Apex Position</title>
<p>The Microscribe 3DLX (Revware Inc, Raleigh, North Carolina) was used to take kinematic measurements by digitizing the positioning screws on both the scapula and humerus as the humerus was rotated from maximum external rotation to maximum internal rotation at 30° intervals. The entire process was repeated for a second trial to confirm repeatability to a value of 1 mm. If the difference between the 2 trials was greater than 1 mm, a third trial was repeated and the averages of the closest 2 trials were used. To calculate the position of the humeral head apex, the specimens were disarticulated after testing and the articulating surfaces of both the glenoid and the humerus were digitized relative to the kinematic measuring screws digitized throughout testing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512462012">17</xref></sup> Coordinate transformations were then performed to calculate the humeral head apex position relative to the geometric center of the glenoid during testing based on the position of the 3 reference screws on the humerus and scapula.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0363546512462012">
<title>Glenohumeral Translation</title>
<p>The humerus was then locked at neutral rotation to measure glenohumeral translation. After the specimen was preconditioned 7 times in each direction with 10 N of translation force, the pulleys were used to apply a force of 10 N. The amount of translation that occurred was recorded for 2 trials using the Microscribe 3DLX. The translation in each direction was calculated as the difference from the humeral head position with the humeral head centered on the glenoid and the humeral head position with respect to the glenoid with translational load applied in the anterior, posterior, superior, and inferior directions. The center position was digitized before each translational loading. The entire process was then repeated with a force of 15 N in each direction. These translational loads were adequate to translate the humeral head to its end point as determined by the capsular laxity based on the amount of compressive load applied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512462012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512462012">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512462012">23</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0363546512462012">
<title>Increased External Rotation (Stretched Condition)</title>
<p>Because throwers’ shoulders commonly have an increase in external rotation combined with a decrease in internal rotation, the capsule was stretched in external rotation. For calculation of the “stretched” condition, a value that corresponded with a 30% increase in maximum external rotation was determined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512462012">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512462012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512462012">15</xref></sup> To create this condition, the anterior capsule was stretched in external rotation after the glenohumeral joint was placed in maximum external rotation and the translation plates were locked. The stretching protocol was based on previous studies in our laboratory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512462012">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512462012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512462012">15</xref></sup> Next, 3.3 N·m of torque was applied for 1 minute, and then all torque was released for 30 seconds. Torque was increased by 1.1 N·m every minute until the 30% goal or 75 N·m of torque was reached. Previous studies have shown that increasing torque beyond this point increases the possibility of rupturing the capsule.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512462012">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512462012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512462012">15</xref></sup> This final external rotation position was then locked for 45 minutes. When the anterior capsule was stretched to 30%, an increased torque above the measurement value (1.1 N·m) was required to achieve the stretch. After the stretch was released and the range of motion was measured with 1.1 N·m, the increase in external rotation was similar to that reported clinically in throwers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512462012">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512462012">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512462012">29</xref></sup> After release, the total rotational range of motion, humeral head position, and glenohumeral translation were measured as described above for the intact condition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0363546512462012">
<title>Glenohumeral Internal Rotation Deficit Conditions</title>
<p>The total range of motion measured for the intact specimen before stretching was used to calculate the amount of internal rotation deficit needed for each GIRD condition. This was specifically done by determining how many degrees of rotation would need to be lost to decrease the total range of motion by 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%. The maximum internal rotation of the specimen was then subtracted by each of these values to determine the new value of maximum internal rotation needed for each GIRD condition.</p>
<p>Before the posteroinferior plication was performed, the length and width of the glenoid face were measured with digital calipers. This measurement was done by distracting the glenohumeral joint so that the glenoid rim could be palpated. The measurements were taken extra-articularly so that the thickness of the capsule was included in the measurement; however, since the goal was to determine the midpoint of both the length and width, the capsular thickness would not have affected this measurement. Each measurement was then divided in half to determine what would correspond to the 6-o’clock and 9-o’clock positions on the glenoid face (in a right shoulder). These points were then marked on the capsule at the glenoid edge with a fine-tipped marker and served to define the limits of the plication. A 0-monofilament suture was then placed in a running fashion from the 6-o’clock to the 9-o’clock position using 3 suture loops grasping the entire capsule from the glenoid edge to its attachment on the humerus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512462012">Figure 2</xref>). While this was done, some of the residual posterior rotator cuff attachment was included in the plication because it could not feasibly be separated from the capsule without compromising its integrity. The 2 ends of the suture were then tied with a single surgeon’s knot that could be held securely with an atraumatic hemostat clamp. The suture was secured with the clamp at the position of internal rotation achieved with a torque of 1.1 N·m that corresponded with the desired GIRD condition. The maximum internal rotation was then measured to confirm the correct amount of tensioning. If the internal rotation measurement was not at the desired level, the clamp was released and the suture was retightened. After this, the total rotational range of motion, humeral head position, and glenohumeral translation were measured as described above.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0363546512462012-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>After completion of the 5% GIRD condition, the clamp securing the plication stitch was released. The suture was then tightened and secured with the clamp again after the amount of internal rotation loss that corresponded with the 10% GIRD condition was achieved. This technique was used because pilot testing in which the specimens were resutured after each GIRD condition resulted in variable and inconsistent data. Using the same stitch with increasing levels of tightening resulted in consistently reproducible data. The biomechanical measurements described above were then taken for this GIRD condition. The process was repeated in the exact manner for the 15% and 20% GIRD conditions.</p>

<title>Glenohumeral Translation</title>
<p>There was significantly less posterior translation compared with the intact and stretched conditions beginning with 10% GIRD for both the 10-N and 15-N forces (4.4 ± 1.6 mm [<italic>P</italic> = .013] and 3.9 ± 1.6 mm [<italic>P</italic> = .036], respectively, vs intact) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546512462012">Figure 5</xref>). There was no significant change in anterior translation for any GIRD value or any force. In the superior-inferior direction, there was significantly less inferior translation starting with 20% GIRD compared with both the intact and stretched conditions for both the 10-N and 15-N forces (6.0 ± 2.6 mm [<italic>P</italic> = .015] and 5.1 ± 2.4 mm [<italic>P</italic> = .027], respectively, vs intact) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0363546512462012">Figure 6</xref>). There was no difference in superior translation for any condition.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that biomechanical changes occur in the glenohumeral joint with as little as 5% GIRD due to posterior capsule contracture. As the amount of GIRD is increased, more biomechanical changes become apparent. Specifically, the humeral head apex position shifted in the end range of motion and posterior and inferior translation decreased with increasing values of GIRD.</p>
<p>Multiple studies have shown that overhead athletes have a shift in their overall rotational range of motion compared with their nondominant arm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512462012">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512462012">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512462012">19</xref></sup> Specifically, there is an increase of maximum external rotation with a corresponding decrease in maximum internal rotation. It is for this reason that the stretched condition (to increase external rotation) was included in this experiment. Interestingly, the 5% GIRD condition in this experiment replicated the exact phenomenon where the maximum external rotation was increased, the maximum internal rotation was decreased, and the overall total range of motion was similar to intact. When this state was compared with the other GIRD conditions, there were biomechanical changes starting at 15% GIRD. Therefore, if one believes that the usual shift of motion in throwers is a normal adaptation, then the clinician may be concerned when the athlete is demonstrating 15% or greater GIRD.</p>
<p>It is uncertain whether this changed rotational range of motion profile is due to soft tissue changes, bony adaptations, or some combination thereof.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512462012">2</xref></sup> Multiple magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that symptomatic throwers have anatomic changes, such as thicker labrums, shallower capsular recesses, and thicker posteroinferior capsules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512462012">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512462012">27</xref></sup> Throwers have also been shown to have osseous adaptations that contribute to the shift in throwing arc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512462012">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512462012">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512462012">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512462012">30</xref></sup> Recent findings have suggested that if differences in humeral torsion are accounted for, minimal differences exist between the rotational arc in healthy shoulders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512462012">20</xref></sup> Several studies have shown that internal rotation stretching or even arthroscopic posterior capsular release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512462012">31</xref></sup> can decrease the amount of internal rotation deficit seen in throwers, giving evidence that the soft tissues are the main culprit behind GIRD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512462012">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512462012">18</xref></sup> Considering these observations, we thought that a plication of the soft tissues would be a reasonable model of recreating GIRD.</p>
<p>Previous studies have attempted to replicate internal rotation deficits in cadaveric models, but the amount of GIRD that was created was well below what is seen clinically even in asymptomatic throwers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512462012">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512462012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512462012">15</xref></sup> Several biomechanical studies have shown changes in translations of the humeral head with selective tightening of the posterior capsule. Harryman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512462012">13</xref></sup> found that operative tightening of the posterior capsule led to superior translation of the humeral head with flexion of the glenohumeral joint. Gerber et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512462012">11</xref></sup> found that creating a plication of the entire posteroinferior capsule resulted in reductions in internal rotation at all angles of abduction but did not affect external rotation. However, these studies tested only 1 posterior capsule plication condition and did not look at multiple plications in the same specimen.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to our study. First, as with most cadaveric studies, individual muscles about the shoulder were not loaded during this experiment. Therefore, the effect of the GIRD conditions may have been magnified because the potential protective effect of muscle loading was not reproduced. Also muscular changes have been reported with repetitive loading, specifically increasing cross-sectional area of the infraspinatus with external rotator contractions, that could affect range of motion measurement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512462012">22</xref></sup> Second, our plication technique, which encompassed the posteroinferior capsule from 6-o’clock to 9-o’clock, may also simulate a more generous area of posterior capsule contracture than actually occurs in vivo. Future studies may attempt to plicate just the posterior band of the inferior glenohumeral ligament. Third, since our posterior capsule plication involved the inferior capsule, we also saw decreases in external rotation; however, the maximum external rotation was larger than intact for each condition even though it was only statistically higher for the 5% GIRD condition. We would expect to see larger increases in external rotation with a greater amount of stretching; however, further stretching would have risked capsular rupture. Fourth, testing was performed in only 1 position that corresponded to 90° of abduction in the scapular plane. Several studies have shown that throwers actually have a more pronounced posterior arm position when in the late cocking position. If we had incorporated horizontal abduction, our results may have been affected. Finally, although we tried to recreate an adequate GIRD model, cadaveric studies may not demonstrate all of the changes that are present, including muscular and osseous adaptations, and these results need to be interpreted with caution.</p>
<p>This study adds to our biomechanical understanding of the glenohumeral changes that occur with increasing amounts of glenohumeral internal rotation deficit. Biomechanical changes in passive glenohumeral joint motion were seen with as little as 5% GIRD in this cadaveric model, and as the amount of GIRD increases, more substantial effects are noted.</p>
