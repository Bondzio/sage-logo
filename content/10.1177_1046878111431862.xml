<abstract>
<p>Born in The Hague in 1946, the author has been interested in simulation and gaming since he was 12 years old. Simulations, particularly the role-play type, were then, and still are, fun for the author. He used them for recreation, to replay history and practice strategy and tactics, to enjoy politics and journalism, and to interact with friends and foes. He was inspired to use simulation exercises as a training tool for educational purposes all over the world. Could the history and the history-to-come of a human being, and his or her vision of the real and imaginary worlds, be described in stages like in world history? The author attempts to do so in this contribution to <italic>Simulation &amp; Gaming</italic>. His life has always been intertwined with reality and fiction alike, and has passed through certain stages, so it might be of help to sketch it through the metaphor of human history. After all, the history and politics of humankind were his main motivations for creating simulation games to teach others, as well as himself.</p>

<p>This autobiography and my ideas concerning simulation exercises and negotiation processes are sequenced according to humankind’s history. This may seem arrogant, but I like to look at each person’s past, present, and prospects as if they are a minishadow of our overarching history—as if history consists of a multitude of personal histories, which is probably true. I therefore start with my most distant past, the oldest layers. As in prehistory itself, mankind’s first steps are shrouded in fog: Tales and artifacts came to us, but no written accounts. This has, of course, also been the hallmark of those early days in which I was conceived and the daylight thereafter. These early times have a decisive impact on a human being. They reveal the earliest traces—perhaps the roots—of my fascination with representations of reality, which we may call the role-play variant of simulation games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1046878111431862">Crookall, Oxford, &amp; Saunders, 1987</xref>). Here I mean role-play in a broad sense: from one sole actor to a limited number, to quite a big group of people. Let the games begin.</p>

<title>Pre- and Protohistory</title>
<p>I was born in the shadow of the World War II and amid high hopes for freedom on September 5, 1946, in the city of The Hague in the Netherlands, in a small hospital that is now the Embassy of Nigeria, a good start for a trainer in diplomatic negotiation. I spent my first 24 years on the outskirts of The Hague in a seaside resort on the North Sea with beaches for tourists and a harbor for fishermen, building sand castles on the shores of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Although the war had ended, these postwar years were sober times. A severe shortage of everything continued, from blankets to baby food, from bread to butter.</p>
<p>My Catholic father and Jewish mother had been in hiding for most of the war, hunted by the Germans. Is it then a coincidence that I became so interested, not only in history and politics, but in war as well, that I started to collect toy soldiers when I was 10? Did I still want to defend myself against a war in which I had been indirectly participating? As we will later see, these toy soldiers are of importance to my story. They stimulated the creation of simulated worlds, which gave birth to the simulation exercises that I currently use in training students and professionals.</p>
<p>In my first decade (1946-1956), the seeds of the future were sown. This is, of course, the case with everybody; nothing new exists here. The average child, however, limits its playground to the first decade and a bit beyond. After that, a child transforms its need for play into sports and other games. Legitimate games are played, but no child’s play. For me, however, the world was my playground, and in a way, it still is. The trick is to create your own space, within the frame that is set by the context of the society in which you are living. Some tough lessons were to be learned. To learn or not to learn, without forgetting your own heritage, that is the question.</p>
<graphic position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_1046878111431862-img2.tif"/>

<sec id="section2-1046878111431862">
<title>Ancient Times</title>
<p>Being intrigued by history and geography—my imagination being stimulated by heroic accounts like <italic>The Iliad</italic> and <italic>The Odyssey</italic>—I decided that my toy soldiers needed a historical and geographic context. I concluded that an army needs a country, and a country should be put on the map. It is possible to use existing maps, thus coming as close to reality as possible, but hence also restricted by it. If simulation looks too much like reality, the space for fantasy and creativity will be limited, to the extent that simulation will lose its function of providing escapism. It therefore makes sense to invent your own world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1046878111431862">Crookall et al., 1987</xref>). We could also call this <italic>l’art pour l’art.</italic> The simulation’s first objective was not to learn about reality, but to transform realities into a context that could be handled. It enhanced my insight into the mechanisms of history, culture, society, politics, and human behavior.</p>
<graphic position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_1046878111431862-img3.tif"/>
<p>Today, we have a word for this—geofiction—meaning a simulation process that is based on, and limited by, a map of a fictitious country or nonexisting world. It should be noted that this is not quite equal to role-play in the sense of interaction between at least two people. My preferred simulations were collective undertakings, but many other <italic>simulants</italic> or <italic>geofictici</italic> are loners. Their role-play is inner role-play, individual role-play. Moreover, geofiction maps are not enough; a country needs structure, a political system, and a society, and provides opportunities for artistic expressions. Today, we call that <italic>second life</italic>, but no word existed for it in the late 1950s during my second decade (1956-1966).</p>
<p>In order to understand history, I decided to recreate it in my own way. I therefore founded and built a city, the Greek/Roman city of Itca, on January 28, 1958. The city became a city-state, the city-state a kingdom, and the kingdom an empire. Others built their own states around this empire and created their own barbaric tribes, resulting in warfare and diplomatic conspiracies. The simulation became a true role-play in which participants’ actions gave rise to a real evolution of history, although translated into simulated jargon. In other words, history was not made up; things really happened, but they were translated into the context of a simulated world.</p>
<p>A recreational—not an educational—simulation arose (the latter would come much later). Friends founded neighboring fiefdoms, some of which could be regarded as allies and others as foes. Battles were fought, diplomacy was invented. As time passed by, diplomacy became more important than warfare, and the armies of toy soldiers gradually lost their importance: Even in a geofictitious world, you cannot, and should not, always fight. Although war makes states and states make war, war sucks the energy that is needed to build up the state. More importantly, in the long run, war endangers stability and the survival of state and society. The day might come when all neighboring countries unite against the hegemonic power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1046878111431862">Morgenthau, 1948</xref>).</p>
<graphic position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_1046878111431862-img4.tif"/>
<p>Simulation, then, is a nice way to learn about diplomacy and statecraft. During the late 1960s, politics started to fascinate me much more than military strategies. A link probably exists here with political and societal developments in the real word: the peace movements that were gaining momentum and the flower-power hype of the late 1960s and early 1970s. My figurines became collector’s items and are still admired today in a cupboard. These kinds of exhibitions are not unusual. Several museums exist in Europe with huge collections of miniature soldiers. Another remnant of that time is an outdoor brick <italic>city</italic> in a forest; in Europe that is not unusual either. Noble people often had a real-life-sized replica like that; they called it a folly.</p>
<p>A huge advantage of transforming a simulated world based on material assets (soldiers, palaces, houses, boats, and walls) into a nonmaterialistic simulation is certainly the reduction of costs and, thereby, a substantial lowering of the threshold for participation. Friends and foes wanted to participate in the simulated worlds of “Itchan” (Itchan Archive; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1046878111431862">Meerts, 1958-2008</xref>), but only a handful could bear the costs. Or better, they had other priorities as far as spending their money was concerned. This is why my second decade evolved into my third by reframing my simulated world into a <italic>paper reality</italic> of maps, constitutions, and journals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1046878111431862">
<title>Middle Ages</title>
<p>Maps of countries and cities, historiographical overviews and historical accounts, constitutions and state regulations, national and international laws, and newspapers and spoken news—these now dominated my scene, and many new people joined in my third decade (from 1966 to 1976). As noted before, this stage matched well with the roaring 1960s and 1970s, already sowing the seeds of educational simulation that was to follow a decade later.</p>
<graphic position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_1046878111431862-img5.tif"/>
<p>Interestingly enough, this outburst of <italic>simul-energy</italic>—which in due course resulted in worlds like <italic>simulantis</italic> and <italic>simultania</italic>—ran parallel to an upsurge of politics in the real world. The revolutions of 1968 and the creation of new political parties had an impact on the recreational simulations that were running in my parallel universes. This offered a dual opportunity for me, and I plunged myself into the new political movements in the Netherlands, while organizing scores of conferences in the real and simulated worlds. Congresses became the mainstay of my simulated interactive policy systems, contributing to intense interaction between the real and the simulated actors. The real world inevitably grew in importance, as not only politics, but also university life and the creation of a family of my own—with children—had its impact on my third decade. At the same time, my personal interest in the subject of my simulations changed from Greek-Roman to Mongol-Turkish cultures. Reality and simulation went hand in hand—I studied political science from 1967 until 1973—but it could already be foreseen that reality would come to overshadow fiction at the end of my third decade.</p>
<p>Simulation can only be understood in, and by, the world that it simulates. The two are irrevocably intertwined. If a simulation wants to be of value, the connection with real life is vital. Only this interrelationship gives value to the simulation exercise. Reality reflects on simulation, but the reverse happens as well, as I learned much later, when my simulation game CRISIS IN YUGOSLAVIA (written in 1983) sparked political upheaval at the NATO Defense College in Rome.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1046878111431862">
<title>Renaissance</title>
<p>My fourth decade (1976-1986) brought many changes, and can be characterized as a <italic>coming out</italic>, for recreational and educational simulation. I helped to create two clubs dealing with games and fiction. The first one was called the Dutch Conflict and Simulation Association (Ducosim, <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ducosim.nl">www.ducosim.nl</ext-link></italic>). This war-game society still exists and grew from a dozen people to more than 1,000 members. My interest was very much in the famous game of DIPLOMACY, and I organized (and won) its first Dutch championship in 1977. Becoming champion was not very surprising, as I had been the only player who really mastered the rules; other participants learned about them for the first time and had to play right away. I ran the club’s journal for 5 years and used this opportunity to build new simulated worlds with many new people participating.</p>
<graphic position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_1046878111431862-img6.tif"/>
<p>Soon after the war-game wave, a <italic>geo-wave</italic> arose. It started with an exhibition in Rotterdam on <italic>Imaginary Countries</italic>. In its slipstream, a new club was founded at the beginning of the 1980s. It was called the <italic>Genootschap voor Geofictie</italic> (Society for Geofiction, <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geofictie.nl">www.geofictie.nl</ext-link></italic>), and de facto its purpose came much closer to my parallel worlds, and we soon merged activities. The foci of the participating human beings (the real ones, the marionette players) were too individualistic for my taste. Everybody had his or her own country. It took me a while to convince the others of the value of simulated interaction, but in the mid-1980s we were on the road with worlds like <italic>Geoforum, Geopolis</italic>, and <italic>Pangeo</italic>.</p>
<p>My fourth decade also coincided with my first opportunity to use simulations in a professional way. The Netherlands Society for International Relations (<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ngiz.nl">www.ngiz.nl</ext-link></italic>) was looking for a coordinator to run its course for the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to be concluded by a simulation game. This gave me the opportunity to professionalize both of these role-plays as well as myself. Opportunities widened with the merger of the Society into a new organization, the Netherlands Institute of International Relations Clingendael, which provided research and training opportunities for academics and diplomats from all over the world (<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clingendael.nl">www.clingendael.nl</ext-link></italic>).</p>
<graphic position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_1046878111431862-img7.tif"/>
<p>For training purposes, simulation games are of course an ideal tool to teach the content and process of international conferences. I started by adding new games to the one that we already used. The characteristics of the authentic game were its topical and ever-adapting nature. The game followed reality bit-by-bit; any change in reality led to alterations in the game. This is ideal for understanding substance, but it does not help much in understanding process. I, therefore, started to write games that would be less connected to day-to-day politics. Becoming more interested in processes, the phenomenon of negotiation came to the fore.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1046878111431862">
<title>Modern Times</title>
<p>During my fifth decade (1986-1996), my recreational simulations were pushed into the background by the educational simulations, and these in turn were subordinated to the idea that games can only be a viable learning tool if they are used in a wider setting—the framework of negotiation processes. Moreover, as my simulations were about states, the setting became diplomatic or, more precisely, interstate bargaining. Coming out became going out, as two new developments pushed me into the networks of the real world—first, my admission in 1985 to the International Forum on Diplomatic Training (IFDT) and second, my participation in the Conference on the Processes of International Negotiation (PIN) in 1989. Both meetings were in Vienna, and both were conceived in the 1970s as attempts to bridge the East-West divide.</p>
<graphic position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_1046878111431862-img8.tif"/>
<p>From 1989 onward, I delivered seminars on international negotiation through the IFDT network of the Diplomatic Academies (<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.da-vienna.ac.at">www.da-vienna.ac.at</ext-link></italic>), supported by the knowledge that I gathered in the context of the PIN Program of the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA, <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.iiasa.ac.at">www.iiasa.ac.at</ext-link></italic>). This offered an opportunity to spread my simulation exercises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1046878111431862">Klabbers, Schepers, Takkenberg, &amp; Crookall, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1046878111431862">Kremenyuk, 1991 &amp; 2001</xref>) and my ideas about them throughout the real world, delivering seminars and workshops in more than 90 countries on all continents, although mainly in Eurasia.</p>
<p>My sixth decade (1996-2006) was a continuation of the preceding decade, with even more emphasis on aspects of negotiation. In 1999, the PIN Steering Committee asked me to join them, as they had no trainer in their midst. This forced me to publish more on negotiation at the expense of publications on simulation and training. However, more thorough and academic insights in negotiation processes stimulated my direct colleagues and me at Clingendael to discover new pathways. New simulation exercises were invented, such as the one on the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization (the UNDRO GAME; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1046878111431862">Bercovitch, Kremenyuk, &amp; Zartman, 2008</xref>). A simulated UN conference on the basis of its real documents, it was also connected to a film of these negotiations, <italic>Space Between Words</italic>, the only film of a real multilateral negotiation process.</p>
<p>Another invention was the so-called PENTAGAME, a quite revolutionary minilateral negotiation among five countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1046878111431862">Bercovitch et al., 2008</xref>). The original PENTAGAME involved a European Council Working Group meeting, but variations were soon created on the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the Caspian Sea, and the future of Kosovo and Afghanistan. Later on, others transformed them into HEXAGAMES, which are more and more widely used now, as I sometimes notice with new groups, which have already experienced a game run by a Mr. X, who seemingly got it from a Mrs. Y, both of whom are completely unknown to me.</p>
<graphic position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_1046878111431862-img9.tif"/>
<p>What happened to my recreational simulations? Not much can be said about them. My sixth decade saw a revival of the old format on a simulated continent called <italic>Itchanea</italic>, as my youngest son became interested in replaying history. He seemed to be an excellent negotiator, collecting as many points in the Afghan game as all four other players combined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1046878111431862">
<title>Postmodern Times</title>
<p>I formally put an end to my recreational simulations on January 28, 2008. An exhibition of 50 years of fictitious developments brought many of my old friends together, and with this the <italic>Itchan Archives</italic> were finalized. In 2006, I ceased to be deputy director of the Clingendael Institute. The extra time gave me an opportunity to focus solely on negotiation processes for my remaining time at Clingendael until 2011. I am continuing my quest around the world to preach the <italic>nego-gospel</italic>, for example, as a guest professor at the College of Europe in Bruges, the University of Economics in Prague (Czech Republic), and the Technical University in Delft (the Netherlands).</p>
<graphic position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_1046878111431862-img10.tif"/>
<p>Simulations and games are now well accepted, in professional as well as in private life. However, what is their academic status in research and training? What is the position of international negotiation processes in the curricula on international relations in this world? They made it onto the academic curricula in the United States, but in Europe, negotiation has not really been recognized as a viable part of political science. Since the beginning of my seventh decade, I have hence tried to put simulation and negotiation on the academic map, as a subject of research and of education, shifting my attention more and more from training professionals to educating university students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1046878111431862">
<title>Simulation and Negotiation</title>
<p>What is a good simulation exercise? My answer would be one that is easy to understand and interesting to play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1046878111431862">Armstrong, Percival, &amp; Saunders, 1994</xref>). The structure of the game should be relatively simple. In order to understand easily the context and the mechanics of the game, it is helpful to work with a subject that participants know something about. In other words, although it can be helpful to simulate fantasy countries such as <italic>Spokania</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1046878111431862">Tweehuysen, 1982</xref>), <italic>Slaka</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1046878111431862">Bradbury, 1986</xref>), <italic>Turghanista</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1046878111431862">Meerts, 1992</xref>), or <italic>Molvania</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1046878111431862">Cilauro, Gleisner, &amp; Sitch, 2003</xref>), it seems to me more useful to take real countries as the basis for simulation exercises if learning about procedures, processes, people, and products are to go hand in hand.</p>
<graphic position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_1046878111431862-img11.tif"/>
<p>Simulations are, to me, exercises of some complexity and duration. Ideally, they should be the pinnacle of a series of shorter exercises that train specific skills such as strategy and tactics, distributive and integrative bargaining, dealing with trust and risk, managing complexity and a lack of transparency, power and persons, and so on. Together, they will have to be blended into a setting with introductions, debriefings, and, if needed, coaching as they go along. It is, of course, important to look at the target group. Although young diplomats love to play games, ambassadors might see it as a threat to their ego (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1046878111431862">Meerts, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The most interesting groups are the most challenging ones, such as groups from North Africa, the Middle East, the Balkans, the Caucasus, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia. They are not always used to this kind of interaction and therefore experience the game in a very intense and sometimes emotional way. This is a real challenge for trainers. However, some game facilitators love tension and theater, and like to be on stage. An important question is, of course, what participants will take home from training. Some are quite pessimistic about the ability of simulation and gaming to change people’s behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1046878111431862">Movius, 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, many, including myself, are convinced that interactive learning does have a greater impact on people than static lecturing.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>During the first half of my life, simulation and gaming helped me to get to grips with reality, and in the second half, they served to help others to understand their reality. My kind of recreational and educational creations can be labeled as role-plays, although some people have called them works of art. Simulation can be a tool to enhance understanding through a detour. If direct confrontation creates too much denial and defensiveness, the metaphor of simulation might help protagonists to open up and understand. This presumes a certain link between reality and fiction, as otherwise the learning process will not be of much value.</p>
<graphic position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_1046878111431862-img14.tif"/>
<p>In an ideal world, trainers would learn from reality through observation, but especially in negotiation, this is hardly possible. Academics thus use student groups as a laboratory. Although this is a reasonable alternative, reality is different of course. Academics try to capture reality in theories, but reality is still different, although nothing is more practical than a good theory. Theoreticians try to learn from practitioners, but practitioners are often unaware of what they do. You need some distance from the process in order to analyze it.</p>
<p>Simulation exercises can partly solve these problems—a self-created reality that can be observed, analyzed, learned from, and practiced. In order to be attractive, however, they also have to be artistic. How to be a trainer can be learned, but some talent is also needed. Rembrandt had to teach himself painting techniques, but learning these techniques does not make me a Rembrandt. Far from being as glorious as Rembrandt, my greatest moment as a <italic>simulant</italic> came in 2001, when my Mongolian academic colleagues dressed me up as a Mongol in order to receive a (real) honorary doctorate from the National University of Mongolia in Ulan Bator. That was not a simulation, but it looked like it.</p>
