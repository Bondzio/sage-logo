<abstract>
<p>A combination of computational and imaging tools was developed to characterise the performance and assess the lifetime of flare tips, the top portion of stacks used to burn off excess gas in the gas and petroleum industry. Integrating the use of (1) an infrared imaging study to obtain temperature profiles of flare tips in operation and (2) finite element modelling of stress distributions based on temperature profiles allowed lifetime prediction for creep and fatigue failure. The techniques were successfully applied to a complex flare tip design that included a venturi shaped windshield. It was concluded that in this instance, the flare tip lifetime would be limited by a combination of creep and fatigue of the support brackets and by plastic deformation at the top of the windshield. Design methodologies for producing flare tips with improved lifetimes are suggested, including the use of computational fluid dynamics modelling to assess the combined effects of gas flow rates and wind conditions on combustion behaviour. Thus, the prediction prior to installation, of both the performance of a new design and the long-term behaviour, can be a valuable assessment process for a proposed flare tip assembly.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Oil and gas platforms, refineries and chemical plants need to burn off excess gas that may result from pressure variations during processing operations. Flare tips are designed to produce a vertical flame standing above the stack at high gas flow rates. However, operational conditions may vary considerably, and at low gas flow rates, especially with a strong prevailing wind, external burning with flame impingement on the outer surface of the flare tip is a common feature. Many attempts have been made to increase the service lifetime of flare tips by changing the design and with the use of more corrosion and heat resistant alloys, but these changes have given mostly marginal improvements. The alloys have changed from stainless steel 310 and other steels to higher nickel and chromium containing alloys such as the 800 alloys, alloy 625 and alloy RA333<sup>®</sup>. These changes have resulted in some improvement,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309324712464921">1</xref></sup> but unpredictable flare tip failures still occur, as described by Fox et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309324712464921">2</xref></sup> Failure may be catastrophic and can occur at apparently random operating times, requiring an unscheduled replacement. While the cost of a planned replacement may be relatively small (∼£100,000 or less), an unscheduled replacement requires the use of helicopters and the loss of up to 4 days of gas and oil production. The cost of replacing the Fulmar flare tip in 2004 was reported to have been around £9 million (Fox et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309324712464921">2</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>Examples of failures are many and varied, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0309324712464921">Figure 1</xref>, with flare tips taken from offshore oil and gas installations in the North Sea. Failure mechanisms have been reported to be thermal fatigue, corrosion, stress-assisted oxidation and creep. Thermal fatigue, the repeated stress exerted on the flare tip during heating and cooling, is thought to be the main cause of failure. In the presence of wind and at low gas flow rates, flame impingement on one side of the flare tip can create large temperature gradients causing thermal stress. To quantify the levels of stress formed as a result of the temperature gradients, it is essential to know the temperatures of the flare tip during different operating modes.</p>

<p>This study has focussed on developing a new methodology to evaluate flare tip performance prior to manufacture and installation. This methodology was then applied to a new design that was recently installed at an onshore gas processing facility. The design incorporated a venturi shaped windshield aimed to provide cleaner combustion and less smoke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0309324712464921">Figure 2</xref>). The windshield was welded to the top of the main gas stack at four points via support brackets; the windshield and stack were made of alloy 625, with the lower sections of the stack made of alloy 310. Variations on this design were installed at three further onshore gas facilities in North Holland and Portugal. Two of these installations had shown worrying levels of flame impingement while flaring at low gas flow rates.</p>

<p>Finite element modelling (FEM) is widely used to determine thermal stress distribution in structures. Gao et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309324712464921">3</xref></sup> have used this method by coupling temperature and stress fields and applying a frictional heat flux in transient stress analysis to identify the source of thermal fatigue in disc brakes. Deng<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309324712464921">4</xref></sup> used a numerical model that coupled thermal and mechanical stresses in three-dimensional (3D), but then went one step further by considering metallurgical effects such as the effect of volume change due to the austenite–martensite phase transformation on residual stress and welding distortion. Deng concluded that the martensitic transformation significantly increased residual stress and welding distortion in a medium carbon steel. Wada et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309324712464921">5</xref></sup> have studied the thermal expansion in elastic and multi-plastic layers of Cu/Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/Cu in cyclic thermal loading conditions. They assumed that Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio of the materials were constant, but considered temperature-dependent thermal expansion coefficients, and cycled the material between 200 °C and −40 °C. They claimed that their model accurately predicted the thermal expansion coefficient of layered structures within 1 ppm/°C. Kim et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309324712464921">6</xref></sup> investigated the effect of high thermal stress on fatigue and creep of an aircraft duct flange using FEM and have confirmed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) findings that had suggested a build up of cyclic thermal stress due to flange constraints. The use of FEM in failure analysis is commonplace in the aerospace industry,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309324712464921">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309324712464921"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309324712464921"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309324712464921">9</xref></sup> but to the authors’ knowledge has not been applied in open literature for flare tips. Previous studies on flare tips have examined the presence of periodic flow instability leading to combustion-driven oscillation of the flame and the subsequent effect on sound levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309324712464921">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309324712464921">11</xref></sup> Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies conducted by John Zink Co., a manufacturer of refractory burners, thermal oxidisers and combustion flares, has mainly centred on applications for fired heaters and incinerators, with little consideration for the effect of temperatures on mechanical integrity, and though the authors suggest that the method might be extended to flare systems,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309324712464921">12</xref></sup> no such study has been published.</p>
<p>This is the first study to consider the effect of operating temperatures on the mechanical integrity of a flare tip. To enable this, temperature distributions across the windshield, support brackets and stack were required. This was done using infrared (IR) thermal imaging. The data obtained from thermal imaging were then used to perform a stress analysis study using ABAQUS<sup>©</sup> FEM software version 6.7-1 (Dassault Systémes, Villacoublay, France). A combination of IR and stress analysis was then used to predict the lifetime, before failure from creep or thermal fatigue.</p>

<title>Thermal imaging</title>
<p>IR thermal imaging was used to measure the temperature gradients both across and down the flare tip. A forward looking infrared (FLIR) thermal imaging camera (P640 series, Thermascan Ltd, Bedford, UK), with a 7° lens was used. The camera was able to record a temperature range of 300 °C–1500 °C, with a reported accuracy of ±2%. The camera had been calibrated against a reference black body over a temperature range of 0 °C–1000 °C prior to imaging.</p>
<p>IR thermal imaging is a technique that is sensitive to reflections, emissivity, and to a lesser extent atmospheric humidity. To avoid interference from the flame, flaring was maintained at a fixed gas flow rate until alloy temperatures had stabilised (5 min) and imaging commenced for 18 s immediately after the flare was turned off. Estimating the emissivity of the metal surfaces was also crucial. Calibration was performed by comparing the adjacent regions on the windshield that were assumed to be at similar temperatures, where one region was covered with carbon (i.e. soot, with an assumed emissivity close to 1) and the other surface representative of the bulk oxidised alloy. An overall emissivity value of 0.57 was thus obtained. It should be noted that this value is an estimate and a true value could only be obtained with the calibration of actual windshield samples in laboratory conditions, which in this instance was not feasible. The value for the emissivity has been applied to the entire flare tip, and this will inevitably introduce errors as regions that are covered with soot will show higher temperatures, as they have been assigned an incorrect value for the emissivity. The overall temperature errors associated with the condition of the radiating surface, the emissivity corrections and varying surface conditions have been estimated to be ±100 °C. It is known that the temperature varies with the 0.25 power of the emitted radiation over the whole spectrum from a black body. Thus, varying the emissivity from 0.57 to 1 would lead to temperature errors of at most 190 °C at 1000 °C to 130 °C at 600 °C. However, if the soot covered just 10% of the area, then the effect would be reduced to only 19 °C. Thus, these assessments have provided the following results (and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0309324712464921">Figure 3</xref>):</p>

</list>
<p>Temperatures of 1000 °C or above are above the operating temperatures of the alloys used for flare tips. This will cause rapid oxidation and lead to the deterioration of mechanical properties of the alloys. The high temperature gradients and transient temperatures can both lead to thermal stresses and plastic deformation. The effect of these stresses on the integrity of the flare tip structure needs to be analysed. At a temperature of 1000 °C, the yield point of alloy 625 is 135 MPa, and the alloy has lost most of its mechanical strength (compared to σ<sub>y</sub> at RT of 483 MPa) and will therefore not withstand high thermal stresses before undergoing plastic deformation. The higher yield strength of Ni-based alloys and the improved oxidation resistance due to higher Cr content have been the driving force behind the move away from stainless steels and the use of alloys 625 and 800H in flare tips. The use of windshields provides improved resistance against a prevailing wind and reduces flame impingement. The use of the venturi windshield in the present design was intended to increase mixing between air and the combustion gases, thereby increasing combustion efficiency and reducing smoke levels. However, the design caused high levels of flame impingement and consequently operating temperatures of up to 1000 °C, which are not sustainable by the alloys used in the flare tip.</p>

<title>Stress analysis</title>
<p>The stresses, strains and resulting deformations were predicted using FEM analysis and the IR temperatures, with the assumptions given in the following. The mesh was generated in 3D using Fluent (ANSYS UK Ltd, Sheffield, UK) and imported into ABAQUS, resulting in a total of 78,461 linear tetrahedral elements of type C3D4T, with only one element through the thickness of the metal; thus, thermal gradients through the thickness of the metal were ignored. The model was solved using a coupled temperature–displacement step in steady-state conditions for static flaring and under transient conditions for cyclic flaring mode. Further details of the model are given by Abolghasemi.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309324712464921">13</xref></sup> The simulations were calculated using default solution and convergence criteria, as outlined in the ABAQUS theory manual.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309324712464921">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was assumed that the bottom of the flare had been fixed in all directions as it was welded to the lower part of the stack and thus could not move. Heat can be transferred to the flare in three ways, that is, by conduction, convection and radiation. Conduction is controlled by the thermal diffusivity of the alloy. The fluid surrounding the metal, its velocity and fluid properties govern heat convection to and from the metal. Based on trial cases, a heat transfer coefficient of <italic>h</italic><sub>c</sub> = 30 W/(m<sup>2</sup> K) was assumed between the metal and the flare and <italic>h</italic><sub>c</sub> = 20 W/(m<sup>2</sup> K) between the metal and surrounding air. Radiation is controlled by the emissivity and surface condition of the alloys in question.</p>
<p>The IR recorded temperature profiles were implemented into the simulation by applying a heat flux via a Gaussian distribution that will heat up one side of the model to account for flame impingement. A second heat flux was applied to the top of the flare tip with a decreasing gradient to account for the temperature change from the top of the windshield to the bottom of the stack. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0309324712464921">Figure 4</xref> shows the imposed temperature profiles on the windshield and stack, along with a comparison of the measured and imposed temperature profiles. The data show good agreement between the measured and imposed temperatures, the maximum difference being 70 °C or less, which is within the experimental measurement error.</p>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0309324712464921">Figure 5</xref> shows the stress distribution in the windshield at peak temperature (i.e. up to 1000 °C). The highest levels of stress (325 MPa) were found in the support brackets. This is the yield stress of alloy 625 at 635 °C and thus predicts that the support brackets would undergo plastic deformation. This is caused by the expansion of the windshield when subjected to high temperatures. The support brackets act as constraints to the expansion, resulting in the development of high stresses. The stress exceeds yield around the weldments of the downwind support bracket, which experiences the most expansion. The stress experienced at the top of the windshield is lower than yield and therefore suggests that the windshield is experiencing elastic deformation due to the deformation of the supports brackets that hold it in place.</p>

<title>Cyclic stress distribution</title>
<p>Repeated heating and cooling of the windshield lead to cyclic stresses being applied to the flare. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0309324712464921">Figure 6(a)</xref> shows the stress distribution in the windshield after 10 thermal cycles. The top view shows considerable deformation of the windshield compared with the original circular shape. The deformation observed here is still only elastic and is again thought to be due to the deformation of the support brackets. The repeated expansion and contraction that has been applied to the flare tip when the flare is turned on and off have resulted in plastic deformation at the support brackets where the stress has exceeded yield. The welded support brackets, which hold the windshield to the stack at four points, hinder the expansion and contraction, and this is most pronounced in the downwind direction that is subjected to flame impingement. The cycling results in an uneven deformation as predicted by the model and later observed optically, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0309324712464921">Figure 6(b)</xref>, ultimately leading to plastic deformation.</p>

<p>Positions 4–6 range from the top to the bottom of the windshield. At the top, the recorded temperature was 906 °C ± 100 °C. At this point, the stress levels computed by the model are fairly low (∼30 MPa). At this location, the peak temperature is 906 °C ± 100 °C, and the yield point of alloy 625 is 205 MPa. It can be seen from optical images that the top of the windshield has deformed plastically at two locations and thus must have experienced stress levels above the yield stress. The model only predicts a strong elastic deformation at the top of the windshield for flaring at 300 × 10<sup>3</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/day. This elastic deformation can be due to the plastic deformation that occurs in the support brackets that hold the windshield in place. However, higher flaring rates lead to temperature gradients that are more concentrated at the top of the windshield and can result in the observed plastic deformation. It is also possible that a combination of different flaring modes may have caused the deformation. This study has focussed on the most severe operating conditions observed at gas flow rates of 300 × 10<sup>3</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/day. But it is plausible that a combination of flaring conditions (low, medium or high gas flow rates) would have aggravated the predicted deformation.</p>
<p>Predicted creep failure at position 7, where the top of the stack (alloy 625) is welded to the lower part of the stack (alloy 310), was found to have a creep failure time of 6 × 10<sup>17</sup> days, the extended lifetime no doubt being due to the lower temperatures.</p>

<p>Operational data supplied by the gas processing station for a period of 4 months from September 2009 indicated that transient and unstable flaring occurred approximately four or five times per month, with each flaring lasting for about 30 min. Thus, the lifetime of the windshield support brackets from failure by thermal fatigue would be approximately 25 months. Compared to the worst case of creep failure time of 20 days, the flare will be able to withstand stresses from thermal fatigue for 750 days. Knowing that the flare will only operate for 30 min at a time, creep failure will not occur (even if integrating the time at temperature, it will take 5750 days), and thus, the main mode of failure for the flare tip will be due to thermal fatigue from stresses exerted on the support brackets.</p>

<title>Failure of the venturi flare tip</title>
<p>The flare tip examined in this study experienced severe plastic deformation of the venturi after approximately 6 months in operation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0309324712464921">Figure 10</xref>). This is in agreement with the predictions made using the method described in this article and thus provides validation of the model. Based on the predictions made in this study, the flare tip was considered safe to operate for a further 6 months, when it was then removed during a scheduled plant shutdown. Thus, the methodology avoided the need for an unplanned replacement and the associated financial costs.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study has shown that the replacement of flare tips with new, but untried, designs can have serious consequences. Thermal imaging has shown that the temperature of the windshield described in this article reached 1000 °C or more under certain flaring conditions. When the windshield in question was constrained from thermal expansion, considerable thermomechanical stress developed in the structure. Temperature gradients across the windshield as a result of the prevailing wind conditions produced uneven stress distributions leading to gross distortion of the windshield. The distortions were most pronounced in those parts of the structure that were at high temperatures where the alloy could deform plastically at relatively low values of stress. The deformation was observed to increase with time and the number of flaring cycles.</p>
<p>The designs and alloys used in flare tip manufacture are many and varied, and there is little doubt that yet further designs and the use of even higher temperature alloys will be suggested. There is thus the need to have a rigorous process for assessing the effectiveness of a design to avoid expensive mistakes.</p>
<p>The use of CFD modelling to assess the combined effect of gas flow and wind conditions on the combustion pattern observed in different flare designs prior to installation will help predict the suitability of each design for a particular situation. These data can then be used to perform stress analysis studies and determine mechanical integrity and long-term performance for a proposed flare tip assembly.</p>
