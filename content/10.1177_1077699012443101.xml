<p>A rare photograph in Alice Fahs’s book <italic>Out on Assignment</italic> shows five women in late Victorian attire seated together in front of a desk cluttered with papers and photographs and other newsroom miscellanea. Congenial and confident, the women form a tableau, with two leaning an elbow on the desk as they meet the camera’s gaze, while another clutches the arm of the woman next to her in sisterly fashion and yet another holds a kitten.</p>
<p>Writers for the <italic>New York World</italic>, the women were all well-known in their day. What is remarkable about the photograph now, however, is that it calls into question historiographical assumptions about female journalists of the past who, if remembered at all, are presumed to have been brash and brassy tokens in a field that was not simply male dominated but macho. The photograph illustrates Fahs’s main point—that there was a “public community of independent women” writing for large urban newspapers and that together they created “a new engagement between women and public life, one centered around active participation and observation.” Yet because of low regard for the sensational press, controversy as a historical organizing principle, and sexism itself, all but a few have been forgotten.</p>
<p>Fahs, a historian at the University of California, Irvine whose research examines the intersections of print culture, race, gender, and public space, provides an engaging and thorough look at many of these women, based on a close reading of their work and other archival sources. Focusing on journalists working between roughly the mid-1880s through the 1910s, she shows how newspaper work was integral to women’s increasing participation in the workplace generally, their expanded travel experiences, and their sense of adventure. As she writes, “If the tropes of ‘innocence’ and an ‘averted gaze’ had structured Victorian women’s selfhood, now ‘experience’ and an alert, forthright, all-seeing gaze reorganized ideas of what constituted appropriate knowledge for newspaper women.”</p>
<p>The book’s organization underscores the interrelatedness between newspaper women’s work and women’s lives. The first chapter notes that between 1870 and 1900, the recorded number of women working as reporters and editors increased from a total of 35 to 2,193, and that did not include women paid for “specials” on “space rates” (freelancers). Many came to New York from the South and West, driven by a sense of adventure and the need for paid employment. The latter was particularly true during the economic downturn of the early 1890s, when women such as Elizabeth Jordan found themselves supporting their families. Some were “New Women”—privileged, educated, and mostly white—while others were “Bachelor Girls” whose narratives focused on a frugally feminine independent existence. Meanwhile, journalists such as Rose Pastor Stokes were working class, and African American women such as Victoria Earle Matthews, Fannie Barrier Williams, Gertrude Bustill Mosell, and, of course, Ida B. Wells made a name working for “race” papers. As a group, newspaper women were so visible that Margherita Arlina Hamm wrote a regular column titled “Among the Newspaper Women” for the <italic>New York Journalist</italic> beginning in 1891.</p>
<p>Of course, many women were relegated to the “women’s pages,” the focus of Fahs’s second chapter. Not surprisingly, many resented the segregation and limitation of “women’s topics” (household hints, fashion, and recipes) and the ridicule of being called the “hen coop.” “It is humiliating to do no work worth being taken seriously,” wrote Anne O’Hagan, beauty editor of the <italic>New York World</italic>. Moreover, some women’s page writers made a healthy professional salary advising other women to be domestic—a point that is troubling from a feminist perspective. However, others used the space to explore “progressive womanhood,” using “women’s page” space to create an ongoing public discussion that helped readers see new possibilities.</p>
<p>As Fahs writes, “Newspapers became a significant means of creating, sharing, and spreading knowledge about women’s status and prospects—with special attention to women’s work,” including career advice. Cautioning against “writing off women’s pages too quickly,” Fahs notes that women themselves have done so out of scorn and shame, effectively reinforcing the male-centered value system. Reframing the discussion, she argues that some editors were adept at “flying under the radar” of prohibited topics such as suffrage by focusing on women’s progress in industry, the professions, education, and clubs. Moreover, new forms of writing that emerged during the period, notably the “human interest” feature and the long interview, came from the “particularities of observation” and “adherence to the complexities of stories” that characterized work from the “hen coop.” Not constrained by the increasingly dry style of “straight news” (which Lincoln Steffens said permanently damaged his writing), female reporters wrote subjectively, often reinventing themselves. One of Fahs’s most provocative observations is the parallel between the pseudonymous public personae created by women writers, including the “stunt girls” (most famously, Elizabeth Cochrane as “Nellie Bly”), and public theatricality. Their work was, in effect, street theater where women could act out new public roles.</p>
<p>Two particularly intriguing chapters are titled simply “Work” and “Travel.” In the first, Fahs explores the popular stories of newspaper women who played the part of working girls to write about life in factories and other low-paying jobs. Noting that such stories typically drew on pre–Civil War sentimental literature designed to elicit readers’ sympathies with “the plight of respectable but downtrodden working women imagined as pale, shivering, and helpless victims,” Fahs argues that newspaper women such as Eva Valesh “began to reconfigure and reconceptualize” such images. The “Travel” chapter, meanwhile, examines women’s journeys, which enabled some, such as Fannie Ward, to became inadvertent war correspondents “crossing the most intractable gender line of all in newspaper work.”</p>
<p>Fahs is hardly the first historian to examine women in journalism; her work joins other exemplary studies such as Maurine Beasley and Sheila Gibbons’s <italic>Taking Their Place: A Documentary History of Women and Journalism</italic> and Jean Marie Lutes’s <italic>Front-Page Girls: Women Journalists in American Culture and Fiction, 1880–1930</italic>. Yet by focusing on a relatively narrow period of time and questioning old assumptions, Fahs offers a fresh perspective. For example, she notes that female journalists have been forgotten in part because sensationalism has been maligned, “a summary and preemptive judgment that has limited and blocked analysis. . . . Why not explore how [newspapers] created sensation and how they fit into a larger emerging culture of leisure?” Rejecting the “add women and stir” trope, she draws a far more nuanced picture of female journalists, based on the daunting—if not exhaustive—amount of material she uncovered. She notes in the introduction that much of her work became possible during the past decade as more primary sources found their way to databases. By uncovering them and taking them on their own terms, she provides what is arguably the most engaging look at female journalists in the early twentieth century since Ishbel Ross’s 1936 <italic>Ladies of the Press</italic>. The book is rich and readable, suitable for advanced undergraduates and certainly for graduate students and researchers. Full of material that could be explored further and context for various projects, it is a highly useful book. Every academic library should own a copy, and many researchers will enjoy it simply because it is a good read.</p>
