<abstract>
<p>A review of recent writing makes the case that children living in poverty (urban, rural, or other) are more in jeopardy now than ever. As teachers attest and research asserts, poverty affects children in profound, complicated, and lasting ways. However, the general music program is uniquely positioned to meet children’s needs, especially those living in poverty. This discussion will consider several important questions: First, what are the complexities that confront children living in poverty? Next, how can culturally responsive pedagogy guide us to respectful approaches for general music educators working with these populations? And finally, how can music education organizations help remove potential roadblocks to implementing strong music programs in high-poverty districts?</p>

<body>
<p>One of my biggest jobs this past summer involved cleaning my desk, which was complicated by the rather large stack of professional journals that had accumulated. Since I didn’t want to turn my back on a potential treasure trove of resources, I went on a reading binge. It was a large job, but by reading them all at once, I was able to make connections that I might have otherwise missed. The result was several file folders of related articles on topics about which I feel particularly interested or passionate.</p>
<p>The folder labeled “urban” has given me a new insight into my work as an urban music educator. As I have discovered, it is not my imagination that the job seems more challenging in recent years. My folder contains multiple articles from multiple authors making the case that children living in poverty (urban, rural, or other) are more in jeopardy now than ever. As teachers attest and research asserts, poverty affects children in profound, complicated, and lasting ways.</p>
<p>Although painting an accurate picture of the reality in which many children live is an important pursuit, it seemed somewhat pointless to me without also considering how music educators might respond to these realities. For many years, we have made the claim that our music programs are vital to the success of all students. My summer reading has brought me to the conclusion that the general music program is uniquely positioned to meet children’s needs, especially those living in poverty. Unfortunately, the economic realities that affect children’s lives have also created a climate in which general music programs are frequently reduced, diluted, or eliminated.</p>
<p>In this article, I hope to add my voice to several important, but not new, questions: What are the complexities that confront children living in poverty? How can culturally responsive pedagogy guide us to respectful approaches for general music educators working with these populations? How can music education organizations help remove potential roadblocks to implementing a strong music program in high-poverty districts?</p>
<p>I hope you will pardon the metaphorical soapbox, but I feel it is important at this juncture to state explicitly that the children of whom we speak are experiencing a poverty of opportunity, but not a poverty of potential. It is not our job to “fix” them, but instead to do our part in mitigating their circumstances. It is also crucial to that avoid the dangers of oversimplification and stereotyping, of the children or their circumstances. Although general terms such as <italic>students living in poverty, high-poverty schools</italic>, and <italic>high-needs districts</italic> are used here for ease of discussion, families coping with the challenges of poverty represent diverse circumstances, ethnicities, native languages, religious beliefs, and any number of other characteristics by which society tends to derive labels or classifications.</p>
<p>Please note that I will be discussing the implications and effects of poverty on general music students without specifically referencing their culture, native language, or ethnicity. This, of course, is not consistent with the fundamental tenets of culturally relevant pedagogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1048371313478611">Gay, 2010</xref>). However, my thought is to look at the implications of poverty as a single part of a much larger picture. Many resources are available on multicultural music education and culturally-responsive pedagogy, and it cannot be stated strongly enough that cultural diversity and understanding are fundamental assets to our programs.</p>
<p>To consider the first question, let’s look at the sheer depth of poverty as it is described in my admittedly noncomprehensive survey of recent writings. The 2010 census tells us that the number of children living in poverty is at the highest since 1933: 22% of children, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The same report tells us about those living in “deep poverty,” earning less than half of the income defined as poverty level; these numbers are also higher than ever in our history. In addition, another record was set, almost 50 million people are without health insurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1048371313478611">“The Rise of Poverty,” 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>For the minimum wage worker, the picture is particularly bleak. Information from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1048371313478611">National Low Income Housing Coalition (2012)</xref> recently calculated how many hours a week at minimum wage it would take to rent a two-bedroom apartment at current market rates, assuming that 30% of income is spent on housing. Arkansas and West Virginia are the most “affordable,” requiring 63 hours of work a week. Washington, D.C., was the least affordable, at 140 hours a week. It is not currently possible anywhere in the United States to afford such an apartment on a 40-hour work week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1048371313478611">National Low Income Housing Coalition, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>These realities have yielded an interesting result. Despite recent gains in reducing the achievement gap between students based on ethnicity, a widening gap has appeared between students of divergent socioeconomic status. Research by Sean Reardon of Stanford University is pointing to a frightening trend. As economically-advantaged students tend to do better in school, and doing better in school tends to lead to higher incomes later in life, it becomes more difficult than ever to break the cycle of poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1048371313478611">“Income Inequality,” 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Research supports the conclusion that more children are negatively affected by poverty than in the past. Unfortunately, a lack of funds does not affect only students and families but also the schools that serve them. Research conducted by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that of 24 states with relevant data, 21 anticipated spending less on education in 2012 than in 2011. These cuts have led to rather drastic results. To name but a few examples, some districts in California have cut as 10 instructional days from the school year; after-school programs were eliminated for some students in Miami and Florida, while Texas dropped preschool services for many students. Here’s the crucial point for this discussion: The article goes on to point out that because high-poverty schools tend to rely more on state funding, cuts at the state level tend to have greater overall impact for those schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1048371313478611">Rebell, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>To paint a more complete picture, let’s also look at some of the other factors that influence the education of students living in poverty. A recent report from Johns Hopkins University discusses the effects of chronic absenteeism, defined as missing 10% of school days. Poverty-stricken urban schools see up to 33% of students chronically absent, with the numbers at about 25% percent in high-poverty rural schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1048371313478611">“Absenteeism Epidemic,” 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Other authors discuss at length the dangers of environmental hazards in school buildings, such as exposure to lead, mercury, pesticides, arsenic, air pollution, mold, and asbestos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1048371313478611">Chatham-Stephens, Mann, Wershof Schwartz, &amp; Landrigan, 2011</xref>). Although the authors do not specifically point to high-poverty school buildings, it stands to reason that those school districts would be least able to afford necessary repairs. To add insult to injury, the disparity between wealthy, independent school facilities and high-poverty public school buildings has become shocking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1048371313478611">Weissbourd &amp; Dodge, 2012</xref>). Schools separated by the distance of only a few miles might as well be separated by a chasm the size of the Grand Canyon when comparing the educational opportunities afforded their students.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the disparity in educational opportunities between affluent children and those living in poverty is a theme that carries through to our own field. In a heartfelt and timely commentary, NAfME President Scott C. Shuler continues the assertion that music education is vital to the education of all students and quotes Education Secretary Arne Duncan in describing it as a civil right. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1048371313478611">Shuler (2012)</xref> reminds us that the neediest students—the ones who have the most to gain from arts education—are the least likely to receive it.</p>
<p>Simply stating the case that many students are affected by poverty is compelling on its own merits, but the literature also proposes several theories on the connection between poverty and lower achievement in school. One theory posits that affluent parents have more resources that can be levied to benefit their children. These resources include financial wealth as well as the complicated interplay of cultural knowledge and personal networks that allows parents to lay a strong groundwork of support for their children’s efforts. Parents living in poverty do not have full access to these supports, leading to subtle, yet profound, results such as low birth weights, poor nutrition, chronic illnesses, lack of early childhood education, unsafe living conditions, neighborhood violence, and so forth, all of which can contribute to academic challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1048371313478611">Willingham, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Another school of thought, not necessarily in competition with the first, theorizes that poverty leads to such a high level of daily stress for children that actual changes in the brain can take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1048371313478611">Willingham, 2012</xref>). A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides some related information about the implications of severe childhood stress for later life. The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study is a large undertaking, with more than 17,000 people completing questionnaires about their childhood years. The information gathered points to a strong connection between certain childhood traumas and later risks for poor quality of life, illness, and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1048371313478611">Felitti et al., 1998</xref>). Although this study does not specifically look at the effects of poverty, it does strengthen the case that childhood stress is detrimental to overall health and well-being.</p>
<p>It’s a bleak picture, but now let’s look at what this means for the general music educator, as we consider the second question posed earlier. In the midst of our current, appropriate concern with culturally responsive pedagogy, we can also take into consideration the myriad implications of poverty. Our general music program can provide an intentional, albeit partial, response to the challenges faced by many of our children, while building on their strengths to ensure success.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the general music program offers a unique position in working with children of poverty, an idea shared by many others (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1048371313478611">Abril, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1048371313478611">Camillieri &amp; Jackson, 2005</xref>). The typical general music educator has the opportunity to work with most, if not all, of the students in the school, and does so with more curricular freedom than the classroom teacher. This flexibility gives us this ability to reach many students in creative ways, responding to the strengths and needs of the students rather than the demands of a rigid curriculum. In addition, the general music educator tends to be less reliant on textbooks and less likely to be required to work with a mandated one, thus allowing for a wider variety of resources as well as the opportunity to avoid ones that present bias. We can also capitalize on the inherent expressiveness of our discipline, providing a vehicle for students’ self-expression and personal validation. In other words, music educators have tools at our disposal not enjoyed by some of our colleagues.</p>
<p>The following thoughts represent lessons I am learning in my personal, ongoing efforts to use the lens of culturally responsive pedagogy to inform my work as a general music educator in a high-poverty district. It is admittedly not a perfect fit; poverty is not synonymous with culture, and children living in poverty represent a wide variety of ethnicities, cultures, and native languages. However, I am discovering that the fundamental tenets of culturally responsive pedagogy have much to teach us about our students. The need to examine our own biases, the mandate to know our students beyond a superficial level, the opportunity to empower and validate children, the focus on students’ strengths rather than deficits, and the refusal to make excuses or accept less than success are appropriate and respectful steps in improving our efforts on behalf of children living in poverty.</p>
<p>One of the first lessons we can learn from culturally responsive pedagogy is the need to examine our own thinking for evidence of bias or misunderstanding about our students and their circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1048371313478611">Gay, 2010</xref>). For example, are we making assumptions, however subconsciously, about the reasons our children are living in poverty, essentially blaming the children or their families? Are we using poverty as an excuse for a lack of success in our programs? Do we feel that the potential for musical achievement of our students is somehow less than their suburban counterparts? Are we focusing our energies on what our students do not have, rather than what they possess? Are we misinformed about the musical preferences and potential of our students? Are we assuming that our way of participating in the musical world is the only or best way? As difficult as it may be, we must be honest with ourselves about our thoughts, carefully analyze how they affect our teaching, and discover the ways in which they are in conflict with fact and proven research—for further discussion about the myths of poverty, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1048371313478611">Gorski (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1048371313478611">Books (2008)</xref>.</p>
<p>Our next lesson from culturally responsive pedagogy challenges us to get to know our students on a deeper level, moving past superficial impressions or snap judgments, using this information to inform our teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1048371313478611">Gay, 2010</xref>). This is a difficult task for the general music educator who sees hundreds of students every week, leaving precious little time after attending to the myriad responsibilities we carry. However, one approach is to create lessons that incorporate opportunities for students to tell their personal, cultural, and musical stories. See, for example, the poem template in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1048371313478611">Appendix A</xref>, the directions for a “Telling My Story” composition project in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1048371313478611">Appendix B</xref>, the “Circles Exercise” from <italic>Sound Ways of Knowing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1048371313478611">Barrett, McCoy, &amp; Veblen, 1997</xref>), or the “Musical Timeline” exercise in <italic>Music From the Inside Out</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1048371313478611">Anker, Ponder, &amp; Santman, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Another opportunity is to ask open-ended questions and encourage students to begin their answers with “In my experience…,” which encourages students and teacher alike to place learning in the context of students’ lives. We can also learn about the musical preferences of our students by trading recommendations, that is, students choose a song for the teacher to hear and the teacher responds the following week with a song that is in some way related or similar to the first recommendation. This can establish a classroom routine of reciprocal musical sharing, dispelling the myth that certain kinds of music are only for certain kinds of people. Regardless of the method, we can acquire a more accurate understanding of our students by really listening to what they have to say.</p>
<p>By increasing the opportunities for students’ voices to be heard, we also begin to address the goals of validating and empowering the students in our care, another lesson we can learn from pedagogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1048371313478611">Gay, 2010</xref>). After completing the poem, composition project, or time line discussed above, we can plan a wide variety of opportunities to sing, play instruments, listen, and research, helping our students discover how musicians throughout time and across cultures have told their stories through musical expression. Finding commonalities between the experiences of oneself and others is validating and empowering.</p>
<p>We’ve now at least begun to examine our own thinking, create opportunities for student voice, and use the world of music to validate and empower our students. Culturally responsive pedagogy has a further lesson for us. Let’s reexamine the information about poverty from the first part of this article, discuss how the general music educator can use this knowledge to plan for student success, and consider how we might reframe the picture to focus on students’ strengths rather than deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1048371313478611">Gay, 2010</xref>). This process requires us to use our deeper understanding of the students in our care. Please keep in mind that since children living in poverty represent diverse circumstances, it is not possible in to state any student strength or characteristic that will hold true for all students. Therefore, this discussion will be necessarily general, not specific.</p>
<p>For example, let’s consider <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1048371313478611">Willingham’s (2012)</xref> description of the tangible and intangible resources that affluent parents levy on behalf of their children but that may not be enjoyed by parents in poverty. For some of these families, experiences beyond their immediate neighborhood are few, leading to isolation from other segments of society. However, when we look for strengths instead of deficits, we may discover that some students possess a strong sense of community and a deep understanding of the people and cultures their neighborhoods encompass. By connecting new information and experiences to familiar ones, students may more fully understand how a specific piece of information fits into a larger body of knowledge. Students can further build on this strength by engaging in a curriculum that begins with their community and moves outward in concentric circles.</p>
<p>In addition, lessons that encourage a sense of teamwork continue to build on that sense of community. Some students are not motivated by competition but would rather work as part of team to accomplish a common goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1048371313478611">San Antonio, 2008</xref>). Encouraging students to work together, coaching and supporting each other, is a common thread in literature about culturally responsive pedagogy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1048371313478611">Gay, 2010</xref>). We can access this strategy in many ways. General music games and activities that direct students to compete as individuals could be modified to allow partners to work together. Success in achieving particular skills, such as reading rhythm patterns or performing an instrument part, can be increased by encouraging students to work in groups, with each one taking responsibility for the learning of all group members.</p>
<p>Just as students can discover connections between new information and their daily lives, links can also be forged between unfamiliar musical material and students’ daily musical listening. However, presenting a wide variety of music and knowledge is vital. It is unfortunate that some otherwise well-meaning general music educators jump to conclusions about the kinds of music to which their students will listen. In my opinion, it is unconscionable to limit the learning of students of poverty by assuming they will not respond to a particular genre. With careful preparation, most students will listen to and interact with nearly anything and will be willing to give most styles of music a reasonable chance. Our general music programs in these (and any) settings should include popular music, orchestral music, opera, jazz, music of different cultures and traditions, including those represented by the students, and any other works of quality that will support learning.</p>
<p>To further develop a body of knowledge and plant seeds for later interest, students should also be invited to participate in local cultural institutions. Many arts organizations offer very affordable field trip opportunities, and grant programs often support such programs for high-need schools. If travelling physically to another location is problematic, perhaps a virtual trip may suffice. Visiting the websites of local arts institutions, looking at mass transit maps to plan an imaginary trip, and displaying brochures and schedules can make these venues welcoming to students and their families. We can also work to the strengths of students by discovering connections they may already have to local arts organizations and artists, inviting family and community musicians to share their gifts with general music classes. Culturally relevant pedagogy encourages these efforts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1048371313478611">Ladson-Billings, 1995</xref>); we are learning more about our students and their community and validating the role music plays in their lives.</p>
<p>Another tool that can bring the wider world into our classroom is web-based videos, such as those found on YouTube. (If your school district blocks these sites within the building, videos may be downloaded at home to your desktop for later viewing.) With a bit of research, general music educators can find videos of quality performances ranging from native culture bearers from around the globe to professional classical performances. Although some students are familiar with these resources already, others may not have easy access to computers with Internet capabilities. Certainly, technology can be costly and may be beyond the reach of small or even nonexistent music budgets. However, there are other funding sources and grant programs willing to provide resources on behalf of high-needs schools.</p>
<p>Since research has shown that children living in poverty often experience stressful lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1048371313478611">Willingham, 2012</xref>), the general music program for these students should find ways to provide a stress-free environment. In contrast to high-stakes, stress-filled testing, students must find the general music room to be a haven in which they are free to explore the world of music without pressure. Emphasizing participation, asking questions with multiple answers, providing opportunities for creativity, and demonstrating acceptance of mistakes are all important parts of a supportive climate in the general music program, allowing the strengths of the students to take the central role. Scaffolded instruction, differentiation, and peer partnerships to support the learning of English language learners and students with physical or learning challenges can also mitigate the stress of our most at-risk students (while empowering students to serve as leaders). Please note that reducing stress in the music classroom does not require compromising rigor; it is possible to convey high expectations for students in a supportive climate.</p>
<p>In addition to creating lessons that prevent stress from interfering with student success, general music educators can also plan activities that help reduce the effects of other stressors in the lives of our students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1048371313478611">Jensen, 2001</xref>). Since exercise is known to have such an effect, movement activities such as folk dance will simultaneously address the needs of children living in poverty and support music learning. Singing and playing instruments together can also reduce stress, provided that students are well prepared for such activities and encouraged to participate in a comfortable way. This is not the time for enforced solo work or high-pressure performance rubrics.</p>
<p>Our discipline is usually highly motivating for students, and for those that may experience chronic absenteeism, the general music educator can do their part toward encouraging attendance. Most music teachers in high-needs schools can point to several students who are often absent, but rarely on music day. By greeting every child with a smile, making every child feel welcome, and saying words such as “I’m glad you’re here,” we can make a difference for children who feel their presence is not valued. At the end of every lesson, we can tell students what we’re excited about doing with them next time, allowing students and teachers alike to look ahead with excitement.</p>
<p>Let’s also at least partially reframe the picture of absenteeism to discover students’ strengths. In some cases, students are absent because they are caring for younger siblings or other family members. The level of responsibility and independence that such students develop is a remarkable strength that can translate to further success in music class. When we as general music educators are willing to set aside a position of absolute authority and instead encourage student decision making and leadership, we are building on this strength. Let’s ask students to consider musical decisions such as tempo, dynamics, classroom instrumentation, and form. We can teach conducting patterns and rotate student conductors for classroom singing. We can provide opportunities for students to manage their own creative process while composing, with scaffolded support as needed.</p>
<p>One of the reasons a general music program can be so valuable for high-poverty schools is that the students receive so much “bang for the buck.” Although a keyboard lab might be nice, a high-tech sound system would be lovely, and tons of instruments are always fun, it is possible to create a high-quality general music program for very little financial investment on the part of the school or the families it serves. The general music educator should always be looking for materials that will be interesting to his or her students but should never use a lack of such materials as an excuse for a poor-quality program. Our lesson from culturally responsive pedagogy demands that we accept nothing less than success, refusing to accept or make excuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1048371313478611">Corbett, Wilson, &amp; Williams, 2005</xref>). So we don’t have any instruments? Let’s plan a lesson that has students creating their own instruments from household materials. No basal music series? We can download a few mp3 files for song time, call the publisher for some sample copies, or write a grant proposal. No music classroom? We should use any space we can find, and when our administrators see a vibrant program, we might be the next in line for a room.</p>
<p>We’ve looked at some of the ways we can use the lessons of culturally relevant pedagogy to inform our work. Now, let’s look at the bigger picture in consideration of the last of our three questions. There are a number of roadblocks that stand in the way of high-quality general music programs in schools/districts that serve children living in poverty. It is both possible and appropriate for NAfME and the affiliated state Music Educator Associations (MEAs) to work to remove these roadblocks.</p>
<p>One of these roadblocks is that music teachers serving high-poverty schools are not always connected to support systems such as NAfME. Although the job is difficult, music educators such as these are often left to cope on their own. Some survive, whereas others seek positions in suburban districts or leave the profession altogether.</p>
<p>There are several steps professional organizations such as NAfME might take to support our colleagues. First, we can heighten the relevance of NAfME for teachers in high-poverty schools by increasing the available workshop programming that directly addresses the needs of these students and teachers. Second, rather than wait for teachers to find the organization on their own, we need to go directly to our colleagues working in high-poverty schools. Membership representatives must make personal contact with teachers, offering support and encouragement. By increasing participation in NAfME, we simultaneously provide support for teachers and increase the knowledge base of our organization. Third, NAfME and the affiliated state MEAs can make it more financially viable for these often underpaid teachers to participate by offering reduced-price memberships and conference registrations. And last, as is already happening in some states, we can help keep good teachers in the profession by developing mentoring partnerships, matching early-career teachers with colleagues experienced in serving high-needs populations.</p>
<p>The second roadblock is one of advocacy. It is widely accepted in our field that advocacy is part of the job, but we tend to advocate mostly for our own programs in our own districts. For teachers in high-poverty schools, advocacy presents a whole different set of challenges. Many such districts do not employ a music coordinator to be the voice for the department, and individual teachers are already maintain heavier course loads than their suburban counterparts. In high-poverty districts, music educators may find that their voices are not valued, and speaking up may even put their positions in jeopardy. High turnover in administrative positions further complicate the issue; it’s hard to know who to advocate to when the power brokers change every year.</p>
<p>An appropriate response from NAfME and the related state organizations might be to rethink the role of appointed/elected advocacy chairs. The current model seems to be that these individuals serve as a resource for music educators seeking to initiate an advocacy campaign, but in high-poverty districts, more of a partnership is needed. An advocacy chair for NAfME or the state MEA, in collaboration with district music educators, might regularly seek an audience with upper level administrators to provide information about the value of music education for their students.</p>
<p>Although the financial investment for a general music program is not necessarily an expensive proposition, it is necessary to hire certified music educators. Another roadblock occurs when some districts manage to circumvent even this basic investment because their state’s education laws do not require it. This is an area in which the advocacy efforts of NAfME are particularly well suited. By continuing to lobby for state-mandated arts education taught by certified arts educators, we are at least helping put the right people in place. Further support in the financial arena might include maintaining a current listing of agencies that provide grant money, along with advice about writing effective grant proposals. However, since many available grants are for relatively small sums, and usually for supplies and instruments rather than salaries, the first part of this recommendation is perhaps the more important.</p>
<p>This discussion began with three questions for us to consider as we work to respond appropriately and respectfully to the needs of children living in poverty. We must pay attention to the harsh reality of poverty and how children are affected by it. We must levy the incredible power of general music programs in ensuring the success of students living in poverty. And we must look at the influence that can be wielded by our organization in building quality general music programs in high-poverty districts. My thoughts represent only one perspective in what must be an ongoing discussion in our profession. The time to take action is now—our efforts will make a difference in the lives of thousands of children.</p>

<title>Poem Project</title>
<p>Students complete the poem on an index card and post their card in the classroom before the end of the lesson. If time allows, a gallery walk can allow students to read the works of others. The general music educator should also write a poem and post it with the students’ work. This activity is not for assessment purposes, and marking spelling or grammar errors is not appropriate at this time.</p>

<title>“Telling My Story” Project</title>
<p>Based loosely on “The Zipper Bag Project” from <italic>Middle School General Music: The Best Part of Your Day</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1048371313478611">McAnally, 2009</xref>), which includes a detailed rubric for the project. The directions may be easily modified to include classroom instruments, if available.</p>
<p>Directions:</p>
<p>In this project, you will work in a group of two, three, or four to create a composition that tells a story from the life experience of one of the members of your group.</p>
<list id="list1-1048371313478611" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Choose a story to tell through sound—it can represent a life-changing experience or a daily routine, and it can be exciting, upsetting, or any emotion you choose.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Using only the contents of your book bag, the space around you, and body percussion, create sounds that help tell your story.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Create symbols to notate your sounds—they can be letters, numbers, and/or shapes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Compose music that tells the story your group chose. Your composition must be at least 30 seconds in length.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Notate your composition using the symbols you created.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Practice and revise your composition until everyone is your group is satisfied; prepare to perform it for the class. Everyone must participate.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Please note that when we encourage students to share life experiences, we may bring to light events that require additional support for students, so it may be helpful to speak with the school counselor before the project begins.</p>
