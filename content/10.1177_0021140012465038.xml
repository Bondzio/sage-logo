<p>Pope John Paul II understood the mission of the Church to be a participation in the priestly, prophetic, and royal mission of Christ. This essay follows the development of this understanding from his time as Archbishop of Cracow though to <italic>Evangelium vitae</italic>. It examines, in particular, evangelization and its relationship to the threefold mission. It traces its development through his integration of the teaching of <italic>Lumen gentium</italic> on the threefold office of Christians and the teaching on evangelization in <italic>Evangelii nuntiandi</italic>. Noting that the <italic>Lineamenta</italic> of the Synod on New Evangelization makes little reference to the threefold office, it, finally, offers some ideas as to how we might develop our understanding of the threefold mission and apply it to ‘new evangelization.’</p>

<body>
<p>In 2010 Pope Benedict XVI established a Pontifical Council for Promoting New Evangelization in order to encourage ‘a renewed evangelization in countries where the first proclamation of the faith [has] already resounded, and where Churches are present of ancient foundation, but which are going through a progressive secularization of society and a sort of “eclipse of the sense of God.”’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021140012465038">1</xref></sup> More recently, it was announced that the theme for the 13th Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops to be held in 2012 would be, ‘The New Evangelization for the Transmission of the Christian Faith,’ the <italic>Lineamenta</italic> of which has already been published. Certainly, efforts to engage in a new evangelization have been taking place in Europe, as well as the rest of the world, for some time. The European continent has seen eight international World Youth Days; and new ecclesial movements have been engaging in evangelizing efforts there. The Catholic Bishops’ Conference for England and Wales has established an agency to support evangelizing efforts in dioceses, parishes, youth programs, outreaches to inactive Catholics, prayer groups, and dedicated training and formation programs. The catalogue of this agency bears witness to a multitude of small green evangelical shoots breaking through the soil.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0021140012465038">2</xref></sup> And there are many other examples of engagement in a new evangelization.</p>
<p>Yet, after three decades of attempting to engage in a new evangelization, whilst there are many areas of the world in which the Catholic Church is growing, in Europe, in particular, the Church still seems to be losing ground. The Church in Ireland is reeling from the sexual abuse scandal. In Germany a growing number of Catholics are asking to be ‘de-registered’ so as to avoid paying Church tax. In the Netherlands the extremely low rate of practice shows no discernible improvement. In many European nations ‘progressive secularization’ seems to progress apace. Meanwhile, whilst some parishes run Alpha courses, parish missions, or other forms of evangelical outreach, and RCIA programs are widely established, only <italic>a minority of parishioners</italic> are actively engaged in these. If a new evangelization of Europe or anywhere else is to occur, it is the <italic>majority</italic> of believers in these communities who must become involved in evangelization, and above all in their day-to-day lives. This is something that the <italic>Pontifical Council for Promoting New Evangelization</italic> can encourage, but cannot guarantee. ‘New evangelization’ will not have the desired impact unless a much greater number of these ‘silent’ believers also become evangelists.</p>
<p>This article will outline John Paul II’s thinking on new evangelization by presenting his fundamental understanding of the mission of the Church. The first part will show how John Paul II understood the mission of the Church to be grounded in the <italic>missio Dei</italic> (mission of God) and the threefold mission of Christ as priest, prophet, and king. The second part examines John Paul II’s understanding of evangelization, its development over time, and the relationship between evangelization and the threefold mission of the Church. The third part notes that the <italic>Lineamenta</italic> of the Synod makes only a single mention of the prophetic mission of Christ and the Church, with no specific mention, whatsoever, of the priestly and royal aspects of this mission. It will also offer some ideas as to how we could develop our understanding of the threefold mission and apply it to ‘new evangelization.’ The final part offers two examples of how our living out of this threefold mission might be developed further: the first being its theoretical exposition in <italic>Evangelium vitae</italic>; and the second its practical exposition in a new ecclesial movement called the Emmanuel Community.</p>

<title>The Mission of the Church and the <italic>Missio Dei</italic></title>
<p>According to John Paul II, the mission of Jesus is to make the Father present as love and mercy, to proclaim and establish the Kingdom of God, and to accomplish the work of Redemption.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0021140012465038">3</xref></sup> The mission of the Church is to participate in and continue this mission.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0021140012465038">4</xref></sup> Before he became Pope, Karol Wojtyla, as Archbishop of Crakow, looked at the mission of the Church in some detail in a work entitled <italic>Sources of Renewal</italic>. There he drew upon the teaching of <italic>Lumen gentium</italic> that the Church’s mission is a sharing in the priestly, prophetic, and royal mission of Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0021140012465038">5</xref></sup> It is the sharing in this threefold mission that ‘enables us to define that People [of God] more precisely as a messianic one.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0021140012465038">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In <italic>Sources of Renewal</italic>, Wojtyla developed an analysis of how the Council’s teaching on the Church and its mission should be implemented. He stated that the reality of mission ‘is closely linked with Revelation and defines in a dynamic manner the mystery of the Church itself.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0021140012465038">7</xref></sup> Herein, the <italic>missio Dei</italic>, as presented in <italic>Lumen gentium</italic> and <italic>Ad gentes</italic>, was Wojtyla’s starting point for his exposition of the Church’s mission.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0021140012465038">8</xref></sup> It is through the mission of the Son and Holy Spirit that both the Trinity and God’s plan of salvation are revealed to humanity. This mission not only reveals God but also accomplishes humanity’s salvation by bringing the Church into existence and maintaining it in existence. Thus, the Church, every Christian, and even every believer (who might only be ‘related’ to the Church) have a missionary ‘character.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0021140012465038">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Next, Wojtyla outlined the nature of the Church’s mission itself, noting that the Church originates in the salvific mission of the Trinity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0021140012465038">10</xref></sup> This mission is the sending of the Son and Holy Spirit, which is both revelatory and salvific.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0021140012465038">11</xref></sup> Rather than simply carrying out a function or acting as an institution, the Church is in a ‘state of mission,’ which defines its very nature. This nature of the Church is derived from the mystery of the Trinity through the mission of the divine Persons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0021140012465038">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to Wojtyla, everyone in the Church is in a ‘state of mission,’ not merely functionally, but by their very nature. Every Christian shares in the divine mission.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0021140012465038">13</xref></sup> Because the divine mission is both a self-revelation of God <italic>and</italic> a work of salvation, a Christian must accept this revelation through faith in order to share in the divine mission. Indeed, the first implies the second. One commits oneself to God by accepting the divine testimony in Jesus Christ and being prepared to witness to this testimony. Thus, the profession of faith is a dynamic one: it is not merely a passive acceptance of what God reveals, but a willingness to bear witness to it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0021140012465038">14</xref></sup> Faith <italic>requires</italic> witness. This witness should be made manifest through both the example of Christ-like lives and the explicit testimony of a Christian’s words about Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0021140012465038">15</xref></sup> It should be made manifest by ‘missionaries’: bishops, priests, religious, and lay people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0021140012465038">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In <italic>Sources of Renewal</italic>, Wojtyla said that the Second Vatican Council links the ‘salvific mission of God … with the threefold power of Christ as priest, prophet and king, while also showing that participation in that power determines the reality of the Christian life.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0021140012465038">17</xref></sup> He believed that participation in this salvific mission through sharing in this threefold power of Christ was the central theme of the Council’s teaching about the Church.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0021140012465038">18</xref></sup> Christian testimony about Christ, through which the reality of faith is expressed, does not take place outside of, but through, participation in Christ and his mission. The significance of the threefold power of Christ as priest, prophet, and king is that it is through this expression that the salvific mission of God, the ‘testimony of God himself,’ is given its human dimensions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0021140012465038">19</xref></sup> Christians participate in this testimony. According to Wojtyla, ‘this threefold participation is very clearly linked with the Mission which forms the content of Christian testimony.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0021140012465038">20</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section2-0021140012465038">
<title>The Church and the Threefold Mission of Christ</title>
<p>When Wojtyla examined the mission of the Church in detail, he employed the teaching of <italic>Lumen gentium</italic> to emphasize that the Church’s mission is a sharing in the prophetic, priestly, and royal mission of Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0021140012465038">21</xref></sup> In <italic>Christifideles laici</italic>, he linked this threefold mission with the fact that Jesus is the Christ, the ‘Anointed One,’ and Christians are in union with him. Quoting St Augustine, he stated that:
<disp-quote>
<p>Not only has our head been anointed but we, his body, have also been anointed…. therefore <italic>anointing</italic> comes to all Christians…. we are the Body of Christ because we are all ‘anointed’ and in him are ‘christs,’ that is, ‘anointed ones,’ as well as Christ himself, ‘The Anointed One.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0021140012465038">22</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Wojtyla, Christ’s priesthood and our share in it were central to the teaching of Vatican II about the Church, humanity, and the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0021140012465038">23</xref></sup> Moreover, according to him, it is the priestly mission of Christ and of Christians, which most fully and simply expresses who they are:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is … good reason to consider participation in the priesthood of Christ and the attitude that derives therefrom, before turning to the prophetic and kingly aspects. While all these aspects indicate the orientation of the Conciliar enrichment of faith in respect of the attitudes of every Christian, it is participation in the priesthood of Christ, which denotes the simplest and most complete attitude.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0021140012465038">24</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, exactly <italic>why</italic> this is so, what this ‘good reason’ is, is never addressed.</p>
<p>For Wojtyla, every Christian participates in the priesthood and, therefore, the sacrifice of Christ. This participation is ‘not merely a question of external resemblance but the fruit of internal participation and the work of the Holy Spirit.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0021140012465038">25</xref></sup> Through this participation Christians can join with Christ in offering their entire selves and the whole world to God. All the baptized have been consecrated to offer spiritual sacrifices to God, and indeed, to offer their whole selves to God as a sacrifice. Every action of a Christian, especially participation in the Eucharist, if done in the Spirit, becomes a spiritual sacrifice to God and consecrates the world to him.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0021140012465038">26</xref></sup> All the work, prayers, apostolic labours, hardships, family life, and even leisure which is done ‘in the Spirit … become spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0021140012465038">27</xref></sup> During the Eucharist these sacrifices are offered to the Father. The deeds of the laity consecrate the world to God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0021140012465038">28</xref></sup> This offering of themselves and the world to God expresses the essence of faith, for in faith human persons respond to God’s self-revelation and commit their entire selves to God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0021140012465038">29</xref></sup> It was Wojtyla’s belief that this commitment expresses the fundamental vocation of every human person.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0021140012465038">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to Wojtyla, the prophetic mission of Christ, as the incarnate Word, is ‘to express the divine truth in human language.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0021140012465038">31</xref></sup> Because the Church participates in this mission it has a responsibility to the Word of God. For Wojtyla, a ‘prophet is one who speaks in the name of the Lord, who knows the truth contained in the word of God; he bears it in himself, imparts it to others and guards it as his dearest heritage.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0021140012465038">32</xref></sup> Vatican II placed participation in the prophetic mission of Christ on a par with participation in Christ’s priesthood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0021140012465038">33</xref></sup> What makes the prophetic mission distinct is ‘the sense of responsibility towards the gift of truth contained in Revelation.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0021140012465038">34</xref></sup> This sense of responsibility is expressed through the <italic>sensus fidei</italic> (sense of faith). There should be a close harmony between the faith of the faithful and the teaching office of the Church. Both manifest the truth of God and share in the ‘<italic>munus propheticum</italic> [prophetic office] of Christ.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0021140012465038">35</xref></sup> Drawing upon <italic>Lumen gentium</italic>, John Paul II stated that the lay faithful, not just the pastors of the Church, ‘are given the ability and responsibility to accept the gospel in faith and to proclaim it in word and deed.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0021140012465038">36</xref></sup> In doing this, they prophetically point to the future consummation of all things in Christ, allowing the power of the Gospel to shine out in their lives and witness to their hope of future glory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0021140012465038">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Wojtyla’s understanding of the royal mission of the Church was based on his understanding of the kingship of Christ. Drawing on <italic>Lumen gentium</italic>, he began with the point that Christ’s kingship is based on his obedience to his Father. It is because of his obedience unto death that the Father has glorified him as king forever.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0021140012465038">38</xref></sup> There are two aspects to the Christian’s sharing in this kingship. The first is that Christians are called to a ‘royal freedom,’ a freedom from the ‘rule of sin.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0021140012465038">39</xref></sup> They are meant to have the same freedom as Christ has in conquering sin and having a ‘kingly self-rule.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0021140012465038">40</xref></sup> Through this holiness the Christian ‘helps to bring about Christ’s kingdom.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0021140012465038">41</xref></sup> The second aspect has two dimensions. The first is that Christians are called to participate in the mission of the servant-king. ‘This consists of “serving Christ in others,” so that Christians “may in humility and patience bring their brethren to that king” (LG 36).’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0021140012465038">42</xref></sup> This kingship and the development of Christ’s kingdom are further expressed in the Christian’s relationship with the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0021140012465038">43</xref></sup> They are linked with God’s original plan to ‘subdue the earth’ (Gen 1:28), and they involve the transformation of the world through science, technology and civilization. In this way we share in the ‘<italic>munus regale</italic> [royal office] of Christ.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0021140012465038">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>This mission to transform the world was analyzed particularly in <italic>Christifideles laici</italic>. Although this document deals specifically with the vocation of lay people in the Church and world, we know from <italic>Sources of Renewal</italic> that, for Wojtyla, the royal dimension of mission, and, by implication, the priestly, and prophetic dimensions, belong to all the baptized.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0021140012465038">45</xref></sup> The specific areas that he outlines as part of this mission of transformation include the promotion of the dignity of the human person, the inviolable right to life, the right to freedom of conscience and religious freedom, and the recreation of married, family, social, public, economic, and cultural life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0021140012465038">46</xref></sup> In all these ways Christians are called to work for the participation of the human race in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Finally, Wojtyla claimed that the ‘attitudes’ arising from sharing in the threefold mission of Christ are interrelated: ‘It should be noted at the outset that these attitudes inter penetrate and in a certain sense determine one another. They form, so to speak, an organic complex within the fundamental attitude of testimony.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0021140012465038">47</xref></sup> However, he did not specify how these attitudes interpenetrate; rather, he stated that they are difficult to ‘separate and distinguish with precision.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0021140012465038">48</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0021140012465038">
<title>The Church’s Mission to Evangelize</title>
<p>As well as observing that the Church’s mission is to participate in the priestly, prophetic, and royal mission of Christ, John Paul II also notes that ‘the entire mission of the Church … is concentrated and manifested in <italic>evangelization</italic>.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0021140012465038">49</xref></sup> What did he mean by ‘evangelization,’ and how can this be reconciled with his presentation of the Church’s mission as priestly, prophetic, and royal?</p>
<p>Avery Dulles believed that John Paul II’s understanding of evangelization, like that of the Second Vatican Council, was based on pre-conciliar kerygmatic theology, the substance of which is the proclamation of the basic message of salvation through Jesus Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0021140012465038">50</xref></sup> This embodied a significant shift from post-Reformation missiology with its emphasis upon gaining new adherents for the Church and demonstrating, against Protestantism, the divine origin and authority of the Church.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0021140012465038">51</xref></sup> According to Dulles, Pope Paul VI broadened the notion of evangelization put forward by the kerygmatic theologians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0021140012465038">52</xref></sup> He defined evangelization as <italic>the</italic> vocation of the Church.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In his [Paul VI’s] view proclamation and catechesis, while occupying an important place in evangelization, are only one aspect of it (EN 22). Evangelization, moreover, should be directed not simply at individuals but also at cultures, which need to be regenerated by contact with the Gospel (EN 20). The tasks of human development and liberation, according to the apostolic exhortation, are profoundly linked with evangelization, but they are not the same thing. Against all secularizing tendencies, Paul VI warned that evangelization can never be reduced to a merely temporal project (EN 30–34). It must always include a clear and unequivocal proclamation of Jesus as Lord (EN 22). It must be directed to eternal life in God (EN 26, 35).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0021140012465038">53</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Dulles maintained that John Paul II’s understanding of evangelization was in keeping with that of Paul VI and built upon it. Thus, he thought that John Paul II did not just link human development and liberation with evangelization. He pointed out that, at the 1979 Conference of Latin American Bishops, John Paul II identified works on behalf of justice and human promotion as an indispensable part of the Church’s evangelizing mission.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0021140012465038">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, Marcello Zago sees some difference between how Paul VI and John Paul II used the terms ‘evangelization’ and ‘mission’:
<disp-quote>
<p>John Paul II prefers to use the term ‘mission’ to indicate the worldwide activity of the Church, while he reserves the term ‘evangelization’ for the proclamation of the word in all its forms. He emphasizes the fact that missionary activity constitutes a distinct reality from the evangelization of Christians or those who are no longer Christians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0021140012465038">55</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By contrast, in <italic>Evangelii nuntiandi</italic> Paul VI rarely used the term ‘mission.’ For him, ‘evangelization’ <italic>is</italic> the mission of the Church. Thus, according to Zago, Paul VI extended the definition of evangelization further than did John Paul II.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0021140012465038">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>In <italic>Evangelii nuntiandi</italic>, Paul VI used the term ‘evangelization,’ rather than the term ‘mission,’ to define, almost exclusively, the mission of the Church.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0021140012465038">57</xref></sup> By contrast, when John Paul II spoke about the mission of the Church, he used a whole variety of terms which appear to be equivalent to ‘mission of the Church,’ and consequently, to each other. Thus, in <italic>Redemptoris missio</italic> he spoke of ‘the Church’s universal mission,’ ‘missionary thrust,’ ‘new evangelization,’ ‘the work of evangelization,’ ‘apostolate,’ ‘missionary activity’ and ‘missionary evangelization.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0021140012465038">58</xref></sup> In particular, it would appear that John Paul II regarded ‘evangelization’ as synonymous with ‘mission of the Church.’</p>
<p>John Paul II often spoke of mission as an ‘activity.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0021140012465038">59</xref></sup> He also spoke of it in terms of ‘nature’ and ‘purpose.’ So, the missionary thrust belongs to the very ‘nature’ of the Christian life, and the one ‘purpose’ of missionary ‘activity’ is to serve people by revealing to them the love of God that is made manifest in Jesus Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0021140012465038">60</xref></sup> Missionary activity brings newness of life, which is salvation in Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0021140012465038">61</xref></sup> The goal of missionary activity is realizing integral salvation or divine filiation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0021140012465038">62</xref></sup> Missionary activity should communicate new life in Christ to everyone.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0021140012465038">63</xref></sup> The purpose of mission is the proclamation and establishment of God’s Kingdom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0021140012465038">64</xref></sup> One of the central purposes of mission is the establishment of <italic>koinonia</italic> (communion), a fraternal communion, a unity of heart and soul, a human, spiritual, and material fellowship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0021140012465038">65</xref></sup> Missionary activity leads to true liberation, a liberation from ‘all alienation and doubt, from slavery to the power of sin and death.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0021140012465038">66</xref></sup> The universal mission of the Church is to communicate salvation in all its integrity, to communicate the fullness of life, ‘to reveal and communicate the love of God to all people and nations.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0021140012465038">67</xref></sup> To put it more simply, for John Paul II, the nature of the Church’s mission is determined by the nature of God. Mission springs from the Trinitarian communion within God and finds its end in communion with God, beginning in this life and concluding in a final consummation with God in Christ.</p>
<p>In light of these understandings we can analyze, in greater depth, what John Paul II said about missionary activity. Missionary activity—evangelization—is proclaiming Christ and bearing witness to him.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0021140012465038">68</xref></sup> It involves activities such as dialogue, human promotion, commitment to justice and peace, education, care of the sick, and aid to the poor and to children.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0021140012465038">69</xref></sup> Does it follow from this that <italic>every</italic> activity of the Church is missionary? In <italic>Redemptoris missio</italic> John Paul II said that the above activities are a part of the Church’s mission. ‘In carrying on these activities, however, she [the Church] never loses sight of the priority of the transcendent and spiritual realities which are the premises of eschatological salvation.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0021140012465038">70</xref></sup> Even before these activities, mission means witness and a way of life that shines out to others, the witness of fraternal communion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0021140012465038">71</xref></sup> How are we to reconcile this apparent discrimination between two levels of mission; on the one hand, explicit proclamation, witness, and fraternal communion; on the other, activities such as dialogue, human promotion, and commitment to the poor?</p>
<p>The answer lies in John Paul II’s sacramental understanding of witness. The Church is a sacramental sign of the kingdom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0021140012465038">72</xref></sup> The kingdom is already present in the Church as a kind of first fruits, but it is by no means fully consummated in the Church.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0021140012465038">73</xref></sup> Thus the Church both witnesses to the reality of the kingdom already present in it and points to a greater but not yet fulfilled reality; a transcendent, eschatological reality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0021140012465038">74</xref></sup> One could say that every public activity of the Church, indeed, of every Christian, is meant to be a witness to, and sign of, the kingdom.</p>
<p>John Paul II held that the first form of witness is the life of the missionary, of the Christian family, and of the ecclesial community. This witness reveals a new way of living; and it is not limited to ‘the missionary.’ Everyone in the Church can bear this kind of witness, and sometimes it is the only way of being ‘a missionary.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0021140012465038">75</xref></sup> He held that the most appealing form of witness to the world is that of charity to the poor, weak, and suffering. This contrasts with human selfishness and raises precise questions which lead to God and the Gospel. A commitment to peace, justice, human rights, and human promotion can also be a witness to the Gospel, when it is genuinely a sign of ‘concern for persons and is directed towards integral human development.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0021140012465038">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>For John Paul II, the Church engages in these works for human development because of what she is. In them she reveals the kingdom present in her and points to its final fulfilment. Like a sacrament, the Church is both a sign and instrument of something greater. Works for human development are signs, which point to the consummation of communion with God through Christ. John Paul II relates these works to two gestures that are characteristic of Jesus’ mission: healing and forgiving. According to him, the healings performed by Jesus show his compassion in the face of human suffering, but also signify that in the kingdom people will be freed from bodily suffering. Moreover, these healings are a sign of that spiritual salvation, which is liberation from sin, and they invite people to faith, conversion, and forgiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0021140012465038">77</xref></sup> Both the healing and forgiveness that were offered by Jesus were a breaking in of the kingdom amongst us and a sign of a greater, ultimate reconciliation and healing.</p>

<title>Evangelization and the Threefold Mission of the Church</title>
<p>How does ‘evangelization’ fit into the ‘threefold mission’ schema of Vatican II? In <italic>Sources of Renewal</italic> Wojtyla followed <italic>Lumen gentium</italic>’s identification of ‘evangelization’ with the ‘prophetic’ mission of Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0021140012465038">78</xref></sup> Evangelization is a ‘prophetic’ activity.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Christ accomplished his prophetic mission: he was the incarnate Word and expressed divine truth in human language. The Church, as the People of God, participates in that mission…. A prophet is one who speaks in the name of the Lord, who knows the truth contained in the word of God; he bears it in himself, imparts it to others and guards it as his dearest heritage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0021140012465038">79</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to <italic>Lumen gentium</italic>, evangelization is ‘the proclamation of Christ in word and testimony of life.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0021140012465038">80</xref></sup> John Paul II continued this identification of evangelization with the prophetic mission of the Church in both <italic>Christifideles laici</italic> and <italic>Redemptoris missio</italic>. For example, in <italic>Christifideles laici</italic> he wrote: ‘Through the <italic>prophetic mission</italic> of Christ, “who proclaimed the kingdom of his Father by the testimony of his life and by the power of his words” [LG 35], the lay faithful are given the ability and responsibility to accept the gospel in faith and to proclaim it in word and deed.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0021140012465038">81</xref></sup> However, in <italic>Evangelium vitae</italic>, he attempted to give a more thorough-going definition of evangelization, once again, within the framework of the threefold mission. He began the fourth chapter of <italic>Evangelium vitae</italic> with what might be called an exhortation on the need to evangelize. He turned again to the words of Paul VI: ‘evangelization is the grace and vocation proper to the Church, her deepest identity. She exists in order to evangelize.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0021140012465038">82</xref></sup> He then gave his own definition of evangelization as:
<disp-quote>
<p>An all-embracing, progressive activity through which the Church participates in the prophetic, priestly and royal mission of the Lord Jesus. It is therefore inextricably linked to <italic>preaching, celebration and the service of charity</italic>. Evangelization is a <italic>profoundly ecclesial act</italic>, which calls all the various workers of the Gospel to action, according to their individual charisms and ministry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0021140012465038">83</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What follows in the rest of chapter four of <italic>Evangelium vitae</italic> is an attempt to expand upon this definition. In response to Paul VI’s claim that evangelization is <italic>the</italic> vocation of the Church, in <italic>Evangelium vitae</italic>, John Paul II broadened the Council’s notion of evangelization to cover the whole threefold mission, not just the prophetic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0021140012465038">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>How did John Paul II unite the proclamation of the Gospel through preaching, the celebration of the Gospel through liturgy, the practice of the Gospel through holy lives, and the service of charity? How is each of these activities evangelical? The answer is to be found in the verse of Scripture with which he began chapter four of <italic>Evangelium vitae</italic>: ‘You are God’s own people, that you may declare the wonderful deeds of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light (1 Peter 2:9).’ We act according to our nature: because we are truly God’s people, not just by his choice, but by transformation, in order to be true to our own nature we <italic>must</italic> proclaim, celebrate, and live out the Good News of what God has done for us and in us. Every action of the Church should <italic>witness to</italic>, that is, <italic>testify to</italic> the Good News of what God has done for us and to us in Christ. Worship and service, as well as preaching, all proclaim the Good News. In this sense evangelization can be spoken of as ‘an all-embracing progressive activity through which the Church participates in the prophetic, priestly, and royal mission of the Lord Jesus.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0021140012465038">85</xref></sup> Every activity of the Church has, or should have, an evangelizing effect. The Church is the light of the world (Matt 5:14). Everything it does is meant to reveal the salvation of God which is in Christ. In a sense the Church, to be true to its own nature, cannot avoid witnessing to the Gospel, just as a light cannot avoid shining. It can only avoid evangelizing through a denial and rejection of its own ‘messianic’ nature, a kind of spiritual suicide.</p>
<p>Did John Paul II expand his notion of evangelization or was he just using the term in two different, albeit related, senses? Is there a contradiction in his understanding of evangelization?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0021140012465038">86</xref></sup> In <italic>Evangelium vitae</italic> he corrected an anomaly in his understanding of evangelization. This correction was occasioned by two things: the broader definition of evangelization given in <italic>Evangelii nuntiandi</italic> when compared with that found in <italic>Lumen gentium</italic>; and John Paul II’s embrace of the threefold mission schema found in <italic>Lumen gentium</italic>.</p>
<p>As we have seen, in <italic>Lumen gentium</italic>, evangelization is explicitly identified with only one part of the Church’s mission, the prophetic. In <italic>Evangelii nuntiandi</italic>, evangelization is identified as <italic>the</italic> mission of the Church, a position to which John Paul II gave assent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0021140012465038">87</xref></sup> In <italic>Evangelii nuntiandi</italic>, Paul VI did not use the threefold mission model. By using this model John Paul II introduced an apparent contradiction into his statements about evangelization. In some places in his writing evangelization seems to be the entire mission of the Church, in others, only a part. The explicit definition and lengthy analysis of evangel- ization, which he gave in <italic>Evangelium vitae</italic> were an effort to affirm Paul VI’s definition, but within the framework of the threefold mission.</p>

<title>Evaluating the Developments in John Paul II’s Understanding of Evangelization</title>
<p>This development in John Paul II’s understanding of evangelization, occasioned by his attempt to reconcile the statements of Vatican II about the ‘prophetic’ nature of evangel- ization with Paul VI’s identification of evangelization as <italic>the</italic> vocation and mission of the Church, seems reasonable. His reconciliation of these two expositions is a valid development, since, although in <italic>Lumen gentium</italic> the term ‘evangelization’ is used only of the prophetic office, the evangelical witness of the priestly and royal offices of the People of God is implied by the fact that both of these offices witness to the truth about Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0021140012465038">88</xref></sup> Both worship, on the one hand, and holiness and service, on the other, witness to the fact that Christians have been redeemed by Christ, that he is living in them, and that they have been reborn to a new life. The threefold mission, as outlined in <italic>Lumen gentium</italic>, has an inherent potential to bear the identification of evangelization with each of its three parts because of the fundamental unity of the mission. The priestly and royal offices are also prophetic. We proclaim Christ not just by word but by every activity as, we have seen, John Paul II was very much aware of this.</p>

<sec id="section6-0021140012465038">
<title>The Threefold Mission and the ‘New Evangelization’</title>
<p>A perusal of the <italic>Lineamenta</italic> of the Synod reveals that it seeks to establish the nature of a new evangelization, the challenges that face it, and the means of engaging in it. However, the <italic>Lineamenta</italic> has only a single reference to participation in the prophetic mission of Christ, a quotation from <italic>Christifideles laici</italic>, which speaks of the participation of the laity in that mission.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0021140012465038">89</xref></sup> Participation in the priestly and royal mission of Christ and the Church are not mentioned. Perhaps this omission is due to the fact that the Council’s teaching on this threefold mission is to be found in <italic>Lumen gentium</italic> and <italic>Apostolicum actuositatem</italic>, but is not mentioned in <italic>Ad gentes</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0021140012465038">90</xref></sup> Also, in both <italic>Redemptoris missio</italic> and <italic>Christifideles laici</italic>, John Paul II confined his identification of evangelization to participation in the prophetic mission of Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0021140012465038">91</xref></sup> Then again, perhaps the omission should not take us completely by surprise, since, despite the prominence given to the threefold mission in <italic>Lumen Gentium</italic> and in the teaching of Pope John Paul II, Catholic theological reflection upon this mission since the Second Vatican Council has been somewhat sparse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0021140012465038">92</xref></sup> What is surprising, however, is the relative neglect, given the interest in the theology of the laity in Catholic circles since Vatican II. It would seem that part of the neglect is due to a concentration on lay ministry as such and its relationship to the ministry of the ordained.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0021140012465038">93</xref></sup> This may be a case of asking good questions, but not the first questions that should be asked. Should one not look at the mission of believers prior to the mission of lay believers? Does not the question of lay ministry and its relation to ordained ministry run the risk of creating a new version of an old order, with a few ‘lay ministers’ seconded to the clergy on a de facto basis, rather than on an understanding that all lay people are called to be ministers of the grace of God?</p>
<p>Given the importance that is placed on the threefold mission by both <italic>Lumen Gentium</italic> and John Paul II, the suggestion is offered to the Synod Fathers that in developing our understanding of this mission there are three immediate tasks to be undertaken. One is to elucidate how these three offices are specifically related to, and interpenetrate, each other. One can prophetically evangelize through the witness of a kingly self-rule, and one can evangelize through priestly worship in the Spirit. Evangelization can be the ultimate act of serving others, serving others can be an act of worship, and an act of worship can be a service to others. St Paul speaks of himself as the ‘minister [<italic>leitourgon</italic>] of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service [<italic>hierourgounta</italic>] of the gospel of God, so that the offering [<italic>he prosphora</italic>] of the Gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit’ (Rom 15:16).</p>
<p>Another is to clarify the relationship that pertains between the threefold mission of all the baptized and the mission of those in Holy Orders (for those ordained do not cease thereby to be baptized and numbered amongst the faithful, nor does the common priesthood belong only to the laity, but to all the baptized). After all, St Augustine said: ‘To you I am the bishop, with you I am a Christian.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0021140012465038">94</xref></sup> And, indeed, <italic>Lumen gentium</italic> states that ‘everything that has been said of the People of God is addressed equally to laity, religious, and clergy.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0021140012465038">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>A third is to enquire into the validity of John Paul II’s conviction that it is the priestly mission of Christ and of Christians, which most fully and simply expresses who they are. In <italic>Sources of Renewal</italic>, Wojtyla made this point without any preparation or development.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0021140012465038">96</xref></sup> What did he mean by it? If Vatican II placed participation in the prophetic mission of Christ, and by implication also the royal mission, on a par with participation in Christ’s priesthood, as Wojtyla claimed, then in what sense can participation in the priestly mission of Christ most fully and simply express the identity of a Christian?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0021140012465038">97</xref></sup> The two positions would seem to be contradictory. Or is it a case of participation in the priestly office of Christ being foundational for the other two? Is it prior, but not superior, to them?</p>
<p>In carrying out the above tasks it must be borne in mind that the statements in <italic>Lumen gentium</italic> on the three offices create certain difficulties for these tasks. For one thing, the priestly and prophetic offices are dealt with first in the chapter on the People of God as a whole, before the hierarchical nature of the Church and the nature of the laity are addressed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0021140012465038">98</xref></sup> It is only in the chapter on the laity that the nature of the royal office is addressed, along with the priestly and prophetic mission of the laity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0021140012465038">99</xref></sup> Secondly, in dealing with the priestly office of the faithful—before anything has been said about the hierarchical nature of the Church—<italic>Lumen gentium</italic> outlines the relationship between the common priesthood of the faithful and the ministerial priesthood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0021140012465038">100</xref></sup> One could ask if the ordained retain the common priesthood, or if it is subsumed into their ministerial priesthood (so that they exercise the common priesthood in a new way).</p>
<p>The understanding of the threefold mission remains to be integrated with that contemporary understanding of mission which we now call ‘new evangelization.’ If John Paul II was right when he said that evangelization is ‘an all-embracing, progressive activity through which the Church participates in the prophetic, priestly, and royal mission of the Lord Jesus,’ and if it is correct to identify ‘new evangelization’ with the entire contemporary mission of the Church, then it is important that all of the above tasks be undertaken by the Synod Fathers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0021140012465038">101</xref></sup></p>

<title>Living Out the Threefold Mission</title>
<p>This essay will conclude with two final points which, by way of example, attempt to advance our understanding of the threefold mission. The first will be an analysis of John Paul II’s exposition of the threefold mission within the particular context of the value and inviolability of human life. This can be taken as a specific example of a task that needs to be repeated in many other contexts; for example, human social relationships, the value of human work, the practice of ecumenism, inter-religious dialogue, the care of the natural environment, etc. Secondly, the article will suggest that the living out of the Christian life within a new ecclesial movement may be one such incarnation of the threefold mission of believers.</p>
<sec id="section8-0021140012465038">
<title>In the Gospel of Life</title>
<p>At the beginning of the final chapter of <italic>Evangelium Vitae</italic> John Paul II gave a more thorough-going definition of evangelization within the framework of the threefold mission, and he then attempted to develop that definition within the context of the ‘Gospel of Life.’ According to John Paul II, Christians have a ‘duty to <italic>preach the Gospel of life</italic>, to <italic>celebrate it</italic> in the Liturgy and in our whole existence, and to <italic>serve it</italic> with the various programs and structures which support and promote life.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0021140012465038">102</xref></sup> Our first task is prophetic: to proclaim the Gospel of life. Proclaiming Jesus is proclaiming life, since Jesus is the manifestation of <italic>eternal</italic> life, and it is only in <italic>this</italic> kind of life that a person’s earthly life has any meaning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0021140012465038">103</xref></sup> True human life is a life of relationship with the living God and is a gift from God. It is life as God’s gift which makes it sacred and inviolable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0021140012465038">104</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our second task is priestly: to celebrate the Gospel of life. Surprisingly, this begins with a <italic>contemplative</italic> outlook. In order to celebrate the Gospel of life we must grasp its deeper meaning by contemplating ‘its beauty and its invitation to freedom and responsibility.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-0021140012465038">105</xref></sup> This is the outlook that can see life as God’s gift and see in every person the living image of the Creator. This will enable us to ‘revere and honour every person’ and will lead us to praise and thanksgiving for the gift of life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-0021140012465038">106</xref></sup> This should lead us on to celebrating the God who gives eternal life, the divine life from which all other life in creation originates. We are called to thank and praise God the Father for creating us and giving us a share in his glory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-0021140012465038">107</xref></sup> This celebration can be helped by drawing upon ‘the wealth of gestures and symbols that are present in the traditions and customs of different cultures and peoples’ in which they express joy for, respect for, the protection of human life, as well as the ‘hope and desire for immortality.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-0021140012465038">108</xref></sup> Besides the celebration of special times and conditions in human life, we need to celebrate the Gospel of life in our daily living as part of our spiritual worship of God (Rom 12:1). We accept the gift of God’s life and make our lives a sacrifice of praise to him through laying down our lives for others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-0021140012465038">109</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, we can share in Christ’s royal mission of supporting and promoting human life through the service of charity. We are called to love our neighbours, especially the poorest, the most lonely and the most in need (the hungry, the thirsty, the foreigner, the naked, the sick, and the imprisoned, the child in the womb, and the elderly person who is suffering or dying). We are called to continue the Church’s tradition of service to such as these through education and practical initiatives that support human life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn110-0021140012465038">110</xref></sup> The rest of the chapter is devoted to outlining the many ways in which we can do this.</p>
<p>This investigation of John Paul II’s prophetic, priestly, and royal categorization of the service of the Gospel of life reveals that much of the ground covered by him under its prophetic and royal aspects is not new. However, in reflecting upon it, what strikes one is that perhaps the most important insight for our future service of the Gospel of life is the fact that while placing a great emphasis on the prophetic and royal activities which serve life, we have neglected to give the same attention to its priestly service. This is especially so in contemplating the beauty of life and its invitation to freedom and responsibility, in linking natural life with eternal life, and in having an attitude of praise and thanksgiving both. Is this one reason why our efforts in the service of life have not borne all the fruit which we would wish?</p>

<title>In the Emmanuel Community</title>
<p>The Emmanuel Community was established in 1972 by two lay people, Pierre Goursat and Martine Laffite. It is important to make clear that the Community is an <italic>ecclesial</italic>, not a <italic>lay</italic> community. That is, its members come from all states of life: married, single, those consecrated in celibacy, and those in Holy Orders. Members seek to carry out their vocation as Christians, within the Community, by living out three ‘graces’; namely, adoration, compassion, and evangelization. These three graces are seen as being interrelated. One leads to the next. Adoration of Jesus should lead to a drawing close to the heart of Jesus. By drawing close to his heart one’s own heart should develop the same compassion as his, becoming a ‘shepherd’s heart’ for those in need, whether that need be of a material or a spiritual nature. And the greatest need that people have is for Christ himself. Hence compassion ultimately should lead to evangel- ization. Now it seems that these three ‘graces’ could be related to the threefold mission of Christians. Adoration is a ‘priestly’ activity. Having compassion for others is an activity of ‘royal’ service. And bringing the Good News of Jesus to others so that they too can know him as their Lord and God is a ‘prophetic’ activity. The living out of these three ‘graces’ within the Emmanuel Community may also have some relevance to the questions of whether or not those who are ordained continue to share in the ‘common’ threefold mission of the baptized. Within the Community, every member, of <italic>whatever</italic> state of life, meets regularly in small groups called <italic>maisonneés</italic> (households) in order to share how they have been living the ‘graces’ of the Community. All states of life can be found in an individual <italic>maisonneé</italic>. There are no separate meetings for lay people and priests. Both lay people and priests share how they have been praying, showing compassion, and evangelizing.</p>
<p>This brief exposition of the life of the Emmanuel Community is presented as an example, not a template, of how the threefold mission might be lived out. Any other movement, community, congregation, organization, or institution within the Church can reflect on its corporate life and undertake an investigation of the threefold mission of the baptized as lived out within it.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The ‘new evangelization’ is important in grasping the nature of our participation in the threefold mission of Christ. Currently, the Church is faced with three ‘evangelical’ challenges. The first is to realize that <italic>every</italic> believer is called to be an evangelist. The second is to grasp that every believer is <italic>also</italic> someone who needs to be evangelized. The third is to understand that all believers are called to evangelize and be evangelized in <italic>every</italic> aspect of their lives. It is in the face of this last challenge, in particular, that the import- ance of emphasizing the threefold nature of our mission, and of identifying evangelization with all three, is to be found. Our worship of God and service of others are prophetic. Our service of others and proclamation of the Gospel to others give glory to God. Our proclamation of the Gospel to others and worship of God are our service to others. We have never completely forgotten this, but in a secular society which tends to compartmentalize ‘religion’ and regulate it to the private sphere, we may need a particular reminder of this aspect of the universal nature of our mission.</p>
