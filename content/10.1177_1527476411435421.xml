<abstract>
<p>This article explores the role of scripted cable television in the making and remaking of place in the conjuncture of postdisaster crisis and the neoliberal transformation of urban space. I suggest that <italic>Treme</italic> contributes to the remaking of New Orleans by engaging conceptions of authenticity, dwelling on the elements of cuisine, music, and diversity that mark New Orleans as distinctive, and highlighting individual enterprise as a condition of possibility for remaking post-Katrina New Orleans. I also suggest that because it makes for compelling quality television and provides badly needed publicity and temporary economic stimulus for the local economy, <italic>Treme</italic>, the show and the HBO production, through no fault of its own, displaces critical engagement with public policy choices and state-centered redress for economic, cultural, and social injustice and inequality.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago <italic>Frank’s Place</italic>, aired on CBS, promised viewers a televisual account of black life that most had never experienced. As Helen Morgan Parmett notes in this issue of <italic>TVNM, Frank’s Place</italic> was about identity, pride of place, and heretofore little seen complexity within a black community located in New Orleans. With its opening theme music and visual montage, <italic>Frank’s Place</italic> marked New Orleans as a special place, noting in particular its difference from Boston (from which Frank, the lead character played by Tim Reid, had recently arrived). With its exterior shots of neighborhoods like Tremé and the Ninth Ward, <italic>Frank’ Place</italic> tried to give viewers more than a tourist view of New Orleans by focusing on social relations set in Frank’s neighborhood restaurant. As the series settled in for what turned out to be a short run, New Orleans mostly provided the context to explore tensions generated by Frank’s return to the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1527476411435421">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many of us wanted the program to succeed as an example of how to represent the complexity of black life on commercial broadcast television. Despite the network’s cancellation of <italic>Frank’s Place</italic>, traces of the program remain if only as a reference point for what commercial television could do with a serious engagement with black life. Even though <italic>The Cosby Show</italic> dominated this period of black-themed television programming, <italic>Frank’s Place</italic> with its emphasis on black working-class life in New Orleans was a counterweight to NBC’s bid for quality television hooked to black upper middle class normativity as the model of the American Dream. In many respects, taken together <italic>Frank’s Place</italic> and the <italic>Cosby Show</italic> anticipated if not expressed outright the different faces of neoliberal self-sufficiency and entrepreneurialism in the black community.</p>
<p>The HBO original television series <italic>Treme</italic> also generated considerable interest in critical and popular circles. Of course, much has changed in the twenty years since Hugh Wilson and his production team tried to tell complex stories about black, working-class life set in New Orleans. The most consequential event is hurricane Katrina and its aftermath. As scholars, filmmakers, journalists, and activists have detailed, it was not just the force and destruction of the devastating hurricane that accounts for what happened in New Orleans in 2005. What occurred in New Orleans in the wake of Katrina is the result of social, cultural, economic, and public policy choices. Such choices and willful neglect made pre-Katrina New Orleans one of the poorest, racist, violent, and unequal places in the United States (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527476411435421">Woods 2009</xref>, 769). Ironically, a mere three years after Katrina, Illinois Senator Barack Obama, became the first person of African descent elected President of the United States.</p>
<p>In addition to these historic events, there are important shifts in media and television (with which <italic>TVNM</italic> readers are already familiar), including the transformation from a network to a postnetwork institutional structure and the appearance digital and web-based delivery platforms. Then too, in the United States we experienced often subtle, but profound, transformations in the cultural and political discourse of race and difference. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527476411435421">Ruth Wilson Gilmore (2007)</xref> calls this the coupling of difference with power, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527476411435421">David Goldberg (2009)</xref> describes it as the cordoning of race from racism and privileging the analysis and political effects of race rather than racism. That is, concerns with race, its analysis, operation, and effects triumphed over attention to the production, operation, and effects of racism. Indeed, with the election of Barack Obama, one of the most decisive effects of this coupling of difference and power and the separation of race from racism is that legal practices, empirical evidence, and cultural understandings of racism are neither framed nor conveyed in the language of history, structures, and culture, but individuals and intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527476411435421">Perry 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527476411435421">Wise 2010</xref>). While Obama’s election was historic, it also unleashed sustained assaults by conservatives against forms of social relations they defined as nonnormative. Differences of race, sexuality, national origin, and marriage were among the chief targets. Obama’s election gave new impetus to political conservatives to cling to the idea of United States as a panacea of racial equality and postracial equality and opportunity, this despite the marked increases in racial hostility directed at blacks and Latinos, dramatic disparities in economic inequality between whites and people of color, and an increasingly disrespectful public discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527476411435421">Tavernise 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527476411435421">Taylor et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527476411435421">Woods 2009</xref>). Materially this postracial ideal takes form institutionally in color-blind public policies like the elimination of affirmative action, harsher and more punitive immigration laws, and the expansion of the prison industry.</p>
<p>In the political discourse of postrace racial equality, difference (and its representation) plays a pivotal role in narrating—or more likely failing to narrate—the systematic exposure of some segments of the population to increased risk and danger. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527476411435421">Clyde Woods (2009)</xref> might suggest in a variation on Gilmore, some members of black and poor communities systematically face increased risk of premature death, ill health, and social and economic vulnerability such as that depicted in the television news footage of mostly black victims of hurricane Katrina. Cultural accounts of this systematic exposure to vulnerability as a product of individual disposition, personal choice, the lack of entrepreneurial know-how and motivation ignores historical and systematic production of advantage and disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1527476411435421">Wellman 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527476411435421">Woods 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>These are discursive and historical matters, but as Goldberg notes in the discourse of neoliberal race, the language of diversity, multiculturalism, hybridity, and color-blind public policy, the pressure is to be rid of race, to take the antiracial position based on tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527476411435421">Brown 2006</xref>). When the critique of racism is abandoned and replaced with concerns for eliminating or minimizing race, racial tolerance and diversity displaces racism as the object of social and political reform. In the alliance of power and difference, difference is more easily explained, even celebrated as cultural exception (New Orleans as special; see Goldberg 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527476411435421">Gray 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The logic of neoliberalism provides the social form and public policy rationale in the United States for shrinking the public sector and transferring resources and public goods from the most vulnerable to the most advantaged. The cultural expression of the effects of neoliberalism—attacking an incompetent state, demonizing clients of the state, privileging market transactions, and celebrating entrepreneurial subjects—in New Orleans and on its residents are evident even in the series.</p>
<p>In the context of signal events, <italic>Frank’s Place</italic> and now <italic>Treme</italic> continue to do cultural and ideological work. But exactly what kind of work and in whose service? And what, if anything, have we learned about television’s role as Woods put it, in providing intellectual justification, identification with, and emotional attachment to an order built on racial and class subordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527476411435421">Woods 2009</xref>, 74). I want to query television’s staging and enactment of the relationship between difference and power, racism and race. As is the case with several of the pieces in this issue, I am especially interested in the instantiation of the neoliberal project, more precisely, <italic>Treme</italic> as a performance of the neoliberal project of subject making and place making through its regimes of representation. In the case of <italic>Treme</italic>, this is an especially difficult challenge given the high quality of the series, the outstanding track record of its production team, and social power and cultural appeal of loss and trauma. The cultural meaning and discursive work (including its material effects) cannot be disentangled from the question of how to see the neoliberal project or how neoliberalism positions us to see processes like the production of race and the elision of racism, the enclosure of space, and the sense of belonging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527476411435421">Robinson 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>By centering neoliberalism as a framework though which to approach the series, I suggest that in its consistent attention to loss and longing for pre-Katrina multicultural New Orleans and by dwelling on rebuilding and return in post-Katrina New Orleans, <italic>Treme</italic> removes from critical scrutiny some of the very historical, social, and economic relations of power exposed by Katrina. This position asks that we read the series as an alibi for the continuation, in new guise, of a devastating social project, one whose defense requires a new structure of feeling to make sense of that which is lost and being selectively recovered (what some scholars have termed Katrina disaster tourism; see Morgan Parmett and Thomas in this issue). At the same time I wonder what (and how) the series might contribute to forging a different (new?) common sense to challenge the neoliberal orthodoxy (which is also on display in various storylines in the series) about belonging, the past, return, and entitlements?</p>
<p>The pieces collected in this issue of <italic>TVNM</italic> tells us something about the work—cultural, discursive, ideological, and material—that <italic>Treme performs and accomplishes</italic> in a local context preoccupied with security, tourism, branding, and economic restructuring. In addition to the question of the cultural and ideological work performed by <italic>Treme</italic>, the articles in this issue offer examples of critical television writing about <italic>Treme</italic> (especially since <italic>Frank’s Place</italic>) and New Orleans (especially post-Katrina). They illustrate the centrality of media in the (material) production of neoliberal urban space, the performance of neoliberal subjects, and rewriting of the place of New Orleans in the national imaginary. In this regard Morgan Parmett’s and Thomas’s essays in this issue are especially illustrative.</p>
<p><italic>Treme</italic> occupies a position between its location as a small but significant source of economic revitalization, including sustained attention to rebuilding the city and its criticism of the city, state, and national government for indifference to the suffering of residents in the aftermath of the storm.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1527476411435421">2</xref></sup> HBO’s branding and marketing of quality television, their production of space, preoccupation with authenticity and the status of the real, and their self-consciousness about the televisual relationship to place appears in the reoccurring tropes at the center of the series—food and music. New Orleans as hybrid and therefore exceptional defines what is lost in the disaster and what is most desired in its rebuilding. This loss and desire is in tension with the harsh reality of local practices of racial inequality that defined the real New Orleans and the Disneyfication of New Orleans that many feared the series might enable if not produce. This latter concern is expressed directly in the first season of the series in the repeated appeal to the distinction between the fake and the authentic. This negotiation of the authenticity was also frequently staged in the series attention to the question of return for displaced residents and lack of affordable housing to accommodate them.</p>
<p>Programs about place have always been a staple of television. Shows set in New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Boston, and San Francisco are among some of the most memorable in television history, and as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527476411435421">Victoria Johnson (2008)</xref> shows, so too are programs set in the American heartland. Cincinnati and Alaska come to mind and more recently Baltimore, Detroit, Memphis, and Texas in the case of scripted television and places both exotic and mundane in reality television. This role of place in television and the importance of television in making place, brings to mind what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527476411435421">Rebecca Scott (2010)</xref> calls national sacrifice. In her study of the cultural significance of strip mining in West Virginia coal country, Scott argues that places like West Virginia coal country produce the necessary elements for industrial development and national expansion—energy in the case of West Virginia or automobiles in the case of Detroit and a unique cultural history in the case of New Orleans. At the same time, given the twin effects of deindustrialization and the global relocation of major regional industries, in the national imagination these regions and cities have now become (and in some cases always were) “strange” and often dangerous places populated by large concentrations of poor whites, immigrants, and unemployed minority populations and identified with illicit cultures and skyrocketing crime. These spaces are depicted in popular culture, films, and news coverage as spaces of cultural exception by which we measure the normative. In the case of New Orleans, what Woods calls the Bourbon economy is characterized by the systematic isolation, exploitation, and invisibility of black labor on which New Orleans tourism and its cultural status in national narrative depends. Wade Rathke and Courtney George in this issue suggest that this commitment to New Orleans cultural exceptionalism is evident in <italic>Treme</italic>’s consistent and aestheticized depiction of multiracial street parades, black social clubs, hybrid music, and Indian costumes. What the series does not show is that with these “precious” and “real” traditions that are in danger of being sacrificed comes crushing poverty, economic isolation, food injustice, and social inequality among the very people who are the source of these unique gifts to the nation.</p>
<p>As <italic>Treme</italic> sometimes suggested in its first season, these questions are not just about matters of television’s representations of authenticity and the real measured against the Disneyfication of New Orleans. Until it was superseded by energy—the gas and oil industries—tourism was the major engine of the local economy. In <italic>Treme</italic>’s account of recovery, the writers use the debate over authenticity to address some of the larger questions of economic revitalization and social justice. Storylines explore who controls tourism (politicians, developers, gentrifiers, new arrivals to the city) and given the region’s depressed economy what kind of tourism is ethically acceptable and financially profitable (heritage tourism, disaster tourism). In its consistent attention (both on and off the screen) to the challenges of securing and sustaining employment for local cultural workers (musicians, workers in the hospitality, and food industries) who depend on the tourist economy, the show celebrates the aspirations, hard work, and enterprise of individual members of the community. In its first season, the narrative arc of the series locates this kind of individual enterprise in the market, beyond a local, state, or federal government that is at best indifferent and at worst incompetent, corrupt, and preoccupied with defending its self-image. What sense of public “commons” there is, in typical neoliberal fashion, is managed and represented by the market.</p>
<p><italic>Treme</italic> plays an important role as well in the material and spatial production of post-Katrina New Orleans. <italic>Frank’s Place</italic> operated within the locus of a politics of identity defined by struggle over representation (e.g., access, variety, and complexity of the image) and a bid by people of color for greater visibility. <italic>Treme</italic>’s production impacts the local economy materially. Hence as Morgan Parmett shows, <italic>Treme</italic> expresses (“celebrates” would not be too strong) the ethic of individual enterprise in its story lines and principal characters and its very presence as an on-location production generates opportunities for community partnerships, businesses projects, and marketing the show, the city, and individual cast members. This enterprise—putting people to work locally, celebrating the local culture and history, working with local organizations and generating branding and publicity opportunities for events like Jazz fest and Mardi Gras produced a much needed boost for the local economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527476411435421">Watts and Porter, forthcoming</xref>). (The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527476411435421">2011</xref> Monterey Jazz Festival featured ‘An Afternoon in Treme’ that focused on the music of Kermit Ruffins, Glen David Andrews, the Dumpinstaphunk and the Soul Rebel all “real performers’ featured in the series. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527476411435421">Monterey Jazz Festival, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the economic restructuring of the city, the reduction of its population through rezoning and the destruction of affordable housing, the defunding of the state and reduction of city services, the extension of tax breaks for oil and gas interests, and the privatization of safety and security, I can’t help wondering if the kind of enterprise represented by the local presence of <italic>Treme</italic>’s production company, at least for the city’s unemployed residents, isn’t a bit like the periodic gigs (at the airport or strip clubs) sought by the city’s working musicians, just enough to get by. In the absence of a public policy commitment and infrastructure of resources that could sustain long-term safety, employment, housing, and services for the city’s poorest residents, then anything, even occasional work for a television production company is better than nothing. In this sense the series seems almost prescient in showing itinerant work and casual labor as the new normal for the city’s black and poor citizens. Against the backdrop of this kind of disposability and economic insecurity, the celebration of individual enterprise goes some way to assure tourist and local consumers of the safety and stability of post-Katrina New Orleans. In the face of this neoliberal restructuring, <italic>Treme</italic> the television show and <italic>Treme</italic> the television production is, for the moment, important to the economic success of the city and within the televisual landscape it helps viewers affectively connect to New Orleans.</p>
<p>In the transition from the network to the postnetwork period of broadcast television, start-up net-lets like FOX, WB, UPN successfully drew on black themed programming to establish profitable niches in urban markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1527476411435421">Zook 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527476411435421">Jennifer Fuller (2010)</xref> suggests that more recently cable operators like HBO used the model of mini-networks of the 1980s, effectively fusing risky and innovative approaches, black themed programming, and claims to quality television to form a distinct brand identity. In this world of building brands black themed shows like <italic>The Wire, Treme</italic>, and documentaries now appeal to a specific market niche, lifestyle, and aesthetic sensibility. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527476411435421">Sarah Banet Weiser (2007)</xref> argues too, that in the context of branding and consumer citizenship, blackness has come to signify a lifestyle—urban, youth, hip, music, and fashion. Fuller and Banet Weiser’s important insight prompts me to ask about <italic>Treme</italic>’s discursive production of blackness and the kinds of claims <italic>Treme</italic> makes about its representation of race and blackness in the postracial, neoliberal discourse.</p>
<p>The cultural practices that define New Orleans are unmistakably black and hybrid. Yet <italic>Treme</italic> makes multicultural claims about the place of race in New Orleans. The series is especially attentive to the cultural and historical significance of blackness in the particular history of the city and the United States. In season one, this appeal to multicultural New Orleans (rather than the critique of a racist city) was expressed dramatically in story lines that addressed the threat posed by immigrant Latino workers to the historic role of black labor in the city, the tensions between black community members and hipster whites, the patronizing attitude of middle-class black city officials toward poor and displaced black residents. As opposed to historic and cumulative racial disadvantage experienced by poor blacks, this emphasis is very much in keeping with the postracial separation of race from racism suggested by Goldberg and the celebration of New Orleans’ multiracial exceptionalism so vital to its tourist economy.</p>
<p>In a postracial discourse that claims that the most blatant expressions and effects of racism are now a thing of the past, the effects of persistent poverty and immiseration especially for blacks, when made manifest as Katrina did so dramatically, puts cultural difference (rather than racism) in the service of the neoliberal project. For example, in its first season the series establishes that the problems facing post-Katrina New Orleans are not just about race in general and blacks in particular. Rather, with its focus on the central characters from various walks of life, of ages, professions and races, the series intimates that all of the city’s residents (wealthy, middle-class professionals, students) have a stake in returning the city’s black cultural traditions to their full glory. A consistent theme of the articles assembled in this issue of <italic>TVNM</italic> is that within the post-Katrina tourist economy, <italic>Treme</italic>, the series, plays a major role in telling (and selling) of the special story of the city and its people. Brand-ready tropes like regional cuisine, music, and social (parade) rituals help sell the city and the culture.</p>
<p>What kind of city and cultural traditions does the series help brand and market? Rathke and George (this issue) point to the relationship of local and regional music spatially and temporally to the New York jazz scene, which offers a particularly artful illustration around questions of authenticity, purity, and tradition. I want to suggest that local and regional music functions as a kind of sound track to the series and to what was lost in the storm. In beautiful scenes, story lines, characters, and musical performances, the music moves between New York City and New Orleans (including local venues set in neighborhoods, outlying towns, social clubs, and street corners). In almost all of these, New Orleans is authentic, pure, origin, uncontaminated, a wellspring of precious traditions. New York is the place of success, of headlines, and recognition. Though eternally connected to the local, the traditional, the authenticity of home, New York is the testing ground of serious musicians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1527476411435421">3</xref></sup> As a metaphor for New Orleans, this seems to express Tremé’s anxiety about the loss of tradition and against remaking New Orleans. Somewhat ironically by celebrating tradition and repeatedly staking claims for its authenticity, compared to NYC, Tremé makes New Orleans infinitely brandable and marketable. Is this is the work of recovery?</p>
<p>But what about reimagining, reinventing, breaking down the binary not in the name of tracking down and protecting authenticity, but in the name of recovery, by reinventing anew. Is recovery, we might ask, the same as reinvention? And what kind of city should the people of New Orleans (re)imagine and (re)build for New Orleans to become not just a tourist destination for heritage and disaster tourism but a key point in a global network of cultural, social, and economic transaction as cultural historians Lewis Watts and Eric Porter (forthcoming) suggest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1527476411435421">4</xref></sup> Such a relationship is less zero-sum than dialogic and fluid nurtured, in the thicket of strange combinations and new amalgamations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527476411435421">Flores 2009</xref>). In this sense, New Orleans like its musical worlds and cultures refuses the strictures of purity and contamination, the modern and the historical. Mixture, encounter, and amalgamation whether expressed in culinary or musical form depends on the deployment of traditional forms (rather than the pure) in the service of what is available to make something new (rather than authentic). New York (and for that matter Mexico, Haiti, and Cuba) is less an ideal of the modern than a node of exchange in the global circulation of culture and people. In this sense the “new” in both York and Orleans signals becoming and exchange rather than a destination.</p>
<p>As a television text, can <italic>Treme</italic> interrupt, or at the very least comment on, the structural and historical forces that contribute to its very presence in the city? Would it? As a cultural text, the series does not seem to have a cultural language with which to represent the transformation and effects of basic infrastructure of New Orleans that goes beyond corruption, indifference, and incompetence, as one of the contributors contends the show’s writers did with Baltimore in <italic>The Wire</italic>. Fighting to expose and to eliminate individual corruption and incompetence, like struggling for or against race rather than against racism, can appear to endorse, even celebrate, the triumph of neoliberal individual enterprise.</p>
<p>How then to read subtle and complex commercial broadcast and cable television texts for their defense and justification of neoliberal accounts of the steady erosion of social life, especially for the most disadvantaged and exploited members of society? In this sense, I am interested in <italic>Treme</italic>’s as a complex example of critical writing about New Orleans especially in terms of its role in seeming to endorse and naturalize the alliance of blackness, neoliberalism, and television. But this is not the only language available with which to write New Orleans. Woods, the late UC Santa Barbara scholar who wrote so eloquently and passionately about New Orleans, was also on the lookout for cultural practices that write New Orleans differently. Woods looked to grassroots community-based activists who worked with social and cultural organizations deploying the music, poetry, local practice, and cuisine of its black and hybrid cultures to organize, advocate, and reimagine New Orleans. Not the pre-Katrina conditions of racism and poverty but a more dialogic, equitable, open, and democratic New Orleans.</p>
<p>I laud <italic>Treme</italic>’s critical attention to corruption, gentrification, racial hostility, and its attempts to address the difficulties of return, disappearance, degraded services, and unemployment in New Orleans. As the pieces in this special issue observe, the series is constrained by the conventions of the form and perhaps more importantly by its own imbrication within a neoliberal project. As Fuller observes, HBO has turned black-themed programming into quality television, and independent filmmakers like Spike Lee have an outlet for their work. This is all very much in keeping with the entrepreneurial neoliberal project of branding and marketing blackness as quality television. So the alliance of <italic>Treme</italic> and <italic>The Wire</italic>, Spike Lee, and other projects in the cable sector of television makes sense. As I have suggested already, this essential alliance helps to shore up a kind of neoliberal common sense, which, in the case of New Orleans, depends on enclosure of wealthy populations and isolation of the poor, the transfer of public assets to the wealthy, the intensification of security and regulation and defends, justifies, and renders that economy and the social relations of race and class on which it depends as natural and inevitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527476411435421">Robinson 2007</xref>). Still, despite these political economic moves and the alliance of the cable sector, image culture, and neoliberalism, grassroots community-based stories, experiences, social relationships, and practices remain a source of alternative and emergent possibilities. In the alliance of risk, quality television, and blackness, <italic>Treme</italic>’s writers and producers can well turn to the hidden histories, diasporic connections, and memories that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527476411435421">Watts and Porter (forthcoming)</xref> suggest form the basis for writing New Orleans not as an exception and reminder of national shame but a new way of imagining citizenship and belonging.</p>
<p>Scholars spanning fields as varied as African American studies, media studies, American Studies, and cultural studies have been working with concepts like excess (rather than the limits of representation), and the performance and enactments of subjectivities (rather than the construction of identity) to rethink the relationship between visual cultures and blackness. Rather than the struggle for visibility and recognition represented by some of the early television scholarship on <italic>Frank’s Place</italic> (including my own), the concepts of racial excess and performance, particularly given the degraded cultural status of the black body within the normative regime of visual cultures, is a promising site of interruption and perhaps even the basis of emergent and alternative possibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527476411435421">Fleetwood 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1527476411435421">Williamson 2011</xref>). Just as the presence of the production company in New Orleans results in material effects locally, at the very least, the excessive and the unruly have the potential to call out the normative and the regulatory work of television within the discourse of postracial neoliberalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527476411435421">Summers 2011</xref>). Perhaps this is just the kind of writing that <italic>Treme</italic> and critical writing about <italic>Treme</italic> can perform (even unwittingly) in the context of the alliance of neoliberalism and race. A series like <italic>Treme</italic> can interrupt and maybe even on occasion force into view the normative work of possessive individualism, market supremacy, disaster tourism, the loss of the commons, and their devastating impact on ordinary people. Even if only momentary, such a disruption can make space for conceptions of community that do not aim to rebuild on the same old edifice of Bourbon plantation relationships but rather reimagine New Orleans anew. In this sense, both <italic>Treme</italic> the television series and critical writing about the series contained in this issue offers another opportunity for a different telling.</p>

<p>Nowhere else on television can I see the great jazz bassist Ron Carter, saxophonist Donald Harrison, pianist Allen Toussaint, trumpeter Kermit Ruffins, and Doctor John Rabinack.

<p>This tension between the real and the fake, the hybrid history and the modern racial politics is revealing in the series’ casting of the black Haitian sous chef as a proxy for the rich and diverse local traces of French, Spanish, and West African presence in the history and contemporary culture of the city’s black population.</p></fn>
