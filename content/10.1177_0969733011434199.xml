<p>If there’s one particular thing that stands out in my memory each year after delivering papers on ethics to groups of undergraduate and postgraduate nursing students, it’s the rapt attention that they invariably give to a morally focused case study or nursing narrative. When this occurs, it is as if the unfolding events of the study become a temporary reality for them, and they seem to relive each new development in the story with deep interest. Subsequently, whether it’s a story from my own past experiences, another nurse’s story, or one of their own stories from practice, the effect is always very similar – we seem to experience that sometimes elusive but highly prized ‘pedagogical moment’ together.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733011434199">2</xref></sup> I have long presumed that this is because most nurses share their stories with each other as a way of personally relating what it means to face a significant ethical dilemma from both a personal<italic> and </italic>a nursing perspective. In this regard, nurses are only too willing to offer their ethical interpretations of any given issue, as for them at least, realistic ethical narratives are a major pathway towards the development of better practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733011434199">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011434199"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733011434199">5</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The power of stories about moral meaning and ethical actions should never be underestimated. Often, even though such stories have occurred several years ago, the particular circumstances and events are usually well remembered by each narrator as if it were yesterday. It is as if the narrator needs not only to remember such incidents over time, but to reflect on them, reconsider them, and most importantly of all, to learn from them. In the retelling, it is as if their hard learnt lessons demand to be repeated for others not only to consider, but to absorb, meditate upon and recall within their own ‘real world’ health care practices. Hence, the well-told narrative or case study can be much more than reflection on practice; it can also be a testimony of the value of ethics within shared practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011434199">6</xref></sup> </p>
<p>Yet, what is the ‘real world’ exactly, who exactly is the story teller, and what is the purpose of their story? My own students accept all stories that strike a note of realism with them whether they come from nurses, patients or other sources. What seems to matter to them is not just the possibility to reflect upon the depth of human relations and interactions that is inherent within multiple realities and dimensions, but the added possibility of future transformations through praxis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733011434199">7</xref></sup> That is, a critical analysis of in-depth narratives not only allows the participants to acknowledge the wide range of responses that are found not only within social and personal ways, but to also develop insights that may lead to transformative practice. In such a fashion, the interconnectedness of the past, present, future, personal, and professional becomes as one. An expertly retold and analysed narrative is therefore a powerful metaphor for the moral quandaries that may face each one of us <italic>and</italic> a stimulus for improving the professionally focused ethical experiences of us all.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733011434199">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>So it is that in this brief editorial, I wish to raise the flag in support of those articles that illustrate the value of case studies, or as I would prefer, stories or narratives about ethics in health care practices. This is then, a call for <italic>your</italic> narrative, or those stories of others that you have absorbed over time; it is also a request for your article that offers an analysis of a particular case that may help others to improve their own ethical practice. Thus, between us, we can fill the perceived gap between theory and practice with not just mere description or endless philosophical speculations, but with focussed reflection, analysis and continuing mindfulness that should invariably lead to better ethical decision making and ultimately improved nursing care for all. </p>
