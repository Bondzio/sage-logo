<abstract>
<p>This study aims to determine the contributing factors for early childhood overweight/obesity within the contexts of the child’s home, school, and community, and to determine how much each of the ecological contexts contributes to childhood overweight/obesity. The framework was developed from Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory. Data for 2,100 children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort, were used in a series of multilevel modeling analyses. There was significant variation in childhood overweight/obesity by school and community. The majority of variation in childhood overweight/obesity was explained by the child and family factors in addition to school and community factors. Explained variance of childhood overweight/obesity at the school level was 27% and at the community level, 2%. The variance composition at children’s family level alone was 71%. Therefore, overweight/obesity prevention efforts should focus primarily on child, family, and school factors and then community factors, to be more effective.</p>

<p>Over the past 30 years, the prevalence of childhood obesity has increased substantially in the United States. From 1976 to 2008, the prevalence of obesity in children, ages 2 to 5, increased from 5% to 10.4% and for ages 6 to 11, from 6.5% to 19.6% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945913480275">Ogden &amp; Carroll, 2010</xref>). The growing rise in childhood obesity prevalence, especially in the younger age group, raises considerable concerns about the short- and long-term negative health consequences for these children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945913480275">Daniels, 2006</xref>) because obese children are more likely to develop severe obesity and chronic diseases as adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945913480275">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2011a</xref>). To address the obesity problem, previous research has identified the period of adiposity rebound (AR), the lowest point of body mass index (BMI) that occurs at 5 to 7 years of age as one of the critical periods in developing obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945913480275">Dietz, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945913480275">Drohan, 2002</xref>). Obesity occurring at this period persists into adulthood and increases risk of obesity-related complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945913480275">Dietz, 1994</xref>). To prevent current early childhood and adulthood obesity, it is critical that children in the AR period receive special attention from health care providers. In addition, providers need to understand how to manage potential factors responsible for the development of obesity in early life.</p>
<p>A number of studies have identified the influential factors for childhood overweight and obesity. These previous studies generally examined simple relationships between childhood obesity and the predictors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945913480275">Davison &amp; Birch, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945913480275">Hawkins &amp; Law, 2006</xref>). Studies to date have not simultaneously examined the influences from the child’s multiple ecological contexts, such as family, school, and community. It is extensively acknowledged that childhood obesity is the result of a multifactorial etiology involving individuals and environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945913480275">CDC, 2011b</xref>). Therefore, it is important to understand potentially contributing factors in the development of childhood overweight and obesity from the multiple contexts in which children live. The purpose of this study was to determine the contributing factors for childhood overweight/obesity at kindergarten entry within the contexts of the child’s home, school, and community and to determine the degree to which each ecological context contributes to childhood overweight/obesity.</p>
<p>The theoretical framework of this study was developed from the ecological systems theory (EST; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945913480275">Bronfenbrenner, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945913480275">1989</xref>). In the EST, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945913480275">Bronfenbrenner (1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945913480275">1989</xref>) considers a person as being at the center of nested structures of the ecological environment: the micro-, meso-, exo-, and macrosystems. Change in one level of ecological system could affect the other levels and could influence a child’s developmental outcomes directly or indirectly through multiple contextual changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945913480275">Bronfenbrenner, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945913480275">1989</xref>). For children, an ecological environment includes the family and school, which in turn is surrounded by larger social contexts, including the community and society at large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945913480275">Davison &amp; Birch, 2001</xref>). In previous studies, an ecological model was used in various areas related to childhood obesity problem, for example, to organize a review of the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945913480275">Davison &amp; Birch, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945913480275">Lobstein, Baur, &amp; Uauy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0193945913480275">Story &amp; Neumark-Sztainer, 2002</xref>), to guide studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945913480275">Gable &amp; Lutz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193945913480275">Reifsnider, Bishop, Ethington, &amp; Ruffin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193945913480275">Reifsnider, Keller, &amp; Gallagher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193945913480275">Reifsnider &amp; Ritsema, 2008</xref>), and to guide the obesity intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945913480275">Black, Siegel, Abel, &amp; Bentley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945913480275">Eisenmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945913480275">Jeor, Perumean-Chaney, Sigman-Grant, Williams, &amp; Foreyt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193945913480275">Niederer et al., 2009</xref>); however, no previous published research uses secondary data analysis guided by EST to study early childhood overweight/obesity in multiple ecological contexts simultaneously. Previous researches using secondary data analysis have identified the associated factors for childhood overweight and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945913480275">Huus, Ludvigsson, Enskar, &amp; Ludvigsson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945913480275">Maher, Li, Carter, &amp; Johnson, 2008</xref>). For this study, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0193945913480275">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the application of EST to early childhood overweight/obesity to guide this research. It presents a model of the variables of interest based on the results of previous research assessing early childhood obesity in combination with EST. Variables of interest are conceptualized in the family, school, and community environment.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The study was a secondary analysis of the data set from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945913480275">National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)</xref>. The ECLS-B is a nationally representative sample of children born in 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945913480275">Bethel, Green, Kalton, &amp; Nord, 2005</xref>). Data were collected in five data-collecting waves, starting the cohort when children were about 9 months of age, and following them until they entered kindergarten. The ECLS-B uses a multistage, stratified, and clustered design for data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945913480275">Bethel et al., 2005</xref>). Samples were selected from U.S. birth certificates. Certain populations were oversampled, including low birth weight, very low birth weight, twins, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Chinese, and Asian/Pacific Islanders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945913480275">Nord, Edwards, Andreassen, Green, &amp; Wallner-Allen, 2006</xref>). In this study, to identify unique variables during the prenatal period, the first year of life, and kindergarten entry, cross-sectional data from birth certificates, 9-month, kindergarten-2006, and kindergarten-2007 waves were used. The 9-month wave (data collected in fall of 2001-2002) of the original study included about 10,700 children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193945913480275">Snow et al., 2009</xref>). About 7,000 children participated in the kindergarten-2006 wave (2006-2007 school year) and about 1,700 participated in the kindergarten-2007 wave (2007-2008 school year; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193945913480275">Snow et al., 2009</xref>). To address the purpose of this study and for children to be eligible for data analysis, they could not have any missing information on BMI at kindergarten entry and for any of the explanatory variables. Children with missing data were excluded from the analysis. Tests for significant differences for the baseline characteristics for the excluded and included groups were conducted. According to the ECLS-B restricted-use data license, the unweighted sample size number must be rounded to the nearest 50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945913480275">NCES, n.d.</xref>). As a result, the reported sample size is an approximated number.</p>
<sec id="section2-0193945913480275">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Child weight status (overweight/obese vs. nonoverweight/nonobese) at kindergarten entry was used as an outcome variable. From the ECLS-B original study, all physical measurements were determined multiple times by trained interviewers using standardized protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945913480275">Najarian, Snow, Lennon, &amp; Kinsey, 2010</xref>). To determine the child’s weight, the child took off shoes and wore light clothes to stand unassisted on the SECA® scale. The child’s weight was recorded in kilograms (kg). The child’s height was measured in centimeters (cm) with a SECA®-portable stadiometer. Data on weight and height were recorded into computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI). The mathematical averages for weight and height were used to determine BMI using the following formula: BMI = (weight in kg / [height in cm]<sup>2</sup>) × 10,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945913480275">Najarian et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, children’s BMIs from the 2006 and 2007 kindergarten waves were combined. Two binary categories were used for children’s weight-status classifications using the BMI-for-age weight-status categories from CDC. Children with BMIs less than the 85th percentile were identified as nonoverweight/nonobese and children who had BMIs equal to the 85th percentile or equal to or greater than the 95th percentile were classified as overweight/obese.</p>
<p>Explanatory variables were drawn from the children’s family, school, and community variables. Family variables included (a) child’s characteristics and early life factors, (b) child’s factors during kindergarten, and (c) child’s family and parental factors. These data were collected from birth certificates and parent questionnaires from the 9-month, kindergarten-2006, and kindergarten-2007 waves. The children’s race in this study was a composite variable: Y1CHRACE. The race of mother was drawn from birth certificates. Characteristics of participants are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913480275">Table 1</xref>. For data analysis, most explanatory variables drawn from the original ECLS-B data file were reclassified (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193945913480275">Table 2</xref>). Children’s race was classified as White, Black, Hispanic (including race-specified and no-race-specified Hispanic groups), and Other (including Asian, Native Hawaiian/other Pacific islander, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and more than one race, non-Hispanic group). Maternal weight gain during pregnancy was classified into a binary categorical variable based on the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945913480275">Institute of Medicine (IOM; 2009)</xref> pregnancy weight guidelines. Maternal weight status was determined using weight information from the kindergarten wave; using CDC criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193945913480275">CDC, 2011c</xref>), weight status was classified into the following four BMI categories: underweight (below 18.5), normal weight (18.5-24.9), overweight (25.0-29.9), and obese (30.0 and above). In the child’s school level, variables were extracted from the Common Core of Data (CCD), which collected the data from the public schools. The school variables included the following: total numbers of students, pupil/teacher ratio, school type, and school location (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193945913480275">Table 2</xref>). The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) county codes were used as a community variable.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Multilevel modeling was used for the data analysis. As suggested by the EST, children (first level) were conceptualized as being nested within <italic>schools</italic> (second level), and then nested within <italic>communities</italic> (third level). In this study, we included child characteristics and family factors in the first level because the majority of data was derived from only one child in the family. Multilevel logistic regression was used to explain the binary child weight status using three models. Model 1 was the empty/unconditional model, which had no predictor variable at any level. The empty model was used to determine how variations in childhood overweight/obesity could be contributed by the three different levels: child’s family, school, and community levels. Next, the conditional models were estimated in Models 2 and 3. In Model 2, the child’s family-level variables were included as predictors in a series of multilevel logistic regression model. In Model 3, the child’s family-level and school-level variables were included. The aim of the conditional model was to identify the variations in childhood overweight/obesity between schools and communities after controlling for the child’s family and school variables.</p>
<p>Multilevel logistic models were estimated using “xtmelogit” commands in the STATA software package, version 11 (STATA, College Station, Texas). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the variance decomposition were used to present the effect of the school and community contexts on childhood overweight/obesity, adjusted for individual children’s families and school variables. The ICC for the multilevel logistic regression model can be defined as <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-0193945913480275">

In multilevel modeling, the variance was split to explain the variation in childhood overweight/obesity in each level. The total variance in the three-level model is the sum of the variance components at all three levels given by σ=(π<sup>2</sup>/3)+σ<sub>A</sub>+σ<sub>B</sub>, where σ<sub>A</sub> is the variance at the school level, and σ<sub>B</sub> is the variance at the community level. For ECLS-B database, data were collected based on a complex survey design. The children’s demographic characteristic statistics were estimated by applying the sampling weight provided in the ECLS-B to the file for appropriate inference; the results were presented in weighted and unweighted information.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>After excluding children with missing values, the number of children in the analytic sample was 2,100, the number of schools was 1,742, and the number of counties was 533. The sample size per school ranged from 1 to 5, with an average of 1.2; the sample size per community ranged from 1 to 71 with an average of 3.91. The children’s ages ranged from 58.1 to 81.9 months (<italic>M</italic> age = 68 months; <italic>SD</italic> = 0.09). Comparing participants and nonparticipants, we found significant differences in child’s race, parents’ highest education level, and household income. When applying sampling weight to the data analysis, more than half the children were non-Hispanic White (51.9%), with 32.6% classified as overweight/obese and 65% of the parents had achieved a vocation/tech program/some college or higher. The majority of children (73.5%) came from households with incomes of more than US$25,000. The sample characteristics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913480275">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>The estimated results of the three-level model, with school and community variations for childhood overweight/obesity, and the estimated effects of the explanatory variables are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193945913480275">Table 2</xref>. The <italic>p</italic> value for the Wald-chi-square test (fixed effect parameters) in Models 2 and 3 were less than 0.0001, which indicated that significant amounts of variance in the childhood overweight/obesity were accounted for by the explanatory variables in the model. From random effect parameters, the <italic>p</italic> values for the likelihood-ratio test were less than .001, .0013, and .0012 for Models 1, 2, and 3, respectively; these results indicated that the proportion of variation in childhood overweight/obesity varied significantly by school and community. In Model 1, the empty model, the estimated variances in childhood overweight/obesity were 1.31 (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.55) at the school level and 0.18 (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.10; ICC = .28, .05) at the community level.</p>
<p>In the conditional models, Models 2 and 3, after adjusting for the children’s family-level and school-level factors, there remained less unexplained school-level and community-level variation, but the remaining variations between the school and community levels were still significant at less than the 5% level. In Model 2, after adjusting for the children’s family-level factors, the total remaining variance in childhood overweight/obesity was 1.19 (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.55) at the school level and 0.12 (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.1) at the community level; the explained variance for childhood overweight/obesity with the children’s family-level factors was 25.87% at the school level and 2.61% at the community level. In Model 3, after adjusting for children’s family-level and school-level factors, the total variance in childhood overweight/obesity was 1.24 (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.56) at the school level and 0.11(<italic>SE</italic> = 0.1) at the community level; the explained variance of childhood overweight/obesity with children’s family-level and school-level factors was 26.72% at the school level and 2.37% at the community level. The variance composition at the children’s family level was 68.8% in Model 1, 71.52% in Model 2, and 70.91% in Model 3.</p>
<p>According to the estimated results of Models 2 and 3, the variation in childhood overweight/obesity was explained mainly by the child’s family-level factors, including the child’s race, birth weight, fruit-eating behavior, maternal weight gain during pregnancy, maternal weight status, and household income (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193945913480275">Table 2</xref>). Children were more overweight/obese if they were Hispanic or of other minority races, their birth weight was more than 4,000 grams, they ate fruit fewer than 2 times per day, the maternal weight gain during pregnancy was more than the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945913480275">IOM (2009)</xref> recommendation, the maternal weight status was categorized in the overweight and obese group, and the household income was US$25,000 or less. However, in Model 3, the child school characteristics of number of students, student/teacher ratio, school type, and school location were not significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study reported the influencing factors for early childhood overweight/obesity within the contexts of the child’s home, school, and community. According to the results from the fixed effects part, factors that explained the variation in children’s weight status in this study were found to be consistent with the previous research on early childhood obesity. Hispanic children (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945913480275">Maher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0193945913480275">Salsberry &amp; Reagan, 2005</xref>) were more likely to be overweight or obese than White children. High maternal weight gain during pregnancy (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945913480275">C. Li, Goran, Kaur, Nollen, &amp; Ahluwalia, 2007</xref>) and high birth weights for the children were related to weight gain during the early childhood period (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945913480275">Dubois &amp; Girard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945913480275">C. Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945913480275">Maher et al., 2008</xref>). Children of overweight or obese parents were at increased risk of overweight or obesity (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945913480275">Dorosty, Emmett, Cowin, &amp; Reilly, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945913480275">Dubois &amp; Girard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945913480275">Fernald &amp; Neufeld, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193945913480275">He, Ding, Fong, &amp; Karlberg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945913480275">Jouret et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, low household income also contributed to higher BMI in children (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945913480275">Maher et al., 2008</xref>), perhaps due to the limitations in resources and accessibility to affordable healthy foods.</p>
<p>The findings from this study confirmed the results of previous research about the influential factors for early childhood obesity and support the implementation of an existing IOM guideline to prevent childhood obesity. Maternal weight and maternal weight gain during pregnancy were significantly related to childhood overweight/obesity at kindergarten entry. To prevent a child from having a weight problem, maternal weight gain during the pregnancy period should be monitored. Appropriate health education to prevent excessive weight gain should be provided for pregnant women to maintain weight gain within the normal range based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945913480275">IOM’s (2009)</xref> gestational weight guidelines. In addition, because mothers can play a critical role in children’s nutrition and can be role models for children’s eating and exercise behaviors, maternal weight problems can influence a child’s weight status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945913480275">Durmus et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, it is important for health care professionals to assess the dietary and physical activity of the family and design family interventions that include mother and child in the intervention programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945913480275">Jeor et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, the findings indicated that children from low-income and/or ethnic minority families are at significantly greater risk of overweight/obesity. Thus, tailored health care interventions that promote healthy nutrition and physical activity from an early age should focus on children within these groups to prevent them from developing weight problems and to help them achieve healthy weight status. This study also found that children who ate fruit fewer than 2 times per day were more likely to be overweight/obese. As a result, promoting children’s consumption of a diet rich in nutritional foods, such as fruit, might decrease the child’s risk of overweight/obesity.</p>
<p>The findings from the random effect part of multilevel modeling add to the existing knowledge about the contribution of each ecological context on childhood overweight/obesity. From existing knowledge, early childhood overweight/obesity was influenced by the child’s early life factors and family factors. The findings from this study indicated that after adjusting for the children’s family factors, the variations in childhood overweight/obesity between school and community levels were decreased and were still significant. This result suggested that the variation in childhood overweight/obesity between school and community levels can be explained by the child’s family-level factors. Still, the children’s family factors explained the largest amount of variance in childhood overweight/obesity at kindergarten entry. However, the findings from this study still suggested the importance of including the school and community variables in addressing the early childhood overweight/obesity problem. Although when entering kindergarten children were only partially exposed to school environments, school still explained almost 27% of a child’s weight status, even after controlling for the child and family factors. While analysis with the ECLS-B could not identify potential factors to explain the variation in childhood overweight/obesity at the school level, it is still important to explore more school factors associated with early childhood overweight/obesity. Understanding factors for childhood overweight/obesity during the early period of life in the school context might help health care providers to manage weight problem in younger children.</p>
<p>This study has identified various factors influencing children’s weight status; however, some limitations still need to be considered. Early childhood is an important period when children start to be exposed to multiple outside environments other than family, and there are multiple factors influencing the child’s body weight. These factors include child care providers in centers and in other environments such as home care. This study still could not identify all the ecological contexts such as child care centers that could simultaneously influence early childhood obesity because the data set did not include a detailed identifiable child care center variable. In addition, the study did not include important measures for examining school and community effects on early childhood overweight/obesity. At the school level, domains such as quantity and quality of physical education, school nutrition program (e.g., meals/snacks), school resources (e.g., playgrounds), and school programs that could help to promote good eating habits and active lifestyles for children should be included. Because of these limitations, we could not identify school factors that can help to prevent obesity in children. At the community level, contextual factors such as the availability and accessibility to a safe park or playground and safe sidewalks, paths, and trails, and accessibility to healthy food in the community were not included in the ECLS-B survey. For the community level, we used the county code that might not best reflect the neighborhood characteristics. The lower level of geographic boundary such as census blocks census tracts could enhance information about how the community level can influence early childhood overweight/obesity. In addition, because the explanatory variables in school and community level were not included in the ECLS-B data set, there might be alternative explanations about the combined effects of school and neighborhood on childhood overweight/obesity. Therefore, future research needs to explore the extended components of school and community to explain the variation in early childhood overweight/obesity between schools and communities. According to the initial analysis of excluded and included groups, there were significant differences in baseline characteristics that could bias the results.</p>
<p>This study has identified influential factors for early childhood obesity by conceptualizing the development of childhood obesity within an ecological framework and applying multilevel modeling to explain the effect of each ecological context on childhood obesity. To our knowledge, there is no previous published research using multilevel modeling to study early childhood overweight/obesity in multiple ecological contexts simultaneously. Previous researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945913480275">L. Li, Law, Conte, &amp; Power, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193945913480275">Ong, Preece, Emmett, Ahmed, &amp; Dunger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945913480275">Perez-Pastor et al., 2009</xref>) used multilevel modeling focused more on individual child and family context factors; these studies did not include nonfamily factors in the analysis. The present study included family and nonfamily context factors in the model, which allowed us to concurrently determine the fixed effects and random effects of school and community on children’s weight status. This modeling also allowed us to examine how each ecological environment explained overweight/obesity in young children. These advantages helped us to determine the relative importance of each ecological level for early childhood obesity, which assists decision makers to allocate resources and prioritize various ecological-level interventions to prevent childhood obesity.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the findings from this study indicated that all three levels of children’s ecological environments explained early childhood overweight/obesity and provided rationale for multilevel obesity interventions for young children. The early childhood period is an important period of growth and development related to the timing of AR. Children are also in the transition period between early child care providers and school. They might be exposed to multiple child care providers and educators and to different kinds of environment at the same time. Therefore, it is important to understand how all ecological contexts work together to influence early childhood overweight/obesity. From the study findings, family, school, and community contexts explained early childhood overweight/obesity. As a result, to prevent childhood obesity, there is a need for family, school, and community collaboration to identify the childhood obesity problem and design interventions to be implemented in multiple contexts that affect children, especially in the at-risk group. Obesity-prevention efforts need to expand to target not only individual, child, or family levels, but also the children’s other contexts.</p>
