<abstract>
<p>This article discusses the psychological writings of the neglected 18th-century English philosopher Abraham Tucker and argues for his importance. The article explores the similarities between Tucker’s work and that of William James. It is suggested that both share a humorous and humane style, which concentrates on exploring concrete examples, especially from everyday life, rather than constructing abstract theories. Moreover, there are substantive similarities. Tucker, like James, saw consciousness occurring over time as a river or stream. Both stressed the importance of habit for individual and social life, and both depicted the infant as being overwhelmed by sensation. Tucker may have been neglected because he was “dethroning” the ideal of the conscious, rational ego before the importance of unconscious thinking had gained currency. This celebration of Tucker through the parallel with James has a critical purpose. Psychology is more than theory and methodology; it has to be written. Its rhetoric is important. The examples of James and Tucker show the value of warm-hearted writing.</p>

<p>Abraham Tucker (1705–1774) is not a familiar figure. He has been ignored by the vast majority of books on the history of psychology—from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354311398518">Baldwin (1913)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959354311398518">Boring (1929)</xref> to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959354311398518">Richards (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959354311398518">Robinson (1996)</xref>. Gardner Murphy mentioned Tucker in passing in<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959354311398518"><italic>An Historical Introduction to Modern Psychology</italic> (1928)</xref>. Amongst recent historians of psychology, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959354311398518">Martin and Barresi (2000)</xref> are a notable exception, for they discussed Tucker at some length. However, for most students of psychology’s past Tucker remains a pleasure yet to be discovered. I want to suggest that in the 18th century Tucker proposed many of the psychological ideas that were to make William James famous over 100 years later.</p>
<p>William James, of course, is not a neglected figure. He has been admired by psychologists as diverse as Boring, Vygotsky, and Watson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959354311398518">Leary, 1990</xref>). He continues to be much loved. Antonio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354311398518">Damasio (2006)</xref> has recently written that only Shakespeare and Freud equal James’s understanding of human behaviour (p. 129). James’s contemporaries certainly recognized his originality. The philosopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959354311398518">Schiller (1996)</xref> wrote that James made “a great discovery” when he called consciousness a stream (p. 149). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354311398518">James Angell (1996)</xref>, James’s research assistant at Harvard and later Professor of Psychology at the University of Chicago, claimed that the concept of habit was “the most important interpretative principle” in James’s work (p. 135). Angell described <italic>The Principles of Psychology</italic> as “perhaps the only thoroughly entertaining account of reasoning that we have in the English language” (p. 136). In these three matters—seeing consciousness as a stream, insisting on the psychological importance of habit, and writing psychology in an amusing manner—James had a forerunner in Tucker.</p>
<p>If this is correct, then we may have to adjust the history of psychology. Although this essay is about the past, my aim is not to write history but to use history for examining psychological ideas. Today, historians of ideas often seek to bed down past thinkers in their “historical contexts”. That is not my purpose. Great poets and story-tellers can break through historical context to speak directly to us. A great psychological writer like William James can do this; and so too can Abraham Tucker, at least if we permit him. At a mundane level, I will hope to do what Walter Benjamin gloriously called brushing history against the grain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354311398518">Benjamin, 1970</xref>, p. 259). The present essay deliberately interrupts the flow of historical time, by placing side-by-side two writers who, in their different times, showed similar insights into human consciousness.</p>
<p>Properly speaking, this essay is more historical psychology than psychology of history. Accordingly, I will seek to demonstrate the similarities between Tucker’s and James’s views on a range of psychological issues, including the continuity of consciousness and the role of habit in life. But more than outlining historical coincidences, I will be asking what Tucker and James can teach psychologists today. In answer, I will be suggesting that they point to the priority of examples over theory and to the importance of the way that we write psychology. Both Tucker and James were wonderfully humane writers. If we wish to produce humane psychologies today, then we have much to learn from them.</p>
<p>There is a simpler reason for discussing Tucker. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959354311398518">William James (1911)</xref> wrote “that one of the first duties of a good reader is to summon other readers to the enjoyment of any unknown author of rare quality” (p. 371). So, as someone who has enjoyed and benefited from reading Tucker, I now wish to act as a good reader, sharing with others my enjoyment of this largely forgotten figure.</p>
<sec id="section1-0959354311398518">
<title>The life of Tucker</title>
<p>Abraham Tucker led an uneventful life. He did not move in the intellectual circles of the age, but for the most part lived quietly in Surrey on his large country estate. Most of the information about his life comes from a very brief biography which his grandson, Sir Henry Paulet St. John Mildmay, wrote as a preface for a republication of Tucker’s major work, <italic>The Light of Nature Pursued</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959354311398518">Mildmay, 1831</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0959354311398518">Young, 2004</xref>). Tucker’s father, a wealthy merchant, died when Tucker was still a child. Having inherited the family fortune, Tucker never needed to seek a university or clerical position. Unwilling to engage in public controversy and reluctant to push himself forward, he preferred to stay at home, pursuing his intellectual interests and attending to the education of his two daughters.</p>
<p>Tucker published nothing under his own name. He published two minor tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354311398518">1755</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0959354311398518">1773</xref>)—the first, an anonymous light-hearted piece, supposedly written by a country gentleman advising his son to avoid politics; and the second, a pseudonymous booklet arguing how to reform spelling to match the spoken word. Apart from these, Tucker’s literary efforts were devoted to <italic>Light of Nature</italic>, which he started in 1756, two years after the death of his much-missed wife. He published a lengthy, preliminary chapter on free will as a separate booklet in 1763, under the pseudonym Edward Search. This booklet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354311398518"><italic>Freewill, Foreknowledge and Fate</italic> (1763a)</xref>, contained a preface by Tucker’s other pseudonymous persona, Cuthbert Comment, who described himself as Edward’s cousin and a member of “an under branch of the Searches” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354311398518">Tucker, 1763a</xref>, p. xxv). Mr. Comment added several footnotes to the main text. Following a critical review of <italic>Freewill</italic> in <italic>Monthly Review</italic>, Mr. Comment came to the spirited defence of his cousin in a separate booklet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959354311398518">Tucker, 1763b</xref>). <italic>Light of Nature</italic>’s first two parts (comprising five books) were published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354311398518">1768</xref>, under the name of Edward Search, but without editorial contributions from Cuthbert Comment.</p>
<p>Tucker continued working on his great opus, finishing it shortly before his death in 1774. The last years were difficult. He had gone blind, but his older daughter, Judith, helped him complete the work, transcribing his words and reading drafts back to him. She even taught herself ancient Greek to help with the task. Judith oversaw the posthumous publication of the final four books. She discarded her father’s literary conceit of being Search, publishing these volumes under his own name.</p>
<p>Tucker’s death hardly bothered the outside world. <italic>The Annual Register</italic>, which had not reviewed Tucker’s work in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354311398518">1768</xref>, failed to mention him when it listed the notable deaths of 1774. It recorded the death of the town clerk for the City of London, who died a few days before Tucker; and then it listed the death of a Lincolnshire co-heiress, who died a week later. In between these two listings, it did not record the passing of the author of <italic>Light of Nature</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354311398518"><italic>Annual Register</italic>, 1775</xref>, pp. 198–199).</p>

<sec id="section2-0959354311398518">
<title>Tucker’s project</title>
<p>Even Tucker’s most dedicated admirers will admit that <italic>Light of Nature</italic> is not a tightly structured work. It digresses, as Tucker allows his imagination to wander down some quirky by-ways. This is particularly pronounced in the last volumes, which were written when the author could no longer read his own drafts or earlier chapters. Nevertheless, the basic project is clear: Tucker wished to present a case for rational Christianity, opposing both materialist atheism and the bigotry of unreasoning faith. There was nothing unusual in the project itself. Rational Christianity for Tucker meant faith rooted in a rational understanding of nature. God had established “the laws of nature”, and so any Christian philosophy “proceeds by the study of nature”, including human nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959354311398518">Tucker, 1843</xref>, p. 462).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0959354311398518">1</xref></sup> The first part of <italic>Light of Nature</italic> was subtitled “Human Nature” whilst the second part was “Theology”; the volumes published posthumously bore the subtitle “Lights of Nature and Gospel Blended”.</p>
<p>For his analysis of human nature and particularly for his analysis of human thinking, Tucker drew inspiration from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959354311398518">Locke’s <italic>Essay Concerning Human Understanding</italic> (1690/1960)</xref>. In the Introduction to <italic>Light of Nature</italic>, Tucker modestly claimed that “whatever I may be able to do I stand indebted to Mr. Locke”, who had facilitated the increase of knowledge “by pointing out the sources and channels from whence it must be derived”. However greatly Tucker venerated Locke, he nevertheless found himself at liberty “to dissent from him in some few instances”, adding that “this happens very seldom” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354311398518">Tucker, 1768</xref>, Vol. I, ii, pp. xviii–xix). Tucker may have downplayed his differences from Locke, and certainly they do not signify a great ideological or theological divide. However, as will be suggested, they indicate a very different view of the way that the mind works and how its operations should be described.</p>
<p>One of Tucker’s contemporaries, David Hartley, also attempted to use Locke’s analysis of the mind as a means of building rational Christianity upon a scientific study of human nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354311398518">Allen, 1999</xref>). In this regard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354311398518">Hartley’s <italic>Observations on Man</italic> (1749/1834</xref>) resembles <italic>Light of Nature</italic>. It also has two parts: the first analyses the human mind and the second provides a theology supposedly based on the first part. Hartley’s approach was much more systematic than Tucker’s. Hartley analysed the human mind in terms of the principle of association, which he derived from Locke. He combined this with a theoretical neuropsychology, based on the passage of vibrations along the nervous system—an idea which he derived from Newton.</p>
<p>Despite certain outward similarities between Hartley’s work and his own, Tucker was critical of <italic>Observations</italic>. He distrusted Hartley’s theory of vibrations, viewing it as fundamentally materialist. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354311398518">Tucker (1768</xref>, Vol. I, ii, pp. 66ff.), Hartley was reducing human action to the laws of physiology and was thereby denying free will. The two writers differed in their approaches. Unlike Tucker, Hartley was a systematizer, trying to organize all human psychology around the principles of association and neurological vibration. Historians of psychology, recognizing something familiar in Hartley’s style of neuropsychological theorizing, have often credited him with being one of the first “proper”, scientific psychologists (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959354311398518">Glassman &amp; Buckingham, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959354311398518">Goodwin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354311398518">Hergenhahn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959354311398518">Wade, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Tucker might have criticized Hartley for being a materialist, but he also stressed that human experience required a body. Without eyes, ears, and nervous connections to the brain, we would not be able to see or hear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354311398518">Tucker, 1768</xref>, Vol. II, ii, pp. 7ff.). Tucker was aware that this assumption contained theological perils. If the body is necessary for experience, this would mean that there could be no conscious life after the death of the body. In the theological part of <italic>Light of Nature</italic>, Tucker produced a mystical “hypothesis”, proposing that on death the soul departs from the body in a tiny bodily vehicle that is too small to be seen by the naked eye. The soul continues to exist in this vehicular state until it ultimately progresses to the “mundane state”, when it loses its individuality and becomes at one with all previous souls. Tucker describes his vision of having met the vehicular John Locke. The dead philosopher, now inhabiting a tiny body, greets him warmly: “Welcome, Ned Search, into the vehicular state…I have noticed a faint resemblance in your way of thinking with mine” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354311398518">Tucker, 1768</xref>, Vol. II, ii, p. 127). Tucker (or Search) then has an enjoyable chat with Locke about matters philosophical and vehicular. Locke explains how he can still speak, despite lacking a mouth between his vehicular nose and enormous chin. As James would do many years later, Tucker takes mystical themes seriously without abandoning good sense or down-to-earth humour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959354311398518">James, 1902</xref>; and see particularly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959354311398518">James, 1908</xref>, for his defence of entertaining unproven religious hypotheses).</p>
<p>I will not be discussing these aspects of Tucker’s work (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959354311398518">Martin &amp; Barresi, 2000</xref>, for an excellent discussion of Tucker’s ideas about the unity of the person). Nor will the present discussion deal with the theme that brought Tucker a little bit of posthumous fame, which perhaps, in the company of the vehicular Locke, he might have been able to observe with enjoyment. In the early part of the 19th century, William Paley became the most important ethical philosopher in England, advocating a sort of Christian utilitarianism. He found in Tucker the idea that humans do not just pursue their own individual happiness, but that they also pursue, or rather they should pursue, the common happiness of all (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959354311398518">Tucker, 1777</xref>, chap. 1). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959354311398518">Paley (1791)</xref> praised Tucker: “I have found in this writer more original thinking and observation upon the several subjects that he has taken in hand than in any other, not to say, than in all others put together” (pp. xxv–xxvi). Interestingly, Paley explained who Tucker was, as if he did not expect his readers to recognize the author’s name.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959354311398518">Paley (1791)</xref> wrote that Tucker’s “talent for illustration is unrivalled” (p. xxvi). Tucker’s social utilitarianism may not be relevant to the present discussion, but his talent for illustration most certainly is. It shaped the character of his psychological analyses, putting him at one with James.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0959354311398518">
<title>Tucker’s style and approach</title>
<p>In his preface, “To the Reader”, of <italic>Freewill, Foreknowledge</italic>, Tucker discussed his approach, aims, and literary style. He said that he neither sought nor expected applause for his writing: “[T]he Searches were never remarkable for a fondness for fame” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354311398518">Tucker, 1763a</xref>, p. xiv). Although he worked in isolation, he took care with his writing: “I am sure it has cost me infinite pains to save pains to my Reader” (p. xviii). Because his topics were “unentertaining and dry”, he endeavoured “to embellish them with a diversity of style” in order to “relieve the Reader and keep his attention awake” (p. xiii). Sometimes he treated his Reader as a friend, “as if we were sitting together over a bottle” (p. xiv). In the “Preface of the Annotator”, Cuthbert Comment, himself a humorous embellishment, claimed that “few since Plato have attempted to intersperse humour and gaiety among close arguments” (p. xxvii).</p>
<p>Interspersing argument with humour would also be characteristic of James. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354311398518">Hugo Münsterberg (1996)</xref> wrote that James’s textbooks have “the intimate warmth of a friend” and “the charm of a perfect artist”; students read them as if reading a novel (p. 109). One historian of psychology has claimed that James’s <italic>Principles</italic> contains the richest descriptions of human experience in non-fictional writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0959354311398518">Wozniak, 1999</xref>). There was an oft-repeated saying about the James brothers: William wrote psychology like a novelist, while his brother Henry wrote novels like a psychologist (the saying can be traced to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0959354311398518">Rebecca West [1916</xref>, p. 11]). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354311398518">Tucker (1763a)</xref>, however, cautioned his Reader not to read his work as if it were a novel “where one has little else to do than drive on post haste to see how it ends” (p. xxi).</p>
<p>There is a reason why some of James’s readers might have read his books as if they were novels, and why Tucker might have worried lest his readers did likewise. Quite apart from their respective literary skills—and the trouble they took to acquire such skills—both James and Tucker placed great emphasis on describing examples. Like novelists, they gave primacy to the particular, rather than treating particulars as the servants of theory. In his Preface to the Reader, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354311398518">Tucker (1763a)</xref> wrote that he sought understanding through “experience and observation of ourselves” (p. vii), examining the workings of the mind “in the common occurrencies of life” (p. viii). He counselled his hypothetical reader “to judge of the abstract in the concrete” and to fix upon “particular instances” (p. xxii). James’s recent biographer has commented that it is “the parade of examples” that brings <italic>Varieties of Religious Experience</italic> to life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959354311398518">Richardson, 2007</xref>, p. 414).</p>
<p>James and Tucker reflected on their own feelings with humanity and homeliness. They did not describe the philosophical ego triumphing over ignorance. In one of the most famous passages of <italic>Principles</italic>, James discusses how he found it difficult to get out of bed on a cold morning. He writes that, “if I may generalize from my own experience”, we suddenly find ourselves having got up without a decision—“a fortunate lapse of consciousness has occurred” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959354311398518">James, 1890</xref>, Vol. 2, p. 524). Similarly, James described his problems in concentrating. He shares his readers’ weaknesses. And so did Tucker. Criticizing Locke’s claim that a good student only leaves his studies to satisfy an appetite, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354311398518">Tucker (1768)</xref> says that after a morning’s work on his book, he finds himself in need of recreation:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I then throw aside my papers sometime before dinner; the veriest trifle suits my purpose best: the philosopher can loll out at window like Miss Gawkey, to see the wheelbarrow trundle, or the butcher’s dog carry the tray, and is perfectly contented with his situation. (Vol. 1, i, p. 140)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Then the dinner bell sounds; the philosopher stops his gawking and rushes down to the parlour.</p>
<p>Most of Tucker’s disagreements with Locke came when he examined particular examples. This is clear when Tucker discussed motives in chapter VI of <italic>Light of Nature</italic>. Locke in his <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959354311398518"><italic>Essay</italic> (1690/1960)</xref> had produced a rather sketchy account of human motivation, based on the search for pleasure and the avoidance of pain (Vol. 2, xx–xxii, pp.159ff.). Pleasures and pains create uneasiness, and we are motivated to remove that uneasiness and seek satisfaction—hence we engage in motivated actions. Tucker saw great merit in Locke’s account, but he felt it was limited. To be sure, there were moments of uneasiness leading us to satisfy desires, but not all our actions stemmed from uneasiness.</p>
<p>Locke had concentrated on important actions in life, rather than common occurrences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354311398518">Tucker (1768)</xref> saw that we are continually filling our time performing little actions without deliberation or inner uneasiness, such as the moments “in our idle hours or vacant spaces of time [when] we turn our eyes to look at a butterfly, or put down our hands to remove the flap of our waistcoat that had gotten between us and the chair” (Vol. 1, i, p. 101). Tucker parades examples, often from his own experience: “I speak only for myself: when I sit down to dinner I feel no uneasiness in being hungry, rather rejoice in having a good appetite” (pp. 126–127). Frequently, the expectation of pleasure itself can produce further pleasures, not uneasiness. When we are thirsty on a hot day, we may derive pleasure in seeing the wine sparkle as it is poured from a bottle, and in hearing “the little glug glugs” (p. 127).</p>
<p>There are no disquisitions on the psychological effects of glug glugs in Locke’s <italic>Essay</italic>. But, as will be seen, the expectation of future pleasure (or pain) reflected something fundamental about human experience that Tucker stressed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354311398518">Tucker (1768)</xref> claimed he differed from Locke only in detail: “Though I do not pretend to a clearer, perhaps I may to a more microscopic eye: I consider action more minutely” (Vol. 1, i, p.119). In several places, Tucker used the metaphor of a microscope to describe his mode of analysis. “We Searches”, he wrote, “although not many of us are clever at handling the telescope, are observed to be in general very fond of the microscope” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959354311398518">Tucker, 1843</xref>, p. 455). In essence, Tucker was defending the sort of method that a James or a Goffman would use: looking in detail at what people do and feel, rather than constructing a grand scheme and then searching for examples to fit the theory. Characteristically, Tucker laughed at his chosen metaphorical method. The microscope is not always useful: “[I]f you walk in the street with a pair of microscopes tied to your eyes, you will perpetually be running against people” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959354311398518">Tucker, 1843</xref>, p. 459).</p>
<p>Tucker’s method was not really a “method” in the modern sense, but he was engaging in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354311398518">Ernest Hilgard (1987)</xref> would call “psychologizing”. To “psychologize” was, in Hilgard’s view, “to reflect on ordinary observations” and then to offer such a plausible interpretation that “detailed proof would seem irrelevant—or at least too tedious to be worth the effort” (p. 50). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354311398518">Tucker (1768)</xref> advised his readers not to consider him to be “unveiling a secret unknown to them”; instead he was just making “an observation they cannot fail of making themselves upon such notice” (Vol. 1, vi, p. 76). In his introduction, Tucker made the same point. No reader should expect new discoveries: “I pretend only to remind him of things that may have slipped his memory or point out to him objects that may have escaped his notice” (p. xvi). But as Hilgard realized, it is no mean skill to show people something about themselves that they regularly overlook.</p>
<p>According to Hilgard, James was the “the preeminent psychologizer”; and this was why James produced such “a full-bodied, warm-hearted psychology” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354311398518">Hilgard, 1987</xref>, p. 50; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959354311398518">Hunt, 1994</xref>). James, with the latest experimental and physiological research to aid him, could remind his readers of their small, easily forgotten foibles. We can smile with self-recognition at his observations. James, of course, was opposing the cold psychology of German introspectionism with a looser form of self-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959354311398518">Myers, 1997</xref>). Some psychologists, notably Baldwin and Hall, criticized James’s <italic>Principles</italic>, when it was first published, for being too unsystematic and too personal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959354311398518">Henley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959354311398518">Richardson, 2007</xref>, pp. 301ff.). James valued understanding the particular over the formulation of grand theory. Similarly, when put alongside Locke’s theory-driven descriptions of action (or those of Hartley), Tucker’s accounts convey a full-bodied, unsystematic, warm-hearted sense of humanity.</p>

<title>Stream of thought</title>
<p>The parallels between Tucker and James would be interesting, but not necessarily crucial, if they were based solely on their stylistic similarities as writers. Additionally, however, there are substantive similarities in the way the two understood the nature of consciousness. James’s most famous “discovery”—that consciousness is a stream—has its parallels in Tucker’s work.</p>
<p>Tucker’s analysis of the mind differed from that of Locke (and also from later associationists) in one very important respect. Tucker did not use his metaphorical microscope to isolate particular states of mind which supposedly exist at a given instant. He saw actions and thoughts occurring over time and, thus, the mind had to be analysed in relation to sequential patterns of living. This is apparent in Tucker’s descriptions of pleasure and uneasiness. The common occurrences that he described are actions taking place across time: we are hot and thirsty, sit down and wait for the drink to be poured, and so on. He is envisaging a sequence of events rather than an isolated, psychological moment.</p>
<p>When discussing the anticipation of pleasure, Tucker wrote that the present moment does not really exist as such, for we are always looking forward. Although philosophers might talk of the present, “this present time is in reality the next succeeding instant” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354311398518">Tucker, 1768</xref>, Vol. 1, i, p. 108). This can be seen in the way we perceive things. Our perceptions “flow in upon us without intermission and we generally have a foresight of them before they come” (p. 109). Moreover, we can affect what we are about to see. In this regard, the future is mixed with the present. James made the same point, adding the past to the mixture of present and future. In <italic>Principles</italic> he wrote that the present only exists in an abstract sense, and that we do not have a consciousness of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959354311398518">James, 1890</xref>, Vol. I, pp. 608f.). Any perception of an object is complex, and “part of the complexity is the echo of the objects just past, and, in a less degree, perhaps, the foretaste of those just to arrive” (p. 606).</p>
<p>For James, these notions of perception, involving past and present, follow from his famous conception of consciousness as a stream. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959354311398518">James (1890)</xref> wrote that consciousness is unbroken and feels unbroken, although it can be interrupted when we sleep; otherwise “consciousness remains sensibly continuous and one” (Vol. I, p. 238). James could equally have repeated Tucker’s description that perceptions flow without intermission. James stressed that consciousness was not chopped up into bits: “A ‘river’ or a ‘stream’ are the metaphors by which it is most naturally described”. He declared that henceforth we should refer to “<italic>the stream of thought, of consciousness, or of subjective life</italic>” (p. 239). He described this as “the primal fact” of the science of psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959354311398518">James, 1899</xref>, p. 15).</p>
<p>Tucker used the same metaphor. He argued that the mind is both active and passive. We cannot completely control our thoughts, even if we are deliberating upon an issue intently, rather than staring out of the window. The thinker is like a hound sniffing a trail: we might decide to follow the trail but we have not laid it down, so that we do not know where it might lead. The mind only begins a train of thinking, “but the thoughts introduce one another successively” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354311398518">Tucker, 1768</xref>, Vol. 1, i, p. 11). Tucker says we can compare the thinker to a “man who has a river running through his grounds” (p. 12). The river might break into several channels; if the land owner tries to dam up one of the channels, the river still flows through others. The flow of the river is unstoppable, and so it is with our thoughts, which “are perpetually working so long as we are awake” (p. 13). We may divert our thoughts, but we “can never totally prevent them from moving” (p. 13).</p>
<p>For James, the river of consciousness meant that thoughts and feelings never repeat themselves in exactly the same way. Tucker emphasized another point, from which James would not dissent. However much we try to control our thoughts—and both James and Tucker agreed we should try—we can seldom, if ever, succeed in retaining full control. Our conscious life happens to us as much as, if not more than, we direct it to happen. The rational, dominant ego (or “will”) is a myth. We are not the masters (or mistresses) of our own minds: as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354311398518">Tucker (1768)</xref> wrote, “We cannot constantly keep a watchful eye on our thoughts”, but notions will start up “in the fancy” (Vol. 1, i, p. 370). According to Tucker, the mind “cannot lie a moment inactive” for “she works incessantly…and if her weightier motives suspend their action ever so little, some lighter will slip in to keep her in play” (p. 91). Some ideas are like lightning: they “flash, strike and vanish; they pass so swiftly we cannot get a look at them nor remember their existence” (p. 92).</p>
<p>Tucker was again departing from Locke, for he was denying that thinking or mental activity can be equated with consciousness. In one of the few passages from the <italic>Light of Nature</italic> to be quoted by a 19th-century psychologist, Tucker wrote that the mind can continue working even when we are asleep. On waking, we can find that our ideas “have ranged themselves anew”, and this shows that “our organs do not stand idle the moment that we cease to employ them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354311398518">Tucker, 1768</xref>, Vol. 1, i, p. 249). William Carpenter, the celebrated physiologist, quoted this passage to support his notion of “unconscious cerebration” or brain activity giving rise to thinking without conscious experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354311398518">Carpenter, 1879</xref>, p. 531). By the time James was writing, it was becoming acknowledged not only that unconscious thinking existed, but that its study was central to the new discipline of psychology. One American textbook, published five years after <italic>Principles</italic>, claimed that the largest class of mental activities to be studied by psychologists were unconscious ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959354311398518">Krohn, 1895</xref>, p. 18). James, of course, had given great attention to our habits, fidgets, and the “fringes of experience” of which we are largely unaware.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0959354311398518">
<title>The importance of habits</title>
<p>There is further parallel between the ideas of Tucker and James: the importance of habits. One authority has claimed that the most widely quoted chapter of <italic>Principles</italic> is the chapter on habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959354311398518">Hothersall, 1984</xref>). James argued that much of our behaviour and experience is habitual. We develop habits of language, habits of mind, bodily habits, and so on. Some of our habits are “known” by the body, not the conscious mind: “Few men can tell off-hand which sock, shoe or trouser-leg they put on first”. To remember, they must mentally rehearse the act and “even that is often insufficient—the act must be performed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959354311398518">James, 1890</xref>, Vol. 1, p. 113). There are also habits of mind. It is through the development of perceptual habits that we come to understand the world. In a famous phrase, James described the world of the infant, who, assailed by all senses at once, perceives it all as just “one great blooming buzzing confusion” (p. 488). Gradually, the infant learns to make sense of this confusion, selecting certain elements and ignoring others. This selectivity becomes habitual, as the mind, without conscious awareness, learns to focus on some elements and weed out others.</p>
<p>Conscious thinking can also be guided by habits. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959354311398518">James (1890)</xref> described thinking as a stream, thoughts pass before us “in a train or a chain” (Vol.1, p. 240). In this respect, thought is jointed, as we pass from one train of thought to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354311398518">Bailey [1999]</xref> discusses whether this conflicts with James’s notion of the continuity of thinking). Because our brains continually build up connections between nerves, our minds build up habitual trains of thought. As we start thinking of one thing, so we move habitually to another. These conceptual habits ensure that we do not have to start from scratch each time we think. The individual could have no meaningful life without habits, whether conceptual, perceptual, or behavioural. Habits also provide the routines that are vital for social life. In another striking phrase, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959354311398518">James (1890)</xref> described habit as “the enormous fly-wheel of society” (Vol. 1, p. 121).</p>
<p>All these ideas—with the exception of the physiological speculations about the nervous system building up well-used connections—can be found in Tucker, who likewise stressed the importance of habits. Like James, Tucker envisaged the world of the infant as overloaded by confusing sensations. Nature presents her objects, he wrote, “in a chaos, or confused multitude, wherein there is nothing distinct, nothing connected”; instead, sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and feelings “rush in all the five avenues of sensation, and accost the mind in one act of perception” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354311398518">Tucker, 1768</xref>, Vol. 1, i, p. 223). The mind learns to select, to pay attention to some things not others—there is a “culling of particular objects from the whole number exhibited to view” (p. 225). And we begin to associate some objects with feelings, memories, and so on.</p>
<p>Tucker paid great attention to the nature and operation of trains of thinking. He saw it as part of our nature to form and use trains: “Though the mind by her notice begins the formation of a train, there is something in our internal mechanism that strengthens and completes the concatenation” (1768, Vol. 1, i, p. 248). Once we have formed trains of thought then, “whatever suggests the first link, the rest will follow readily of their own accord” (p. 249). So, too, we might have behavioural habits; and Tucker discussed such small gestures as rearranging a waistcoat or picking at one’s fingers. Having chains of thought and habits were vital for life. Our first attempts at so many actions are awkward and slow, “while we are forced to dig up everything by dint of application”; but when we have formed “proper trains, that will spring up of their own accord”, then we find “we can go on expeditiously, readily and perfectly” (p. 254).</p>
<p>In Tucker’s view, the importance of habit eclipses that of conscious judgement for the conduct of everyday life, both on an individual and a social level. He suggested: “The tenor of our lives, and success of our endeavours, depends more upon habit than judgement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354311398518">Tucker, 1768</xref>, Vol. 1, ii, pp. 93–94). He claimed that “our habits both of thinking and acting” depend on the same cause, namely “the spontaneous or mechanical rising of ideas in thought” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959354311398518">Tucker, 1777</xref>, iv, p. 175). Habit does not triumph by force, “but steals upon you imperceptibly, or teases or tires you into a compliance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354311398518">Tucker, 1768</xref>, Vol. 1, ii, p. 93). Because habits include our perceptions of objects, management of limbs, trains of thought, and “common forms and modes of behavior[,] . . . there is no living in the world without falling into habits” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959354311398518">Tucker, 1777</xref>, iv, p. 183).</p>
<p>Tucker may not have used the metaphor of the fly-wheel, but his meaning was similar to James’s. He had an additional argument that distinguished formal rules from habits. Rules, habits, and customs share an affinity “for they all tend to produce a uniformity of custom” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959354311398518">Tucker, 1777</xref>, iv, p. 246). We need rules for social life, but they are often irksome and restrictive. People react against them. However, habitual customs are far more efficacious than consciously followed rules. When rules become familiar, they cease to be consciously followed or resisted. Instead, they become “habits or ways of acting fallen currently into without care or reflection” (p. 246). Of course, some customs and habits can have ill consequences, such as the habits of prejudice or “habits of misapprehension and misjudging common among all degrees of men” (p. 188). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959354311398518">James (1890)</xref> pointed out that habit, the great social fly-wheel, was society’s “most precious conservative agent” (Vol. 1, p. 121). Tucker appreciated that such conservatism had its dangers, as well as benefits. Habits, just like microscopes, can sometimes restrict our vision of the world.</p>

<title>Forgetting Tucker</title>
<p>Why has Tucker been forgotten? It is insufficient just to say, as Paley did, that the reason lies in the rambling nature of Tucker’s great book. Some thinkers have made and sustained reputations on the basis of long, unreadable works. We can all think of examples. Actually, William Hazlitt published a compact version of <italic>Light of Nature</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354311398518">1807</xref>, on the recommendation of the poet Coleridge. This abbreviated volume fared no better than its much longer original. It was certainly less successful than James’s compact version of <italic>Principles</italic> which was published as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959354311398518"><italic>Psychology: Briefer course</italic> (1892)</xref>. James was writing for an identifiable market of undergraduates who wanted accessible textbooks to help them through their courses. Neither Tucker nor Hazlitt had such a ready readership.</p>
<p>Perhaps Tucker was producing ideas that did not match the intellectual mood of his times. In effect, rather than by intention, Tucker was showing the psychological limitations of Locke’s project of attempting to base all knowledge on scientific reasoning. Through his examples, he was showing why we are not in control of our minds. For much of the time, the conscious mind, or ego, was unaware of what it was doing. This was not the result of cognitive failure but was part of human nature. By the mid- to late 19th century, developments in neuro-physiological research were suggesting that much brain activity does not reach conscious awareness. To use Carpenter’s term, “unconscious cerebration” was becoming an acceptable idea. Moreover, writers such as Alexander Bain and Herbert Spencer were, in their analyses of the mind, paying attention to the little, non-intellectual, and even non-conscious things that we do. The way was being prepared for accepting that “the unconscious” may be an important determining factor in human psychology.</p>
<p>Tucker was writing at a time when many intellectuals were reluctant to dethrone the rational ego, even if they were happy to unite rationalism with theology. Much more historical investigation would be required in order to relate Tucker’s lack of success to wider movements of intellectual change. Yet, at first sight, he looks like a thinker who proposed ideas that would appear significant 100 years later, at least when they were presented with the rhetoric of scientific discovery, which even James employed.</p>
<p>Of course, forgotten figures can have intellectually important effects. It is common for historically minded psychologists who champion the cause of a neglected figure to claim that the individual in question really did have a major impact. It has been claimed that the 18th-century figures of the third earl of Shaftesbury and Thomas Reid, despite being outwardly neglected, have had an underground effect on the history of psychology; their ideas on commonsense have resurfaced unacknowledged in contemporary critical psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354311398518">Billig, 2008</xref>). The supporters of Karl Bühler, in arguing the case for reassessing his contribution, have stressed his influence on such major figures as Popper, Vygotsky, and Wittgenstein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354311398518">Brock, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0959354311398518">Wettersten, 1988</xref>). But Tucker is a far more obscure figure. There is no evidence that he directly, or indirectly, influenced figures such as Popper, Vygotsky, or Wittgenstein. Certainly, Paley is not in that class today—and one would have to work hard to argue that, through Paley, Tucker significantly affected the future direction of psychology.</p>
<p>There is, nevertheless, a possible almost-linkage between Tucker and James through the English philosopher Shadworth Hodgson. James first met Hodgson in 1880 and subsequently they corresponded regularly. James quoted Hodgson’s work extensively in <italic>Principles</italic>. Hodgson’s philosophy was based on an analysis of mind and its operations. His approach was much more theoretical than James’s and he certainly lacked the gift of illustration. In one letter to Hodgson, James complained that a piece of his friend’s writing “hangs in the air of speculation and touches not the earth of life” (30 December 1885, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959354311398518">H. James, 1926</xref>, p. 244).</p>
<p>James appreciated Hodgson’s ideas about consciousness. In <italic>Principles</italic>, James included a lengthy quotation from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959354311398518">Hodgson’s <italic>The Philosophy of Reflection</italic> (1878)</xref> to support his own notion that the perception involves past and future, giving consciousness its continuity “without which it could not be called a stream” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959354311398518">James, 1890</xref>, Vol. 1, p. 607). In the quotation, Hodgson suggested that there is no present in consciousness and that experience is continuous. Hodgson did not describe consciousness as a stream in <italic>The Philosophy of Reflection</italic>, nor in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959354311398518"><italic>The Theory of Practice</italic> (1870)</xref>, which James also quoted in <italic>Principles</italic>. Hodgson did so in his first book, when he defined the purpose of metaphysics as tracing “the stream of consciousness and of existence to its source or sources” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959354311398518">Hodgson, 1865</xref>, p. 74). By the time he came to write <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959354311398518"><italic>The Metaphysic of Experience</italic> (1898)</xref> several years after James’s <italic>Principles</italic>, Hodgson was using the metaphor regularly.</p>
<p>More work would be needed to trace the influence of Hodgson on James and vice versa. What is of interest here is another possibility. There is no evidence that James read Tucker, but he certainly read Hodgson’s <italic>The Theory of Practice</italic> and, particularly, the sections on emotion (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959354311398518">James, 1890</xref>, Vol. 1, p. 130). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959354311398518"><italic>The Theory of Practice</italic> (1870)</xref>, Hodgson critically discusses Tucker’s approach to the emotions at length (pp.108ff.). Hodgson was arguing that emotions could not be causes of other emotions or of physiological states. Although clearly familiar with Tucker’s work, Hodgson does not cite him when discussing the continuity of consciousness or the absence of a pure experience of the present. One might speculate whether on these issues Hodgson may have been influenced by reading Tucker.</p>
<p>Although one cannot tie down whether Tucker influenced Hodgson—and whether, through Hodgson, he indirectly influenced James—one thing can be said with certainty. Hodgson could have cited Tucker when he agreed with him, and not just when he disagreed. Had he done so, James might then have become aware of his predecessor. We might speculate further. The seriously dry Hodgson would not have enjoyed the glug-glug, Miss Gawkey side of Tucker. James, on the other hand, would have appreciated the humour. Such conjectures must remain, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354311398518">Tucker (1768)</xref> described his vision of Locke, “hypotheses…concerning things unknown” (Vol. 2, ii, p. 5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0959354311398518">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Remembering Tucker</title>
<p>What benefits can we gain from reconsidering Tucker and noting his similarities with James? The question is most appropriate for those who are critical of current ways of doing psychology and who might look to the past in the hope of finding alternative ways of understanding psychological issues. In this regard, Tucker and James have much to teach us. In their respective ways, they point to the importance of little examples over big theory. Both prized the role of examples, and this lies at the root of their originality. They did not posit, and grandly name, hypothetical mental states as the so-called “causes of actions”. Instead, they sought to imagine how we actually do things, how we actually think and feel. By psychologizing in this way, they were able to notice the complexity of our actions and thoughts, occurring over time. It is no coincidence that these two thinkers who took psychological examples seriously both envisaged consciousness as a stream.</p>
<p>Nor is it a coincidence that they wrote humanely about our limitations and foibles. Neither expected us to have perfect, super-rational egos. In this, Tucker and James are themselves examples for those who wish today to create different, warm-hearted forms of psychology. Moreover, their work demonstrates that psychology is not just theory and methodology, as if the discipline stands solely upon these two big pillars. The enduring popularity of William James illustrates the poverty of the theory–methodology outlook. James was not an especially notable theorist—<italic>Principles</italic> is not famous because it presented a unique theoretical stance. Nor was he a great methodologist. Regarding the new experimental method emerging from Germany, he wrote that it “taxes the patience to the utmost and could hardly have arisen in a country whose natives could be <italic>bored</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959354311398518">James, 1890</xref>, Vol. 1, p. 192). Quite simply, James’s fame rests upon his quality as a psychological writer.</p>
<p>Like any academic discipline, psychology must be written. Its rhetoric is as much, if not more, a part of its character as are its theories and methodologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354311398518">Bazerman, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959354311398518">1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354311398518">Billig, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354311398518">1996</xref>). The examples of James and Tucker show why. James disdained the rhetoric of the research report, which psychologists developed during his lifetime. Instead, he dazzled, charmed, and entertained his readers. His “psychologizing” was not a method as such. It could not exist outside of his writing, like the equipment of a psychological laboratory. His way of writing ensured that his psychologizing was warm-hearted. So it was with Tucker. There is so much that brings the reader closer to the writer. In the focus on the little things of life, the waistcoat flap and trouser-leg, and in the all too human failures of thinking, we can recognize ourselves.</p>
<p>If today we want a humane psychology, then it is not principally to theory or methodology that we should be turning. It is precisely because James and Tucker did not write like “proper” psychologists that their writings are still able to bring such insight and wisdom. Significantly, by turning their attention to the details of small actions, they were able to produce, across a gap of over 100 years, a strikingly similar psychological understanding. This present tribute to both Tucker and James is not wholly innocent. It is more than a celebration of psychology’s past, both remembered and forgotten. It seeks to raise hopes for a different psychology in the future. It is psychology’s present that is being overlooked here. That is perhaps apt. After all, both Tucker and James disputed the psychological reality of the present.</p>

The chapter was reinstated subsequently with the approval of Tucker’s grandson. Quotations from this chapter are taken from the 1843 edition.</p>

<p>Actually Tucker’s name does appear in <italic>The Principles of Psychology</italic>. James includes a lengthy quotation from Sir William Hamilton’s <italic>Lectures on Metaphysics and Logic</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959354311398518">James, 1890</xref>, Vol. 1, p. 406). Here Hamilton quotes a number of writers, including Tucker, to the effect that the mind can only focus on a small number of objects at once. Regarding the exact number of objects, Hamilton sides with Charles Bonnet and Destutt de Tracy, as against Tucker, in claiming that the figure is six (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354311398518">Hamilton, 1859</xref>, pp. 176–177).</p>
