<abstract>
<p>Drawing on the marketing literature, as well as the views of both marketing educators and current marketers in Canada, a survey was conducted of marketing practitioners to determine their top priorities for improvement in marketing education, as well as the key challenges in need of attention. An importance-performance analysis was carried out on these data. Findings indicate that the top current priority for practitioners is knowledge related to areas associated with measuring return-on-investment and strategic marketing. Results also support that meta-skills are perceived as high priorities for improvement, including the ability to creatively identify, formulate, and solve problems; the ability to write in a business environment; and the ability to set priorities. Some of the areas identified as lower priority in this study included design-related skills, production, and merchandising. Suggestions for changes to marketing education, future research, and considerations for practitioners are provided.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Scholars have long debated the comparative value of developing marketing skills versus knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475312465091">Davis, Misra, &amp; Van Auken, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0273475312465091">Hafer &amp; Hoth, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0273475312465091">O’Brien &amp; Deans, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0273475312465091">Parker, Pettijohn, &amp; Luke, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0273475312465091">Pefanis Schlee &amp; Harich, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0273475312465091">Walker et al., 2009</xref>). The proponents of the knowledge argument contend that although specific skills are perpetually changing, areas of conceptual knowledge possess a protracted lifecycle that is deeply rooted and significantly more stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475312465091">Davis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0273475312465091">Pefanis &amp; Harich, 2010</xref>). This perception has led to the argument that educators should prioritize conceptual knowledge over technical skills. This belief is further supported by the opinion that technical skills are known to be highly interdependent and are reported to be a reflection of the underlying theory of a given discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0273475312465091">Blackwell; 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0273475312465091">Cunningham, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0273475312465091">Rudolph, 1981</xref>). This understanding of marketing education has emerged as a centralized ideology within many undergraduate programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0273475312465091">Schibrowsky, Peltier, &amp; Boyt, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Over the past decade, researchers have studied the challenge of balancing conceptual marketing knowledge with skill development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475312465091">Davis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0273475312465091">Hafer &amp; Hoth; 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0273475312465091">Kelley &amp; Gaedeke, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0273475312465091">Petkus, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0273475312465091">Schibrowsky et al., 2002</xref>). This literature includes research that explores the prioritorization of knowledge and skills from a practitioner’s perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0273475312465091">Barr &amp; McNeilly, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475312465091">Davis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0273475312465091">Pefanis &amp; Harich, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0273475312465091">Raymond, Carlson, &amp; Hopkins, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0273475312465091">Walker et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, scholars have begun to examine the emerging gap between marketing education and marketing needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0273475312465091">Arora &amp; Stoner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0273475312465091">Barr &amp; McNeilly, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475312465091">Davis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0273475312465091">Eberhardt, Moser, &amp; McGee, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0273475312465091">Floyd &amp; Gordon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0273475312465091">B.

Gray, Peltier, &amp; Schibrowsky, 2012</xref>). In addition, significant research has identified the importance of meta-skills, which include faculties linked to communications, critical thinking, interpersonal communications, and leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0273475312465091">Blackwell, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0273475312465091">Deutschman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0273475312465091">Eberhardt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0273475312465091">Hafer &amp; Hoth, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0273475312465091">Hahs, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0273475312465091">Kaplan, Piskin, &amp; Bol, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0273475312465091">Kelley &amp; Bridges, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0273475312465091">Kelley &amp; Gaedeke, 1990</xref>;; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0273475312465091">Pefanis &amp; Harich, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0273475312465091">Sundstom, De Meuse, &amp; Futrell, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0273475312465091">Ursic &amp; Hegstrom, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0273475312465091">Young &amp; Murphy, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study seeks to extend the work of previous scholars who have examined a practitioner’s view of marketing education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0273475312465091">Hafer &amp; Hoth; 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0273475312465091">Harrigan &amp; Hulbert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0273475312465091">Kelley &amp; Gaedeke, 1990</xref>). Notably, it will respond to the recent assertion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0273475312465091">Harrigan and Hulbert (2011)</xref> that “we are at the stage where marketing academia has a lot to learn from marketing practice” (p. 254). Although these remarks would seem somewhat intuitive, they are illustrative of the gap that has developed between curriculum and practical need. The fact that scholars in multiple studies are observing this need in marketing education inspires this research to empirically assess the situation in Canada. This is particularly poignant given the recent call for research investigating areas outside the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0273475312465091">D. Gray et al., 2012</xref>). In undertaking this assessment, this article adopts a mixed-methods approach to conduct an importance-performance analysis (IPA) of marketing knowledge and skill areas (per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475312465091">Bacon, 2003</xref>) from the perspective of practitioners.</p>

<title>Operationalizing the Discipline of Marketing</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475312465091">Davis et al. (2002)</xref> contend that a central challenge of studying core marketing knowledge and skills is about operationalizing and defining the scope of the discipline. Defined as the “the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0273475312465091">American Marketing Association, 2007</xref>), marketing is a complex field requiring industry practitioners with a varied set of competencies. As a result, the starting point for a study of this nature is to deconstruct and rank the specific conceptual knowledge areas and skills among industry practitioners.</p>
<p>The process undertaken began with a literature review of existing studies on meta-skills and knowledge areas central to marketing. Next, we conducted a curriculum analysis of the top 20 marketing programs in the United States and eight of the leading marketing programs in Canada.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0273475312465091">1</xref></sup> This analysis included coding key outcomes, skills, and knowledge areas at both program and course levels. We then established an expert industry panel to support questionnaire development based on purposeful sampling to ensure a diverse representation of marketing expertise. The four criteria used to select the panel involved (a) representation from business to business and business to consumer marketers, (b) size of business, (c) representation from both client and agency side, and (d) representation from diverse industries. Based on these criteria, a pool of candidates was identified via the researchers’ professional networks.</p>
<p>The panel’s objective was to deconstruct the definition of marketing and specifically focus on the skills and knowledge areas used by practitioners to evaluate the hiring of entry-level marketing employees. Through a facilitated exercise over two in-person meetings, the panel identified a total of 53 items. Following the approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0273475312465091">Hopkins, Raymond, and Carlson (2011)</xref>, the panel members were asked to cluster the individual items into a higher order topology. The practitioners clustered the 53 items into four knowledge categories and one category of meta-skills. These categories were assessed within the context of the related literature as well as the results of the curriculum analysis to identify a total of 72 items clustered into five categories. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0273475312465091">Table 1</xref> presents these categories and items, as well as the source of the item (panel, curriculum analysis, or literature).</p>

<title>Questionnaire Development</title>
<p>A preliminary questionnaire was developed based on the 72 items identified within the literature, the panel, and the curriculum analysis. The flow of the questionnaire followed the structure of most importance-performance analyses, where the respondent was asked to assess each item on a 7-point rating scale to enable analysis of variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475312465091">Bacon, 2003</xref>). A 7-point scale is considered more appropriate for consumer surveys (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0273475312465091">Finstad, 2010</xref>). The importance scale is anchored at (1) <italic>needs only a basic understanding</italic> and (7) <italic>needs a deep comprehension</italic>. Similarly, the performance scale is anchored at (1) <italic>very weak</italic> and (7) <italic>very strong</italic>. Refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0273475312465091">Table 2</xref> for additional detail on these rating scales.</p>

<p>The evaluation of meta-skills leveraged the item structure of the Predicting Learner Advancement through Cooperative Education (PLACE) instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0273475312465091">Parks, Onwuegbuzie, &amp; Cash, 2001</xref>). The PLACE instrument was selected since (a) it was designed as an instrument to measure meta-skills development of undergraduate students and (b) the item structure of the PLACE instrument has demonstrated significant reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0273475312465091">Parks et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>A pretest was conducted to examine the reliability of the questionnaire. A group of 25 marketing professionals were specifically selected and asked to review the questionnaire. A total of 17 of these professionals participated in the pretest. Each was asked to complete the survey and provide qualitative feedback on the clarity of the questionnaire, as well as the relevancy of the items measured against the discipline. Both the empirical results and the qualitative feedback identified concerns associated with both redundancy and questionnaire length. Based on this feedback, 26 items were removed (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0273475312465091">Table 1</xref>, where these items are noted with an *), resulting in a final questionnaire consisting of 46 items.</p>

<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0273475312465091">Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0273475312465091">2006</xref>) argues that an essential goal of business education is a need to maintain relevancy to the practitioners it serves. This view is supported by marketing scholars as well. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0273475312465091">Lincoln (2007)</xref> contends that a key goal of marketing education is to support transition from student to practitioner, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0273475312465091">Hill and McGinnis (2007)</xref> suggest that preparing students with the skills to confront real-world problems is essential.</p>
<p>This research samples to represent the larger population of marketing practitioners in Canada. The survey was distributed electronically via a self-administered web-based data collection process. Recruitment involved three stages. First, a chapter of the Canadian Marketing Association distributed the survey electronically to its membership base of 750 marketing practitioners. Second, the questionnaire was distributed to the 278 registered attendees of a national marketing conference. Last, the researchers distributed the survey to their respective professional networks of marketing professionals, predominantly in Western and Central Canada.</p>
<p>The final sample was composed of 253 responses, geographically drawn from across Canada. The majority of respondents are either directly responsible for hiring marketing staff (46.9%) or have an influence on that decision (31.1%). The majority of respondents (88.8%) have a university or postgraduate degree. A total of 43.6% of respondents hold a degree in business, with 19% of those who majored in marketing. As reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0273475312465091">Table 3</xref>, the final sample represents a breadth of industries, company size, and experience.</p>

<title>Factor Analysis</title>
<p>In an effort to assess curriculum prioritization and to test the internal consistency of the proposed categories and their importance, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted on the data regarding the respondents’ importance ratings. The EFA was undertaken to understand the interrelationship of individual items and to provide educators with a potential approach to assess future curriculum design.</p>
<p>The EFA, using principal components extraction and a promax rotation, did not support the hypothesized five-cluster model. Rather, the EFA suggested an alternative cluster model as noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0273475312465091">Table 5</xref>. As reported in the said table, the <italic>communications</italic> category emerged as being composed of two statistical constructs. The first construct possessed of 9 items central to marketing communications; however, a new construct also emerged that possessed four items linked to design and production. The four items are (a) design philosophy, (b) production processes, (c) graphic design, and (d) copywriting. Similarly, the knowledge cluster of <italic>strategic marketing</italic> emerged as two unidimensional constructs. The first construct was composed of six items associated with strategic marketing, whereas the second was made up of four items linked to product management. The four product management items include (a) product management, (b) pricing strategy, (c) marketing budget, and (d) return-on-investment (ROI) measurement.</p>
<p>The individualized CFA process for a new seven-factor model was implemented for each factor run resulting in Eigen values in excess of 1 and all factor loadings over 0.6. The internal consistency was tested using Cronbach’s alpha for the restated seven-cluster model, revealing a range from .789 to .945 (refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0273475312465091">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Importance-Performance Analysis: Category Level</title>
<p>The first phase of the IPA involved aggregating the items. This process involved calculating an average score from the measures in that category. The descriptive results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0273475312465091">Table 6</xref> in declining order based on the gap between the importance and performance. This focus on the gap is essential as it will provide educators guidance on priority areas for improvement. Results of the gap analysis identifies gaps where importance out-ranks performance in three of the seven categories (i.e., meta-skills, product management, strategic marketing). In contrast, performance out-ranked importance in the other four categories (i.e., channel management, communications, marketing context, and design).</p>

<p>Next, a series of paired <italic>t</italic> tests were conducted to determine if there are differences between the aggregate scores for each category. The results of these <italic>t</italic> tests are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0273475312465091">Table 7</xref>, which reports that 19 of the 21 pairings are statistically significant with the most important skill category being meta-skills followed by strategic marketing. It should be noted that there is no significant difference between the product management and channel management category ratings, implying that these are tied as the second most important category. Similarly, marketing context and communications skills are assessed by respondents as also being tied but at a lower priority level. The design skills are found to be the lowest priority of the set.</p>

<p>In adopting the approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475312465091">Bacon (2003)</xref>, a visual representation of the relationship between importance-performance variables is presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0273475312465091">Figure 1</xref>, an IPA perceptual map. The purpose of this approach is to allow for further examination of the relationship. Here, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0273475312465091">Figure 1</xref> graphically highlights the relationship between the importance-performance variables, illustrating that meta-skills are reinforced as the highest priority construct. In contrast, Design Skills are highlighted as a low priority dimension. The perceptual map shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0273475312465091">Figure 1</xref> also highlights the consistency of the category performance rating by practitioners. Specifically, it illustrates that practitioners rate the performance of new graduates (horizontal axis) between 4.69 (Product Management) and 5.0 (Meta-Skills). This relatively small variance (0.31) suggests that practitioners assess performance at a macro-level and perceive little difference at the category-level. In contrast, the importance rating of the seven categories (vertical axis) ranged between 4.04 (Design) and 5.81 (Meta-Skills). This large variance (1.77) suggests that practitioners do perceive a distinct difference in importance between these variables.</p>

<p>To understand the robustness of the findings, a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the performance means for some key demographic and emporographic characteristics. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0273475312465091">Table 11</xref> presents the results of the sensitivity analysis using a similar approach to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0273475312465091">Peltier, Scovotti, and Pointer (2008)</xref>. The results of ANOVA analysis show few significant differences among reported characteristics with only four instances of significantly different means out of a total of 84 opportunities. This low level of significant differences in the sensitivity analysis represents less than 5% and, therefore, may be attributed to random chance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Results report that marketing educators are doing good work in certain areas but need to prioritize other areas where practitioners observe shortcomings. Several observations are important in this regard based on the analysis.</p>
<sec id="section11-0273475312465091">
<title>Importance-Performance Gap Analysis</title>
<sec id="section12-0273475312465091">
<title>Meta-skills</title>
<p>The importance-performance gap is widest in the meta-skills category (Gap = 0.81). In fact, 11 of the 13 items measured demonstrated a statistically significant gap between importance and performance. The individual items with the widest gap include areas of problem solving (Gap = 1.15), business writing (Gap = 1.12), and time management (Gap = 1.04). In addition, meta-skills rank first in both importance and performance. This suggests that graduates perform well in this area—relative to the other categories—but that they do not meet the level of importance that practitioners assign to them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0273475312465091">
<title>Product management</title>
<p>Product management maintains the second widest gap at the category level (Gap = 0.59). This result can be linked to the fact that it was the third highest ranked importance category but was the lowest ranked in performance. The individual item associated with measuring ROI was in fact the lowest ranked individual item by performance (<italic>M</italic> = 4.45) and maintained the widest gap of any individual item (Gap = 1.24).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0273475312465091">
<title>Strategic marketing</title>
<p>The category of Strategic Marketing was the third ranked category in terms of importance-performance gap (Gap = 0.47). At the item level, the top three items were (a) positioning (Gap = 0.83), (b) brand (Gap = 0.71), and (c) competitive analysis (Gap = 0.70).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0273475312465091">
<title>Channel management</title>
<p>The importance-performance gap in channel management was very small (Gap = −0.07). Customer relationship management had the widest gap between importance and performance (Gap = 0.68). The importance-performance gap for sales presentations, sales management, and distribution strategy was observed to be small. However, respondents define recent graduates as having a substantially higher level of performance in the areas of e-commerce (Gap = −0.46) and merchandising (Gap = −0.78) when compared with the importance ratings. Indeed, the e-commerce performance item achieves the highest mean score for recent graduates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0273475312465091">
<title>Communications</title>
<p>The gap between importance and performance in the communications category was observed to be very small (Gap = −0.11). This was also reflected at the item level as the importance-performance gap ranged from 0.06 (public relations) to −0.04 (investor relations). The gap observed in investor relations was a result of the fact that it was the lowest ranked communications item in terms of importance for new graduates (<italic>M</italic> = 4.17). Interestingly, social media possessed the highest performance score (<italic>M</italic> = 5.55) of all 46 items measured.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0273475312465091">
<title>Marketing context</title>
<p>As a category, marketing context had a very low gap between importance and performance (−0.16). This was primarily due to the low importance rating that respondents assigned to this category. In fact, there was not a single item whose importance exceeded performance. For example, the highest ranked item was associated with understanding the role of the size of business and this was ranked 31st out of the 46 items measured. In follow-up discussions with the expert panel, they suggested that the low importance associated with this category is attributed to the fact that “context” is company and industry unique and learned on the job. As a result, there is no expectation that new graduates will have a deep understanding of the unique contextual dynamics of a specific company.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0273475312465091">
<title>Design skills</title>
<p>As a category, design items were reported to have low importance when compared with the other categories. Moreover, it was the only category where the performance outranked the importance (−0.69). In fact, in terms of importance, all ranked in the bottom quartile of the 46 items measured. This included media psychology (40th), design philosophy (43rd), production processes (45th), and graphic design (46th). These results suggest that these specialized design skills are not expected from graduates of an undergraduate marketing program. Instead, the demand for these skills may continue to reside in more traditionally design-centric programs (i.e., graphic design).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0273475312465091">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>Following the completion of the study, the researchers reengaged the expert panel to support the analysis and interpretation of results. They were also asked to identify potential implications for marketing education. Based on their review of the results, the expert panel provided feedback that can be grouped under three major themes for consideration by researchers and practitioners. Each is described in the following paragraphs.</p>
<sec id="section20-0273475312465091">
<title>Evidenced-Based Marketing</title>
<p>The post hoc panel concurred that results highlight the importance among practitioners regarding the development of analytical skills that support evidence-based decision making. Individual items that suggest this include the importance of measuring ROI (<italic>M</italic> = 5.69), customer relationship management (<italic>M</italic> = 5.51), competitive analysis (<italic>M</italic> = 5.66), and segmentation (<italic>M</italic> = 5.19). These scores, combined with the highest level gap in the area of problem solving (Gap = 1.15), suggest the new graduates today are not receiving the necessary training in evidence-based marketing.</p>
<p>The post hoc panel also drew attention to the fact that the majority of undergraduate marketing programs include a course that focuses on marketing research methodology. However, research methods represents the 7th ranked performance item but is ranked only 25th in terms of importance to practitioners. Furthermore, this course provides foundation knowledge for building an analytical, evidence-based marketer. Panel members suggested that the challenge is that the processes, resources, time, and rigor taught in a theoretical market research course are rarely available to marketers today in practice. Instead, practitioners typically purchase market research and intelligence, which they tend to synthesize along with other data in real time to make evidence-based decisions. Thus, the panel emphasized that the challenge today is not access to enough data but rather access to too much data. This suggests that undergraduate marketing programs should reassess how market research and evidence-based decision making is embedded into curriculum. For example, current research methodology courses could be redeveloped into courses that focus on the efficient and timely analysis and application of evidence to support marketing decision making. However, this change needs to ensure that students remain able to adequately critique sources and content of data they will use in their planning and reporting activities. The post hoc panel further suggested that such a course could incorporate dimensions of methodology, but from the perspective of being an educated consumer who can effectively and efficiently determine which secondary research products warrant an allocation of resources.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0273475312465091">
<title>Strategic Thinking</title>
<p>The panel’s feedback and our results both highlight the importance of developing strategic marketing knowledge. The significant importance-performance gaps found in areas such as brand strategy, positioning strategy, and competitive analysis support this. This view is further supported by the finding that practical areas (e.g., copywriting, merchandising) were ranked by practitioners as significantly less important for new graduates.</p>
<p>The majority of the panel supports the assertion that practitioners seek graduates who demonstrate a higher level understanding of strategic marketing with less of a focus on tactical dimensions. However, certain panel members raised a caveat regarding findings at a category level where they argued that examining the importance and related performance of the knowledge clusters in isolation was flawed. Asked to explain, they contended that a successful marketer—regardless of particular knowledge area expertise—should be anchored in the foundational meta-skills. Thus, developing a strategic, evidence-based marketer who does not possess the essential meta-skills, such as problem solving or time management, was suggested by the panel to be of limited value to an organization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0273475312465091">
<title>Meta-Skills Are the Foundation</title>
<p>The panel suggested that the dominance of meta-skills exists because it is the foundation on which every successful professional marketer is built. They suggested that regardless of the role (i.e., whether you are a creative director at an agency, the VP of marketing at a multinational firm, or a marketing coordinator at a nonprofit organization), the importance of meta-skills are what unites marketers and what should be the core of marketing education. When we asked our post hoc panel to explain, they identified the need to manage priorities as an example of a meta-skill that transcends the discipline. In this example, the panel’s definition of meta-skills included tasks ranging from basic administrative activity such as completing time sheets to prioritorizing returning phone calls and emails on a daily basis.</p>
<p>This position is supported by previous research that emphasizes the critical importance of meta-skills development for business students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0273475312465091">Pefanis &amp; Harich, 2010</xref>). Indeed, the reported importance-performance gap of these meta-skills among practitioners punctuates the emerging challenges to pedagogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0273475312465091">Walker et al., 2009</xref>). Of the 46 items measured by importance, the first nine by rank are meta-skills. Moreover, many of the 13 meta-skill items possessed a noteworthy gap between the importance and performance ratings. These dominant meta-skill items include variables associated with self-management, problem solving, and adaptability. This demonstrates that practitioners want to hire a new graduate who is scalable and will provide return on their investment as an employee. This validates the assertion by the panel that a new graduate who demonstrates the priority meta-skills will be more competitive in the marketplace when compared with the one who possesses only marketing knowledge. By extension, it is recommended that learning outcomes linked to meta-skill development take priority over marketing knowledge outcomes in both program and course development. This recommendation is further supported by the result that the dominance of meta-skills could have significant implications on course activities and individual student assessment. Indeed, the priority meta-skills identified by practitioners are largely self-management measures (i.e., follow-through, take initiative, time management) but within the context of team-based deliverables (i.e., work with others, sell ideas). In turn, this logic would lead to the recommendation that activities and assessments should orient toward assessing individual development but within a team environment. Therefore, activities such as group-based case studies or client projects that measure both team and individual performance should take priority over traditional approaches.</p>
<p>Marketing educators have evolved curriculums dramatically in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0273475312465091">Ferrell &amp; Hartline, 2011</xref>). However, results reveal that although case studies and applied client projects (i.e., active learning) remain central to many leading undergraduate marketing programs, marketing professionals involved in the hiring process report that significant room for improvement exists on how we implement applied learning. This finding is accentuated by the observed large gap between importance and performance in the meta-skill cluster. In fact, two of the most important ranked meta-skills (i.e., selling ideas and business writing) sit near the bottom of the performance rankings. To summarize, results and the related literature note that an increasing gap may be opening between marketing education content and the needs of practitioners, perhaps suggesting enhanced use of experiential techniques such as industry-based projects and cooperative education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0273475312465091">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>The results of this research raise the question about the perceived value of traditional undergraduate marketing education among practitioners. Importantly, the development of foundational meta-skills is not unique to marketing, nor business education, since these skills are central learning outcomes to many disciplines within and outside of business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0273475312465091">Yang, Kang, &amp; Mason, 2008</xref>). In particular, these results suggest that the speed of transformation facing many industries today may negatively dilute the perceived value of marketing education and give rise to the substitution of alternate training. This threat of substitution is one that professional marketers face every day. In the context of marketing education, as noted, the priority meta-skills marketers seek from new graduates often transcend disciplines. Therefore, findings suggest that to be competitive, marketing education must emphasize the development of foundational meta-skills through experiential methods that demonstrate application in unique marketing contexts. Such an approach is worthy of future research and, practically, would provide marketing students exhibiting the requisite skills and knowledge a competitive advantage over any new graduate in the social sciences who demonstrates similar skills. If such an approach is not taken, we could see social science graduates succeed, with increasing frequency, in competitions for entry-level marketing positions.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Research Opportunities</title>
<p>It is important to acknowledge the limitations of this research. First, a convenience sample was used, which may have excluded certain marketing environments from our sample. Second, the target practitioner population may have goals and perspectives that differ from those of a university regarding the particular objectives of an undergraduate university education where every program strives to create graduates who are proficient in their fields and are also functioning citizens in their communities. That said, many of the society-based programmatic outcomes (e.g., critical thinking, ethical decision making, empathy, creative thinking) are among the meta-skills that are also prized by the practitioners included in this research. Nonetheless, future research should investigate the importance and performance of marketing program outcomes based on different stakeholder groups.</p>
<p>Overall, this research empirically identified three important themes, each with numerous areas of future potential research, ranging from experiments to test specific pedagogical tactics in the classroom to longitudinal work following individuals from their beginning of their marketing education through to their careers as practitioners. Other themes for future research include examining the interrelationship between specific meta-skills, knowledge areas, and pregraduate work experiences.</p>
