<abstract>
<p>The main goal of this study is the peculiarities of shape memory effect in a porous nickel–titanium (NiTi intermetallic phase referred to as <italic>nitinol</italic>) fabricated via the selective laser sintering/melting process. The phase and structural transformation behaviour of the intermetallide is characterized by means of the scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray and X-ray analysis. The effect of the laser sintering parameters and additional heating on the phase content and the thermal dependence of the electrical resistivity are discussed. Peaks and bulbs of the electrical resistivity are found to correspond to the start and finish temperatures of the austenite-to-martensite and reverse phase transitions, and this discovery can be useful for the shape memory effect estimation and optimization. Advantages and shortcomings in the application of this porous material as biological microelectromechanical systems are briefly considered.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954406212440766" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Different approaches have been reported for studying of phase and structural transformations inside the nitinol (NiTi –intermetallic phase) shape memory alloys (SMAs) that proved to be potentially suitable for bio-medical applications, for example, as compatible implants and/or in biological microelectromechanical systems (bio-MEMS) (clamps, stents, forceps, etc.).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406212440766">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406212440766">2</xref></sup> Another important application is for drug delivery systems (DDSs) that are porous temperature-sensitive SMA filters with the beneficial ability to vary the channel diameter along the drug flow path in the living tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406212440766">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406212440766">3</xref></sup> It was shown in the study described in Arutyunov et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406212440766">4</xref></sup> that the sintered three-dimensional (3-D) nitinol samples achieved the porosity value of 40%, low density ∼3.3–4.1 g/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406212440766">3</xref></sup> and high passivation susceptibility in acid and alkaline media suitable for the DDS applications. The phase and structural transformations were investigated through estimation of the stress–strain behaviour, mechanical loading response, and ultrasonic and thermal properties, with the aid of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electrical resistivity (ER).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406212440766">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406212440766">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406212440766">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954406212440766">14</xref></sup> Earlier,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406212440766">2</xref></sup> we used the stress–strain method for the 3-D porous nitinol parts synthesized by the selective laser sintering (SLS) method aimed to ensure the shape memory effect (SME) and identification of the area of plasticity. It is known that the above-cited approaches have a common character for great volumes of SMA, while the XRD and ER provide more detailed information on the transformation occurring on the grain and crystalline levels. The ER method permits to study the phase transformations in metallic systems to define the composition of different metallic mixtures and conduct quantitative analysis of phases in a solid solution. During the cooling of nitinol, a high-temperature austenite phase transforms into a low-temperature martensite (monoclinic) phase and the transformation is accompanied by the intermediate (rhombohedral – R) phase generation. Hence, the ER method is a more effective way for determining the intermediate NiTi phase when compared to the measurements of ultrasonic and thermal properties. This method reveals the intrinsic behaviour of the SME. The R-phase appearance is signalled by an increase in ER. Upon a successive transformation from the intermediate phase to the low-temperature one, the ER decreases drastically and shows a peak associated with the start temperature of the transformation to the low-temperature phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406212440766">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406212440766">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406212440766">7</xref></sup> On the other hand, the NiTi SMA behaviour (the start and finish temperatures of the austenite/martensite transformation) is strongly sensitive to additional factors, for example, alloy content, preheating and/or strain cycling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406212440766">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406212440766">8</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954406212440766">14</xref></sup> The comparison of the X-ray analysis to ER measurements may help to understand the complicated nature of the phase and structural relationships in NiTi SMA.</p>
<p>The selective laser sintering/melting (SLS/SLM) technology has a great potential for fabrication of both porous and solid functional medical implants out of nitinol with a predefined and reproducible external and internal surface morphology. This article offers discussions of physical and mechanical properties of the porous NiTi synthesized by SLS/SLM and of the SME existence in this material. Peculiarities of the phase and structural transformation behaviour of the material are also analysed. In an earlier study, Shishkovsky<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406212440766">15</xref></sup> the method for the specific ER measurement was proposed to register some SLS structure properties. In this study, this method is applied simultaneously with the X-ray analysis of porous samples synthesized by the SLS and SLM in order to compare the results concerning the SME existence.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0954406212440766"><title>Materials and experimental procedure</title>
<p>All the reagents used in experiments were purchased in French and Russian markets for chemical products and used as supplied.</p>
<p>The specification of powders used in the experiments at the DIPI laboratory, ENISE, France, is as follows: NiTi (–45 µm), pre-alloyed gas-atomized powder from TLS Technik GmbH &amp; Co. Chemical composition (% wt) Ni – balance and Ti – 45%. Granulometric (i.e. grain size) parameters: equivalent diameter (weight by volume) <italic>d</italic><sub>10</sub> = 11.4, <italic>d</italic><sub>50</sub> = 25.5 and <italic>d</italic><sub>90</sub> = 37.5 µm.</p>
<p>The specification of powders used in the experiments at the Samara Branch of the Lebedev Physics Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences (LPI RAS) is as follows: nitinol graded PN55T45 from Polema Co., Tula, RF; nitinol contained 55% of Ni and 45% of Ti in the intermetallic phase of NiTi. PN55T45 particle size was ∼100 µm, which is comparable to the laser beam diameter and hatch distance.</p>
<p>Our experimental set-up at the Samara Branch of the LPI RAS for the SLS of powder composites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406212440766">Figure 1</xref>) involved: (a) a continuous wave YAG: Nd<sup>+3</sup> laser, λ = 1.06 µm; (b) deflectors for scanning the laser beam in the <italic>X–Y</italic> plane; (c) personal computer; (d) interchangeable lenses with <italic>f</italic> ∼149 and 336 mm (to obtain focused spots with <italic>D</italic> ∼50 and 100 µm, respectively); (e) mechanism for deposition and levelling of the powder mixture; and (f) vertically moving cylindrical platform. The laser beam scanned an area of 50 × 50 or 100 × 100 mm<sup>2</sup> and was controlled by the PC through mechanical deflectors. The SLS set-up and optimal processing parameters for 2-D nitinol sample fabrication were described earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406212440766">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406212440766">15</xref></sup> The laser power <italic>P</italic> ranged from 17 to 25.6 W and scan velocity <italic>v</italic> within the interval of 2.5–4.1 cm/s.

<p>The PM 100 machine (Phenix Systems, ENISE, France, Yb – fibre laser, λ = 1.07 µm) has an equipment design typical for SLM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406212440766">16</xref></sup> The laser parameters were power ∼50 W and beam diameter <italic>D</italic> = 70 µm.

<p>The ER ρ was accurately measured by a four-probe potentiometric method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406212440766">Figure 2</xref>) in the temperature range from −150 up to +200 °C. The used temperature range of the thermal cycling was much wider than that of the NiTi transformation. The reason for this is that the temperature points in porous heterogeneous structures governed by some rules could be displaced. An external heater and liquid nitrogen were employed to vary the temperature of the nitinol samples. The temperature was measured with a chromel–alumel thermocouple.</p>
<p>The relative accuracy of the resistivity measurement was checked by the accuracy of the temperature measurement (a relative accuracy of 0.1 °C) and was estimated to be within 10<sup>−4</sup>. The experimental data were digitized by the Labview program on digital-to-analogue converter/analogue-to-digital converter (LCard Co., Moscow, RF). The experimental set-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406212440766">Figure 2</xref>) was tested by measuring the cast NiTi alloy wire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406212440766">Figure 4</xref>).

<p>High-resolution SEM results of a nitinol surface by SLS and SLM are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406212440766">Figure 3</xref>. In order to compare the resulting microstructures, SLS and SLM parameters that were approximately corresponding to each other with regard to the laser energy per unit surface (Andrew number) were selected. The morphology of SLS and SLM surfaces differed insignificantly under lower magnifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406212440766">Figure 3(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406212440766">(d)</xref>), while on the micron level, the differences became marked. Substructures after the SLM were needle shaped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406212440766">Figure 3(c)</xref>) and their sizes were ∼120–150 nm. After the SLS, they looked like a honeycomb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406212440766">Figure 3(f)</xref>) with wall thicknesses of ∼100–140 nm. Similar regular honeycomb-type structures were earlier obtained by the nitinol synthesis with the controllable laser energy out of a mixture of Ni and Ti powders with an equiatomic content of components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406212440766">17</xref></sup> The EDX analysis showed the correspondence of the surface element composition to the initial powders except for traces of nitrogen and oxygen which could be introduced during the powder preparation before the laser processing.

<p>As mentioned in the ‘Introduction’ section, during heating, a peak must appear in the specific ER curve within the range of the austenite transformation. Under cooling, a similar peak corresponds to the martensite transformation from a high-temperature phase for the NiTi to a low-temperature one. It can be expected that the SME develops in the NiTi sample. Besides, for almost equiatomic TiNi alloys, the martensitic transformation (B2 → R → B19) can occur through the intermediate R-phase, depending on the thermo-mechanical treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406212440766">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406212440766">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406212440766">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406212440766">18</xref></sup> At the beginning, the martensitic transformation yields a larger deformation of the lattice than the R-phase transition and is significantly affected by the internal stress field. A strong stress field resulting from rapid cooling will hinder the formation of martensite. Since the R-phase transformation is not so greatly affected by the internal stress field due to a low deformation of the lattice form, this promotes the formation of the R-phase in the inter-dendritic zones where a lower cooling rate is observed. The dislocations’ accumulation, depending on their density and interaction, provokes either the nucleation site formation for the martensitic phase or the slow down of martensitic plate motion. The pinning down of the martensitic plate motion paves the way to the R-phase formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406212440766">5</xref></sup> A significant overlap of the diffraction peaks of 1 1 0<sub>B2</sub> and the R-phase complicates a clear detection of these phases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954406212440766">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is known that the porosity of nitinol leads to the austenite–martensite peak leap relative to the temperature axis, and the transformation temperature range expands while shifting towards the low-temperature zone as well. For example, it was shown in Botterill and Grant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406212440766">8</xref></sup> that a deflection from the NiTi phase stoichiometry by 2% only displaces the peak of martensite transformation by 10°. The martensite transformation peak shifts during strain hardening, adding of alloying elements in cast NiTi and/or under porosity changing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406212440766">1</xref></sup> Papers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406212440766">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406212440766">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406212440766">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954406212440766">12</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954406212440766">14</xref></sup> showed a similar dependence on the temperature for differential scanning calorimetry peaks caused by the phase transformations.

<p>Studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406212440766">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406212440766">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406212440766">15</xref></sup> showed that the variation of the Ni content by 0.1 at.% results in changing the transformation temperature by approximately 10 °C; the presence of 1.0 at.% oxygen decreases the martensite transformation temperature by 92.6 K and makes the parental phase brittle. Additional stable phases (NiTi<sub>2</sub>, Ni<sub>3</sub>Ti) do not exhibit any shape memory behaviour but their formation modifies the composition of the remaining NiTi matrix and, hence, the transformation temperature. The comparison carried out in this study showed that in the synthesized NiTi samples, the intervals of the phase and structural transformations shift towards the negative temperature area due to the combination of the above-mentioned reasons in a lesser degree. The laser treatment of nitinol was carried out in protective atmosphere of argon, and X-ray analysis did not show these phases. So, we explain the great shift by the influence of porosity factor that achieved the level of 45% in case of SLS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406212440766">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406212440766">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>An earlier study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406212440766">15</xref></sup> showed an upper limit in the resistivity curve during cooling caused by the presence of R-phase in a nitinol sample synthesized by the combination of SLS and self-propagated high-temperature synthesis reaction in the Ni + Ti equiatomic mixture. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406212440766">Figure 5(a)</xref>, 1–3 show the ER curves of SLS samples obtained at different laser energy inputs. With an increase of absorbed laser energy, the ER drops by the absolute value, and the R-peaks are hardly noticeable on the ER curves (2 and 3). In spite of this, the XRD pattern shows a weak presence of R-phase (1–10). The residual austenite is contained in the solid solution after laser sintering. During the SLM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406212440766">Figure 6(a)</xref>), the R-phase peak is feeble, though with an increase in the laser energy input, it is enhanced. The X-ray analysis correlated with these results partially. Besides, the SLM is characterized by a great amount of the martensite phase and clear R-phase peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406212440766">Figure 6(b)</xref>). Finally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406212440766">Figure 7(b)</xref>), an additional two-zone laser scanning leads to the decrease of R-phase in the XRD pattern and to the increase of both martensite and austenite phases. It is seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406212440766">Figure 7(a)</xref> (curve 1) that no peak in ER is observed during heating since with the temperature rise the low-temperature phase is transformed directly into the higher one. The ER drop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406212440766">Figure 7(a)</xref>, curve 1) at the cooling stage is not so rapid, if we compare this curve slope with the slopes of curves 2 or 3 at the cooling stage. Meanwhile, upon evaluating the dynamics of the curve slope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406212440766">Figures 5(a)</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406212440766">6(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406212440766">7a</xref>)) change under transition from SLS to SLM processes and further transition to two-zone SLM, it could be concluded that the change of the curve slope for the ER dependence in the minus-temperature region is substantial, and it is maximum for the two-zone SLM process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406212440766">Figure 7(a)</xref>). Actually, the peak absence at the heating stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406212440766">Figure 7(a)</xref>, curve 1) deserves special attention and may be an object for a further separate study. In both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406212440766">Figures 6(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406212440766">7(a)</xref>), the ER increases with the laser input increase in contrast to the SLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406212440766">Figure 5(a)</xref>). A further research is needed to find out the reasons for this ER behaviour depending on the absorbed laser energy and in particular for additional laser thermocycling. An increase in the ER under the transformation was registered within the temperature range of a low-temperature phase for the SLS samples; this can only be attributed to the defects that occurred during the transformation as affirmed in Matsumoto.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406212440766">7</xref></sup> A detailed comparison of the hysteresis loop for the SLS and SLM samples is provided.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0954406212440766" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The evolution of the specific ER as a function of the laser-processing parameters was experimentally studied for the first time in porous nitinol samples synthesized by the SLS/SLM methods. To verify the dependencies established, the samples were subjected to the X-ray analysis. The main experimental results can be summarized as follows:
<list id="list1-0954406212440766" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The absolute value of the ER of the porous NiTi samples is one order higher than that of the solid NiTi wire.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The ER measurement was proved to be a good method for the identification of various phases and the SME in the porous nitinol SMA.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The ER of the phases studied (austenite, R-phase, martensite) increases with the temperature rise but the slopes of this increase are quite different.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The R-phase generally shows a higher ER than the austenite phase, but its value grows with the temperature decrease for SLS samples. This is explained by the accumulation of dislocations with a continuous increase of the R-phase with the temperature decrease. No similar dependence is observed for the SLM samples.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The hysteresis loop of the ER is more remarkable in the SLS than in SLM porous samples.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The evaluation showed that under transition from SLS to SLM processes and further transition to two-zone SLM, the curve slope for the ER dependence in the minus-temperature region changes substantially and achieves its maximum for the two-zone SLM process.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The ER method proposed by the authors makes it possible to estimate the temperature interval where the SME may be expected. The cooling curves of the porous NiTi showed that the SME can shift within the low-temperature region owing to reasons connected with porosity.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The ER can be used as a feedback generator for the direct control of the actuator location with no need for any other sensors. Owing to the SME in the porous nitinol, synthesized layer-by-layer by the SLS/SLM, and to the possibility of manufacturing 3-D objects such as bio-MEMS sensors, DDSs, implants, etc., a new quality level can be achieved in the orthopaedic surgery through the development of self-initiating, self-fixing and self-swinging prosthetic elements at a human body temperature.</p>
