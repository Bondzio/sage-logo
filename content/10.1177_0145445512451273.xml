<abstract>
<p>Comprehensive exposure-based approaches to treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are effective, but they are time intensive and not widely used because of factors such as client noncompliance and fears of iatrogenic effects. Exposure by writing disclosure (WD), modeled after Pennebaker’s brief stress-reduction procedure, may circumvent these obstacles. WD treatment reduces PTSD symptoms in trauma victims but has rarely been tested in diagnosed PTSD participants and never in substance use disorder (SUD) populations—despite high comorbidity rates. The authors applied a standard Pennebaker WD treatment for 45 SUD inpatients screened for full or subsyndromal PTSD in an uncontrolled study. Results suggested potential strong cost-effectiveness: Posttreatment outcome measures showed significant symptom reductions, which remained stable at 3-month follow-up. With converging evidence from future controlled studies, WD strategies may emerge as effective and easily implemented treatment options for PTSD in SUD treatment settings.</p>

<p>Approximately 6.8% of the population meets diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at some point in their lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0145445512451273">Kessler et al., 2005</xref>). One of the primary treatments for PTSD is imaginal exposure, the systematic disclosure of the traumatic experience and associated thoughts and emotions to others. Along with in vivo exposure, imaginal exposure is one of only four treatments for PTSD classified as having “strong research support” by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445512451273">American Psychological Association’s Division 12—Society of Clinical Psychology (2011)</xref>. Furthermore, the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies clinical practice guide recommends exposure as a first-line treatment for PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512451273">Foa, Keane, Friedman, &amp; Cohen, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite exposure treatment’s effectiveness, many barriers to widespread use exist, such as client noncompliance, lack of therapist confidence, and fears of iatrogenic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145445512451273">Becker &amp; Zayfert, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512451273">Becker, Zayfert, &amp; Anderson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445512451273">Cahill, Foa, Hembree, Marshall, &amp; Nacash, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145445512451273">McLean &amp; Woody, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0145445512451273">Olatunji, Deacon, &amp; Abramowitz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0145445512451273">Scott &amp; Stradling, 1997</xref>). As a result, exposure therapy is not often utilized in clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512451273">Becker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445512451273">Cahill et al., 2006</xref>). However, use in one segment of the population is increasing with the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs’ response to PTSD arising from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0145445512451273">Keane, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0145445512451273">Veterans Health Administration, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>One exposure variant that may avoid many of the problems associated with traditional exposure therapy is exposure via written disclosure (WD). WD is based on James Pennebaker’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145445512451273">Pennebaker &amp; Beall, 1986</xref>) brief stress-reduction procedure (i.e., writing about one’s stressful experiences for 15 to 20 min for three to four consecutive days). Many parametric and other variants of the procedure appear in the WD literature. WD initially increases physiological arousal and negative affect, which diminish across writing sessions—response patterns that support the claim that WD functions similar to traditional exposure therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0145445512451273">Sloan, Marx, &amp; Greenberg, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>WD studies measure physiological/health-related outcomes and/or mental health/stress outcomes. The most rigorous and recent WD meta-analysis (146 controlled studies with nearly half unpublished) shows WD is effective for several health and psychological outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145445512451273">Frattaroli, 2006</xref>). Although the overall average effect size reported is very modest (<italic>r</italic> = .075 or Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = .154), the extremely low cost of treatment delivery translates into high cost-effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145445512451273">Frattaroli, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>There are three groups of WD outcome studies: most recruit healthy volunteers instructed to write about stressful experiences, a subset recruits healthy or trauma-exposed volunteers instructed to write about traumatic experiences, and a very small subset selects for diagnosed PTSD volunteers who write about their traumas. The latter are the studies most relevant to the present one. Although the dozen or more studies in the second group (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445512451273">Batten, Follette, Rasmussen Hall, &amp; Palm, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145445512451273">Deters &amp; Range, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145445512451273">Gidron, Peri, Connolly, &amp; Shalev, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0145445512451273">Schoutroup, Lange, Hanewald, Davidovich, &amp; Salomon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0145445512451273">Sloan &amp; Marx, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0145445512451273">Sloan, Marx, &amp; Epstein, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0145445512451273">Sloan, Marx, Epstein, &amp; Lexington, 2007</xref>) indicate that they aim to evaluate the effects on PTSD and measure PTSD or related symptoms, none use PTSD as an inclusion criterion or diagnose PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0145445512451273">Sloan et al., 2011</xref>). The majority solicits undergraduate students as participants and offers course credit incentives. Most report positive outcomes for WD compared with controls, but some do not (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145445512451273">Deters &amp; Range, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145445512451273">Gidron et al., 1996</xref>). Although some participants in this group of studies likely meet full or subsyndromal PTSD criteria, particularly those selected to exceed cutoffs on continuous PTSD symptom measures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0145445512451273">Sloan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0145445512451273">Sloan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0145445512451273">Sloan &amp; Marx, 2004</xref>), the relatively open recruitment procedures limit generalizing to PTSD populations. For example, even the studies with symptom cutoffs cannot guarantee that participants meet the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed., text rev.; <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445512451273">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000</xref>) reexperiencing Criterion B—the hallmark of PTSD that distinguishes it from other anxiety disorders and depression.</p>
<p>We identified four WD studies that studied PTSD samples, although two used procedural variants of the Pennebaker paradigm. Using a common WD procedure for PTSD-diagnosed undergraduates (writing for 20 min on three consecutive days), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0145445512451273">Sloan et al. (2011)</xref> found no posttreatment differences for PTSD or depression symptoms between WD and waitlist groups. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0145445512451273">Smyth, Hockemeyer, and Tulloch (2008)</xref> collapsed all writing into 1 day for a combined Veteran’s Affair (VA) hospital patient and rape/trauma center sample and found no difference between WD and writing control groups at a 3-month follow-up. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145445512451273">Emmerik, Kamphuis, and Emmelkamp (2008)</xref> used a far more protracted WD variant (“Structured Writing Therapy” [SWT]) for their PTSD-diagnosed psychology clinic outpatients: 7.5 hr writing for acute PTSD (i.e., less than 3 months duration) and twice that for chronic PTSD (i.e., duration at least 3 months) delivered across weekly 1.5-hr sessions. Outcome for SWT did not differ from a cognitive behavioral therapy program with a large exposure component but similar duration. However, both groups showed significantly reduced PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms at posttreatment and follow-up compared with a waitlist control group. A fourth study of effects of WD on PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0145445512451273">Resick et al., 2008</xref>) actually aimed to dismantle cognitive processing therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0145445512451273">Resick &amp; Schnicke, 1992</xref>), a comprehensive evidenced-based PTSD treatment that contains both a cognitive component and an exposure-via-writing component. PTSD-diagnosed interpersonal violence victims received 5 weeks of 2 hr per week WD treatment that included reading back to therapists their 45- to 60-min writings and some therapist guidance—another intervention far more extensive than the traditional Pennebaker paradigm. WD produced substantial change, which was comparable to the comprehensive package (but somewhat less than the cognitive component alone).</p>
<p>The dearth of WD studies on PTSD samples and the modest WD group sample sizes for the two negative result studies (<italic>N</italic>s of 10 and 23, respectively) versus samples of 44 and 38, respectively, for the two positive result studies, which were far more intensive, leaves the efficacy of traditional Pennebaker paradigm WD treatments for PTSD open to question.</p>

<title>Substance Use Disorders (SUDs): Relationships with PTSD</title>
<p>Over the past two decades, there has been increasing attention toward PTSD comorbidity in SUD populations, with studies focusing on the nature of this relationship and optimal treatment strategies for SUD clinics. Comorbidity is high: Treatment-seeking SUD patients have PTSD rates of 25% to 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145445512451273">Dansky et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145445512451273">Grice, Brady, Dustan, Malcolm, &amp; Kilpatrick, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0145445512451273">Jacobsen, Southwick, &amp; Kosten, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0145445512451273">Triffleman, Marmar, Delucchi, &amp; Ronfeldt, 1995</xref>). Furthermore, comorbid patients exhibit greater addiction severity, less SUD treatment compliance, and more rapid SUD relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145445512451273">Brady, Killeen, Saladin, Dansky, &amp; Becker, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145445512451273">Brown, Stout, &amp; Mueller, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0145445512451273">Ouimette, Wolfe, &amp; Chrestman, 1996</xref>). The latter result may be explained by PTSD symptom distress exacerbating drug and alcohol craving; reducing that distress with treatment could lead to increased SUD treatment effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145445512451273">Coffey, Schumacher, Brimo, &amp; Brady, 2005</xref>). Among hypotheses accounting for PTSD–SUD comorbidity, the “self-medication” for PTSD symptoms hypothesis has the best empirical support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145445512451273">Chilcoat &amp; Breslau, 1998</xref>), although common neurobiological underpinnings may also play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145445512451273">Brady, Back, &amp; Coffey, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445512451273">Hien et al. (2009)</xref>, SUD clinics are seeking treatments for PTSD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145445512451273">Cohen, Dickow, Horner, Zweben, &amp; Balabis, 2003</xref>), but, at the same time, they are wary that increased stress from PTSD treatment could diminish SUD treatment outcomes. However, Coffey and colleagues found that, while trauma cues increased alcohol craving, exposure treatment for PTSD reduced this response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145445512451273">Coffey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145445512451273">Coffey, Stasiewicz, Hughes, &amp; Brimo, 2006</xref>) indicating that exposure treatment can be safely applied. The consensus is that failure to address PTSD in SUD patients increases relapse risk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0145445512451273">Riggs &amp; Foa’s (2008)</xref>.</p>
<p>Riggs and Foa’s (2007) review on treatment for comorbid PTSD and SUD describes evidence-based comprehensive PTSD treatment strategies studies and outlines the debates on whether one disorder should be treated first or both should be treated simultaneously. If even modestly effective in SUD/PTSD populations, WD treatment could emerge as a cost-effective strategy that could be disseminated widely and rapidly. Relatively simple to implement, WD may also be more acceptable than more intensive exposure-based treatments to both SUD counselors and patients. Finally, WD treatment in SUD clinics could afford many more trials that might then weigh in on the treatment sequencing debates while affording some symptom mitigation.</p>
<p>There are no published PTSD outcome studies using a Pennebaker-derived writing treatment in SUD populations. The present uncontrolled study was an initial attempt to determine whether a traditional Pennebaker-based WD treatment could reduce PTSD symptoms in a SUD inpatient sample (the treatment facility participant source would not permit a control group). Although only the two previous studies with elaborated WD treatments for PTSD yielded strong positive results, the relatively brief inpatient stay (approximately 28 days) for our participants precluded delivery of extensive WD. Given that traditional WD treatment is a small fraction of the intensity and duration of the much more lengthy, empirically supported PTSD exposure interventions, we anticipated small, but potentially cost-effective, PTSD symptom improvements. A secondary aim was to further examine the hypothesis that WD treatment may not be effective when symptoms are more severe or with diagnosed PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0145445512451273">Sloan &amp; Marx, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0145445512451273">Smyth, Hockemeyer, &amp; Tulloch, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants consisted of inpatients receiving treatment from an SUD treatment facility affiliated with a mental health center in north Mississippi. Following Institutional Review Board approval, volunteers (who were not compensated for participation) were screened for full or subsyndromal PTSD, the latter defined as meeting <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445512451273">APA, 2000</xref>) Criteria A and B but not both Criteria C and D. Criterion C includes numbing and avoidance symptoms, and Criterion D includes hyperarousal symptoms. Considerable evidence indicates that subsyndromal PTSD can produce functional impairments and symptom severity comparable to that associated with the full diagnosis (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0145445512451273">Marshall et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0145445512451273">Stein, Walker, Hazen, &amp; Forde, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0145445512451273">Zlotnick, Franklin, &amp; Zimmerman, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>A total of 93 (36.9%) patients of 252 screened met criteria for the study. See the flowchart diagram for the numbers of participants at each point in the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145445512451273">Figure 1</xref>). Sixty-eight (73.1%) agreed to treatment, 64 completed baseline measures, 50 completed treatment, and 45 completed the posttreatment assessment. Of the 48 patients who met study criteria but did not complete the study, 25 refused to participate in the treatment, 13 left the inpatient substance abuse treatment center prior to treatment completion, 5 were forced to leave the treatment center due to rule violations, and 5 completed treatment but left the treatment center prior to collecting the first postassessment data. Of the 45 treatment completers, 17 completed the 3-month follow-up assessment. The group that met criteria for the study did not differ significantly from the group that completed treatment and the posttreatment assessment on age, <italic>t</italic>(91) = 1.60, <italic>ns</italic>; gender, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 0.76, <italic>ns</italic>; marital status, χ<sup>2</sup>(2) = 0.44, <italic>ns</italic>; education level, χ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 7.69, <italic>ns</italic>; or initial PTSD symptom severity, <italic>t</italic>(91) = 0.75, <italic>ns</italic>.

<p>The final sample of 45 participants who completed the posttreatment assessment consisted of 32 (71.1%) females and 13 (28.9%) males with a mean age of 36.36 (range = 20-57; <italic>SD</italic> = 10.38). The sample was Caucasian (97.8%), except for one African American (2.2%). Participants’ marital status varied considerably: 13 (28.9%) were single, 12 (26.7%) were married, and 20 (44.4%) were separated, divorced, or widowed. In terms of education, 6 (13.3%) participants had less than 12 years of education, 13 (28.9%) achieved a high school diploma or equivalency, 18 (40.0%) completed some college, and 8 (17.8%) had a college degree. Participants experienced a variety of traumatic events: physical assault/assault with weapon (20.0%); sexual assault/other unwanted sexual experience (26.6%); sudden death, violent or otherwise (24.5%); and motor vehicle accident (4.4%). Several of the traumas described in the “other” category of the trauma checklist (22.2%), could match named categories, mostly, “sudden, unexpected death” and “severe human suffering.”</p>

Similar to the CAPS, the MPSS can be scored in multiple ways, and those most common in the literature were used. A total MPSS severity score (maximum 119) was calculated by summing the frequency and intensity scores for all the items. The three subscales corresponding to the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445512451273">APA, 2000</xref>) Criteria B, C, and D symptoms for PTSD were calculated by summing the frequency and intensity scores for those items assessing each criteria set. To diagnose PTSD, a symptom was considered present with a frequency score of at least 1 and an intensity score greater than 1—comparable to standard scoring for the CAPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445512451273">Blake et al., 1995</xref>). Participants received a diagnosis of subsyndromal PTSD if all criteria except C or D were met.</p>

<title>Beck Depression Inventory–Second Edition (BDI-II)</title>
<p>The BDI-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445512451273">Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996</xref>) is a 21-item, self-report measure of depression symptoms. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3. The BDI-II has high internal consistency, with alpha coefficients of .92 and .93 for samples of outpatients and college students, respectively. The temporal stability of the BDI-II is sound, with a 1-week test–retest correlation of .93. Convergent validity support for the BDI-II comes from expected relationships found with other measures of depressive symptomatology and anxiety.</p>

<title>Outcome Questionnaire (OQ-45.2)</title>
<p>The OQ-45.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0145445512451273">Lambert et al., 1996</xref>) is a 45-item, self-report measure of broad psychological functioning. It is designed to be administered prior to and during treatment to assess and track change. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from “never” to “almost always.” The OQ-45.2 yields three subscales labeled Symptom Distress (SD), Interpersonal Relations (IR), and Social Role (SR). In addition, the subscales can be summed to arrive at a total score. The OQ-45.2 has demonstrated sufficient internal consistency, with alpha coefficients ranging from .70 to .93. Test–retest correlations range from .78 to .84. The concurrent validity of the OQ-45.2 is supported by reports finding expected relationships with many measures of similar variables.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>All patients (<italic>N</italic> = 252) entering the SUD treatment center during the study agreed to participate in the screening phase, which consisted of obtaining informed consent and administering a demographics form, the LEC, and MPSS—all within 3 days of entry to the inpatient unit. Participants meeting criteria for current PTSD or subsyndromal PTSD on the MPSS were invited to participate in the treatment phase of the study. Informed consent was obtained from willing participants, and they were then administered the BDI-II and OQ-45.2, as well as several other measures as part of a larger study. Four treatment sessions, initiated within a week of inpatient entry, were then held on consecutive days from Monday through Thursday. During each treatment session, participants received written instructions (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0145445512451273">Pennebaker &amp; Campbell, 2000</xref>) that asked them to write about their most traumatic experience for 30 min:<disp-quote>
<p>For the next 30 minutes, I would like you to write about your very deepest thoughts and feelings about the most upsetting or traumatic experience of your entire life. In your writing, I’d like you to really let go and explore your very deepest emotions and thoughts. The purpose of this is to help you to re-experience all aspects of the event, including emotions, but in the safety of this room. Write the most detailed description of the event that you can, including your thoughts, feelings and actions just before the event, while the event was occurring, and after the event. Include what happened in detail, how you were feeling at each moment in time [e.g., I was terrified, my heart was pounding, I was dizzy with fear], what you were thinking [e.g., I thought I was going to die]. Include your current thoughts and feelings about the event along with the impact the event has had on your life. Try to write for the entire time. If you cannot think of anything else to write and you have written about every detail you can recall, please read over what you have written several times for the remainder of the session. As you re-read, please resume writing at any time you recall other details, reactions at the time or present reflections on your experience. Do not be concerned with spelling, sentence structure, or grammar. All of your writing will be confidential. Remind yourself that the purpose of the writing task is to begin to reverse your habit of avoiding certain thoughts and feelings associated with your traumatic experience. This will produce discomfort, at least in early sessions, if you push yourself. The discomfort is your guide telling you that you are working hard to get better.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For treatment sessions, the therapist met each participant individually, handed them a copy of the writing instructions and paper, and escorted them to a quiet and private room where they completed the writing. After 30 min, the therapist stopped them, collected the writing, and walked them out. There was no processing of reactions to writing with the therapist.</p>
<p>Posttreatment assessments were conducted 2 weeks after the last writing session. Participants again completed the MPSS, BDI-II, and OQ-45.2. In addition, contact information was collected for the follow-up assessment. Follow-up questionnaires (MPSS, BDI-II, and OQ-45.2) were mailed 3 months after the last writing session with a postage-paid, return-addressed envelope. All participants received contact information for the experimenters in case they became interested in receiving study results or had subsequent concerns about participation. Participants received telephone prompts after the questionnaires were mailed in an attempt to maximize follow-up data collection. To increase participant confidence in confidentiality, all assessment materials were coded: No names were placed on materials.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There are no published studies that have examined a Pennebaker-based WD treatment protocol for treating PTSD in an inpatient SUD sample. The results from the present study are promising for the application of WD treatment to these dually diagnosed individuals, a population that is largely underserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145445512451273">Brown, Stout, &amp; Gannon-Rowley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445512451273">Brown, Stout, &amp; Mueller, 1999</xref>). The MPSS, BDI-II, and OQ-45.2 used to track changes in PTSD, depression, and general psychopathology over the course of treatment showed that symptoms significantly decreased between pretreatment and 2-week posttreatment assessments. The MPSS effect size was substantial (1.57), particularly given that the WD intervention was minimal. All results between pretreatment scores and 3-month follow-up scores were significant whether computed with only the 17 participants who provided follow-up data or, much more conservatively, with pretreatment scores substituted for missing participants. However, MPSS effect sizes at follow-up were smaller than at posttreatment, 0.76 and 0.45, respectively, for the two computational methods. Improvements from the pretreatment MPSS mean score for all 64 participants who completed baseline measures (<italic>M</italic> = 75.8) were supported by FIML estimation, which estimated the MPSS posttreatment mean score as 39.1 and the follow-up score as 41.6—indicating reasonably sustained improvement over the follow-up period.</p>
<p>Comparing our findings to other treatments for PTSD, the pre- to posttreatment MPSS effect size of 1.57 exceeds the overall effect size of 0.52 reported in a meta-analysis of several PTSD treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0145445512451273">Sherman, 1998</xref>). The meta-analysis follow-up effect size of 0.64 was also comparable to the follow-up effect sizes in the present study. It is possible that SUD individuals submitting to inpatient treatment may be particularly motivated for change, which might lead them to engage in a way that magnifies the effect of such a modest intervention as WD. Compared with intensive, empirically supported PTSD treatments, which require 15 to 30 hr of therapist time, WD treatment, requiring only minutes, appears cost-effective.</p>
<p>Contrary to hypothesized limitations of WD treatment for individuals with more severe PTSD symptoms or a full PTSD diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0145445512451273">Sloan &amp; Marx, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0145445512451273">Smyth, Hockemeyer, &amp; Tulloch, 2008</xref>), we found the opposite: Severity was substantially correlated with pre–post treatment symptom improvement. Of course, regression to the mean must be considered, and our participants’ baseline scores were quite high, which increases regression effect probability. Although it is impossible to tease out regression effects to determine whether more severe cases actually do better, it is clear that these data do not support the hypothesis that WD is less effective for diagnosed or severe PTSD cases.</p>
<p>Several study limitations warrant discussion. The major limitation is the absence of a control group. The greatest concern, that treatment effects may be a result of factors other than WD treatment, lies primarily with the concurrent SUD treatment (eclectic in the facility, with both AA models and cognitive behavior therapy—in individual, group, and family formats). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445512451273">Coffey et al. (2007)</xref> found that PTSD symptoms decreased with SUD treatment alone. However, the magnitude of symptom change in our sample was over three times greater than the symptom change reported in this sole study of the phenomenon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0145445512451273">Figure 2</xref>). It deserves noting that our depression and overall functioning measures (i.e., BDI-II and OQ-45.2) are much more likely to be confounded by the SUD treatment. Supporting that the changes observed resulted from WD treatment were the numerous unsolicited participant comments that WD significantly benefited them. It is also possible that the WD treatment may have facilitated further emotional processing of traumas through disclosure in individual and group SUD treatments (although PTSD was never targeted, according to staff). Such a complementary or synergistic combination tempers conclusions that can be drawn about the effectiveness of standard WD treatment alone for PTSD.</p>
<p>Other limitations deserve comment. The lack of participant racial diversity and a modest sample size, due to the fact that only about half of the eligible participants elected to receive treatment and then completed treatment, raise generalizability concerns. There is some indirect evidence that the sample was representative, however. The higher proportion of females (i.e., 71% of the sample) matches data that indicate PTSD prevalence is higher in females than males with SUD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145445512451273">Brady et al., 2004</xref>). Also, the pretreatment MPSS score of 74.1 compares well with the 70.4 baseline CAPS score of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0145445512451273">Resick et al.’s (2008)</xref> writing treatment group (the two measures have parallel content and scoring).</p>
<p>The high rate of attrition for the 3-month follow-up assessment period (62%) limits confidence in conclusions based on that small subsample. However, this rate is comparable to studies applying intensive PTSD treatment concurrently with SUD treatment. For example, treatment attrition was 61% in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145445512451273">Brady, Dansky, Back, Foa, and Carroll (2001)</xref>, but both high rates compare with the 72% attrition for cocaine treatment alone in the National Institute of Drug Abuse Collaborative Cocaine Treatment Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145445512451273">Coffey, Dansky, &amp; Brady, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, our results show an apparent decline in effect sizes over time, and a longer term follow-up might show further loss and point to a need for more extensive writing treatment. It should be noted that our 3-month follow-up was on par with the longest follow-up intervals found in the WD treatment literature for trauma and PTSD.</p>
<p>Pending systematic replication with suitable controls, WD treatment in an SUD treatment environment may have many potential benefits. Unlike intensive PTSD treatments, WD treatment, as used in this study, requires a small time commitment from treatment providers: Clinicians could address PTSD in SUD patients without compromising their primary SUD treatment focus. In addition, both SUD patients with PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145445512451273">Brown et al., 1998</xref>) and SUD researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0145445512451273">Ouimette, Brown, &amp; Najavits, 1998</xref>) support simultaneous treatment of both disorders. For those who warn of the dangers of addressing PTSD early in SUD treatment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0145445512451273">Triffleman, Carroll, &amp; Kellogg, 1999</xref>), WD treatment implementation could provide opportunities for multiple lower risk and inexpensive trials to test this hypothesis.</p>
<p>In summary, the results from this study appear very promising for the use of a WD treatment protocol for PTSD in SUD inpatients. However, future controlled studies with structured clinical diagnostic interviews and long-term follow-up are required to validate these results and to investigate cost-effectiveness of more intensive WD approaches (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0145445512451273">Resick et al., 2008</xref>). Those studies should also examine the effect of WD treatment on SUD outcomes. With converging evidence from future studies, writing strategies may emerge as effective, readily accepted, and easily implemented treatment options for PTSD in SUD treatment settings. Alternatively, successful WD use in SUD clinics resistant to more intensive PTSD treatments might pave the way for subsequent acceptance of those known highly effective approaches.</p>
