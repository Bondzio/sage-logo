<body>
<p>Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the subsequent collapse of Cuba’s centralized economy, pursuing relationships with foreign visitors to the island has emerged as a viable means of accessing hard currency, consumer goods, travel, and emigration—of gaining admittance to a perceived better life. During years of intense economic hardship, which the Cuban government termed its <italic>Período especial en tiempo de paz</italic> (“Special Period in Peace Time”), the plummeting value of state-provided salaries, as well as chronic shortages of everything from basic foods to clothing and paper, meant that Cubans suffered from economic constrictions worse than those felt during the Great Depression in the American Midwest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0304375412470773">1</xref></sup> It is in this desperate context that the Cuban state opened its doors to international tourism.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, individual Cubans have been forced to find novel ways to deal with severe deprivation, often with varying degrees of legality. This practice, or rather this set of practices, is known as <italic>jineterismo—</italic>derived from the Spanish verb <italic>jinetear —</italic>“to jockey.” For men, <italic>jineterismo</italic> can mean a range of activities including illegal selling of cigars and rum, finding restaurants and accommodation for tourists, acting as an unofficial tour guide, and romantic and sexual liaisons; women’s interactions with foreigners, on the other hand, are generally understood to be sexual in nature<italic>—</italic>these are the <italic>jineteras</italic>.</p>
<p>There has been much debate, both in Cuba and abroad, as to whether or not using sex and romance with tourists (short or long term, serious or casual) to alleviate hardship constitutes prostitution; however, the Cuban state has been more or less unequivocal in its stance, even as it allows and encourages the tourism sector to grow.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0304375412470773">2</xref></sup> Beginning in 1998 with <italic>Operativo Lacra </italic>(Operation Vice), the state apparatus, acting mostly through the <italic>Policía Nacional Revolucionaria </italic>(National Revolutionary Police), has carried out a sweeping agenda of arrests, incarcerations, and “rehabilitation programs” against people<italic>—</italic>particularly young women of color<italic>—</italic>presumed to be acting as “prostitutes” based on their age, gender, perceived racial categorization, style of dress, and presence in heavily touristed zones of country. It is a controversial issue<italic>—</italic>one which has achieved some publicity abroad in major newspapers and magazines<italic>—</italic>in a country which has laid claim to the total eradication of sex work since the 1960s, and which still maintains that its socialist economy can provide for all of its citizens, in spite of its deep economic crisis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0304375412470773">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Comparatively little has been said in the academic literature, however, about the existence (and repression) of these relationships and even less has been said about the <italic>politics</italic> of seeking, finding, celebrating, condemning, or punishing sexual-affective relationships between Cubans and foreigners. There had been a small number of sociological studies, most notably by writers like Amalia Cabezas and Alyssa García,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0304375412470773">4</xref></sup> but even these mostly avoid the broader political implications of what I saw to be an inherently political question: the pathologization and criminalization of Cuban women’s sexual subjectivities. This article, written shortly after I returned from doing ethnographic fieldwork and interviews in Cuba, represents some of my first observations of the Cuban setting.</p>
<p>In conversation with young Cubans, it seemed that a discursive struggle has materialized as a part of the escalating tension between urban youth and state institutions, a conflict over the assignation of meaning (or meanings) to new sexual identities, the problematization of these sexual relations, and the creation of new objects of disciplinary power. The very words used to describe activities and identities<italic>—</italic>including but certainly not limited to the commonly used jinetera/jinetero<italic>—</italic>have taken on new significance. Specific labels ranging from crass (<italic>puta</italic> or <italic>prostituta</italic>) to enigmatic (<italic>candelero</italic> or <italic>luchadora</italic>) have ebbed and flowed in popular parlance, each loaded with different raced and gendered implications and political commitments. As state governance of bodies and sexualities evolves, I argue that many young Cubans have begun to use bodily and sexual practices as tools to circumvent poverty, resist state dictates on morality and austerity, and create new subjectivities. Language, for its part, has become a major weapon, alternately disciplinary and liberatory, in the struggle for (self-)definition. In Cuba, the very idea of jineterismo<italic>—</italic>understood as a set of sexual, affective, and economic relational activities<italic>—</italic>is overlaid with assumptions about race, gender, class, and sexuality, about moral and social values, ethics, and lifestyles. The concept is bandied about fairly readily in the abstract, but this common usage belies a far more complex and often contradictory set of actors and activities. In practice, the term has come to be applied to such a broad range of relationships, from brief encounters to long-term committed partnerships, that trying to find a clear definition of who is in and who is out is useless.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0304375412470773">5</xref></sup> It is the idea of something called jineterismo, and the presumption of who fits the bill, that matters. This is a discourse which has proved disciplinary and even repressive to a broad sector of the Cuban population in recent years. Through the stories of several young Cubans whom I interviewed in 2010, however, simplistic understandings of jineterismo can be challenged, destabilizing its power as a disciplinary category and elaborating a more nuanced picture of how young Cubans view their relationships, their place in society, and their experience of politics.</p>

<title>Beholden to No One</title>
<p>Early on during my time in Cuba, I began frequenting the terrace of the Hotel St. John as a place to take stock after a day of research and to write my field journal. There were a number of regulars there, mostly foreigners, but a pair of them caught my eye in particular<italic>—</italic>a young woman and her older companion, easily thirty years her senior and clearly foreign, even to my untrained eye. A friend of mine, over coffee at the St. John, had once glanced pointedly in their direction and said wryly, “Fieldwork.” Finally one day, I had the chance to speak to them both.</p>
<p>Yakelín<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0304375412470773">6</xref></sup> comes to the Hotel St. John every day around two o’clock in the afternoon. Most days, Jean-Claude is already there, ensconced on the terrace with a glass of dark rum, chatting amiably with the staff, or pensively smoking a cigar as he waits. When she arrives, she kisses him quickly before settling down for a drink on the terrace. The hotel is rather unassuming, but it sits just steps from the busy east end of Calle 23, known as <italic>La Rampa</italic>, and blocks from the historic University of Havana, and as such Hotel St. John has become a haven for tourists and foreign students who come here for strong coffee and cold beer. After an hour or so, they walk away together, hand in hand.</p>
<p>This same routine has been going on for more than two years now, almost since the day that Yakelín first met Jean-Claude, walking along Calle 23 with a friend, only blocks from where she sits today. She was twenty-one years old, living in a small flat with her mother, father, brother, two sisters, aunt, uncle, two cousins, and her grandmother. After graduating from a boarding school in the countryside, she had elected not to continue to university and was back in Havana with her family. Like so many others, her family worked hard to make ends meet, and Yakelín was looking for ways to lighten the burden. Not long after they met, Jean-Claude made her a proposition. “He suggested that, since I was <italic>en la lucha</italic> [struggling to get by], you know, he suggested that I no longer be in the streets [looking for leads on work, food, clothes] and that he was going to help me <italic>resolver mis problemas</italic> [solve my problems]. And since then, he’s my boyfriend.”</p>
<p>Jean-Claude is married, but Yakelín says that in spite of that they have a `formal relationship'<italic>—</italic>she lives in a comfortable <italic>casa particular</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0304375412470773">7</xref></sup> for which he pays, and they spend every afternoon together. As a retiree, Jean-Claude lives more or less permanently in Cuba, leaving only to attend to his affairs in France and returning laden with gifts including clothing, jewelry, and even a television. He provides her with spending money and helps to support her family as well. She says she loves the independence he has given her, even though she readily acknowledges the implied contradiction<italic>—</italic>she has found her freedom in total dependence on him. Yakelín has no job at present, not because she particularly dislikes the idea, but rather because the salary is simply not worth the trouble.</p>
<p>They make a striking couple. Jean-Claude is a heavy-set Frenchman with thinning white hair, the quintessential European tourist with a gold chain showing through the loosened collar of his <italic>guayabera</italic> shirt, an ever-present cigar, and a burgeoning self-assurance suggesting affluence and social status. Yakelín, on the other hand, is a slender, arrestingly beautiful young woman with espresso skin and hair that falls to her waist. She wears tight-fitting, stylish clothing, obscures her eyes with immense sunglasses, and her many gold bangles jingle with each languid movement<italic>—</italic>the quintessential <italic>cubanita</italic>. It comes as no surprise, then, that they attract attention as a pair; indeed, she is frequently stopped by the police and asked for her identification when they are together, at which point Jean-Claude assures the officers that she is his girlfriend and need not concern them.</p>
<p>Jean-Claude, for his part, speaks often about the difficulties involved in pursuing a relationship as a foreigner with a Cuban woman<italic>—</italic>the bureaucratic and administrative problems which prevent Cubans and foreigners from cohabiting but also the constant attention from the police. He mentions briefly that he worries Yakelín will one day be approached in his absence, but then waves away the unwelcome thought like a bothersome fly.</p>
<p>“When they see us, when they see the age difference<italic>—</italic>me with a tourist<italic>—</italic>they think I’m a jinetera,” she says, but that is one thing that Yakelín is clear that she is not. She never went looking for a relationship with a tourist, nor does she know many foreigners. While Jean-Claude's money has certainly profoundly improved her circumstances, she insists it is not central to their affective bond and that she is not seeking a way out of Cuba<italic>—</italic>she would like to see France, certainly, but she would miss Cuba far too much to leave it forever. Yakelín knows what her relationship looks like to outside observers, particularly given that she does not currently have a state-sector job, so she is very careful not to court trouble in other respects<italic>—</italic>she regularly attends the meetings of her local Comité de Defensa de la Revolución (CDR) and is a dues-paying member of the Federación de Mujeres Cubanas (FMC).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0304375412470773">8</xref></sup> Beyond that, she wants nothing to do with politics<italic>—</italic>she does not see the point in even broaching the subject.</p>
<p>When asked about the future, Yakelín takes a moment to think, looking across the patio at Jean-Claude where he sits, conversing with a friend a few tables away while we talk. “I would like to get married,” she says with a wry smile, “But not to him. I love him very much, but unfortunately, he’s already married. What I would like<italic>—</italic>what I would really like<italic>—</italic>is my own house. I like my independence, you know, and I want to be beholden to no one.” She has no immediate plans for anything to change, though, and in the meantime she says she is happy spending her afternoons on the terrace of the Hotel St. John.</p>
<p>What had first drawn me to Yakelín and Jean-Claude was outside appearances: they could not have fit the stereotype of a jinetera and her foreign date better, but on closer examination, they gave the impression of genuine and utter normality, despite their circumstances, which were atypical to say the least. Yakelín challenges commonly-held ideas about who (or what) constitutes a jinetera. Her physical form is paradigmatic of the category<italic>—</italic>she is a young, very dark-skinned woman attired in designer clothes with elaborately manicured nails, defying the income of the vast majority of Cubans<italic>—</italic>and this is brought all the more sharply into focus when she is seen alongside Jean-Claude. Outside observers regularly presuppose their relationship to be purely transactional and devoid of genuine emotional attachment, assuming that money and love are antithetical, mutually repellent concepts<italic>—</italic>and that sex can only occur in the context of one (prostitution) or the other (a <italic>real</italic> relationship), and never the twain shall meet. Yakelín herself, however, is secure in her understanding of their relationship as genuine and affectionate. Their relationship challenges the notion that any liaison between a Cuban (especially a Cuban woman of color) and a foreigner (especially a foreign white man) must necessarily be construed as jineterismo, in the sense of being purely financially interested, or even prostitution.</p>
<p>To Yakelín, this relationship provides a better life and the freedom to spend her time as she wishes and with someone for whom she cares deeply. Her experience is borne out by centuries of history wherein individuals, and women in particular, have had to consider their future financial well-being and security as an important factor<italic>—</italic>sometimes the principal determinant<italic>—</italic>in choosing a partner. This certainly continues to be a salient theory in Cuba, where traditional <italic>machista</italic> understandings of proper gender roles persist, all the more prominently given the hardships of the “Special Period.” Though state socialism has long pushed for women’s total inclusion in education and the workplace, with a great degree of success, it is nonetheless still quite common to hear young Cuban women express the worry that, in the absence of a partner who can support them, they will quickly become destitute, not being able<italic>—</italic>or, in some cases, willing<italic>—</italic>to subsist on their own earnings. Troubling as this revelation may be, it does nothing to diminish the affective bond that is both potentially and actually present in such relationships; indeed, Viviana Zelizer argues that, far from necessarily contaminating a loving relationship, financial support often plays an affirmative, reinforcing role in intimate relationships: “money cohabits regularly with intimacy, even sustains it.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0304375412470773">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Jinetera is often a label applied from the outside by others, and it is one that Yakelín does not feel describes her experience, having never sought a relationship with a foreigner. Her current relationship is stable and based on mutual affection, so she does not feel the shoe fits, since jineteras are meant to be young women who specifically seek out tourist men, and who flit from one man to the next both frequently and easily.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0304375412470773">10</xref></sup> Her story demonstrates that there is no one type of woman who becomes romantically and sexually involved with a non-Cuban man; her behavior and her relationships do not conform to the received knowledge on jineterismo in Cuba. None of this, of course, means that Yakelín does not experience the very real disciplinary effects of the discourse of jineterismo. She is regularly stopped by police officers for identification checks, and she and Jean-Claude have struggled to find permanent accommodation where they can legally reside together. When I spoke with her, Yakelín seemed confident and unafraid, even flippant, which was not something I saw in many of my interviewees, but it became clear as the conversation wore on that this came down to Jean-Claude<italic>—</italic>he was providing for her for the foreseeable future and he was willing to own their relationship, at least thus far. Her careful observance of some of the other tenets of Cuban socialism, such as the CDR meetings and the FMC membership, is also noteworthy<italic>—</italic>being with a foreigner and not having a state-sector job both count as strikes against, so it becomes increasingly important to tick all the other relevant boxes, as it were. While she did not lay claim to any explicit or transformational political views, Yakelín is a savvy actor within the current political system and acutely aware of her precarious position. Her experience is marked in particular by her race and her gender and by assumptions about her sexuality based on these factors, which together ensure that her relationship will never be taken at face value and will continue to place roadblocks in her path.</p></sec>

<title>Never Found that Person</title>
<p>Nadia grew up in a small town in Pinar del Río province, west of Havana. At the height of the Special Period, she says, her family subsisted on nothing more than potatoes, as staples like rice, bread, meat, eggs, and beans disappeared from the shelves of shops into thin air. It was on a day such as this, with nothing to eat, that Nadia met an Italian tourist who stopped to pick her up as she hitchhiked to school. They chatted along the way, and eventually he asked her to go out with him in the evening, and she agreed. The two of them spent the night in a casa particular that he had rented for the occasion, and in the morning, he slipped a wad of notes into her pocket as they said good-bye. She was 15.</p>
<p>Two years later, Nadia went to Pinar del Río city with a friend, where they met another foreign tourist, this time from Spain, and the three went to bed together. In both cases, Nadia says, she never made any request for money. “I wanted to do it, but not for money. I never asked, but they gave it to me, like a gift,” she says, “And I didn’t say no. Who would say no? I was desperate. I was about to start college.”</p>
<p>The Spaniard returned a year later, while Nadia was studying in Havana, but she told him at the end of that visit that she didn’t want to see him again. “He was a nice man, more or less,” she says of him now, “But he used us.”</p>
<p>She tried to turn her focus to her studies and her future career, but a student living allowance of only 100 pesos per month<italic>—</italic>around $4 USD<italic>—</italic>meant that financial security was never far from her mind. Delighted as she was with her course of studies in English language and literature, Nadia knew she could not survive that way, so she did what many Cuban university students do<italic>—</italic>she entertained the advances of foreign men, and in exchange she got restaurant meals and gifts of cash or clothes. Eventually, she met another Italian traveller who became a longer-term companion, taking her with him to Varadero, Trinidad, and Cienfuegos. “He was here for a month, and we were girlfriend and boyfriend. We were a couple. We had an arrangement. I felt more confident and … just better with him, you know? He knew how to treat me,” she says.</p>
<p>At the end of his month in Cuba, Nadia’s Italian friend asked her to come to Europe with him. She refused, she says, simply because she was afraid of taking such a giant leap. These days, she sometimes regrets her choice, but her Italian companion was married and she was not sure at the time to what extent she could depend on him, moving to Italy as a mistress rather than a wife.</p>
<p>Soon, with pressures to make ends meet mounting, Nadia began going out in the evenings with a friend from college to places like the <italic>Malecón</italic> and <italic>Quinta Avenida</italic>, to actively seek out tourists’ attentions. These were mostly brief interactions, she says, and the money they received went to pay for the girls’ food and housing while they studied.</p>
<p>“We were students, but we needed the money. We were together and I wasn’t scared.” So the two continued this way for more than a year, studying during the week and going out in search of foreign men on weekends. Even in all this time, she says she never had any trouble with the police, a lucky fact that she credits to her fair complexion, her light brown curls, and her student card, which were enough to convince officers performing random checks and sweeps that she was not “that” kind of girl.</p>
<p>Once she had finally completed her studies, Nadia became an English teacher, but only three months into her career of choice, she received the news that her stepfather had passed away. She found herself back in Pinar del Río, teaching at the local school and helping to support her mother. Yet, another Italian man appeared in her life, and Nadia entered into a second longer-term attachment, but all the while she hid the relationship from her mother, even as his contributions helped to support their entire family. “I told her that I had a Cuban boyfriend with money, that he had family abroad.” That was the last time she spent time with a foreigner.</p>
<p>Seven years later, sitting in a seedy fast food restaurant in noisy Centro Habana, Nadia fidgets, turning an empty pop can over and over in her hands as she thinks back on those years. She has long since quit teaching, having damaged her vocal chords, and now she has moved back to Havana to try to make things work with her second long-term Cuban partner, bringing with her their eight-month-old baby and her five-year-old daughter from her last relationship. Her Cuban partners have each known a little of her past, but neither know as much as I now do; her family and friends at home in Pinar del Río, however, still know nothing and Nadia intends to keep it that way.</p>
<p>“I think I need to see a shrink, to let it all go. I wonder if there was another way to make money, but I had to finish college,” she says, shaking her head. “I had low self-esteem back then. It stays with me.” She tells me that she has found various ways of making money, from taking photos of tourists along the Malecón, to her current job as a horse-and-buggy driver in the old city, but making ends meet is still a constant challenge. Though years have passed and at 30 she now considers herself to old to go looking for foreign men, Nadia still dreams of finding someone who can make all the struggles of her life vanish.</p>
<p>“All that time, I just wanted to get out, but I just didn’t find that person. I didn’t want to leave with someone who knew me like that<italic>—</italic>I wanted a real boyfriend, but I needed the money too badly to look for that. But it’s so hard here. For everything. I want to go to church and pray to find someone, or to accept this life. I don’t understand why people smoke and drink here, when there’s no money for food, but then I do understand because it’s an escape.”</p>
<p>She sits silently thinking and I am loath to interrupt her thoughts. The conversation has not been an easy one, as her memories seem to trouble her, but the present is no more comforting. She looks up finally and, with a sadness that belies the determination of her words, she says, “I’m not willing to live and die here.”</p>
<p>Walking away from that interview, having left Nadia with her partner and their daughter, I reflected on those final words and the volumes they spoke about the way she felt<italic>—</italic>and the way so many young Cubans felt<italic>—</italic>about the intense pressure to either resign oneself to austerity and accept the life laid out, or to resist and carve out something new, as yet incomplete and unknown. Forming relationships is a way to access opportunities, not just for financial security, but for a different kind of life. Like Yakelín, many of Nadia’s relationships defy the neat opposition between love and money that Zelizer and Cabezas underline. Indeed, as Derrick Hodge also notes, “there is no clear boundary between sex work and recreational sex” in Cuba, nor in many comparable locales for sex tourism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0304375412470773">11</xref></sup> The emotional/affective facet to even the most fleeting sexual encounters between Cubans and foreigners is not so much feigned as it is a means of maintaining the open-endedness of the interaction and the possibility for it to lead to a more serious relationship. Nadia, like many other young women, knew she was seeking out these men in order to alleviate her immediate economic struggles, but she kept an open mind to possibility, much like any dating scenario.</p>
<p>Nadia’s story stands in stark opposition to Yakelín’s in one regard: she was more than willing to call what she did “jineteando,” and yet she was not treated as a part of the category. She managed to maneuver through the world of dating and hooking up with tourists for many years without ever finding herself in any sort of trouble with the police. Nadia says that she was rarely subjected to random checks or asked to produce identification and, when she was, her status as both a student and a white woman established her as a morally irreproachable “good girl”<italic>—</italic>her whiteness, along with the social capital attached to university study, served to absolve her of suspicion and to recast her activities and associations as innocent rather than degenerate. In Havana, where the large university borders on some of the most heavily touristed zones in the country, thousands of young Cubans come into proximity with foreigners every day. Observed in public with foreigners, young white women are assumed to be in dating relationships, while young women of color are deemed to be engaging in jineterismo when they are seen publicly with men of other nationalities, or even other skin tones. Where whiteness stands as a marker for purity of morals and intentions, black and mulata (mixed-race) women are inscribed with perceived licentiousness and promiscuity. Notes Cabezas, “desire and affection are defined as ‘lighter’ and prostitution as ‘darker,’ effectively racialising the entire process.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0304375412470773">12</xref></sup> Thus, Nadia was able to carry on longer as a self-proclaimed jinetera, unmolested by police scrutiny, than many young women of color who claim no such label.</p>
<p>Nadia’s reasons for seeking out foreign men are clear, as are her feelings about it<italic>—</italic>grinding poverty, her own and her family’s, was the catalyst for her becoming what she calls a jinetera. The relationships she had, ranging from one night to one month, meant momentary escape from adversity and from the stress of confronting that adversity. On top of that, they also gave her the ability to continue pursuing what she still considers to be her calling: languages and teaching. Today, she would no longer call herself a jinetera, but her desire to meet a foreign man who could make her life easier has only increased. Nadia did not think about her situation in expressly political terms, but she articulates a deep dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs in Cuba, one which resonates across the island and bears deep political implications.</p>

<title>La Tierra De Los Mangos Bajitos</title>
<p>Lili has one goal: to leave Cuba. When I first met her, this was not apparent<italic>—</italic>she was among her friends, having drinks at a bar on Plaza de Dolores in Santiago, laughing musically and chatting with some mutual acquaintances. The other foreigners with us that night marveled at how sweet and guileless she seemed, totally without ulterior motive, a stark contrast to the Cubans who regularly approached them. She’s the real deal, they said.</p>
<p>The following day, at the beach, I saw a flash of that resolve when I told Lili the topic of my research. She propped herself up on one elbow in order to look at me directly and said, “We all want to leave Cuba. These girls just want their papers. The men … it’s like they’re buying your freedom, like they’re buying you. Or at least, that’s how I see it.” Then that determined look disappeared again, replaced by gaiety, as our friends returned from the water.</p>
<p>Today, it’s just her and me, facing each other across a wobbly table on the patio of El Piropo. Her beautiful spiral curls are pulled back tightly from her face and that intensity has returned. As she begins to tell me about her life and her world, a very confident and well-spoken person emerges. Lili is twenty-five. She was born in Santiago de Cuba and has lived there her entire life, with her mother, two brothers, uncle, and grandmother together under one roof. She did preuniversity study, but wound up enrolling in college for social work instead, as it would land her with a qualification and a comparatively good salary of 475 pesos ($19 USD) per month within a year’s time. She is even able to travel around Cuba to attend conventions and training sessions. Still, Lili is cynical about her work. “I really don’t like it anymore. I work with people who have a lot of problems, but I don’t have the power to resolve anything. It’s out of my hands.”</p>
<p>She started studying English two years ago, so that she could eventually get a job in a restaurant, where the pay<italic>—</italic>and the tips<italic>—</italic>are much better. Waitressing, though, is not Lili’s long-term plan. She cuts straight to the chase without my even asking.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know too many people who’ve had relationships with foreign men, because when I go out, I go out alone. Me, yes, I’ve dated foreigners<italic>—</italic>not many, but a few. It’s normal here, because of our situation [por la necesidad que hay] and because there are no other options. If you turn to jineteando<italic>—</italic>or to stealing or what have you<italic>—</italic>it’s because of <italic>la necesidad que hay</italic> [the desperate situation we’re in]. Young people, they want to have clothes, you know? They want to go out, to eat, everything. And here there’s nothing.</p>
<p>In my case, yes, I’m looking for a foreign man because I want to leave this country. That’s my case. I’m not looking for someone who comes for a vacation, has some fun with me, gives me money, and then leaves. No, no, no<italic>—</italic>nothing like that. I want something serious, I want him to fall in love with me<italic>—</italic>you know what I mean? I want him to take me back with him.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>She taps the table with each word for emphasis.</p>
<p>What about love? Is that important for her as well? She laughs cynically. “Look, I would really, really like to wind up falling in love with him, too. I would really like that. I don’t want him to buy me clothes or a cell phone, or to fix up my house. I want to leave Cuba<italic>—</italic>that’s all I want. That’s my objective. When I meet a foreign man, if there isn’t anything that attracts me personally to him, then I can’t. I won’t even consider it.”</p>
<p>Now for the big surprise: she’s already engaged. All of this time, we had been speaking in hypotheticals, and she was already planning her move out of Cuba. Her fiancé is a thirty-two-year-old Canadian who comes to visit every month and calls every day. Lili lights up, that bubbly persona returning as she describes him: he’s tall, a bit heavy set, but attractive and attentive. Cuban men, she pauses to point out, are not generally to her liking<italic>—</italic>they are unfaithful, aggressive, even violent, and only interested in money. Foreign men are different<italic>—</italic>they hold the door and let you pass through first. She quickly steers the conversation back to her fiancé.</p>
<p>“He’s the best,” she says. “I know that when I move to Canada, what I want to do is build my life with him. I don’t want to move to Canada and then leave him, you know? I’m serious about this. I want peace and security, and he can give me those, so I’ll stay with him. I want to get married and to work and to have a simple life. He worries that I’ll leave him, but when we get married, it will be serious business. I fully intend to die there,” she adds sardonically, with a twinkle in her eye.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m a little afraid to move to Canada, because I’m not going to see all the people I love here, the most important thing for me is to leave this country and to help my family. It hurts me to know that they have no way of getting ahead in life. It hurts me when there’s nothing to eat in my house. Every day, I ask God to help me leave this country so I can help my family. I don’t have a husband here, not a boyfriend, nothing. My one purpose is to leave Cuba and, bit by bit, to get my family out if I can.</p>
<p>But I never approached men on my own. I met my fiancé when we were introduced. There are different types of women out there, working to get by and to support their families. I see the same ones every day in the same places, one day with one guy, the next day with another. I don’t know anyone who does that, because my friends are all social workers and university students, and they’re mostly married with kids. But then again, some of those girls are made to do it by their Cuban men.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>She has been speaking rapidly, punctuating her thoughts with jabs on the table’s surface and in the air. I’ve barely spoken a word, but at this point, I decide to press her. I ask about her experiences with the police. Has she ever been targeted for identification checks or accused of being a jinetera? “No, never, but that is because I have always been very careful, you know? My fiancé and I don’t go out often and, when we do<italic>—</italic>well, how do I put this?<italic>—</italic>he’s the same colour as me. Mixed race. He looks Cuban. As long as he doesn’t speak, they think he’s Cuban. That was important to me.”</p>
<p>Lili is very aware of the risks she runs, being seen with foreigners, and she has taken calculated steps and conditioned her behavior and choices to mediate that risk. She mentions the registry books, which every casa particular is required to keep, and in which every guest is required to be registered, and how these are frequently used to track young women’s activities. If a woman’s name appears on the books of any casa particular alongside different men, Lili tells me, then she could very easily be sent to prison. She shakes her head in disbelief.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>What bothers me most in this country is that men<italic>—</italic>old, really old men<italic>—</italic>come here looking for young girls, wanting to pay them $5 USD, even $3 USD. They know how desperate people are here. They know they can’t do that in their own countries. Everyone does what they have to do, and if someone wants to sleep with a foreigner for $10 USD, fine. No man will ever buy me like that, not even if I were dying of hunger. They don’t have enough money, frankly. I’m worth way more than $20, $50, $100 USD. But, like the Aldeanos say, ‘<italic>esto es la tierra de los mangos bajitos</italic>’ [‘this is the land of low-hanging fruit’].<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0304375412470773">13</xref></sup> Our situation is bad and people are desperate. Everything here is a lie.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>I barely said a word while I sat at that table with Lili. She had so much to say that I didn’t really need to ask her anything at all. For her part, Lili was very explicit in her political views. She felt the Cuban system had rotted away in its fundamental values, that those principles exist today only as a smokescreen to conceal the self-interest of leaders. When it comes to state measures to control jineterismo, Lili’s thoughts were patently unambiguous: young women are punished for taking those limited options which are available to them. This, she felt, is both unfair and counterproductive, since it does nothing to address the roots of the issue or to give these women other means of addressing their pressing financial need.</p>
<p>The knowledge that her race renders her suspect has conditioned Lili’s behavior, precluding her from spending time in certain parts of her city, even causing her to keep to the relative safety of her own home. She has gone so far as to consider racial markers in choosing her partner, whose skin tone does not immediately identify him as a foreigner in the eyes of most Cubans. Lili’s experience is far from unique in this regard<italic>—</italic>on the street in Cuba, a woman of color seen with a white man is assumed to be a jinetera, based on the highly sexualized stereotype of Cuban women of color that is maintained both in Cuba and abroad. Coco Fusco believes this to be a broadly held conviction by many Cubans that women of color are less appropriate choices as marriage partners, and thus that white men seen with women of color must be foreign and with them only for sex.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0304375412470773">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Lili challenges the stereotypes about young women who pursue relationships with foreigners in many ways<italic>—</italic>she is educated, she holds down a regular job, and she does not angle for gifts or cash from the men she has met. Lili is intelligent and articulate, and although she actively and specifically sought out foreign boyfriends for the freedoms they could offer her, she entered into those relationships, she says, as she would into any other<italic>—</italic>as equals. She felt her freedom had to be bought, but she was willing to enter into that type of bargain only with someone she considered to be as worthy as she was herself.</p>
<p>The jinetera, as such, clearly does not exist<italic>—</italic>there is no essential category of individuals with any demonstrable commonalities which necessarily underlie their behavior or their ideological impertinence. What is more, the meanings attached by young Cubans to their relationships with foreigners cannot be accurately assumed or determined from the outside. As Zelizer argues, we all engage in processes of differentiation and meaning assignation, marking certain relationships as different from other, less acceptable forms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0304375412470773">15</xref></sup> Yakelín, Nadia, and Lili all spoke of this active, delicate practice which has itself become a site of contestation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0304375412470773">
<title>The Struggle for Meaning</title>
<p>If words such as jineterismo, “jinetero,” and jinetera are in fact empty signifiers, then what purpose do they serve? Relations of sexual intimacy, as Zelizer so aptly demonstrates, are very frequently accompanied by transfers of economic resources, often as a means of exhibiting care and attachment; furthermore, the parties to these kinds of interactions, particularly in scenarios where the stakes are high and confusion is likely, are usually vigilant about clarifying “whether the relationship is a marriage, courtship, prostitution, or some other different sort of social tie”<italic>—</italic>what Zelizer calls relational work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0304375412470773">16</xref></sup> One of the ways in which they do this is by marking relationships with names and labels that speak to their intended meanings, be they long term or fleeting, serious or light-hearted; however, outside actors are equally likely to assign meaning to what they see.</p>
<p>In Cuba, this has led to a discursive tug-of-war, heavily laden with normative assumptions about women’s sexuality, promiscuity, and moral integrity. As a function of this, a new terminology has sprung up around jineterismo and the people that populate it as a field of relations. Above and beyond the word jinetera (and its masculine variant, jinetero, though this carries a slightly different set of connotations) which is without a doubt the most common, there are many different terms used to describe people engaged in the sexual-affective economy, the meanings of which are neither absolute nor static. Far from simple semantics, defining and naming allows various actors within the field of relations<italic>—</italic>government, police, journalists, mass organizations, individuals, and society at large<italic>—</italic>to situate young Cubans on either side of various binaries including good/bad, right/wrong, virtue/vice. In this apparent battle for self-definition that I saw occurring in Cuba, language has become a major weapon. Here, I will attempt to explore some of the labels at play in the field. The specific terms concerned range from crass to enigmatic, and they tend to ebb and flow over time in popular parlance, each loaded with different raced and gendered implications and political commitments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0304375412470773">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Certainly, words like <italic>prostituta </italic>and <italic>puta </italic>exist in Cuba, but the standard jinetera is far more popular, at least in part because of its inherent fluidity, continuing to represent a broader notion of what these relationships mean. Without question, it carries less stigma than “prostituta,” which seems to be used almost exclusively by state organs. Jinetera has evolved over time as a uniquely Cuban neologism since the 1960s and 1970s, when it was already being used to denote the exchange of sexual favors for access to scarce goods in a closed economy. Through the late 1980s, and very prominently in the 1990s, it came to be used to describe the phenomenon of Cubans interacting with foreigners in various ways as a means to alleviate hardship; when it came to sexual liaisons with said foreigners, the Cubans in question were (and continue to be) presumed to be women of color<italic>—</italic>and vice versa. Noelle Stout argues that, far from being a “misnomer for prostitution,” the term jineterismo is indicative of a more emancipatory paradigm that challenges “traditional notions of the victimized prostitute” and recasts them with greater agency and power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0304375412470773">18</xref></sup> Or, as Teresa Marrero somewhat more colorfully puts it,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>the word prompts the nature of the exchange; jineteras, like jinetes, mount and control the animal being ridden. This worldview suggests a rearranging of standard notions of the nature of (sexual) consumerism. While contemporary marketing notions hold that the buyer of goods and services reigns supreme, here Cuba’s jineterismo suggests that the provider of services can play and manipulate to its advantage the relation between consumer and provider.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0304375412470773">19</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There are those who argue that jineterismo is nothing more than prostitution,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0304375412470773">20</xref></sup> but its use in Cuba suggests something more fluid, indeterminate, and contingent than such a simple comparison implies. In the early days of the “Special Period,” jinetera in particular was a term that served to distance young women from the perceived criminality and low morality associated with supposed prostitution, speaking instead to their shrewd ability to manipulate their circumstances and support themselves amidst adversity. Coco Fusco describes how jineteras have become folkloric figures in post-Soviet Cuba, appearing in brightly-colored <italic>naïf </italic>paintings for sale in the tourist markets, and coming to embody the deeply engrained fantasy of Cuban mulata sensuality. Says Fusco, visiting Cuba in the mid-1990s, “I got the sense that on the street these women are perceived as heroic providers whose mythical sexual power is showing up the failures of an ailing macho regime.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0304375412470773">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Over time, however, the word jinetera has begun to take on a crassness that has led many of the young people with whom I spoke to eschew it in favor of other terms. Jinetera is also now understood across Cuba to have a specifically racial connotation to it, another source of stigma for some, as it has become inextricably linked to the lascivious image of the mulata. Thus, while jinetera is unarguably still the benchmark term, others have appeared and act as strategies to avoid creeping stigma. Some of these, used self-referentially by two of my interviewees in particular like banners for new identities, go even further toward expressing how young people in Cuba feel about their situations and the meaning of their actions. The first came from Andre, who is a twenty-five-year-old living in Centro Habana. Andre had studied computer science but, finding that the salaries available in state-sector jobs would hardly cover his living expenses, he has now elected not to work at all. He is very social, attractive, articulate, and engaging, so it comes as no real surprise that he has succeeded in making lasting connections with a few different foreign women. Most are significantly older than he is, some send him gifts of cash from abroad, all visit periodically. Andre says what he does is not prostitution, because his aim is to fall in love and build a genuine, committed relationship over time with one of his foreign girlfriends, eventually winding up in a happy marriage. He tells me that the government of Cuba is afraid of the “jinete,” but the way he sees it, everyone is engaged in the practice in some way or another, whether it is renting out rooms to foreigners, running a paladar, buying and selling on the black market, or becoming intimately involved with tourists. Tourism is the “principal source” of money for all Cubans, he says; the difference lies only in how they go about it. Andre referenced the tendency in Cuba to refer to tourism and tourists as <italic>el fuego</italic> (the fire)<italic>—</italic>they ask one another, <italic>¿Estás en el fuego?</italic> (“Are you in the fire?”), or say, <italic>Me voy al fuego</italic> (I’m going to the fire) when they are going out to meet foreigners. They use this term for multiple reasons: the fact that it is seen to be engulfing the country, the likelihood of getting burned and, in Andre’s eyes, its irresistibility. Andre finds the word jinetero to be somewhat vulgar; to that end, he calls himself a candelero, or candle-bearer.</p>
<p>Ana, on the other hand, prefers a different handle. I spoke to her along with three other girls, all from Batabanó and ranging in age from eighteen to twenty-eight , who were telling me about the tourist men who approached them in the nightclubs of Havana. The entire conversation had been tense and stilted, no matter how hard I tried to put them at ease. I had found one area of relative success: we were talking about labels<italic>—</italic>I listed a few different ones and they told me what each word evoked for them. They spoke with a sullen air of resignation, even shame, and said they did not see themselves reflected in any of the terms. The last one I posed to them was one that I had only recently encountered: <italic>luchadora</italic>, meaning “one who struggles” or “one who engages in <italic>la lucha</italic>.” Ana smiled for the first time and her face lit up. She said she liked that one, that it seemed strong and beautiful. The mood in the room lightened considerably from that point. All four of them appeared as if a weight was lifted from their shoulders, and we continued the interview in a far better footing.</p>
<p>These two examples illustrate that labeling is far more than a semantic issue<italic>—</italic>labels do work, they support and reject, they build up and break down. For the so-called jineteros and jineteras of Cuba, simply using a different word can radically change the game on multiple fronts. It can allow young people to avoid (or at least, attempt to avoid) some of the stigma of being branded as criminals or whores, since as the majority of my interviewees confirmed over and over again, these young people do not consider themselves prostitutes, and neither does Cuban society. Their involvement with foreigners is not understood as any particular slight to their moral integrity, nor as necessarily transactional or artificial. Furthermore, evolving terminology helps maintain open-endedness, so that their relationships with foreigners can evolve and take any number of forms in future, by denying a client/prostitute relationship with the foreign partners. Avoiding terms like prostitute and even the increasingly restrictive jinetera underlines the incompleteness and mutability of lived experiences. Perhaps most crucially, changing the terms of the game matters because it allows individuals to say not only what they are not<italic>—</italic>that is, prostitutes and criminals<italic>—</italic>but also to effectively articulate what they are, to create a new form of subjectivity. By taking on a label such as candelero, Andre creates an identity that speaks to the risk involved and paints himself and others like him as enigmatic, even brave, figures who cast light in the darkness. A conceited image, perhaps, but not one without basis: Andre has managed to boost his family’s standard of living considerably. Ana, on the other hand, situates herself within <italic>la lucha</italic>, or the daily struggle to make ends meet, a highly evocative and relatable concept in Cuba. Ana shows herself to be a self-reliant person with integrity, no different than any other Cuban and as worthy of the storied Cuban socialist solidarity as any other.</p>
<p>This is no simple issue of rebranding; on the contrary, words are one of the major weapons employed in a discursive struggle to define what jineterismo is and what it means, to deny the state-dominated discourse that would brand many young Cubans as whores and criminals, and to begin to create new and different lives in their own images. The discourse of prostitution, in which certain women are classed as “good” or “normal” and others as degenerate, dangerous, pathological, or immoral, forms part of a binary that seeks to control, regulating the behavior not of the ever-increasing sector of the population that it has itself rendered suspect. According to Stuart Hall, “the use of labelling and criminalization as part and parcel of the process of legitimating social control is clearly not confined to the past.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0304375412470773">22</xref></sup> The uncritical use of words like “prostitute” and “puta,” most frequently by state actors, and even increasingly jinetera, serves to depoliticize the process by which certain women are deemed to be in need of<italic>—</italic>and available for<italic>—</italic>state intervention. Words like jinetero and jinetera, as empty signifiers, have been increasingly drawn under the rubric of “prostituta.” The use of terms that go beyond this binary relation, whether luchadora or candelero, or<italic>—</italic>perhaps most importantly of all<italic>—</italic>the act of denying any terminology at all, destabilizes the simple opposition of “good woman”/prostitute, opening up possibilities for new relationships, identities and subjectivities.</p>

<title>Conclusion: Creating Liminal Identities and Defying Marginality</title>
<p>Jineterismo is a complex, contested, ambiguous, mutating set of relationships, activities, and even identities, and its meaning (or meanings) cannot be specified in advance, nor from the outside. Affective relationships between people of disparate cultural, racial, national, and socioeconomic backgrounds always exist within a framework of gendered and raced understandings of sexuality and morality, and of legitimate and illegitimate contexts for sexual interaction. In Cuba, the idea that there is a set of activities called jineterismo, and that it is one and the same with prostitution, works to shame and discipline young women’s purported sexual activities, casting an ever wider net based on age, gender, race, style of dress, and a perceived judgment of sexual promiscuity based on those factors. Speaking to young people who have had relationships with foreign visitors to Cuba, however, it became clear that the jinetera, as an emblematic figure with defined characteristics, does not exist, or is at least, as Cabezas observes, “quite an unstable subject.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0304375412470773">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>While differences of race and gender, not to mention significant economic disparities, frequently characterize relationships between Cubans and foreigners it is nonetheless regressive to portray the interactions as necessarily either economic <italic>or</italic> romantic, as racially motivated <italic>or</italic> the result of more “pure” motives, or even as a matter of exploiters and exploited, as is frequently done in literature on sex tourism and transcultural relationships.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0304375412470773">24</xref></sup> While it is true that privileged desire clearly is a determinant of options available to disadvantaged people in tourist destinations like Cuba, as Nancy Wonders and Raymond Michaelowski argue,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0304375412470773">25</xref></sup> to accept such a one-sided evaluation of the situation is to silence the young Cubans involved. Indeed, Laura Agustín asserts that depicting women involved in sexual economies as manipulated, helpless victims is not just reductionist, but also erases them as speaking subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0304375412470773">26</xref></sup> So it is in Cuba, where young women’s relationships are sharply divided between the commercial, which is “devoid of affectional attributes and vilified as racial fetishism,” and supposedly normative relationships.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0304375412470773">27</xref></sup> The state-led discourse of prostitution has served only to reinforce this binary.</p>
<p>The stories of Yakelín, Nadia, and Lili, as well as Ana and Andre, paint a far more conflicted, nuanced, and ambiguous picture of how contemporary youth in Cuba view their role in society, their futures, and even their political system. They defy analyses that would depict them as victims as well as restrictive notions of who they are and what they want. As Stout asserts, young Cubans today “describe a more complex world in which socialised health care, food subsidies and universal education are inalienable rights that effortlessly co-exist with the drive to acquire stylish tennis shoes, clothes, and the luxuries of the dollar economy.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0304375412470773">28</xref></sup> They contend that socialist ideals with which they have grown up, and to which many still ascribe, need not be seen as diametrically opposed to material well-being, nor even to international pop culture and fashion. By crafting new subject positions that destabilize traditional notions of race, gender, and even class, young Cubans are mediating their own circumstances in ways previously unavailable to them. The economic adversity experienced during the “Special Period,” which is still felt today, has opened up spaces to enact new political and sexual subjectivities, identities, and practices.</p>
<p>This is not to say that young people engaging in sexual interactions with foreigners have created an entirely emancipatory space without repression or retribution from state-centered institutions and sites of power; indeed, the struggle between Cuban youth and normative state power entails very real violence alongside the discursive push-and-pull. This violence takes the form of the arbitrary arrests and detentions, corruption and extortion, and policy brutality and sexual abuse, and the racialized bodies of young women in Cuba have become the objects of this state-led violence. The discourse of prostitution is not just a matter of semantics or symbolic status; rather, it is the means by which individual people are made visible and deemed available for this violence<italic>—</italic>symbolic, physical, sexual, and emotional. Crucially, however, it is also the terrain on which young Cubans are finding new ways of resisting the life prescribed for them through bodily practices, sometimes at great personal risk. They are using linguistic categories and tools<italic>—</italic>and sometimes even the lack thereof<italic>—</italic>to carve out a new space for themselves in which to live and love.</p>

<p>Conversely, and tellingly, what increasingly seems to be the global standard terminology, “sex worker,” has never taken root in Cuba. This is first because it would require sex work to be broadly accepted as a form of labor in the Cuban setting—both its socialist paradigm and its deep-seated ideas about gender—which is highly unlikely, and secondly, at the individual level, because it forecloses the possibility for other types of relationships to evolve out of these interactions. Since the women interviewed for this project do not identify as such, not seeing their activities as in any way related to waged employment and not seeking any kind of rights as workers, this term will be discarded entirely for these purposes.</p>
