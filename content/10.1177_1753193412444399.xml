<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to assess whether there is a universal pattern of movement of the finger joints while performing a cylinder grip. A sensor glove was used to record the finger joint motion of 48 participants. Our observations showed that when examining the fingers, flexion motion began either at the metacarpophalangeal (MP) or proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, with the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints always last to move (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0052). The sequence of the joints at the end of the gripping motion was different than at the beginning. Here, the only statistically significant observation was that the DIP joints fully flexed only once the MP joints had flexed fully. Apart from that, it was completely variable which joint reached its final position first or last. The analysis also revealed that synchronization of four identical joints (i.e. the four PIP joints) was significantly higher than synchronization of the 12 finger joints. Although synchronization was already high at the beginning of the flexion motion, it increased significantly by the time the joints completed their movement.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mobility of the individual finger joints of the hand is a basic prerequisite for the ability to grip. The degree of movement required at each joint is determined predominantly by the characteristics of the object being gripped. Earlier research has shown that when gripping a cylindrical object the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints contribute a greater range of motion than the metacarpophalangeal (MP) or distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412444399">Gulke et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Because gripping is a dynamic process, it cannot be adequately defined just by observing the ranges of motion. A significant part of the dynamic characteristic of the gripping motion is the coordinated timing of the joints relative to one another. Little research has dealt with this to date. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412444399">Holguin et al. (1999)</xref> used a visual measuring instrument to examine finger motion whilst making a fist. Their results showed that motion typically begins in the PIP joints, followed by the DIP joints. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412444399">Braido and Zhang (2004)</xref> also used a visual measuring instrument to examine the pattern of motion when gripping a cylinder. They found that in 89% of cases motion began in the MP joints followed by the PIP joints. Neither study determined the relative timing of the motion between the joints. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412444399">Braido and Zhang (2004)</xref> documented a high degree of synchronization in joints of the same type across the four fingers. The specific timing or degree of synchronization of the movement was not disclosed.</p>
<p>The objective of this study was to assess the coordination of joint movement whilst gripping cylinders of different sizes. The following hypotheses were tested: (1) the three joints in a finger or two joints in the thumb flex in a specific order and (2) the 12 finger joints interact in a close timely fashion during the grip and there is an even higher degree of synchronization among the sets of four identical joints (e.g., the four PIP joints).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1753193412444399">
<title>Sensor glove</title>
<p>The Technische Universität Berlin (TUB) sensor glove is equipped with 14 joint angle sensors (JAS) on the extensor side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412444399">Figure 1</xref>). It is a right-hand glove and its flexible structure allows adjustment to hand size. The JAS work as non-contact distance recorders and are therefore not susceptible to wear. The motion sequence of the MP and IP joints of the fingers and thumb were recorded.</p>

<sec id="section4-1753193412444399">
<title>Cylinders</title>
<p>Five cylinder grips were analyzed using cylindrical objects of various diameters: G1 – 12 cm, G2 – 9 cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412444399">Figure 1</xref>), G3 – 7 cm, G4 – 5.5 cm, and G5 – 4 cm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1753193412444399">
<title>Testing protocol</title>
<p>Informed consent was obtained prior to testing. We calibrated the glove for each participant, which took about 3 min. The correct position of the glove and sensors were checked before every measurement. Measurements were taken from the right hand of all participants in a standardized sitting position, with the elbow flexed at 90° and the hand lying flat, palm down on the table, at the beginning of each study.</p>
<p>Each measurement lasted 20 s, during which the cylinder grip was performed three times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412444399">Figure 2</xref>), and mean values were calculated. The relationships between the finger joints were analyzed at the point when their active movement began (t<sub>C</sub>), and ended (t<sub>D</sub>); i.e., as they came to rest in their final position on the cylinder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412444399">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Each participant’s right hand size was measured: hand length (wrist flexion crease to the tip of the middle finger); hand span (greatest distance between the tip of the thumb and tip of the small finger, with the digits fully abducted); length of the middle finger (MP joint flexion crease to tip of the finger); circumference of the metacarpus (measured at the height of the index to little finger metacarpal heads).</p>

<title>Measurement criteria</title>
<p><italic>Digit assessment:</italic> During the digit assessment, we analyzed the sequence of flexion of the three joints in each finger as well as the sequence of the two joints in the thumb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193412444399">Figure 3</xref>). Our focus was on the two most significant points in time during the grip: the beginning of the flexion motion of the joints (t<sub>C</sub>) and the completion of the flexion motion (t<sub>D</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412444399">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, we evaluated the motion of the joints at these two points in time and recorded the sequence of the joints and corresponding time differences.</p>

</fig>
<p><italic>Hand assessment:</italic> During the hand assessment we determined the degree of synchronization of all finger joints in the hand. Therefore, we measured the time gap of the first and last joint to initiate and complete motion. First we analyzed the degree of synchronization within joints of the same type, namely the four MP, PIP, and DIP joints in the hand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753193412444399">Figure 4</xref>). Using the example of the MP joints, at point in time t<sub>C</sub> we determined when the first and last of the four MP joints began motion. The time difference between these two starting points was then calculated. The same procedure was done at point in time t<sub>D</sub> to determine the time gap between the first and last MP joint completing flexion. Similar measurements were then taken for the four PIP and DIP joints.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1753193412444399-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Because we intended to compare the degree of synchronization of the MP/PIP/DIP joints with the overall synchronization of all finger joints, we also took these measurements for the 12 finger joints and two thumb joints.</p>

<sec id="section7-1753193412444399">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p>All data were analyzed descriptively. We present means and standard deviations of calculated time differences. In addition, a generalized regression model was used to analyze the dependency of each digit and hand assessment from other variables. Such a model accounts for the dependency structure in the data, which is important for an appropriate analysis beyond a simple description of the data.</p>
<p>We examined the influence of the sizes of the cylinders, fingers, and joints as independent variables for the digit assessment models. We also investigated the influence of the points in time (t<sub>C</sub> and t<sub>D</sub>) in the hand assessment. The level of significance was <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Forty-eight healthy subjects, 11 women and 37 men, with an average age of 34 (range 21–73) years participated in this study. The participants had no right-hand problems. Thirty-eight of them were right-hand dominant and 10 were left-hand dominant. Average hand measurements were as follows: hand length 18.9 (18–20) cm; hand span 21.8 (20–24.5) cm; length of middle finger 8.4 (7.5–9) cm; and circumference of metacarpus 21.3 (19.5–22.5) cm.</p>

<p><italic>End of motion (t<sub>D</sub>):</italic> The sequence of the joints completing flexion (t<sub>D</sub>) was more variable than at the beginning of motion (t<sub>C</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1753193412444399">Figure 6</xref>). The only significant observation was that the DIP joints finished flexion after the MP joints. Mean time gap was 0.186 s (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0092) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1753193412444399">Figure 6</xref>). On average the PIP joints finished 0.084 s after the MP joints and 0.102 s prior to the DIP joints. These time gaps did not show any significance, and therefore the joint order must be considered variable. The same variability was seen in the thumb. Here, the MP joints finished on average 0.33 s prior to the IP joints. However, the large standard deviation and a <italic>p</italic> value of 0.0904 meant this was not significant. The sizes of the cylinders did not significantly influence the sequence of joint motion at the start (t<sub>C</sub>) or finish (t<sub>D</sub>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Analyzing the gripping pattern of the cylinder grip in healthy subjects revealed various characteristics of the physiological motion pattern. This pattern consists of the range of motion (ROM) of the single joints and their coordination. Our results regarding ROM of the finger joints and modulation when gripping objects of different sizes have already been presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412444399">Gülke et al., 2010</xref>). While in clinical practice one continues to focus on ROM, this study analyzed the interdependence of this movement.</p>
<p>The coordination patterns of the finger joints have been analyzed by several study groups. Their results were somewhat controversial. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412444399">Arbuckle and McGrouther (1995)</xref> analyzed motion patterns of the joints of the index finger whilst making a fist. At the beginning of motion, the MP joint initiated flexion, followed by the PIP and DIP joints. At the end of motion, the sequence was as follows: PIP prior to DIP, prior to the MP joint.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412444399">Holguin et al. (1999)</xref> also analyzed the flexion pattern of the index finger whilst making a fist. Likewise, their results showed initiation of movement of the PIP prior to the DIP joint. They did not consider the MP joint. At the end of motion, they saw a different sequence compared with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412444399">Arbuckle and McGrouther (1995)</xref>: DIP finished prior to the PIP joint.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412444399">Nakamura et al. (1998)</xref> confirmed this finding in their study, which investigated motion of the thumb and index finger during precision grip. At the beginning of motion, they saw a sequence starting from the proximal to distal joints. At the end of motion, the sequence started from distal to proximal.</p>
<p>All of the mentioned studies analyzed a single finger. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412444399">Braido and Zhang (2004)</xref> considered all fingers in their work. Similar to our study, they analyzed the motion sequence of the joints whilst gripping a cylindrical object, but used a visual measuring device. They only took note of the sequence and did not mention time differences between the joints. They also did not differentiate between beginning and end of motion. In 89% of cases, the following sequence was found: MP prior to PIP, prior to DIP joints. The remaining 11% showed the PIP prior to MP prior to DIP joints. These results coincide with our findings to a large extent.</p>
<p>As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412444399">Braido and Zhang’s study (2004)</xref>, we were able to see a degree of variability as to the sequence of MP and PIP joints, with the PIP joints initiating motion only 0.08 s prior to MP joints; this finding was not significant. The DIP joints, however, started flexion last, showing a significant delay of 0.2 s and 0.28 s compared with the MP and PIP joints, respectively. In the thumb, motion started at the MP joint. The IP joint followed with a significant delay of 0.16 s.</p>
<p>At the end of motion, unlike at the beginning, we could not find a specific sequence pattern of the joints in a finger. Here, the only significant result was that the DIP joints followed the MP joints when completing the motion. In the thumb, the order of the MP joint completing motion prior to the IP joint was merely a trend, and did not show significance.</p>
<p>We also analyzed the degree of synchronization of the joints across the fingers in our hand assessment. No comparable studies dealing with this matter were found.</p>
<p>We were able to show that synchronization of four joints of the same type is significantly higher than synchronization of all finger joints. Looking at the MP joints at the beginning of motion (t<sub>C</sub>), the delay between the first and last MP joint initiating flexion was 0.52 s. The gap between the first and last of all 14 joints was 0.99 s and, therefore, twice as high as MP joints. However, a significant difference between all 14 joints and 12 finger joints was not shown, which indicates that the thumb’s motion blends in very well.</p>
<p>Another interesting finding was that the degree of synchronization of the finger joints was significantly higher at the end of motion compared with the beginning. This is true not only for joints of the same type (MP, PIP, and DIP), but also when taking all 14 joints into account. As an example, the time gap for the PIP joints was 0.5 s at the beginning and 0.22 s at the end of motion.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have shown that the dynamic interaction of the finger joints does show certain characteristics and patterns. Future research should be focused on how these patterns change when examining patients who suffer from certain conditions, such as peripheral nerve damage or rheumatoid arthritis. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412444399">Dias et al. (2012)</xref> have shown in this field, the motion of the hand should be examined in the context of grip strength. Apart from that, our findings might serve as raw data for improved myoelectric hand prostheses in the future.</p>
