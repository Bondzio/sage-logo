<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Patients with severe limb ischemia (SLI) secondary to a long occlusion of the superficial femoral (SFA) and/or popliteal arteries (femoropopliteal segment) rely on the patency of the profunda femoris artery (PFA) for collateral arterial supply to the lower limb. Should the disease burden extend into the PFA such that a concurrent critical stenosis or occlusion occurs, the limb viability may become threatened.</p>
<p>Atherosclerotic involvement of the PFA preferentially affects the segment proximal to the first perforating thigh branch and very rarely extends into said branches themselves.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574413491636">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574413491636">2</xref>
</sup> This pattern of disease allows for a localized treatment option in the majority of the cases. Martin reported the first surgical profundaplasty in 1972; since then isolated profundaplasty has been a recognized treatment option for patients with concomitant PFA and femoropopliteal occlusive disease causing critical limb ischemia (CLI).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574413491636">2</xref>
</sup> Contemporary series reports varied results, with 3-year clinical success rates ranging between 49% and 80%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574413491636">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574413491636">4</xref>
</sup> Profundaplasty may also be employed as an adjunct to aortoiliac revascularization when the outflow via the SFA is compromised.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574413491636">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Endovascular therapy has gained widespread acceptance as the first-line treatment option for patients with SLI secondary to aortoiliac and/or femoropopliteal occlusive disease. Those patients with significant comorbidities who have traditionally undergone isolated surgical profundaplasty without bypass reconstruction of the femoropopliteal segment may now be suitable for endovascular reconstruction of both the PFA (ePFR) and femoropopliteal (eFPR) segments. However, in patients with heavily calcified arteries or long-flush occlusions of the femoropoliteal segment, endovascular reconstruction may be unsuccessful. It is this subgroup of patients for whom isolated profundaplasty may still have a therapeutic role.</p>
<p>The efficacy of isolated ePFR remains controversial with few studies reported in the English literature.<sup>

</sup> The aim of this study was to report the contemporary results of isolated ePFR and ePFR + eFPR for SLI performed in a single United Kingdom tertiary referral center, with particular emphasis on limb salvage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1538574413491636" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Between January 2006 and December 2011, a retrospective review of consecutive patients with PFA and femoropopliteal vaso-occulsive disease who underwent ePFR or ePFR + eFPR for SLI (Fontaine classifications 2b, 3, and 4), at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, was performed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574413491636">5</xref>
</sup> Patients were identified through vascular registries, individual and hospital operative logbooks, and radiological records. Isolated ePFR is defined as ePFR without SFA or popliteal reconstruction.</p>
<sec id="section3-1538574413491636">
<title>Classification of Vessel Disease</title>
<p>The PFA disease burden is described in terms of the severity of obstruction (significant stenosis [vessel stenosis ≥50%] vs occlusion) and location of the disease (involves the common femoral artery [CFA] with bifurcation [within 1 cm of bifurcation] vs that which does not involve bifurcation). Concurrent aortoiliac arterial and/or femoropopliteal arterial segment disease is classified into Trans-Atlantic Inter-Societal Consensus II (TASC-II) based upon the angiographic findings.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574413491636">5</xref>
</sup> A patent crural vessel is defined as a continuous anterior tibial, posterior tibial, or peroneal artery from vessel origin to the ankle without significant stenosis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1538574413491636">
<title>Endovascular Procedure</title>
<p>All procedures were performed in a dedicated angiography suite by an interventional radiologist under local anesthesia. All patients were pretreated with an antiplatelet drug and a 5-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor unless specifically contraindicated. Unfractionated heparin, 3000 to 5000 IU, was used during the procedure.</p>
<p>Access to the PFA and/or femoropopliteal lesion was at the operator’s discretion, who took into account the pre- and intraoperative imaging. In general, patients with PFA disease having concomitant proximal (inflow) arterial disease underwent an over-the-aortic bifurcation approach through a retrograde contralateral groin puncture. Patients with patent aortoiliac and CFA segments underwent antegrade ipsilateral groin puncture.</p>
<p>Digital subtraction angiography was used to assess the ipsilateral lower limb arterial tree. A significant vessel stenosis was defined as radiographic evidence of ≥50% reduction in vessel lumen diameter. The PFA lesions were traversed using a hydrophilic 0.035-in wire in either a standard or a stiff format and treated using standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). The angioplasty balloon size was at the individual operator’s discretion and the pre- and periprocedure vessel measurements were also taken into account. Suboptimal angiographic results, defined as a ≥30% residual stenosis, underwent repeated prolonged (≥ 1 minute) PTA. Technical success was defined as a final vessel stenosis &lt;30%. Femoropopliteal lesions were treated concurrently at the discretion of the primary operator using either an intraluminal or a subintimal revascularization technique.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1538574413491636">
<title>Follow-Up</title>
<p>Early (within 30 days of the index procedure) outcomes including technical success (defined as a residual stenosis &lt;30%), reintervention, major morbidity, and mortality were analyzed; and late (greater than 30 days of the index procedure) outcomes including reintervention, amputation, and mortality were assessed. The primary end point was patient survival free from amputation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1538574413491636">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Differences between patient characteristics were assessed using Fisher exact test for categorical variables and 2-sample <italic>t</italic> test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. Patient survival, reintervention, amputation, and patient survival free from reintervention and amputation rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method on an “intention-to-treat” basis. Comparison was made using log-rank tests. Data are presented as median (interquartile range [IQR]) unless stated otherwise. A probability value of &lt;.05 was considered statistically significant. All the analyses were carried out using StatsDirect version 2.7.2 (StatsDirect Ltd, Cheshire, United Kingdom).</p>

<title>Patient Population</title>
<p>A total of 42 patients (34 male; median age 72, range 49-95 years) underwent 44 attempted ePFRs during the study period (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538574413491636">Table 1</xref>). In all, 42 (95%) PFAs were stenosed and 2 (5%) were occluded. In all, 39 (89%) PFA had disease affecting the CFA bifurcation. The Fontaine classification was Fontaine 4 (n = 11), Fontaine 3 (n = 21), and Fontaine 2b (n = 12). Preoperative comorbidities and anatomical/clinical severity of the disease did not differ between ePFR and ePFR + eFPR (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1538574413491636">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Isolated ePFR</title>
<p>A total of 18 attempted ePFRs were performed in 18 patients (16 male; median age 73, range 54-84 years; Fontaine classification: 4 [n = 5], 3 [n = 9], and 2b [n = 4]; femoropopliteal TASC classification: A [n = 2], B [n = 0], C [n = 3], and D [n = 13]). In all, 17 (94%) ePFRs were technically successful and 1 (6%) was unsuccessful secondary to target vessel perforation. Seventeen stenosed vessels were treated by intraluminal angioplasty and 1 occluded PFA was recanalized in the subintimal plane (median [range] balloon diameter was 6 [4-9] mm, median [range] balloon length 40 [40-40] mm). One groin hematoma occurred and was successfully treated with pressure management. Isolated ePFR was combined with percutaneous CFA revascularization in 10 (56%) patients and aortoiliac revascularization in 8 (44%) patients. Median (range) number of patent crural vessels was 2.5 (0-3).</p>
<p>The overall early rentervention rate was 6%. The patient in whom ePFR was unsuccessful underwent a below-knee amputation within 30 days of the index procedure. There was no mortality within 30 days of the index procedure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1538574413491636">
<title>The ePFR and eFPR</title>
<p>A total of 26 attempted ePFRs combined with eFPRs were performed in 25 patients (18 male, median age 73, range 49-95, Fontaine classification: 4 [n = 6], 3 [n = 12], 2b [n = 8], Femoropopliteal TASC classification: A [n = 0], B [n = 6], C [n = 8], D [n = 12]). All ePFRs were technically successful; 24 stenosed PFAs were treated by intraluminal angioplasty, 1 occluded PFA was recanalized intraluminally, and 1 occluded PFA was recanalized in the subintimal plane (median [range] balloon diameter was 5 [4-8] mm, median [range] balloon length 40 [40-60] mm). The ePFR was combined with percutaneous CFA revascularization in 10 (40%) patients and with aortoiliac revascularization in 8 (32%) patients. In all, 22 (85%) eFPRs were successful, and 4 (15%) eFPRs failed due to heavy calcification, preventing the passage of the guidewire in either the intraluminal or the subintimal plane. Of the eFPRs, 2 (8%) resulted in distal embolization of the peroneal artery; 1 was successfully treated by percutaneous thromboembolectomy and 1 resulted in occlusion of the peroneal artery while maintaining anterior tibial artery patency.</p>
<p>Early reintervention rate was 4%; 1 patient underwent femoral-distal bypass within 30 days of the index procedure. There was no mortality or amputation within 30 days of the index procedure.</p>

<title>Late Outcomes</title>
<p>Median (IQR) follow-up for isolated ePFR and ePFR + eFPR was 26 (21-43) and 41.5 (19-52) months, respectively. Two patients who underwent isolated ePFR required a total of 2 endovascular reinterventions secondary to PFA and CFA restenoses at 36 and 8 months postprocedure, respectively. Five patients who underwent ePFR + eFPR required a total of 6 reinterventions (surgical [n = 3], endovascular [n = 2], and hybrid [n = 1]) secondary to femoropopliteal reocclusion (n = 3), PFA restenosis (n = 1), and CFA restenosis (n = 1); median (range) time to first reintervention was 9 (4-65) months. A total of 12 (29%) patients died and 3 major limb amputations were performed during a median (range) follow-up of 33 (5-101) months.</p>
<p>The 6- and 12-month freedom from reintervention rates following isolated ePFR and ePFR + eFPR were 94% and 88% and 92% and 85%, respectively (standard error &lt;0.1). The 6- and 12-month freedom from amputation rates following isolated ePFR and ePFR + eFPR were 83% and 78% and 100% and 96%, respectively (standard error &lt;0.1).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, the current study represents the only series comparing percutaneous angioplasty of the profunda femoris artery with or without concurrent femoropopliteal revascularization in patients with SLI. The principal findings of the current study were that ePFR was associated with (1) good technical success rates, (2) acceptable perioperative morbidity and mortality, and (3) good short-term limb salvage rates when used in isolation or concomitantly with eFPR. These findings are consistent with those in 4 contemporary series from North America and Western Europe, with a total of 121 patients (123 limbs) reporting a technical success rate of 93% (114 of 123 limbs) and an amputation rate at 1 year ranging from 3.6% to 36%.<sup>

<p>Open surgical profundaplasty has long been recognized as a method of limb salvage in patients with CLI secondary to severe femoral and popliteal artery occlusive disease and who are deemed unsuitable for a femoral-distal bypass due to extensive comorbidities or lower limb integmenta necrosis/infection. Rollins et al and Savolainen et al report the two largest case series in the English literature.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574413491636">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574413491636">14</xref>
</sup> Rollins et al reported the results of 51 isolated surgical profundaplasties performed for limb salvage secondary to CLI (Fontaine 3 and 4); 10% of the limbs required an amputation within 30 days of the index procedure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574413491636">14</xref>
</sup> However, this series predates the widespread use of saphenous vein bypass for arterial occlusive disease. Savolainen et al reported comparable results from a contemporary series, with 15% of the limbs requiring amputation following surgical profundaplasty for CLI.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574413491636">4</xref>
</sup> These impressive early results may be partially offset by perioperative wound infection rates of up to 14% and varied medium-term results with the larger case series reporting cumulative 3-limb salvage rates ranging from 49% to 83%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574413491636">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574413491636">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574413491636">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574413491636"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538574413491636">16</xref>
</sup> Some authors believe the medium-term outcomes to be extraneous, viewing profundaplasty as a stabilizing technique that allows time for both patient physiology and lower limb integmentum optimization prior to bypass surgery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574413491636">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>More recently, ePFR has been advocated as an alternative to surgical profundaplasty and may be associated with a reduction in perioperative complications. The largest study to date by Dick et al reports perioperative complications occurring in 1.8% of the patients with no cases of wound infection, seroma formation, or early mortality following 55 ePFRs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574413491636">12</xref>
</sup> Diehm et al compared ePFR and surgical profundaplasty and reported no perioperative complications or mortality in the ePFR cohort, whereas the surgical profundaplasty cohort demonstrated an in-hospital mortality of 29%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574413491636">13</xref>
</sup> This study was limited by the small number (n = 20) of patients. The current study reports minor perioperative complications in the form of groin hematoma, occurring in 4.5% of the ePFRs but no wound infections or early mortality and therefore lends support to the proposal that ePFR is associated with fewer perioperative complications.</p>
<p>The advent of new endovascular techniques and technologies has greatly expanded the range of lower limb vaso-occlusive disease amenable to an entirely endovascular solution; the TASC IIB guidelines are expected to recommend endovascular revascularization as the preferred first-line treatment strategy for TASC C and D lesions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538574413491636">18</xref>
</sup> Our institution first described subintimal femoropopliteal recanalization in 1987 and subsequently reported a technical success and 3-year patency rate of 80% and 60%, respectively, in 200 consecutive femoropopliteal artery occlusions with a mean length of 11 cm.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538574413491636">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538574413491636">20</xref>
</sup> Contemporary studies by both Florenes et al in Oslo and Sultan et al in Ireland report patency rates of 60% at 5 years.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538574413491636">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1538574413491636">22</xref>
</sup> In view of these excellent results, many clinicians question the role of isolated ePFR stating that in all cases it should be combined with attempted eFPR in order to maximize the chance of limb salvage. However, the current study appears to refute this notion and reports comparable early limb salvage rates following isolated ePFR or ePFR + eFPR in patients with CLI.</p>
<p>The authors recognize that there are inherent weaknesses to the current study, which include the relatively small number of patients and the heterogeneity of such a study population. The treatment of the femoropopliteal segment being at the discretion of the primary operator potentially inflicts substantial selection bias. In general, we advocate attempting eFPR in combination with ePFR whenever possible, citing the excellent medium-term patency rates achieved with endovascular femoropopliteal recanalization. However, as we have shown in this study, with a 15% failure rate for eFPR, there remains a role for ePFR, particularly as a stabilizing technique in the significantly compromised limb or patient.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these contemporary data suggest isolated ePFR and ePFR + eFPR are associated with good and comparable early limb salvage rates when used to treat CLI in patients with an anatomical distribution of disease that includes femoropopliteal occlusion. Further, larger studies are required to assess the medium-term benefits of concurrent eFPR.</p>
