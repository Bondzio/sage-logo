<p>The articles in <italic>Nutrition in Clinical Practice</italic> (<italic>NCP</italic>) typically focus on clinical topics. This issue deviates from that tradition slightly by highlighting 5 articles on research and publishing. The special topics in this issue include reviewing published research, conducting literature searches, understanding the role of an institutional review board (IRB), comprehending basic statistics, and learning how to write and publish an article.</p>
<p>Clinicians must learn to critically evaluate published literature to discern the quality of research studies. In the first article in this issue, Dr Lipman gives personal insight into how to read and evaluate research literature. The article defines the parts of a research study and explains the types of study designs. Dr Lipman summarizes the important characteristics of randomized controlled trials with regard to randomization, study size, allocation concealment, blinding, and analysis of data. The article includes a helpful checklist that readers can use as an aid in reviewing scientific studies. Be sure to also listen to an interview between Dr Lipman and <italic>NCP</italic> Associate Editor Beth Krzywda on this topic in a featured podcast available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ncp.sagepub.com">ncp.sagepub.com</ext-link>.</p>
<p>A basic requirement for research is a literature search. PubMed is a database containing references to thousands of journals and millions of articles in the biomedical and life science domain. Online access to PubMed is free, and users can set up accounts to aid in searching literature; the searches can be saved and automatically updated. Dr Lindsey describes how to set up an account in PubMed and explains how to conduct a focused literature search in his article. He provides details on narrowing searches by using terms and filters. The article includes screenshots from PubMed to help illustrate how to use this powerful tool.</p>
<p>Dr Tremaine’s article intends to introduce the reader to the background and purpose of an IRB and its role in overseeing human studies. The author explains the regulatory guidelines for conducting research that were based on principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. The author defines these principles and explains how IRBs uphold them and support ethical practices in research. The article includes 3 helpful tables outlining categories of IRB review, basic elements of an informed consent document, and IRB membership requirements.</p>
<p>The concept of biostatistics can be overwhelming to clinicians. However, to critically review literature, it is important to have a basic understanding of statistics. The intent of the article on statistics by Saracino and colleagues is to help nutrition professionals understand fundamental concepts of statistics and how to choose appropriate statistical tests to analyze research data. The article summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of different study designs. The authors describe and give examples of statistical tests commonly used in nutrition research. The tables are especially helpful in summarizing study designs and inferential statistical tests.</p>
<p>My commentary in this issue addresses how to develop writing skills. Successful publishing requires planning, writing, submitting, revising, resubmitting, and proofing. My article is intended to be a how-to article for new and aspiring authors to understand the step-by-step process of planning and writing an article for a journal with an emphasis on what the author can do to increase chances of publication.</p>
<p>In addition to these articles on research and publishing, multiple articles cover clinical topics in this issue. We hope that you find this special issue helpful in broadening your knowledge of research and publishing.</p>
