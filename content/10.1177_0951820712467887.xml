<fn fn-type="other" id="author-notes1-0951820712467887"><label>*</label><p>An early version of this study entitled ‘Secrets, Due, Dates, and Contractions: The Motif of Childbearing in <italic>4 Ezra</italic>’ was presented at the Early Jewish and Christian Mysticism Group of the Society of Biblical Literature, SBL Annual Meeting in November 2004. I appreciate the helpful comments of members of that group, as well as Elliott Wolfson, Mary Rose D'Angelo, Hindy Najman, and Greg Sterling. To my knowledge, that paper was the first to study childbearing as a literary motif in <italic>4 Ezra</italic>. A feminist analysis of childbearing in <italic>4 Ezra</italic> was previously offered in Luzia Sutter-Rehman, <italic>Geh, Frage die Gebärerin. Feministisch-Befreiungstheologische Untersucheungen zum Geraermtoiv in der Apokalyptik</italic> (Gütersloh: Gütersloher Verlaghaus, 1995). As I was making finals edits to the present version of this study an article exploring many of the same aspects of <italic>4 Ezra</italic> was published, Karina M. Hogan, ‘Mother Earth as a Conceptual Metaphor in <italic>4 Ezra’, CBQ</italic> 73 (2011), pp. 72–91. While Hogan's article focuses on mother Earth, like my study it connects this metaphor with the frequent imagery of human and agricultural fertility in <italic>4 Ezra</italic>. However, it does not explore the narrative function of this imagery as a literary motif, nor the effect the motif has in directing the attention of the audience to how the woman's speech produces Ezra's true lament in his second response to her in vision four. I presented a shorter version of this study at The Sixth Enoch Seminar, Gazzada, Italy, in June 2011.</p></fn>

<abstract>
<p>This article argues that the imagery of childbearing serves as a narrative motif in <italic>4 Ezra</italic>. Language of fertility and birth appears regularly in Ezra's theodicy and his quest for knowledge. The angel uses childbearing metaphors to instruct Ezra about the coming transition of the ages: the signs of the end of the old age are dysfunctional birth and labor pains, while the fruitful new age will give birth according to a predetermined schedule. These numerous references to fecundity convey the theme of Ezra's movement toward understanding, leading him toward the pivotal moment when an actual childbearing woman appears before him. By joining in her lament for a precious son, Ezra shares the divine perspective of love, proving himself worthy of receiving esoteric wisdom.</p>

<body>
<p>The book of <italic>4 Ezra</italic> presents a series of seven visions experienced by the title character. In the first three, Ezra, from his home in exile, directs pointed questions of theodicy to the Most High (3.1–9.25). These queries engender responses from an angel, Uriel, who engages in a series of lively debates with Ezra. In the fourth vision, Ezra journeys from his home out into a field of flowers, where he converses with a mourning woman (9.26–10.59). At the end of their exchange, the woman transforms into a glorious city before Ezra's eyes, a vision interpreted by the angel. This vision and Ezra's response to it mark the end of the debates, for Ezra is now ready to receive visionary dreams about the future, along with their interpretations, directly from God. The book concludes with the republication of twenty-four books of scripture that were previously destroyed, and the writing of seventy secret books to be preserved privately.</p>
<p>This synopsis of the story of <italic>4 Ezra</italic> assumes its narrative unity, an assumption that is relatively new. Many modern interpreters of <italic>4 Ezra</italic>, viewing the book as a loosely edited collection of older material, have paid scant attention to its narrative dynamics. More recently, however, the consensus has shifted toward understanding <italic>4 Ezra</italic> as a coherent whole.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0951820712467887">1</xref></sup> This change in perspective has opened the way for scholars to consider how narrative elements—such as characterization, plot, structure, and literary artistry—shape meaning in <italic>4 Ezra</italic>. The present study contributes to this pursuit by exploring the numerous references to childbearing and fertility in <italic>4 Ezra</italic>, arguing that such imagery is not incidental but comprises a literary motif that plays an important role in the narrative's plot and structure. A close reading of the motif in the narrative's first three visions shows that it serves as a key argumentative figure in the speeches of both Ezra and the angel: Ezra uses it to complain about his lack of understanding, while the angel incorporates it into his responses about eschatological timing, signs of the end of the age, and God's deep love for Israel. The motif also appears in four distinctive exhortations, in which Uriel instructs Ezra to direct his questions to childbearing women. These exhortations foreshadow the appearance in the narrative of an actual childbearing woman: a character who has birthed and lost a child. The repeated imagery of birth and fertility direct the attention of Ezra (and the audience) toward this woman's didactic speech. This study argues that the voice of the childbearing woman plays a pivotal role in Ezra's development by facilitating his transformation from a person who raises intellectual questions to one who laments the loss of a beloved son. This transformation in turn prepares the seer to receive God's secret knowledge, conveyed in the narrative's remaining three visions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0951820712467887">2</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section1-0951820712467887">
<title>The Childbearing Motif</title>
<p>A literary motif may appear across a number of texts or in a single piece of literature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0951820712467887">3</xref></sup> The latter type of literary motif, the subject of this study, is characterized by its reoccurrence, cumulative effect, and symbolic function.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0951820712467887">4</xref></sup> The motif must occur often enough to constitute an associational cluster, and it must be avoidable, that is, relatively unlikely in a particular narrative. A motif's efficacy relies on these two factors, along with three others: the significance of the literary contexts in which it appears, the extent to which various occurrences work together to produce a unified effect on the audience, and the suitability of the motif to what it symbolizes. Overall, a motif ‘represents on the verbal level something characteristic of the structure of the work, the events, the characters, the emotional effects or the moral or cognitive content’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0951820712467887">5</xref></sup> In <italic>4 Ezra</italic>, childbearing and associated images of fecundity demonstrate these five characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0951820712467887">6</xref></sup> Not only does this imagery appear frequently in significant contexts, but it also plays important rhetorical roles within the dialogues and in the pivotal fourth vision, as summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0951820712467887">Table 1</xref> below and detailed in the remainder of this study. While it is true that childbearing suits the apocalyptic focus of <italic>4 Ezra</italic>, its presence is by no means demanded by this context.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0951820712467887">7</xref></sup> The motif is thus avoidable. In addition, the metaphor of childbearing is well suited to the symbolic purpose of the motif: it highlights the hope of renewal in the age to come while also taking seriously the present, severe suffering of the people of God. Ultimately the various manifestations of the childbearing motif work together to mark the course of Ezra's development in the narrative, leading toward a pivotal moment of transformation in the fourth vision.</p>

<title>Vision One (3.1–5.20)</title>
<p>In their first two debates, both Uriel and Ezra use the language of fecundity as a central figure. Ezra associates it with evil in the human heart (3.7–26; 4.6) and his pressing need to understand (4.12). Uriel uses this imagery to describe the travail of the present age, both in its laboring to give birth (4.26–50) and in dysfunctional fertility as a sign that this event is soon to take place (5.1–13). Thus, the fertility imagery of the first vision is mixed: the current age is fertile with evil but it also hastens to give birth to a new age of hope.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0951820712467887">
<title>Debate about Ezra's Understanding (3.1–4.21)</title>
<p>In the first debate, Ezra raises questions of theodicy by arguing that through the process of human birth, the evil heart has passed from Adam to all who live, including God's people (3.7, 11–12, 15, 26).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0951820712467887">8</xref></sup> Human childbearing breeds spiritual infertility for all humanity. Thus, despite God's love for Abraham and God's activity in sowing the law into the hearts of people, the law is barren (3.20–27).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0951820712467887">9</xref></sup> It makes no sense to Ezra that God has singled out the chosen people for punishment: since all humanity is corrupt, all immoral nations ought to experience punishment for their barrenness (3.28–36).</p>
<p>Uriel responds by presenting Ezra with riddles about features of the earth (fire, wind, and day), and Ezra's response continues to use childbearing imagery: ‘Who of those that have been born (<italic>nascor</italic>) can do this’ (4.6)?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0951820712467887">10</xref></sup> By returning to the subject of human birth, Ezra walks into the angel's rhetorical trap, for the riddles ask precisely about earthly features. If Ezra fails to understand his own home, he cannot hope to understand the way of God, about which he has asked (4.10). Here, the angel establishes a shortcoming in the seer's development: something about Ezra's understanding of life on earth must be set straight before he can receive the heavenly secrets of God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0951820712467887">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although this angelic argument deeply affects Ezra, who falls on his face, it does not persuade him: from a prostrate position, Ezra continues to voice dissatisfaction, again with reference to human birth: ‘It would be better for us not to be (<italic>adsum</italic>) here, than to come here and live in ungodliness, and to suffer and not understand why’ (4.12). While the childbearing motif is only implied here in Latin, it is explicit in the Ethiopic and Armenian versions, which read ‘be born’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0951820712467887">12</xref></sup> When the angel asserts again that Ezra can only understand what is upon the earth (4.13–21), Ezra insists that he did not intend to ask about heavenly things but about human matters (4.22–25). Although the way Ezra frames this response suggests that he is simply repeating the questions he has asked previously, in fact, his approach has changed somewhat. Whereas at the beginning of the dialogue he has inquired about divine justice in a broad sense, comparing Israel to other nations, he now asks more specific questions, namely, why God's beloved people have been punished and why the written covenants have been destroyed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0951820712467887">
<title>Divine timing (4.26–50)</title>
<p>Ezra's reframed questions move the dialogue into a new section centered on the timing of the end of the age, which Uriel asserts is ‘hurrying (<italic>festino</italic>) swiftly to its end’ (4.26). In this section, two types of childbearing language—agricultural fertility and human labor—overlap.</p>
<p>Returning to the subject of human evil, the angel agrees with Ezra that the present age is thoroughly sown with evil, which has taken root in the human heart (4.28, 30). However, his use of fertility imagery inverts Ezra's previous assertion about barrenness (3.20–27): the evil seed sown in the human heart is not infertile, as Ezra has claimed, but has rather produced a great crop of abundant, malignant fruit (ungodliness) that must be harvested in order to clear the way for a good crop (4.28–32). The problem is not barrenness but malignant fecundity: the present age ‘will not be able to bring the things that have been promised to the righteous in their appointed times, because this age is full of sadness and infirmities’ (4.27).</p>
<p>Language of human fertility follows. To illustrate that God has already established the timing of this future harvest (4.33–37), the angel offers a word picture of a pregnant woman nearing the end of her term (4.40). Just as she ‘makes haste (<italic>festino</italic>) to escape (<italic>effugio</italic>) the pangs of birth’, so also do the chambers of the souls in Hades ‘hasten (<italic>festino</italic>) to give back (<italic>reddo</italic>) those things that were committed to them from the beginning’ (4.42). While <italic>festino</italic> normally means to rush or hurry, by associating it with birth pains, the angel imbues the word with a dual sense of urgency and fixity. Birth pains arrive according to a pre-determined schedule, steadily advance, and can be neither rushed nor delayed. Yet once labor begins, it moves with intense, unstoppable forcefulness toward the goal of birth. In this context, a translation of <italic>effugio</italic> as ‘pass through’ rather than ‘escape’ would be best, for the metaphorical woman does not hasten to escape birth pangs but rather to pass through them in anticipation of the birth of the child. So too the womb-like chambers of Hades hasten to yield up souls on schedule.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0951820712467887">13</xref></sup> The childbirth metaphor thus emphasizes the predetermined nature of the timing of the end of the age: it will arrive on schedule.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0951820712467887">14</xref></sup> This metaphorical connection between the chambers of Hades deep in the earth and the womb of a woman implies the figure of mother earth, foreshadowing her appearance later in the narrative.</p>
<p>If one keeps this pregnancy metaphor in mind, it is useful to look again at the section immediately preceding it, in which the angel describes the age as hastening (<italic>festino</italic>) to pass through (<italic>pertranseo</italic>) (4.26) and as not able to ‘bring (<italic>porto</italic>) the things that have been promised to the righteous’ because it is ‘full (<italic>plenus</italic>) of sadness and infirmities’ (4.27).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0951820712467887">15</xref></sup> Since <italic>festino</italic> (Syr. <italic>srhb</italic>) describes the chambers of the earth as giving birth in near context (4.42), the use of this verb in 4.26–27 suggests that the new age hastens not simply to pass away but to pass through (<italic>pertranseo</italic>, Syr. ʿ<italic>mr</italic>) a time of labor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0951820712467887">16</xref></sup> Since it is already pregnant (<italic>plenus</italic>, Syr. <italic>mly</italic>) with evil, it is unable to carry (<italic>porto</italic>) renewal (in its womb).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0951820712467887">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus, in addition to the metaphor of a woman in labor to describe the timing of the end of the age, images related to agricultural and human fertility work together in this passage to suggest two other mothers: the present age, pregnant with evil, and the earth, with wombs full of souls.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0951820712467887">18</xref></sup> The labor of the present age, described in agricultural terms, will clear away the evil sown into her through the agency of the human heart, making way for the bearing of good fruit (4.28–32). So too, underground wombs (the chambers of the earth) will bring forth righteous souls (4.42).</p>
<p>Finally, the motif of childbearing appears in a rhetorical device important to the narrative and introduced in this section. When speaking of the laboring woman who serves as the vehicle of his metaphor, the angel does not simply describe her but commands Ezra to query her directly. ‘Ask a woman who is pregnant’, he says (4.40). The angel offers three similar exhortations in visions two and three (5.46, 51; 7.54), which are echoed by Ezra in his own exhortation to the mourning woman in vision four (10.9).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0951820712467887">19</xref></sup> These rhetorical questions serve two narrative purposes. On the one hand, they draw the reader's attention to the didactic role that pregnancy and birth play for Ezra: he might learn something, the angel tells him, if he would query a childbearing woman. On the other hand, this instruction to Ezra begins to move the childbearing motif beyond the level of metaphor and toward the level of character, for it raises the possibility that in Ezra's narrative world there may be a real, flesh-and-blood childbearing woman to whom he should direct his questions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0951820712467887">
<title>Signs of the Transition of the Ages (4.51–5.13)</title>
<p>At the end of vision one, imagery of dysfunctional childbirth appears in the angel's description of the signs of the end of the age (5.1–13). The terror of the end of the age is portrayed vividly as unrest in both heavens and earth, resulting in a loss of purity by violation of boundaries. To depict this chaos, the angel picks up the imagery of spiritual barrenness introduced by Ezra, which he combines with his previous depiction of malignant fertility, now envisioned as malignant birth. The land will be barren (<italic>sterilis</italic>) of faith (5.2) and fertility will go terribly wrong when women give birth (<italic>pario</italic>) to monsters (5.9).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0951820712467887">20</xref></sup> Metaphorical infertility is suggested as well when the angel anticipates that ‘people shall hope but not obtain; they shall labor (<italic>laboro</italic>), but their ways shall not prosper’. Yet childbirth here is not as clear (5.12).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0951820712467887">21</xref></sup> Barrenness, monstrous delivery, and possibly also unproductive labor characterize the chaos of the end.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0951820712467887">22</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0951820712467887">
<title>Vision Two (5.21–6.34)</title>
<p>The structure of the second vision imitates that of the first, and the two speakers echo their use of the childbirth motif from the first dialogue. Ezra again wishes he had not been born if he cannot understand (5.21–40). The angel describes the age as giving birth (5.41–6.10), instructs Ezra to inquire of a childbearing woman (5.46, 51), and uses fertility language to depict eschatological signs (6.11–28).</p>
<sec id="section7-0951820712467887">
<title>Debate about Ezra's Understanding (5.21–40)</title>
<p>Like the first vision, the second opens with Ezra posing a question of theodicy. Still in turmoil, Ezra reminds the angel that God has chosen one people from among many nations but has now destroyed Zion and handed the one over to the many (5.21–29).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0951820712467887">23</xref></sup> Because he cannot understand, he again questions his birth, this time wondering why he was stillborn: ‘Why did not my mother's womb become my grave, that I might not see the travail (<italic>laboro</italic>) of Jacob and the exhaustion of the people of Israel?’ (5.35). In this second expression of despair over his birth, Ezra augments the childbirth motif by drawing more precisely on the realities of human birth with the words ‘mother’ and ‘womb’. The word <italic>laboro</italic> subtly suggests a link between the futility of Ezra's birth and Israel's exhaustion: Ezra sees the birthing labor of his own mother as meaningless if he cannot understand the pointless travail of Israel. Throughout this exchange, the angel's response to Ezra sets God's love over against Ezra's attempts to understand.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0951820712467887">24</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0951820712467887">
<title>Divine timing (5.41–6.10)</title>
<p>In the section on divine timing, the angel again employs the childbirth motif as a didactic metaphor in each of three exchanges with Ezra. In the first exchange, as the two debate the necessity of successive generations of people on earth (5.41–49), Ezra wonders why God could not simply have created all people at once, eliminating the sense of delay that suggests God's injustice (5.43). The angel responds that the creation cannot hasten (<italic>festino</italic>) more than the Creator, nor can ‘the world hold at one time those who have been created in it’ (5.44). This assertion recalls the angel's previous statement about the hastening of the present age and its inability to bear what has been promised, because it is already full (4.26–27, 42).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0951820712467887">25</xref></sup> As before, the angel's imagery relies on an underlying metaphor of the world as pregnant mother carrying fetuses in her womb, which becomes more explicit as the angel continues. To bring out this metaphor, 5.44 might be translated: ‘neither can the age carry all together [in its womb] those who have been begotten in it’ (<italic>nec sustinere saeculum qui in eo creati sunt in unum</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0951820712467887">26</xref></sup> As the angel continues in response to Ezra, the metaphor becomes explicit when, for the second time, the angel exhorts Ezra.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0951820712467887">27</xref></sup> He says, ‘Ask a woman's womb, and say to it, “If you bear ten children, why one after another? Request it therefore to produce ten at one time”’ (5.46). Having presented the vehicle of a metaphor in this exhortation, the angel goes on to offer its tenor: neither can the womb of the present age produce ten fetuses all together (<italic>in unum</italic>) (5.48). Wombs—of real women or the present age—are limited: they must give birth by means of successive pregnancies.</p>
<p>In the second exchange of this section, Ezra's query to the angel about the length of the present age continues the childbearing motif (5.50–55).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0951820712467887">28</xref></sup> If the earth of the present age is a womb, then Ezra wants to know, ‘Is our mother young or approaching old age?’ (5.50). Once again, the angel exhorts Ezra to direct his questions to a childbearing woman: ‘Ask a woman who bears children’ why her infants become successively smaller as she ages (5.51–52).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0951820712467887">29</xref></sup> ‘She will tell you’, says the angel, ‘those borne in the strength of youth are different from those born during the time of old age, when the womb is failing’ (5.53). Ezra and his contemporaries are smaller in stature than those who have gone before, so the angel concludes that the womb of the present age (the earth) is growing old (5.54).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0951820712467887">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus, in the first two dialogues, the childbearing motif—as used by the angel—appears as an extended metaphor in which a woman's womb serves as the vehicle and the earth as the tenor. The ground of this metaphor lies in two shared characteristics: (1) a woman's womb and the earth both bear children and (2) they both deliver according to three purposeful, predetermined, and interrelated schedules: the term of pregnancy, the requirement of successive childbearing, and the overall span of childbearing years in a woman's life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0951820712467887">31</xref></sup> However, this earth-as-womb metaphor describes two different <italic>periods of time</italic> in each of the visions. In the first, it points to the future, when multiple womb-like sepulchers within the earth will deliver up all the souls within them, all at once. But in the second, it portrays the present, when the single, aging womb of the earth gives birth to successive, declining generations of children.</p>
<p>In the third exchange about divine timing, Uriel makes a shift in his use of the childbearing motif. Turning from earth-as-womb language, he instead offers the births of Esau and Jacob as an allegorical analogy to show that the coming age will follow directly on the heels of the present (6.7–10). After an exchange about God's involvement in this transition (5.56–6.6), Ezra asks how long the span of time will be between the two ages, and the angel responds that just as the younger twin grabbed the heel of the older, the coming age will arrive immediately after the present, with no span of time separating the two.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0951820712467887">32</xref></sup> Consistent with his earlier childbirth metaphors, this analogy depicts the arrival of the new age as a birth, but the present age changes roles: it is depicted neither as pregnant with evil nor as an aging mother but rather as an older child followed (and surpassed) by a younger brother.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0951820712467887">33</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0951820712467887">
<title>Signs of the Transition of the Ages (6.11–28)</title>
<p>As Ezra continues his queries about the end of the present age, the childbearing motif appears again in the angel's description of eschatological signs. But in the second vision, the angel inverts this imagery, ultimately painting a picture not of impurity and infertility but of renewal and fruitfulness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0951820712467887">34</xref></sup> He describes a series of reversals: pregnant women will deliver before their due time, unsown places will be sown, storehouses will empty, and springs will stop flowing (6.21–23).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0951820712467887">35</xref></sup> This series of contrasting reversals suggests an upsetting of the natural order that is neither wholly bad nor wholly good.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0951820712467887">36</xref></sup> Yet the childbearing motif specifically is far more positive in this passage when compared with the dysfunctional fertility of signs of the end in the first vision, for it is not monstrous but prodigious.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0951820712467887">37</xref></sup> Infants born pre-term—near the end of the first trimester of pregnancy—not only live but dance. Year-old children show similar promise: they are already able to speak (6.21).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0951820712467887">38</xref></sup> Moreover, when the angel continues to use the language of fertility to point forward to human transformation in the new age, he creates a metaphorical connection between the signs of prodigious birth and spiritual rebirth: ‘Faithfulness shall flourish (<italic>floreo</italic>), and corruption shall be overcome, and the truth, which has been so long without fruit (<italic>fructus</italic>), shall be revealed’ (6.28). This anticipated renewal reverses Ezra's earlier concern about the fruitlessness of the human heart, for in the new age humans will blossom with faith and bear fruit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0951820712467887">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus, while vision one offers signs of dying fertility associated with the old age, vision two emphasizes harbingers of renewed fertility associated with the arrival of the new age. This contrast between portents in the two visions highlights a dissimilarity between endings and beginnings, even if such occur simultaneously. As the angel explains later in the narrative, ‘the beginnings are manifest in wonders and mighty works, and the end in penalties and in signs’ (9.6).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0951820712467887">40</xref></sup> Negative portents accompany endings, but more positive portents herald beginnings. However, as made clear in the Jacob and Esau analogy, the new age will follow directly upon the old, so the portents are mixed</p>

<sec id="section10-0951820712467887">
<title>Vision Three (6.35–9.25)</title>
<p>Like the first two visions, the third opens with a dialogue about Ezra's journey toward proper understanding of earthly events (6.36–7.16).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0951820712467887">41</xref></sup> In this section, the childbearing motif communicates the preciousness of Israel as God's first-born son, and infuses Israel's suffering with meaning, for the constraints of the present age will open into the broadness of the new age, bearing the fruit of immortality. In the middle section, Ezra and the angel do not discuss divine timing—as in the first two visions—but continue their dispute about the one and the many (7.17–8.62a). The childbearing motif is at the center of this debate: the angel uses it to make the case that the few are most precious, while Ezra argues that because God is intimately involved in the birth and nurture of humans, God should care about them all.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0951820712467887">42</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section11-0951820712467887">
<title>Debate about Ezra's Understanding (6.36–7.25)</title>
<p>In continued distress, Ezra uses the childbearing motif to raise a third question about Israel's punishment (6.36–59).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0951820712467887">43</xref></sup> If Israel is God's first-born, only-begotten, and most dear child, why does the nation fail to receive its inheritance (6.58)?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0951820712467887">44</xref></sup> In response, the angel introduces two similes. The current age is like a narrow channel emptying into a broad sea or a dangerous, narrow path—bounded by fire on one side and water on the other—leading to an inherited city (7.3–8). Like these narrow passageways, the constriction of the present age opens into the broad expanse of the age to come, which will yield the fruit of immortality (7.11–13).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0951820712467887">45</xref></sup> But to reach this inheritance, the people of God must pass through ‘difficult and vain experiences’ (7.14), a passageway that is constrained, painful, and laborious (7.14).</p>
<p>Beneath the angel's explicit similes of passageways that lead into a sea and a city, lies the childbearing motif as a submerged metaphor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0951820712467887">46</xref></sup> Given the repeated language of childbearing, the angel's description of difficult, narrow entrances that lead to a new, broad place brings to mind the infant's laborious journey through the birth canal into a new world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0951820712467887">47</xref></sup> The angel's conclusion that the constrained journey will bear fruit (7.13) brings this submerged metaphor of childbirth closer to the surface, for as noted above, fruit-bearing and childbearing are closely connected in the narrative. Another layer is thus added to the angel's extended metaphor of childbearing: he now depicts the suffering of Israel not as the travail of a birthing mother but rather of an infant, squeezed and twisted on its way to new life and its share in the inheritance. Since the angel is responding to Ezra's identification of Israel as God's first-born and only begotten child, an infant's view of birth well suits the context. The point is hopeful: those who find themselves in the narrow and difficult passage ought to focus not on the present difficulty but on the future reward, as the angel exhorts in conclusion: ‘Think about what is to come’ (7.16).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0951820712467887">
<title>Debate about Ezra's Concern for the Many (7.17–8.62)</title>
<p>In the middle section of the vision, as Ezra and the angel discuss Ezra's concern about the fate of the many unrighteous, who will face torment in the age to come, the childbearing motif appears five times.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0951820712467887">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>First, the angel says that when the eschatological city will appear, the chambers of the earth will give up (<italic>reddo</italic>) those who are asleep in it (7.32). This verb recalls the first vision, in which Uriel likens these chambers to wombs that will give up (<italic>reddo</italic>) souls (4.40–43), and shortly later in vision three, the word clearly communicates birth (8.9), as is noted below.</p>
<p>Second, when Ezra laments the fact that so few have kept God's covenant, the angel exhorts him, for a fourth time, to query a woman: ‘Ask the earth and she will tell you’ that among the minerals she produces (<italic>creo</italic>), the rarest are most precious (7.55). His three previous exhortations have told Ezra to direct his questions to childbearing women or their wombs (4.40; 5.46, 51). Moreover, the angel has previously described the earth as a birthing mother (4.41–42; 5.48–49, 55), and the word <italic>creo</italic> can be used to describe the process of giving birth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0951820712467887">49</xref></sup> Thus, in vision three, the angel again directs Ezra's attention to a birthing mother for instruction. Her imagined answer makes the point that the Lord will rejoice over the precious, liberated few but not grieve over the condemned many (7.60–61).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0951820712467887">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>Third, Ezra immediately contests the angel's rare-is-precious argument with an apostrophe directed back to the childbearing earth: ‘O Earth’, he asks, ‘to what have you given birth (<italic>pario</italic>)? … It would have been better if the dust itself had not been born (<italic>nascor</italic>)’ (7.62–63).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0951820712467887">51</xref></sup> Why should the earth bear children at all, if they must live with knowledge of their future torment? This apostrophe is the third time that Ezra has questioned human existence, and as before, Ezra's struggle derives from his identification with <italic>all</italic> of humanity. The problem of sin goes back to Adam and affects all people, thus the coming age will bring not relief but judgment for nearly everyone (7.68).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0951820712467887">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fourth, some verses later in the exchange, as Ezra continues his protest against the few-are-precious argument, he uses the language of fertility to question the purpose of God's labor on behalf of human-kind if it results only in the destruction of many (8.4–16). Speaking of all people, Ezra entreats God to provide a seed in human hearts that will produce fruit and the consequent ability to live (8.6).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0951820712467887">53</xref></sup> Then, he details God's involvement in the physical, earthly processes of childbearing (8.8–14). God fashions the womb, creates the fetus within in, keeps mother and child during pregnancy, nourishes the newborn infant, and guides the youth (with divine mercy) in righteousness, law, and wisdom toward maturity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0951820712467887">54</xref></sup> Ezra's point is a critique: how can such care turn so quickly to destruction? He then offers Israel as an example, with the implication that since God has raised Israel like a child yet allowed it to be destroyed, how is there hope for anyone (8.15–16)?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0951820712467887">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fifth, the angel responds to Ezra prayer for a seed for the human heart that will produce spiritual fruit. Picking up Ezra's fertility metaphor, the angel envisions a farmer who plants many seeds, only a few of which take root. God is like the farmer, and not all of those sown into the world will live (8.41). Ezra, troubled by this comparison, asserts a preference for his previous analogy of childbearing, arguing that God has not made humanity like the farmer's seed, for seeds depend on rain, but humans are formed (<italic>plasmo</italic>) by God. This word recalls the immediately preceding section, in which Ezra describes God's deep involvement in the processes of human birth and development using the word <italic>plasmo</italic> four times (8.7, 8, 11, 14). From the perspective that humans are not like seeds to God but like children, he again begs God for mercy (8.45). The angel concludes this section by returning to the theme of God's love: Ezra cannot know its extent. He also brings up again the topic of one and the many, reprimanding Ezra for again including himself among the many, who are justly condemned (8.46–62a).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0951820712467887">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>To summarize, in visions one through three, language related to childbearing and fertility appears regularly in Ezra's complaints about the problem of evil and the limits of his own understanding (3.7–26; 4.6). The corrupt, barren human heart cannot bear fruit, despite the fact that the law has been sown into it. Ezra himself, struggling with the reality of divine judgment upon the many who have been born on the earth, wishes three times that he had never been born (4.12; 5.21–40; 7.62–63). He also details God's involvement in the physical, earthly processes of childbearing and nurturing of children (8.8–14).</p>
<p>Similarly, the angel uses the motif of childbearing to instruct Ezra about the coming transition of the ages. Disagreeing with Ezra's understanding of this age, the angel describes it not as barren but fertile or pregnant with evil: it will need to deliver the evil within it in order to make way for renewal (4.28–32). In this present age, the womb of the earth, like the wombs of women, delivers living generations successively (5.41–49), but it also grows old, nearing the end of its childbearing years (5.50–55). Akin to a birth of twins, the new age will emerge on the heels of the present, with no gap of time between them (6.7–10), and in the future, the chambers of the earth will yield up their souls (4.42; 7.32). The angel speaks of difficult, narrow entrances that lead to a new, broad places, bringing to mind the infant's laborious journey through the birth canal into a new world (7.3–16). The childbearing motif also appears in the angel's description of the mixed signs that accompany the transition of the ages, which are envisioned as dysfunctional (5.1–13) and prodigious (6.21–28) fertility.</p>
<p>Finally, in the course of this dialogue, the angel exhorts Ezra four times to direct questions to childbearing women. He tells Ezra to ‘Ask a pregnant woman’ (4.40); ‘Ask a woman's womb’ (5.46); ‘Ask a woman who bears’ (5.51); and ‘Ask the earth’ depicted as birthing mother (7.55). These distinctive exhortations—combined with the pattern of childbearing imagery in Ezra's complaints and the angel's responses—prepare the audience for the fourth vision.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0951820712467887">
<title>Vision Four (9.26–10.59)</title>
<p>Just before the fourth vision begins, the angel tells Ezra to prepare for his next vision in a new way: he is to go into a field of flowers, which will serve as his only food for seven days (9.23–25). As has been observed by interpreters, this action represents an important turning point for Ezra, but as will be argued below, it does not complete his transformation. This turn in the narrative is marked by a change in structure. Like the previous three visions, the fourth vision begins with a dialogue between Ezra and the angel, but then a loudly mourning woman appears. After conversation with Ezra, she is transformed into a glorious city, and the vision concludes with the angel's interpretation of these events. In this pivotal vision, the childbearing motif first appears when Ezra again uses fertility imagery to question divine justice (9.26–37). The motif then reaches a peak in the appearance of the mourning woman, both in her description of herself as one who has born and lost a child and in Ezra's conversation with her about mothers (9.38–10.59). Her voice facilitates Ezra's transformation from a man who raises intellectual questions to one who shares the divine perspective by properly mourning for the precious one, Zion.</p>
<sec id="section14-0951820712467887">
<title>Containers and their Contents (9.26–37)</title>
<p>As the fourth vision opens, Ezra uses the language of agricultural fertility to present an analogy—based on containers and their contents—in order to question why those who have received the law will perish. God has sown the seed of the law into Israel, but the people did not keep it, so they perished (9.29–33).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0951820712467887">57</xref></sup> But typically, when a container (such as a sown field) receives contents (such as a seed), if the contents perish, the container remains (9.34–35). Thus, Ezra cannot understand why, as he puts it, ‘with us it has not been so’, for ‘we’ have received the law but perished (9.35–36). Because Ezra's concern through much of the dialogues has been with all humanity, in contrast with the angel's interest in a precious few, Ezra's use of the first person us’ is not clear, even though he refers to Israel in this section. Does Ezra mean us’ as in Israel or as in all humans?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0951820712467887">58</xref></sup> This lack of clarity will be corrected in the following scene.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0951820712467887">
<title>Vision of the Mourning Woman and Its Interpretation (9.38–10.59).</title>
<p>God responds to Ezra's question about containers and seeds by confronting him with a woman in a state of tremendous mourning, crying loudly (9.38). At least two factors suggest that the vision offers a divine response. First, the sorrowing woman appears at the moment that Ezra ‘said these things in my heart’ (9.26). Second, in every case of Ezra's direct speech in the narrative, an answer has always followed. There is no reason to doubt that her appearance follows the same pattern.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0951820712467887">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>The woman's sorrow so captivates Ezra that he turns from his complaints and asks her why she grieves (9.39–40). She responds by telling him her story of barrenness, the divinely empowered birth of a son, and his subsequent death (9.41–47).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0951820712467887">60</xref></sup> At the urging of her neighbors, the woman has remained quiet for two days, but finally, unable to suppress her grief any longer, she has fled out of the city and into the field, intending to mourn and fast without ceasing until she dies (10.2–4).</p>
<p>Among those who interpret <italic>4 Ezra</italic> as a narrative whole, most understand Ezra's encounter with this woman to accomplish a profound reorientation within him. While this general point is largely accepted, interpreters dispute the precise moment within (or leading up to) vision four that this change occurs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0951820712467887">61</xref></sup> It is my assertion in this study that the recurring childbearing motif of the first three visions directs the audience to pay careful attention to this woman's speech. The motif encourages the audience both to hear figurative meanings in her story of childbirth and to expect that Ezra will obey the angel's four exhortations by seeking the woman's insight, now that an actual childbearing woman has appeared before him. In short, the motif anticipates that the woman's voice will provide instruction with the potential to facilitate understanding in Ezra. Indeed, as the analysis below seeks to demonstrate, Ezra continues to hold at least two views that will be reshaped by his interaction with the woman: his concern for the many and his view that the ‘container’ has perished. The first view changes in dialogue with the woman; the second, when he witnesses her transformation.</p>
<p>Ezra's interaction with the woman opens in keeping with the expectations created by the childbearing motif With great interest, he asks her why she grieves. But upon hearing her story, Ezra responds angrily. His anger is not about her grief <italic>per se</italic> but about its object: in Ezra's view, the woman should not mourn the loss of one son when so many people suffer and are destined for destruction (10.8–11).</p>
<p>When considered in the context of the whole narrative, Ezra's angry response is entirely wrongheaded. Rather than learning from a childbearing woman, in accord with the angel's four exhortations to ‘ask a woman’ who bears children, he reprimands her for her insistent mourning (10.5–6). The story the woman tells characterizes her as an admirable person of faith, who like barren women in scripture demonstrates a praiseworthy dependence on God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0951820712467887">62</xref></sup> However, Ezra calls her foolish. The woman's appearance seems to constitute a divine response to Ezra, as argued above, and her transformation ultimately confirms this point, but Ezra rejects her voice. He is angry, but the angel has emphasized God's love.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0951820712467887">63</xref></sup> He joins the woman's neighbors in attempting to silence her mourning for a deeply beloved only son, but the narrative has already established that this kind of love reflects the divine perspective (5.33; 8.47).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0951820712467887">64</xref></sup> Indeed, her great need to mourn openly has brought her out into the field, which as the angel points out later is the necessary place of her transformation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0951820712467887">65</xref></sup> Thus, when Ezra tells her to stop mourning and return to the city, this order cannot be correct. Finally, Ezra claims that she ought to grieve over the many and not mourn the one, but the angel has disputed this point of view.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0951820712467887">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>The deficiency of Ezra's response is further heightened by his echo of the angel's exhortations to ‘ask a woman’, which also creates a deep irony. Not only has Ezra failed to seek this woman's insight, but now he attempts to instruct her with the very kind of exhortation he has ignored. Moreover, Ezra makes exactly the wrong point with his echo of the angel's words. Whereas the angel previously used the metaphor of mother earth to argue that what is <italic>rarest and least</italic> has the greatest value, Ezra now uses this figure to disregard the loss of the rare (her one son) because of concern for the <italic>many</italic>.</p>
<p>Thus, even though Ezra begins his first response to the woman with reference to the ‘deep grief and great distress’ of ‘Zion, the mother of us all’, his real concern is clearly not the sorrow of Zion but the sorrow of the earth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0951820712467887">67</xref></sup> This confusion, which has appeared elsewhere in Ezra's speech throughout the dialogues, raises a question: Who is Ezra's figurative mother? Is she Zion (representing the one) or the earth (representing many)?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0951820712467887">68</xref></sup> The fact that the mourning woman in the field actually <italic>is</italic> Zion deepens the irony of Ezra's mistaken reprimand of her. Although he tells mother Zion not to grieve for her loss but for the loss experienced by mother earth, without question, Zion properly sorrows over the loss of her one, precious son (later identified by the angel as the temple and sacrifice).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0951820712467887">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given the problematic nature of Ezra's first response to her, the woman's one-line rejoinder is important (10.18). Strikingly, she patently rejects this attempt to silence her grief and send her back to the city, replying, ‘I will not do so; I will not go into the city, but I will die here’. The childbearing woman, now not simply a metaphor but a character with a voice, rebuffs Ezra's response to her story, refusing to suppress her grief or leave the field. Through her negative reaction to Ezra's first response to her, the narrative plainly signals its inadequacy.</p>
<p>In addition, it becomes clear that this short speech of resistance by the woman exerts power over Ezra. When he speaks a second time, his tone has changed from reprimand to true consolation, and he recognizes the deep love the woman has for her son (10.19–20). Rather than calling the woman foolish, Ezra seeks to persuade her with reason (10.20). Instead of commanding her to acknowledge God's decree, he encourages her to accept God's mercy (10.24). While he urges her to shake off her ‘great sadness and lay aside’ her many sorrows, he does not—as before—try to silence her sorrow nor urge her to ‘bear bravely’ her troubles (10.15). Rather, he offers the hope of God's rest (10.24). In addition, in this second response, Ezra no longer confuses metaphorical mothers. Rather, he unambiguously offers the sorrow of Zion for the woman's consolation (10.20, 24), voicing a lengthy lament for Jerusalem's woes (10.21–23).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0951820712467887">70</xref></sup> Yet by speaking of Zion's grief, he does not seek to diminish the significance of the woman's sorrow (as in his first response) but rather to acknowledge the enormity of her loss (10.24).</p>
<p>Through lament, Ezra joins the woman in properly mourning the loss of the one—for the first time in the narrative. Some interpreters view Ezra as grieving over Israel earlier in the narrative, but I see no evidence of true lament for Israel until his second speech in vision four.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0951820712467887">71</xref></sup> Prior to this point, Ezra has wept, to be sure, but these tears have been shed not over the loss of the one but over his own intellectual limitations. For example, at the beginning of the second vision, Ezra accuses God of hating Zion. The angel replies that God does not hate but loves Israel, and he asks if Ezra is ‘greatly disturbed in mind over Israel’ or loves Israel more than does God (5.33). Ezra's response is revealing, for his answer is ‘no’. Ezra goes on to make it clear that his ‘agonies of heart’ derive from his inability to understand the way of the Most High (5.34). A few verses after this exchange, the angel observes that Ezra seeks understanding, but what needs to be discovered is the goal of the love that God has promised God's people (5.40). The divine perspective is grounded in deep love for the one precious child, but the pressing issue for Ezra is not love but knowledge. Elsewhere, Ezra's weeping similarly derives not from loss but from intellectual questions about theodicy (5.13, 28; 6.35, 59). While these tears are praised by the angel (5.13), result in his receipt of the initial visions (5.20), and are not silenced (6.35), neither do they represent the true lament that comes from the loss of something precious and deeply loved.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0951820712467887">72</xref></sup> But the woman's insistent mourning over the death of her only child finally shifts Ezra's concern fully away from the many and to the one.</p>
<p>The narrative significance of Ezra's new lament for the loss of the one is highlighted in two ways. First, immediately upon the conclusion of Ezra's lament, the woman begins to transform into a magnificent version of Zion, the very image Ezra used to comfort her. Second, Uriel appears as <italic>angelus interpres</italic> (10.29–57), explaining that Ezra has been privileged to witness the woman's transformation <italic>because of his profound distress on her behalf</italic> (10.39, 50).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0951820712467887">73</xref></sup> It is precisely Ezra's empathy, expressed in a lament for Zion's loss, that makes him worthy to see Zion's glory and receive the divine secrets.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0951820712467887">74</xref></sup> These narrative cues confirm the analysis that the childbearing motif prepares the audience to see the woman's speech as climactically instructive for Ezra because it moves him to join her lament, which in turn sets in motion her transformation and the remainder of the narrative.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0951820712467887">75</xref></sup> Then, as a result of her transformation, Ezra learns that his complaint about containers having perished is not correct, for Zion is actually ‘an established city’ of ‘huge foundations’ (10.26).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0951820712467887">76</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The motif of childbearing weaves through the first four visions of <italic>4 Ezra</italic>, providing a narrative thread that can be traced from the beginning of Ezra's dialogue with the angel to the pivotal scene with the childbearing woman in vision four. On the whole, the childbearing motif serves as an apt figure for the transition of the ages, an event that is both end and beginning, travail and renewal, suffering and hope. Even as the fruit of evil disappears from the womb of the earth, in the midst of terrible signs, the new age emerges, pregnant with promise. Despite the suffering inherent in the birth pangs of the new age, God will ensure delivery according to a pre-determined schedule. Then, the womb of the earth will bring forth all souls sleeping within it, human hearts will become righteous, and Israel, like a child passing through the pain of birth, will enter the broad expanse of its inheritance. Over the precious few delivered by the present age—who are akin to rare minerals born within the earth—the Lord will rejoice.</p>
<p>These interconnections among the childbearing motif provide a rhetorical context for the image of the childbearing woman, preparing both the audience and Ezra to listen to her voice. After experiencing birth and loss, she properly seeks the freedom of the empty field to lament the loss of her one precious son, and she rightly rejects Ezra's attempt to silence this grief and return her to the city. After her rebuke, Ezra joins her in this mourning, offering the sorrow of Jerusalem as comfort. Their shared lament initiates the woman's transformation into glorified Zion, which directly answers Ezra's questions about containers and what is contained. Her transformation reveals that the contained (the woman's son, representing the temple and sacrifice) <italic>has</italic> been destroyed, but the container (the woman, representing Zion) not only endures but triumphs.</p>
<p>The vision of the woman also animates themes inherent in the angel's previous metaphorical and symbolic use of childbearing. Ezra and Zion, joined in mourning, bring to life a glorious city. Similarly, the current distress of God's people should be recognized as productive pain, birth pangs that will produce the fruit of faithfulness and reward. Zion suffers in the present age, but she has not died. Rather she, like the present age itself, labors to deliver the people of God into a broad and glorious inheritance. Their shared mourning also ‘births’ understanding within Ezra by redirecting the objects of both his concern (from the many to the one) and his distress (from his own failure to understand to Zion's loss). Through an encounter with deep maternal love, Ezra gains the ability to receive insight into the goal of divine love.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0951820712467887">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the history of interpretation of Ezra's development in the narrative, scholars have sought to find the author's point of view in the narrative: Is it to be identified with Ezra's assertions in the dialogues or the angel's? If Ezra represents the narrator, then why do his views change? Rather than seeking to identify the author with a particular perspective, this study has investigated the effect of authorial choices on the audience, arguing that the childbearing motif directs us to find a key moment of Ezra's transformation in the voice of the woman. If this understanding of the narrative's artistry is correct, then it reveals an author who has crafted the dialogues to highlight the crucial role of lament as a response to suffering. It reveals an author who does not reject outright Ezra's intellectual questions but who does challenge them, and in whose vision, theodicy ultimately takes second place to lament, for lament shares the divine perspective of love, thus containing within it the promise of renewal.</p>
<p>From the moment that Ezra truly mourns the loss of the one, he never again pleads on behalf of the many nor does he question God, and he begins to receive true knowledge directly from God. Toward the end of the narrative, the childbearing motif reappears briefly in regard to Ezra's new role as recipient of divine wisdom. God says of him, you alone have been enlightened about this … for you have devoted your life to wisdom, and called understanding your mother’ (13.56). From an empathetic encounter with mother Zion (distinct from mother Earth), Ezra becomes the child of mother Wisdom who receives the revelation of God (14.37–40). Poured into Ezra, this revelation flows out from him into two sets of sacred books (14.40–44). Thus, Ezra's rebirth as the child of Wisdom produces a divine, written path that leads to life for those living in the last days (14.22–24). In the end, then, through the image of mother Wisdom, the narrative subtly links Ezra's production of texts with the previous imagery of childbearing, for this depiction of scripture as a path (<italic>semita</italic>) that leads to life (14.22) recalls the angel's description, earlier in the narrative, of a treacherous path (<italic>semita</italic>) akin to the dangerous straits of childbirth (7.8). The narrative ultimately depicts scripture as a way of birth for those who will experience the transition of the ages. If Zion-Wisdom is mother, then Ezra, as producer of sacred texts, opens the passage that leads to life.</p>

When asked for his judgment of the two parties in the parable, Ezra criticizes both forest and sea for overstepping their assigned bounds. As before, the angel uses Ezra's response against him. Like the characters in the angel's story, Ezra should keep within his assigned boundaries: he should seek to understand what is on the earth (4.13–21). Tracing the childbearing motif suggests that this transformation of Ezra's understanding reaches a peak during his interaction with the woman in the fourth vision.</p></fn>

Soranus extends the analogy to nourishment of the child after birth, comparing mother and child with the earth and plants (2.18).

The angel responds not by answering Ezra's query but by countering Ezra's theological assumption: God does not hate but loves Israel. The angel asks whether Ezra loves Israel more than the Maker does (5.33). Ezra's response shows that the anguish in his heart derives not primarily from the suffering of the chosen people but from his own intellectual unrest. To the angel's question about loving Israel more than God, he replies, ‘No’. In fact, his inner turmoil springs from his attempt to understand (<italic>adprehendo</italic>) the way of the Most High (5.34). Ezra concern is neither love nor hate but knowledge (5.33–34). After Ezra laments his birth, the angel notes that Ezra seeks understanding, but if he cannot gather raindrops or make withered flowers bloom, then he cannot discover the goal of the love that God has promised God's people (5.40). In this speech, the voice of Uriel merges with God's voice, which happens on several subsequent occasions.</p></fn>

It becomes clear that Ezra includes himself among those who have failed God (7.75, 126; 8.7, 31, 45), despite the angel's repeated insistence that he is not among this group (7.76; 8.47). In the course of this exchange, the angel reveals new information about the transition between the two ages, including the additional sign that a city will appear (7.26–44).</p></fn>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn50-0951820712467887"><label>50.</label><p>In the three previous exhortations, the angel clearly explains the ground of the metaphor after introducing its vehicle through the command. Here, however, the angel leaves the ground of the metaphor unspecified. Instead, he leaps to a statement about God: just as a person rejoices over what is rare, so will the Lord. The unstated ground of the metaphor could be constructed from the context as follows: a person rejoices after receiving a rare mineral produced (or birthed) from the earth. So too, God rejoices over the righteous few produced (or birthed) by this age (through the womb of the earth). The angel returns to the subject of the precious few in 8.1–3. There, he explains the ‘similitude’ further, saying that the age to come is for the sake of a few, who are like the rare gold dust from which gold is made: ‘Many have been created, but few will be saved’. Similarly, in 8.38, God says, ‘I will not concern myself about the fashioning of those who have sinned, or about their death, their judgment, or their damnation’. And in 9.21, God is depicted as saving ‘one grape out of a cluster, and one plant out of a great forest’.</p></fn>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn52-0951820712467887"><label>52.</label><p>In response, the angel reverses Ezra's point: precisely because humans have minds, they should understand and follow God's commands, which lead to life. The punishment of the many is deserved as the result of their own choices (7.70–74). At first glance, the language of law and covenant seems specific to Israel, but as Stone argues, the angel sometimes uses such language generally to refer to requirements laid upon all humanity (<italic>Fourth Ezra</italic>, pp. 194–95, 234).</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn53-0951820712467887"><label>53.</label><p>Ezra's concern is with all humanity: ‘every mortal who bears the likeness of a human being’ (8.6).</p></fn>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn55-0951820712467887"><label>55.</label><p>Ezra's concern in this passage is universal (8.6), but Ezra—confessing that God knows best about all humanity—provides the example of his own people, about which he knows. Ezra makes a leap, rhetorically, from the imagery of God's care in the process of human birth to his dismay over the destruction of his people. This move implies a metaphor in which God's involvement in human birth and growth serves as the vehicle and God's care of Israel as the tenor. If God has taken care to birth, nourish, and train the people of Israel, why would God then allow them suddenly and quickly to be destroyed? If this has been the experience of God's firstborn, how can anyone on earth have hope for salvation (8.17–19a)?</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn56-0951820712467887"><label>56.</label><p>The third vision concludes with signs of the coming transition of the ages, but these are not presented using childbirth language (8.62b–9.16). When the angel finishes, Ezra upsets the expected structure by asking a last question about why so many will be lost (9.14–16). The angel's response reiterates God's love for creation, demonstrated in tremendous labor in order to save one select plant among many sown from the fate shared by the corrupt world (9.17–22). This image of God's effort to save one among many concludes the vision.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn57-0951820712467887"><label>57.</label><p>This image is similar to the one that Ezra uses to open the dialogue in vision one: the law sown into human hearts has not produced fruit because of corruption within these hearts.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn58-0951820712467887"><label>58.</label><p>In previous parts of the dialogue, when the interlocutors speak of sowing seeds in the human heart and of receipt of the law, they sometimes have the people of God in mind and other times have all humanity in view.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn59-0951820712467887"><label>59.</label><p>Stone argues that the vision of the woman does not answer either Ezra's preceding question (9.26–10.24) or any of the questions he has raised in the dialogue previously (<italic>Fourth Ezra</italic>, pp. 311–13). Rather, he sees 9.39 as a decisive turning point: the woman's appearance distracts Ezra from his questions, causing him to drop them entirely, which facilitates his transformation into an appropriate receiver of divine secrets. While she certainly startles Ezra, I argue below that he continues to hold at least two views that will still be transformed through his interaction with the woman: his concern for the many and his view that the ‘container’ has perished.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn60-0951820712467887"><label>60.</label><p>The barren woman who receives a son is a common biblical motif. Certain midrashic texts mention and interpret a series of seven barren women in scripture, the seventh of whom is Zion: Sarah (Gen. 11.30); Rebekah (Gen. 25.21); Leah (Gen. 29.31); Rachel (Gen. 29.31); Hannah (1 Sam. 2.5); Hazlelponi, mother of Samson (Judg. 13.2–3; 1 Chron. 4.3); and Zion (Isa. 54.1). See, for example, <italic>Aggadat Bereshit</italic> 53; <italic>Pesikta de Rab Kahana</italic> 20.1–7. The woman's joyous childbearing turned to sorrow when on the day of his wedding, her beloved son died (10.1). The death of the woman's son may reflect the story of the Shunammite woman in 2 Kgs 4.12–37, which as Stone notes evidences some parallels to the story the woman tells in <italic>4 Ezra</italic>. He points out as well that the loss of a son on his wedding night is common in folklore, appearing also in Tobit (7.11; 8.10) (<italic>Fourth Ezra</italic>, p. 311).</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn61-0951820712467887"><label>61.</label><p>Ezra's resistance to the angel's arguments in the first three visions has clearly become acceptance by 14.28–36. At dispute is where his change in understanding occurs. For example, Stone sees 9.39 as a decisive turning point: the woman's extreme mourning externalizes Ezra's pain, distracting him from his questions and causing a psychological shift that facilitates his transformation into an appropriate receiver of divine secrets. He argues that by 10.5, Ezra has basically accepted the position of the angel and left behind the issues of the one/few and the many (<italic>Fourth Ezra</italic>, p. 318). Others have argued that the angel finally convinces Ezra at the end of vision three (e.g. Harnisch) or see his shift occurring in vision four as a literary device that happens without explanation during Ezra's conversation with the mourning woman (Brandenburger); as a result of his movement from distress to consolation (Breech); or as a result of witnessing the woman's transformation, which leads him to acknowledge the failure of his own understanding (Hogan). See the summaries of research in Karina Martin Hogan, <italic>Theologies in Conflict in 4 Ezra: Wisdom, Debate, and Apocalyptic Solution</italic> (Leiden: Brill, 2008), pp. 9–35; Stone, <italic>Fourth Ezra</italic>, pp. 22–33.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn62-0951820712467887"><label>62.</label><p>In times of both want (barrenness) and plenty (fertility), she depends on God's benefaction. In the former case, she petitions God, and in the latter, she rejoices greatly over the child (9.46). Her offering of praise contrasts strikingly with the ingratitude of the people of the earth, whom the angel describes has having received God's benefits without acknowledging or glorifying God as their source (9.11). Because nothing in the narrative raises doubts about this self-portrait, it should be viewed as trustworthy.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn63-0951820712467887"><label>63.</label><p>The word ‘anger’ translates <italic>iracundia</italic>, which normally means a violent outburst. Stone recognizes Ezra's anger in the first speech (10.5–17) but sees this as a proper reprimand in that Ezra, playing the role of the angel, encourages the woman to see the big picture and offers consolation (<italic>Fourth Ezra</italic>, pp. 318–21). While Ezra, in his first speech, does imitate the angel's rhetoric, I argue below that this is an ironic imitation, a problematic response that is properly rejected by the woman, who represents the angel's point of view through her story of blessing and loss, her insistent mourning, and her response to Ezra.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn64-0951820712467887"><label>64.</label><p>Stone characterizes the role of the neighbors as mystifying and points to theories that they represent the remnant of an earlier form of the story. He portrays them as mourning with her, but in fact they attempt to suppress her mourning, and she has come to the field to escape them (<italic>Fourth Ezra</italic>, p. 312). They seem to be the voice of propriety that contrasts with the woman's expression of grief for her beloved son. The neighbors’ perspective is reflected quite closely in Sir. 38.17–23. The woman's similarity with sorrowing women in scripture offers further validation of her grief. See, for example, the prophetic figure of Rachel weeping for her children (Jer. 31.13–15). As noted above, she shares some similarities with the Shunammite widow in 2 Kings, a point made by many interpreters. Both stories focus on women whose barrenness has turned into joyous motherhood by God's intervention, yet whose sons have died unexpectedly. Both women take independent action and loudly assert their sorrow. In the story in 2 Kings, Elisha's disciples attempt to silence the mourning mother's grief, but the prophet tells them to ‘Let her be’. In Ezra's exchange with the woman, the seer himself interrupts her mourning in order to press her into conversation, and she asks him to ‘Let her be …’ In 2 Kings, Elisha responds immediately to the woman's grief by taking action to raise her son, but Ezra tells the woman to keep her chin up and return home.</p></fn>

Earlier, Ezra has called the earth ‘our mother’ (5.50). Here, he identifies Zion as ‘mother of us all’.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn69-0951820712467887"><label>69.</label><p>Zion's mourning or desolation is an important motif in the Hebrew scriptures (e.g. Isa. 54.1; Jer. 50.12; Hos. 2.4; 4.5; Lam. 1.2, 16–17; 2.13) that is reflected also in later texts (Gal. 4.26; Bar. 4.14–5.5; <italic>2 Apoc. Bar</italic>. 3.1; 10.16; <italic>Pesiqta Rabbati</italic> 26).
