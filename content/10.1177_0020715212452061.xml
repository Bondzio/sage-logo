<p>Judith Stacey makes a clear statement in her latest book: love and marriage <italic>don’t</italic> ‘go together like a horse and carriage’. Challenging basic assumptions about the primacy and superiority of the ‘normal’ family (heterosexual, monogamous, married, with children), Stacey considers family diversity in three different locations. Based on ethnographic research in the United States, South Africa, and China, she emphasizes that a variety of constructions of families and intimacies exist. To understand families, we must be willing to recognize the many forms intimacies take, as well as the many inequalities generated and exacerbated by a marriage-based system of organizing families. As she argues (p. 12) ‘the sooner and the better our society comes to terms with the inescapable variety of intimacy and kinship in the modern world, the fewer unhappy families it will generate’.</p>
<p>While some of the research presented in this book may already be familiar to readers, the remarkable achievement of this book is in the way that Stacey uses each case to build her argument against marriage, and for a broader, more inclusive understanding of love and relationships. Her argument is constructed carefully, thoughtfully, and with some subtlety, as she reflects on gay male intimacies, polygynous families, and families organized not by marriage, sex, and parenthood, but by matrilineal relationships.</p>
<p>Stacey’s US-based research is situated among gay men in West Hollywood, Los Angeles. Here, her focus is trained on sexual relationships as well as deep friendships among men. She also explores gay men’s varied roles as fathers, including men who feel they are ‘predestined’ to be fathers, as well as those who are ‘situational’ fathers. Stacey depicts the lives of committed couples (and one triad), ex-lovers, ‘sex pigs’, and celibates to consider the range of intimate and familial bonds created by gay men.</p>
<p>A central point that emerges from her analysis is that gay men have learned to design deep, interconnected relationships crossing boundaries of class, race, ethnicity, religion, geography and nationality. Stacey both celebrates and critiques these relationships, pointing out the destructiveness of the ‘male gaze’ as well as the strengths of innovatively designed and respectful relationships. Stacey particularly honors the resourcefulness of gay fathers, praising how they establish and maintain relationships with co-parents, surrogates, adoption agencies, ex-lovers, and others in order to gain access to parenting and to parent their children effectively. While she admits that not all families parented by gay fathers are perfect, Stacey finds many loving, functional families. As she (p. 46) argues, ‘Because gay men have been compelled to create their relationships outside the prescribed template of the ‘‘sexual family,’’ they have devised ways to unhitch and recombine love, lust, nurturance, residence. . . and parenthood.’</p>
<p>The South African case provides a convenient comparison to the United States; while gay American couples are still striving toward marriage rights, gay couples in South Africa were awarded these rights in the 2006 Civil Union Act. Yet, South African gays and lesbians face severe homophobia, and relatively few (mostly white) gay couples marry – in direct contrast to the increasing acceptance and visibility for gay and lesbian relationships in the United States. At the same time, while polygynous families are illegal in the United States, ‘traditional African’ polygynous relationships are not only legal in South Africa, but celebrated (as in President Zuma’s public weddings with some of the women with whom he has children). Stacey reviews the political processes leading to the 1998 Recognition of Customary Marriages Act as well as the 2006 Civil Union Act. She notes an irony in that customary marriages are only legal for indigenous black heterosexual Africans, rather than for polygynous Muslims or for other groups, despite a 1996 Constitution that refuses discrimination on the basis of ‘race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, marital status, age, disability, pregnancy, origin, color, conscience, belief, culture, language, and birth’.</p>
<p>The contrast between the United States and South Africa is raised in order to consider the specter of the ‘slippery slope’ often raised by American commentators, about the potential for legalized gay marriage to lead to polygamous marriages. Rather than insisting that gay marriage and polygamous marriage are unrelated, Stacey suggests that they both recognize more diverse family forms, while noting that in South Africa, polygynous marriages predated gay marriage. Yet, she sees these forms of marriage as not ‘slippery slopes’ leading into one another, but more variably and unpredictably related. Stacey also uses her analysis of polygyny in South Africa to serve as a counterpoint to the widespread adultery apparent in many societies, suggesting that regulated polygynous relationships at least require some responsibility toward wives and children. Stacey suggests that polygynous relationships are ‘an attempt to reconcile men’s competing erotic, domestic, and religious passions while offering some modest compensations to the women who love (or are mated to) them’ (p. 151).</p>
<p>In Stacey’s final case, she explores the Mosuo people of southwest China, whose families are not based on marriage, but on matrilineal and matrilocal kinship. By separating sexuality from parenting and economic bonds, the Mosuo people experience family differently than most other peoples. Mosuo men and women live and work with their maternal families by day, and engage in romantic and sexual relationships by night. While some Mosuo couples practice ‘open’ visiting, acknowledged by others and similar to marriage, the men in these partnerships continue to reside with their maternal families. Other Mosuo practice ‘closed’ visiting, with no obligations to one another (although few seem willing to admit to multiple casual relationships). Yet women and men experience a rare degree of automony and equality regarding both their sexual and procreative lives; mate choice carries no implication for the family, and neither men nor women appear to be judged based on their sexual relationships or their procreative capabilities. Stacey traces some of the changes in this system over the last several decades due to Chinese politics, and then points to a dramatic change as thousands of ethnic tourists come to the region to see the Mosuo, undermining traditional family structures in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>Stacey sees a great deal to celebrate in the Mosuo system, which avoids problems generated by both traditional patriarchal families and modern sexual families. As she notes, ‘It radically frees family fortunes from the capriciousness of sexual love by eliminating marriage altogether. ‘‘Women and men should not marry,’’ as Namu explained the Mosuo perspective, ‘‘for love is like the seasons – it comes and goes’’’ (p. 183). She argues that Mosuo families are durable, stable, and relatively harmonious, while valuing all members of the household.</p>
<p>Based on these three cases, Stacey makes her claim for recognizing and supporting family diversity. She argues that her research has shown three things: marriage is not either universal or necessary, fatherlessness is <italic>not</italic> the root of problems in American families, and marriage promotion is not the way to solve social problems. Based on these principles, although she supports the aims of gay families, Stacey argues against marriage, which she sees as further institutionalizing inequalities based on marital status. At the same time she notes that a system narrowly based on marriage ‘drives diversity underground, where exploitation, abuse, and blackmail can thrive’ (p. 200), as well as promoting both adultery and divorce. Rather than the state supporting or favoring certain types of relationships, Stacey contends that the state should facilitate caring and support with civil rights and benefits based on citizenship, parenthood, and guardianship. Although encouraging family diversity, she also recognizes that some family systems are more (or less) egalitarian. Yet she remains insistent that ‘unhitching’ desire and domesticity is our best chance for happier families and a less troubled society.</p>
<p>The book is thought provoking, engaging, and makes important contributions to the study of families. Yet, Stacey under-theorizes the role of the state, even though the state plays a crucial role in regulating families across all of her cases. On the one hand, Stacey is calling for the state to get out of the marriage game. On the other hand, she notes that if the state regulates certain types of marriage (such as polygamous marriage in the US), the potential for these relationships to be destructive, abusive, and inequitable may be lessened. What role does the state play in ensuring that relationships are not abusive? How might family law evolve under a system that does not center on marriage? While her analysis is deft, at times she appears to dodge some of these inconsistencies – or perhaps unknowns – in her argument. Yet, despite these lingering questions, the book is a success. I recommend it as one that deserves a wide readership and one that should provoke important and more nuanced debates about how love, intimacy, sex, domesticity, and children should and should not be ‘hitched’.</p>
