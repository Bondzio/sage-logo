<abstract>
<p>This article explores how during the period of 1997 to 2003 the signifier of Sisterhood came to serve as an empty signifier within and among a number of small Swedish feminist grassroots publications (i.e. zines). It begins by positioning the Swedish feminist zine community within the larger context of so-called ‘second and third wave feminisms’ but argues at the same time that it is important to break with traditional feminist chronologies, and resist reductive generational narratives of feminist movement history. On the basis of this particular empirical case the article introduces an analytic of sexual logics as an alternative for analysing feminist discourse. From here the article goes on to investigate how the notion of Sisterhood has come to serve as an empty signifier within this specific community. It concludes with a more general discussion of the function of empty signifiers in relation to recent feminist discussions of Sisterhood.</p>

<title>Introduction: Revisiting Sisterhood</title>
<p>In times such as ours, when feminist debates are dotted with expressions such as ‘postfeminism’, ‘new feminism’, ‘queer’ and ‘the third wave’, any reference to the notion of Sisterhood might, for some, seem dated, something belonging to a bygone age of separatism and consciousness raising. This oddity would perhaps be all the more conspicuous given that much of the research I have conducted has often taken its cue from the thoughts and actions of contemporary young feminists – most of whom, just to compound the apparent anachronism, are well acquainted with post-structuralist critiques of the putative essentialism of radical feminism. Specifically, this article explores how the signifier of Sisterhood during the period between 1997 and 2003<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1350506811434871">1</xref></sup> – a time otherwise more commonly known for its denouncement of Sisterhood as a viable political ideal for feminism – came to operate within a number of small Swedish feminist grassroots publications (so-called zines<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1350506811434871">2</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>Only a brief survey of these publications is necessary to discover that, for a vast majority of these zines, Sisterhood functions as something of a common norm. This collective norm is expressed not only through explicit textual references and slogans such as ‘Sisterhood Gives Strength’ and ‘Every Girl is a Riot Grrrl’, but also in the form of visual representations (photographs, drawings, cut-and-pasted collages) which seek to express a sense of togetherness, of unity and comradeship between women. But as a norm Sisterhood operates in a quite paradoxical way. Not only does it serve to build a sense of commonality, solidarity and a shared purpose between the zines, but this very sign for stability and unity provides no fixed meaning. Sisterhood opens itself up as a rallying point for contestation, for the redescription and renegotiation of its very meaning. In this article, therefore, I examine how, in this particular zine community, the signifier of Sisterhood came to serve as what political theorist Ernesto Laclau has named an ‘empty signifier’, that is, as a ‘surface of inscription’ for a number of disparate – and sometimes contradictory – political ideas and feminist demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350506811434871">Laclau, 1996</xref>: 36–46; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1350506811434871">2000</xref>: 303; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1350506811434871">2005</xref>: 130; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350506811434871">Gunnarsson Payne, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to develop a fuller understanding of this process it is, however, necessary to break with commonly reproduced feminist chronologies that tell the story of feminism as one simply moving ‘from a preoccupation with unity and sameness, through identity and diversity, and on to difference and fragmentation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1350506811434871">Hemmings, 2005</xref>; 115–116; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350506811434871">Dean, 2009</xref>). The work of contextualizing the Swedish feminist zine community is thus carried here out in tandem with a critique of oft-told generational narratives that accentuate the differences between ‘the mothers of the second wave and daughters of the third’.</p>

<title>In-between the ‘waves’: The Swedish feminist zine community</title>
<p>Although relatively unknown to a more general public, the previous two decades have witnessed what some have referred to as ‘the grrrl zine revolution’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350506811434871">Green and Taormino, 1997</xref>: xxi). With the rise of the Riot Grrrl movement, originating in the US in the early 1990s, there followed a vast increase in young girls and women – especially in the Anglo-Saxon context, but also internationally – engaging in the production of zines: small non- or anti-commercial DIY publications which are usually produced and distributed by a small editorial collective or a single person. Grrrl zines cover a wide range of topics, such as love, sex and sexualities; sexual violence; menstruation; self-harm, body image and eating disorders; music, media and culture; radical politics; and animals rights (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350506811434871">Harris, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350506811434871">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1350506811434871">Kearney, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1350506811434871">Schilt and Zobl, 2008</xref>). With its easily available and inexpensive media techniques (typing, hand-writing, collages, as well as the more recent technologies such as desktop publishing) the genre of zine writing lends itself to those belonging to marginalized groups and social movements. As such, it has often served as a platform for the production of oppositional discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350506811434871">Gunnarsson Payne, 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1350506811434871">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The transnational grrrl zine network is commonly framed as a movement which continues to address some long-established (and ‘characteristically’) ‘second wave’ feminist concerns, such as sexual violence, lesbianism and male homosociality. But it has also added issues previously dismissed as not being feminist political demands, such as queer and trans-politics and modes of identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1350506811434871">Kearney, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350506811434871">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1350506811434871">Leonard, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1350506811434871">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350506811434871">Rosenberg and Garofalo, 1998</xref>). As such, these new feminist articulations have not been entirely consistent with the demands raised by the so-called second wave of feminism. Indeed, antagonisms and tensions between these two strands of feminism can even be said to be characteristic of much contemporary feminist debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350506811434871">Henry, 2004</xref>). While the second wave agenda has been criticized for its universalist and identitarian variant of political militancy, third wave feminist political mobilizations have often been accused of lacking any substantial agenda for social change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1350506811434871">Siegel, 2007</xref>: 150–151; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1350506811434871">Hemmings, 2005</xref>), on point of fact of its specious individualism and preponderant concern with merely lifestyle-oriented issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1350506811434871">Pilcher and Whelehan, 2004</xref>: 171). Recurrently, this tension is often represented as an intergenerational conflict between the ‘mothers’ of the second wave and their ‘daughters’ of the third, implying a rather rigid connection between age cohort and politics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350506811434871">Henry, 2004</xref>). This generational narrative has been further emphasized by the respective ways of self-labelling within the movement(s); ‘Grrrl’ being in part a denouncement of the prototypically ‘second wave’ label ‘Womyn’ – and the more recent ‘Lady’ as a way of rearticulating the feminist subject of the third wave as a more ‘grown up’ political agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1350506811434871">Schilt and Zobl, 2008</xref>: 176). Although this intergenerational tension is not without reference to ‘actual’ happenings and debates within the feminist movement(s), I would argue that these tensions are not reducible to generational differences. On the contrary, this framework has proven inadequate to deal with certain specificities about the Swedish feminist zine community, where questions of antagonism internal to particular political mobilizations obviate <italic>intra</italic>generational and not intergenerational tensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350506811434871">Gunnarsson Payne, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although feminist zines have circulated internationally since the early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350506811434871">Chidgey, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350506811434871">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350506811434871">Duncombe, 1997</xref>: 69; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1350506811434871">Kearney, 1997</xref>: 207–229; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1350506811434871">Piepmeier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1350506811434871">Schilt and Zobl, 2008</xref>: 172–176), the Swedish feminist zine community only began to flourish a few years later. Most explicitly influenced by Riot Grrrls was the editorial collective behind <italic>Amazon</italic> (first published in 1997). By the early 2000s the titles <italic>Killed by Beauty</italic> and <italic>(r)Agata</italic> also expressed to a certain extent a commitment to this movement. Titles such as <italic>Radarka, Lilith</italic> and <italic>Bleck</italic>, however, mainly referred to other sources of inspiration and only retroactively came to recognize themselves as belonging to a specific zine genre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350506811434871">Gunnarsson Payne, 2006</xref>). As such, the genealogy of what over the next few years grew into a principally national, feminist zine community, with its partly distinctive characteristics and debates, can neither be reduced to, nor understood as entirely separate from, the context of the larger and more thoroughly documented transnational (predominantly English-language) grrrl zine network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350506811434871">Chidgey, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350506811434871">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1350506811434871">Kearney, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350506811434871">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1350506811434871">Leonard, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1350506811434871">Schilt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1350506811434871">Schilt and Zobl, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1350506811434871">Zobl, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1350506811434871">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>From feminist waves to sexual logics: Beyond feminist anachronisms</title>
<p>In the Anglo-American context, the notion of Sisterhood is generally regarded as an archetypal ‘second wave’ phenomenon. For example, in the article ‘Whatever happened to Sisterhood?’, published on British feminist ezine <italic>The F-Word</italic>, Kristine Aune describes Sisterhood as a somewhat ‘lost virtue’ of feminism – one which was ‘crucial for the second wave (1970s) feminism’, but that regrettably ended with the collapse of the visible and strong feminist grassroots activism of the women’s liberation era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350506811434871">Aune, 2003</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350506811434871">Dean, 2010</xref>). Similarly, in her study of generational narratives in the North American feminist movement, Astrid Henry has convincingly argued that the growth of so-called third wave feminism in the North American context was heavily shaped around processes of disidentification with the previous age cohort of feminists – or the ‘mothers’ of the second wave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350506811434871">Henry, 2004</xref>: 7; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350506811434871">Butler, 1993</xref>: 112; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350506811434871">Fuss, 1995</xref>: 7). While this process of disidentification in part involves an acknowledgement of the advances made by previous generations of feminists, it also involved the construction of a simplified ‘ideal type’ of the ‘second waver’, a ‘straw-woman’ which has come to represent a ‘dowdy’, white, middle-class and anti-sex feminism – a feminist stereotype easily disavowed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350506811434871">Henry, 2004</xref>: 124). Part of this particular articulation of second wave feminism, which in the Anglo-Saxon context afforded a younger generation of feminists a place from which to speak, also involved a construction of new feminist family metaphors. The previously dominant unifying signifier of Sisterhood was now replaced with the notion of ‘daughterhood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350506811434871">Henry, 2004</xref>: 10).</p>
<p>It is important to acknowledge that this ‘matrilinear narrative’, however, follows rather specific and nationally bound chronologies. Feminist activist and academic Agneiszka Graff has already emphasized its problematic transposition onto a post-socialist and Catholic politico-cultural context such as Poland, for example, where ‘no generation of feminist “mothers” exists for self-proclaimed third wavers to rebel against’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350506811434871">Graff, 2007</xref>: 142). Although Graff concedes that there is some explanatory relevance in talking about Polish feminists’ use of third wave tactics in their struggle for issues such as reproductive rights – a feminist priority which in the Anglo-American context has been firmly associated with second wave feminism – her essay also demonstrates the shortcomings of applying the wave metaphor to the Polish feminist context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350506811434871">Graff, 2007</xref>: 152).</p>
<p>Similarly, the generational narrative does not offer a perfect fit for the analysis of Swedish contemporary feminist practices, in which the mother–daughter narrative has not been as prevalent as it has in the Anglo-American debates, nor has the metaphor of the ‘third wave’ been such a dominant trope for contemporary feminist self-identification. Instead, the Swedish counterpart – if one can speak of such a thing – to the ‘third wave’ would, during the years of this study, be ‘queer feminism’. And while the latter to a great extent does overlap with many prototypically ‘third wave’ practices and modes of identification, the absence of generational connotations seems to have made possible ‘new’ feminist identifications which do not necessitate the renunciation of Sisterhood about which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350506811434871">Henry (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350506811434871">Aune (2003)</xref> and others have spoken. Hence, although one can speak of a certain family resemblance – in Wittgenstein’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1350506811434871">1967</xref>: §67) meaning of the term – between contemporary feminist practices and modes of identification, their respective use of family metaphors are certainly at variance. As such, it is incumbent upon me here to resist using any worn-out tropes of ‘mothers of the second wave’ and ‘daughters of the third’ – or the theoretical analogues, which would caricature the respective movements as expressive of the difference between ‘essentialism’ and ‘constructivism’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1350506811434871">Hemmings, 2005</xref>). What is called for is a more flexible analysis of feminist movements, their activism and modes of identification. This I hope can be achieved with the introduction of what I propose to name, ‘sexual logics’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1350506811434871">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>By logic I mean, again following Laclau, ‘a kind of relation linking different discursive elements and thereby [which] serves as a <italic>condition of possibility for the operation of a particular system of rules</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1350506811434871">2000</xref>: 283–283; emphasis added). As such, the discourse theoretical notion of logics aims to explain ‘the purposes, rules, and ontological presuppositions that render a practice or regime possible, intelligible, and vulnerable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350506811434871">Glynos and Howarth, 2007</xref>: 2). As I hope to make clear, my reading of this concept entails first and foremost the <italic>ontological presuppositions</italic> of certain speech acts, practices and regimes of discourse. In my empirical analysis, the notion of sexual logics is used primarily to understand the different ways in which the zines inscribe their respective understandings of the subject of feminism onto the surface that the signifier of Sisterhood provides.</p>
<p>I begin to operationalize this idea by introducing three predominant sexual logics<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1350506811434871">6</xref></sup> governing the various articulations of Sisterhood in the Swedish feminist zine community, namely the <italic>logic of sexual sameness, the logic of sexual dualism</italic> and <italic>the logic of sexual transgression</italic> – each building on different and distinctive ontological premises.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1350506811434871">7</xref></sup> Although the genealogical beginnings of each logic can, to a certain extent, be located in specific historical and sociocultural contexts (within or outside the feminist movement itself), the notion of a sexual logic is an attempt to capture how these ontological presuppositions are sedimented, reactivated or rearticulated also in times, places and political situations which differ radically from the milieu in which they are first thought to have originated. The choice of privileging the category of ‘sex’ in this analysis is, however, <italic>neither</italic> because other analytical categories (such as ‘race’, ‘sexuality’, ‘class’, ‘religion’, etc.) are of less importance for the theorization of the political practices of feminism, <italic>nor</italic> because attention was not paid to these issues within the different zines under study – but because Sisterhood, when thought of as an ‘empty signifier’, is an <italic>inherently</italic> ‘sexed’ category. As such, ‘sex’ served as the ‘least common denominator’ for the ways in which the zines were determining the ‘subject of feminism’ (as ‘class’ has traditionally done for Marxism, or ‘race’ for the civil rights movement, etc.).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1350506811434871">8</xref></sup> Considering the privileged status the category of ‘sex’ has for the production of feminist discourse, I argue that it is sexual logics that constitute the very condition of possibility for <italic>any</italic> articulation of Sisterhood. As such, it is important to make an analytical distinction between the quasi-transcendental level of analysis (on the level of logics and the construction of Sisterhood as an empty signifier) and empirical analyses of manifestations of ‘sistering’ (concrete mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion in particular feminist groups or practices).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1350506811434871">9</xref></sup> Thus, these logics are analytical constructions which are <italic>not</italic> (unlike notions of feminist generations or waves) trying to characterize an entire feminist discourse or practice, but rather, to ‘capture the various conditions that make that practice “work” or “tick” ’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350506811434871">Glynos and Howarth, 2007</xref>: 2).</p>
<p>For example, and overlapping with (but not identical to) commonly repeated notions of feminist waves as well as Julia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1350506811434871">Kristeva’s (1981)</xref> canonical account of three feminist generations, the logic of sexual sameness has generally, but not exclusively so, served as the condition of possibility for more liberal strands of feminism and gender equality projects; the logic of sexual dualism is the prototypical presupposition of radical and cultural feminist practices; and the logic of sexual transgression is commonly associated as the ontological premise for more contemporary feminist practices such as Riot Grrrl and queer feminism. My proposed framework of sexual logics, however, makes possible an analysis of how such logics coexist alongside each other within a single generation, movement, group, publication, or even a single conversation. Although the limited space of this article cannot do justice to the complex intersections of such logics, its aim is to go some way in demonstrating how ‘a theory of sexual logics’ might help us avoid the pitfalls associated with the application of the generational feminist narrative to national contexts which, while sharing some traits with their Anglo-Saxon counterparts, cannot be said to simply reproduce their story in a different geopolitical setting.</p>
<p>I now turn to the imaginarization of a feminist Sisterhood in the Swedish zine community. Here it is important to understand that while, on the one hand, the appropriation of the insignia of Sisterhood is indebted to the women’s liberation movement of the 1970s, on the other hand it should not be inferred that the way in which Sisterhood operated in the Swedish zine community was a mere replica of its previous definitions. As has been convincingly argued, for example, from the point of view of black feminism and intersectional approaches to feminism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350506811434871">Anthias and Yuval-Davies, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350506811434871">Hill Collins, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350506811434871">hooks, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350506811434871">Mohanty, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1350506811434871">Thornton Dill, 1983</xref>), previous appeals to Sisterhood have ‘forged widespread unity . . . by attributing a set of common interests to women – interests shaped by an allegedly shared experience of oppression’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1350506811434871">Lyshaug, 2006</xref>: 78), thereby constructing a false universality as a foundation for feminist struggle at the expense of particular experiences, perspectives and interests of, for example, women of colour, ‘third world’ feminists, working-class women and lesbian women. Despite the importance of taking these valid criticisms into account, however, I would argue that it is important not to hypostasize such critiques as an intrinsic feature of the notion of Sisterhood per se, but to investigate instead, through systematic empirical analyses, the various ways in which the signifier of Sisterhood has come to function in different feminist contexts. It should not be forgotten that the particular way in which such debates appear in a given feminist community is contextually overdetermined.</p>

<title>What is a woman? Who is a sister? Sexual logics and the subject of feminism</title>
<p>It is worth noticing that, unlike many Anglo-Saxon ‘third wavers’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350506811434871">Henry, 2004</xref>), the majority of the Swedish feminist zinesters were – albeit to a greater or lesser degree – at some point during their publishing activities explicitly inspired by radical feminist ideas. Therefore, instead of serving as a figure for disidentification, radical feminism in this context had a more positively productive function – also among feminists who did not necessarily share some of its most fundamental premises (such as the aforementioned appeal to universality). It did, however, provide the zine community with a heritage, with a sense of shared history and a common frame of reference, making visible thereby a certain family resemblance between publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1350506811434871">Wittgenstein, 1967</xref>: §67).</p>
<p>Queer feminist zine <italic>(r)Agata</italic>, for example, explicitly drew inspiration from earlier radical feminist practice. Quoting and commenting on a movement text produced about a feminist camp in Sweden in 1976, <italic>(r)Agata</italic> initiates a discussion on renewing the principle of Sisterhood:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>For us, sisterhood meant that we, despite many differences, had a lot in common because we are all women. We knew women often have a negative attitude towards one another; jealousy and rivalry we already knew, but we would now try to learn Sisterhood. (Organizers of the feminist camp Källingölägret, Fårö, Sweden, 1976, quoted in (<italic>(r)Agata</italic> #2)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1350506811434871">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Women have something in common; we are living under the same oppression. Even if the oppression is not as strong in all areas of society, we must, all women, still get together and fight against the oppression as a group. We have to show solidarity to one another and resist, together. That is what is called Sisterhood, and which could be regarded as obvious. (<italic>(r)Agata</italic> #2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In posing the question: ‘Whatever happened to “Sisterhood gives strength”?’ <italic>(r)Agata</italic> begins its active search for a lost feminist virtue. But far from this loss evoking feelings of melancholia, it instead places a responsibility on young feminists to actively re-engender the principle of Sisterhood.</p>
<p>A second zine, <italic>Radarka</italic> (the most unequivocal in its affirmation of radical feminism), articulates a notion of Sisterhood in similar terms to <italic>(r)Agata</italic>, namely as a form of political friendship and solidarity between women that functions as an ‘antidote’ to male homosociality (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1350506811434871">Holmberg, 1995</xref>: 26):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Sisterhood is about . . . prioritizing women and relationships with them. One moves her availability from the men to the women. One part of the subordination is about us being available to men. . . . When us girls begin to come together to influence politically or in personal relationships (needless to say, one does not exclude the other) men lose part of their control over us. That is one of the political points of sisterhood. (<italic>Radarka</italic> #2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These two articulations of Sisterhood both seem to rest on the radical feminist idea of <italic>woman-identification</italic>, an idea which was originally articulated by the US collective Radicalesbians in 1970 – and which also gained strong resonance in the Swedish movement at the time in well-known feminist collectives such as Grupp 8 (<italic>Group 8</italic>) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1350506811434871">Schmitz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1350506811434871">Witt-Brattström, 2010</xref>). What will soon become clear, however, is that despite the apparent similarity, <italic>Radarka</italic>’s and <italic>(r)Agata</italic>’s respective attachments to the radical feminist heritage of Sisterhood operated on radically different foundations concerning whom ought to be included as a ‘sister’.</p>
<p>So as to give a level of formality to this difference, I describe four zines that stage a three-fold logical distinction: first, <italic>Radarka</italic>’s idea of Sisterhood as operating within the bounds of a ‘logic of sexual dualism’; second, <italic>(r)Agata</italic>’s and <italic>Amazon</italic>’s understanding of Sisterhood as functioning within a ‘logic of sexual transgression’, and finally, a ‘logic of sexual sameness’ present in the zine <italic>Killed by Beauty.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1350506811434871">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In what does this logical difference consist? First the ‘logic of sexual dualism’. <italic>Radarka</italic>’s Sisterhood is constituted through a strict dichotomization between ‘male’ and ‘female’ which is manifested not least in terms of their uncompromisingly separatist political practices. Over its six years in publication, <italic>Radarka</italic> developed into a ‘women-only space’. With doubtless a sense of pride, it declared itself as <italic>the</italic> only feminist separatist magazine in Northern Europe. The obvious upshot was that only women were invited to take part in its production (writing, editing), and women were represented in and by the zine, and women-only were allowed to subscribe to – or even read – <italic>Radarka</italic>. For them, ‘men’ must be excluded from the feminist movement and cannot self-label as feminists; this being due to their radically different experiences of growing up in a patriarchal society:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Guys have no right to call themselves ‘feminists’, since they do not have any experience of being oppressed as a girl, and it is the personal experiences we have of the oppression of [boys and men] that constitutes the foundation of feminism. At least, this is the radical feminist foundation. (<italic>Radarka</italic> #5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Significantly, <italic>Radarka</italic>’s formulation of ‘the enemy of feminism’ becomes embodied by ‘born men’, a figure which comes to serve as representative for Patriarchy, the constitutive outside Sisterhood (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1350506811434871">Mouffe, 2000</xref>: 12). Also this particular way of constructing a feminist political identity (against the ‘patriarchal threat’) is commonly traced back to the radical feminist movement of the 1970s. Millet, for example, was to think the idea of universal patriarchy as <italic>Herrschaft</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350506811434871">Millet, 2000 [1970]</xref>: 31), a regime which produces societal structures on the basis of the oppression of women (whence the unequal division of labour and the constitutive inequality of sexual relationships). Patriarchy, then, is a ‘birthright priority [in which] males rule females’. It is a form of ‘interior colonization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350506811434871">Millet, 2000 [1970]</xref>: 25), which is upheld by socialization, and which differs radically for the male and the female child. Male and female, man and woman are seen as ‘two cultures and their life experiences are utterly different’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350506811434871">Millet, 2000 [1970]</xref>: 31). Breaking free from Patriarchy, then, means in the first instance breaking free from her own internalized ‘values of the colonizer’ (‘man’) and stopping ‘actively participating in carrying out the colonization’ of herself and her sex as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350506811434871">Barry, 1979</xref>: 172, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1350506811434871">Rich, 1980</xref>: 646). Only on these two preconditions will woman become a truly woman-identified woman. Significantly, woman-identification should not be understood merely as a denunciation of ‘the masculine’, but also as a rejection of ‘the feminine’ – which is conceived of as a ‘male given’ and inauthentic female identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1350506811434871">Radicalesbians, 1970</xref>). It is against this backdrop <italic>Radarka</italic>’s following statement should be read:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Just because a man cuts off his dick and takes hormones and develops breasts, it does <italic>not</italic> make him a woman. . . . T/S-‘women’ are <italic>not</italic> women, since they are not raised and socialized to be [women]. Additionally, they are not born women. T/S-‘women’ are men! . . . Sex is something we are born with and nothing we can choose. (<italic>Radarka</italic> #4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The rigidity of this difference clears the stage of its ambiguous actors. Between the opposition of Sisterhood and Patriarchy, a number of limit cases have to be assigned a certain place in relation to this frontier. In the case of <italic>Radarka</italic> transwomen cannot be placeholders for woman-identification. The corollary is direct in its simplicity: in <italic>Radarka</italic>, a born ‘man’ can never become a ‘woman’. This perceived immobility <italic>between</italic> genders is characteristic of the logic of sexual dualism. And this logical ‘hypo-stasis’ has obvious political effects. For while the politics of <italic>Radarka</italic> certainly promotes a changed female subject as the result of political engagement, the change a woman is said to undergo during this process is relative to the stability of an unchanging essence of what it means to be a woman, itself beyond political transformation. <italic>Radarka</italic> engages in the practices of ‘consciousness raising’, of ‘demystification’ and ‘denunciation’. It is a politics that is a kind of ‘policing of the enunciated’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1350506811434871">Rancière, 1999</xref>), a manning of the borders, where the transgressing of the well-ordered gender division requires political disciplining. This logic of sexual dualism, within which <italic>Radarka</italic> operates, must now be juxtaposed with an alternative logical terrain. I intend now to move to the logic of sexual transgression, and the feminist zines <italic>(r)Agata</italic> and <italic>Amazon</italic> which both can be said to operate within it, and its impacts on mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion of Sisterhood.</p>
<p>In 2000, the same year as <italic>Radarka</italic> published its views on the necessary limits of women-identification, <italic>Amazon</italic> – a zine which was also produced in Umeå, the same town as <italic>Radarka</italic> – expressed something which while not explicitly directed as a response to <italic>Radarka</italic>, might well have been. While <italic>Radarka</italic> had expressed that they ‘have nothing in common with drag queens, gays, “transsexuals”, S/M-people and butch/femme-girls, because they are not feminists’ (<italic>Radarka</italic> #4), <italic>Amazon</italic> was to publish the opposite standpoint. Contra <italic>Radarka</italic>, which regarded various gender queer identities as a patriarchal threat to feminism, <italic>Amazon</italic> embraced the ‘subversive’ potential of these identities:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Trannies, sissies, transsexuals, butches, androgynies and other gender benders are provoking because they are undermining the very foundations for the hetero-patriarchal society. The gender benders make visible the fact that ‘femininity’ and ‘masculinity’ cannot be controlled by our genes, but are role play without scripts, that are possible to copy and make parody of. People that are preying upon and moving the sex/gender-boundaries cannot be said to strengthen dominating preconceptions and stereotypes of gender, but rather to break them. (<italic>Amazon</italic> #6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For <italic>Amazon</italic> the transformation into a feminist subject does not presuppose an ‘originally’ or ‘born’ female subject which needs to rid herself of ‘male-identification’ in favour of a more authentic, revolutionary, female self. Instead of resting on a firm foundation and strong certainty of <italic>who</italic> can be included in Sisterhood, <italic>Amazon’s</italic> ontological presuppositions of ‘sex’ rests on ‘contingent foundations’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350506811434871">Butler, 1994</xref>), on an explicit and wanted uncertainty of who is a woman, or what a woman ‘is’. While for <italic>Radarka</italic> such a certainty is required for the possibility of a feminist politics – <italic>Amazon</italic> works with quite the opposite presupposition. The boundaries of inclusion/exclusion of <italic>Amazon</italic>’s Sisterhood are not organized around the logic of sexual dualism, but instead around a logic of sexual transgression according to which <italic>all</italic> gendered identities are regarded as sociocultural constructions – and sexual dualisms as the very prime target for feminist political struggle. As a result, what is for <italic>Radarka</italic> seen as a necessary precondition for feminist political struggle, is for <italic>Amazon</italic> regarded as an obstacle for any progressive gender politics.</p>
<p>A similar logic is operative in <italic>(r)Agata</italic>: only in the subversion of the dichotomy itself is there the potential for social change. The implication being that all dualisms based on essentialist notions of ‘sex’ must be a prime target for a feminist politics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350506811434871">Butler, 1999 [1990]</xref>: 5). This becomes quite clear when this particular zine collective vehemently criticizes the Michigan’s Womyn’s Music festival for their ‘womyn born womyn’ policy – a policy which excluded male-to-female transwomen from attending (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350506811434871">Ekins and King, 2006</xref>: 205). This is a concrete manifestation of a clash between a feminist politics organized around the logic of sexual transgression and the logic of sexual dualism supposed in feminist separatist events. Contrary to the logic of sexual dualism, according to which politics is as much about maintaining the well-ordered distribution of sexuated bodies between two possible standpoints as it is about effectuating an overturning of the patriarchal system of relations, the logic of sexual transgression inculcates a politics of dispersal, according to which it is the subversion of the gender division itself that constitutes the political act.</p>
<p>Thus far a quite straightforward opposition has been shown to be operative within recent feminist political mobilizations in the context of the Swedish zine community. Yet this would still offer only an incomplete insight. In addition to the presence of a ‘logic of sexual dualism’ and a ‘logic of sexual transgression’ operating, there is a further logic to be engaged with: a ‘logic of sexual sameness’. Zines such as <italic>Killed by Beauty</italic> argue that Sisterhood should not only include ‘born women’ or (in the case of <italic>Amazon</italic> and <italic>(r)Agata</italic>) any being that ‘becomes a woman’, but men as well as women (irrespective of the sex which they had been assigned by birth). The true meaning of Sisterhood cannot be achieved through excluding men from the feminist struggle. To say otherwise would entail complicity with the very same gender system that is the targeted object of feminist struggle:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We in KBB hold the opinion that also men can be feminists – contrary to many other feminist zines. Saying that they can’t is the same thing as saying that us whites can’t struggle against racism, because we’re not black. (<italic>Killed by Beauty</italic> #2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Killed by Beauty</italic>’s articulation of Sisterhood is first and foremost egalitarian – no one who wishes to take part in the feminist struggle should be excluded from participating, male or female. The Sisterhood articulated by <italic>Killed by Beauty</italic>, then, is articulated with a logic of sexual sameness.</p>
<p>As a logical consequence, their feminist strategy <italic>par excellence</italic> is to be ‘gender blind’; and it is only by emphasizing ‘equality as sameness’ that the feminist movement discovers the authentic meaning of the slogan ‘Sisterhood Gives Strength’:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We do not check what sex a person happens to have, but cooperate, we believe in the true ‘Sisterhood Gives Strength’-theory and will not bash anyone. If you are working to make things equal in this country, we say THANKS! . . . Can we just not stop dividing everything into male and female and realize that we are all the same species. Homo sapiens. And all struggle for a society for everyone. Where everyone has the right to decide? Be happy that someone wants to, instead of only focusing on the genitals of that person. (<italic>Killed by Beauty</italic> #2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As part of their egalitarian politics, the very idea of transgressing binary oppositions of ‘sex’ becomes obsolete. If ‘everyone is equal’ – then no political subject is to be privileged. Instead, the focus is not on changing subjectivities, but on letting everyone be ‘themselves’ in the name of an all inclusive humanism. The ‘oppressive regime’, from this point of view, becomes neither Patriarchy nor ‘dualistic accounts of gender’, but rather any regime that impedes on ‘free choice’ and expression of individual personality (as long as it does not hurt anybody else). Feminism is expressed as an ideology that should allow everyone to ‘be as they want to be’ rather than ‘playing police and setting up rules for what individual feminists should think’ (<italic>Killed by Beauty</italic> #2). As such, <italic>Killed by Beauty</italic>’s articulation of Sisterhood claims to speak for ‘everyone’, not based on their assigned or self-identified gender identity, but everyone who, in one way or other, identifies with the struggle for gender equality and the ending of gendered oppression.</p>
<p>Considering the incompatibility of these three logics, and the antagonistic debates they have given rise to within the zine community, it should be noted that this did <italic>not</italic> (as perhaps would be expected) lead to a complete upheaval or ‘collapse’ of this community. On the contrary, acts of ‘sistering’ were constantly carried out between them, most notably manifested in the practices of repeatedly promoting one another, publishing interviews with each other, reviewing each other and advertising for each other – all in the name of Sisterhood. Significantly, such acts of ‘sistering’ took place also in cases where the ideological schisms seemed to be completely insurmountable (as in the case with <italic>Radarka</italic> and <italic>Amazon</italic>) and also during periods of intense ideological conflict between different zines – even when the conflict regarded the very form and content of Sisterhood itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350506811434871">Gunnarsson Payne, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>The collapses and resurgences of Sisterhood: Why feminism needs empty signifiers</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In recent years Sisterhood as slogan, motto, rallying cry no longer evokes the spirit of unity. Some feminists now seem to feel that unity between women is impossible given our differences. Abandoning the idea of Sisterhood as an expression of political solidarity weakens and diminishes feminist movement. Solidarity strengthens resistance struggle. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350506811434871">hooks, 1986</xref>: 127)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While, as the initial remarks of this article implied, Sisterhood has often been deemed obsolete, failed, or collapsed, it certainly seems to be a feminist heritage of which many feminists find it hard to dispose altogether. This is evidenced not least by feminist texts such as Kristine Aune’s aforementioned text and the continuous recurrence of feminist publications and websites that bear its name – as well as its revival within the feminist zine community in the late 1990s and 2000s. Therefore, while the specific articulation of Sisterhood made by the western women’s liberation movement of the 1970s may well have ‘collapsed’ in favour of increased diversification and greater awareness of the exclusionary effects of universalist feminist ideals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350506811434871">Dixon, 1977</xref>), the very signifier of Sisterhood does not seem to have entirely lost its political force for feminist activism. On the contrary, in the case of the Swedish feminist zine community, Sisterhood has proven its potential by functioning as a unifying signifier for a range of disparate and sometimes internally contradictory ideas of which subjects Sisterhood ought to include and represent. In this sense, Sisterhood has become an ‘empty signifier’, that is, a unifying as well as internally contested signifier that serves as a surface of inscription for not one version of feminism, but several – as here represented by <italic>Radarka, (r)Agata, Amazon</italic> and <italic>Killed by Beauty</italic>.</p>
<p>Taken together, these zines disclose something of the interior differentiation of what is nominally a nationally determined zine community. In admittedly a cursory manner, I have sought to capture something of what divides them under three formal logics, each of which reveals significant divergences in the way in which limits are imposed on the inclusivity of who counts as a ‘sister’. And yet, this analytic of sexual logics should not come at the expense of the way in which a community as such (composed of heterogeneous and fractious elements) is possible. This rearticulation and extension of the meaning of Sisterhood is, therefore, <italic>not</italic> to be regarded simply as a radical break with its radical feminist and universalist ‘origins’, but rather as a contingent consequence of a tension between different and sometimes contradictory sexual logics – a tension which has proven constitutive of the production of feminist discourse itself.</p>
<p>The universalist heritage of Sisterhood as collective identification and ideal is not itself an element of any one logic, but is trans-logical; the very intra-feminist struggle that has been demonstrated in this article concerns the question of who ‘counts’ as ‘sister’, and by extension as a struggle for the very mechanisms of inclusion by which Sisterhood is to become ‘truly universal’. Therefore, the universalist claim of Sisterhood is precisely what makes possible in its name an enchainment of demands between feminist groups, and what opens up feminism to future possibilities; it is, in this sense an ‘empty universality’ that has the potential to serve for the encompassing of further demands which have previously not been acknowledged as part of the feminist struggle (e.g. queer-, trans- and intersex related issues). Significantly, and as the many criticisms expressed against the universalist idea of Sisterhood have indicated, such a fullness is however ultimately unachievable. Like any other empty signifier, Sisterhood always shows itself precisely ‘through the presence of its absence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350506811434871">Laclau, 1996</xref>: 53), and it is from this ever-present absence that it constitutes its political potency and for continuous calls for further inclusions to be made in its name.</p>
<p>Feminism, like any other political movement, <italic>needs</italic> to be organized around empty signifiers in order to construct a ‘united front’ against an oppressive regime – even when there is no full consensus within the movement about the exact definition of either the movement itself or its political targets. Of course, feminist and women’s issues have continuously been brought to the fore even after the so-called ‘collapse of Sisterhood’. Indeed, other empty signifiers (‘third wave’, ‘gender equality’, ‘Riot Grrrl’, ‘queer’) have come to play a similar unifying function in various particular manifestations of feminist activism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350506811434871">Dean, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350506811434871">2010</xref>). However, recent melancholic expressions of Sisterhood as a ‘lost virtue of feminism’ may indicate that to this day there is no other signifier that has quite managed to take its place. And perhaps it is precisely this current lack of a more all encompassing empty signifier that the more contemporary feminist resurgences of Sisterhood are symptoms of. After all, to once again borrow an expression from the work of bell hooks: ‘There can be no mass-based feminist movement to end sexist oppression without a united front’ (1986: 127).</p>

<p>The content and argument of this article is partially based on my PhD thesis entitled <italic>Systerskapets logiker: En etnologisk studie av feministiska fanzines</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350506811434871">Gunnarsson Payne, 2006</xref>). The material used for the study consists in its entirety of complete or nearly complete publication 13 different titles of Swedish feminist zines, all published between 1997 and 2003. It should be noted, however, that Sisterhood also after this period has continued to serve as an ‘empty signifier’ in Swedish feminist zines. To give but one example, the currently active queer feminist comic writer’s collective Dotterbolaget explicitly describe their separatist and trans-inclusive activities (zine making, workshops, etc.) as guided by the principle of sisterhood.</p></fn>

<p>Prior to the publication of feminist zines, zines had been mainly circulating within male-dominated subcultures, such as football fandom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1350506811434871">Haynes, 1995</xref>), science fiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1350506811434871">Jenkins, 1992</xref>) and punk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350506811434871">Duncombe, 1997</xref>). Two particularly strong strands in the genealogy of feminist zines can, however, be traced back to the cultural production of the bulletins and newsletters of the women’s liberation movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s, as well as to the anarchic and idiosyncratic modes of expression and radical bricolages of the punk zines which flourished in the 1980s.</p></fn>

<p>Although the recent expansion of studies of various zine cultures serves crucial purposes in documenting this otherwise marginalized genre, the lack of systematic studies of zines from other language regions risks contributing to an oversimplified understanding of existing zine cultures, as well as an overemphasis on its transnational affiliations – affiliations which are often made possible only by the use of the English language. Moreover, as so-called grrrl zines often are regarded as prototypical expressions of so-called third wave feminism, the predominance of studies of English-language feminist zines risks reproducing a rather biased account of contemporary feminist media production. As Elke Zobl has recently pointed out, however, that while we know far more about English-language zines, zines from other language regions are slowly ‘finding recognition on an international level’. The commonly used term ‘grrrl zines’ (e.g. ‘the Grrrl zine network’, ‘the Grrrl zine revolution’) reflects this scholarly bias towards the Anglo-Saxon context. In Germany and Spain, for example, these media products have sometimes been labelled ‘femzines’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1350506811434871">Zobl, 2009</xref>: 7). The most commonly used terms in the Swedish contexts are ‘feminist zines’ and ‘feminist fanzines’ (<italic>feministiska zines</italic>, or <italic>feministiska fanzines</italic> in Swedish).</p></fn>

<p>In my formulation of the notion of sexual logics, I am drawing heavily on and reworking the discourse theoretical formulation of ‘logics’ as formulated by Ernesto Laclau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350506811434871">1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1350506811434871">2005</xref>), as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350506811434871">Jason Glynos and David Howarth (2007)</xref> in the context of feminist and gender studies.

My argument against the former is that the concept of ‘gender’ itself rests on the presupposition that sexual difference is wholly or partly culturally constructed – a presupposition that might, or might not, be implicit in the logic(s) under investigation. As such, instead of widening the logical possibilities internal to an analytic of feminism, a notion of ‘gender logics’ would narrow the scope for thinking (in this case) feminist variants. ‘Sex’ as a category, notwithstanding the criticisms levelled at this category, operates at a more primitive level from which the category of gender derives its political force. The concept of ‘feminist logics’ (as used in my own previous work) is simply inappropriate as it might falsely imply that these logics are <italic>necessarily specific</italic> to the feminist movement, when as a matter of fact, some of them underlie also other movements, discourses, practices or regimes.</p></fn>

<p>Importantly, these three feminist logics have been ‘discovered’ and named by way of a retroductive process and thereby correspond to what I have been able to locate in my specific empirical material. Importantly, one can also imagine the occurrence of a <italic>logic of sexual nihil</italic> as in the case with androgyny (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350506811434871">Ekins and King, 2006</xref>) and a <italic>logic of sexual multiplicity</italic> as in the case with certain discourses on intersexualism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350506811434871">Fausto-Sterling, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350506811434871">2000</xref>), even if these logics have not been present in any of the zines I have studied.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-1350506811434871">
<label>8.</label>
<p>This is not to say that such analytical categories have not played a significant part in various practices of ‘sistering’ within feminist movements, but it is important to note that this concerns a different level of analysis. To give an example, the overrepresentations of white women that indeed did occur in these zines can certainly be seen as biased, but they do <italic>not</italic> mean that the zines did not regard ‘women of colour’ as ‘subjects of feminism’, i.e. subjects for whom feminism <italic>ought</italic> not speak (as, we shall see, in the case of <italic>Radarka</italic>’s exclusion of transwomen). It should also be noted that, for example, the white and middle-class bias within the movement was regularly and self-critically debated within the zines under study.</p></fn>

<p>This is not to say that also these types of exclusions that have been made in the name of Sisterhood do not deserve meticulous attention. Indeed, this issue has previously been extensively discussed in feminist scholarly literature and still calls for further empirical and theoretical investigation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350506811434871">Anthias and Yuval-Davies, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350506811434871">Dixon, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350506811434871">Hill Collins, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350506811434871">hooks, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1350506811434871">Lyshaug, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350506811434871">Mohanty, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1350506811434871">Thornton Dill, 1983</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>It should be noted that in the early issues of <italic>Radarka</italic> the logic of sexual dualism is articulated with what, for want of a better term, could be called <italic>a logic of anti-anthropocentrism</italic>, explaining practices such as meat eating, animal testing and animal pornography by way of theories of patriarchy, and thereby including also animals as ‘subjects of feminism’ (although not as feminist political agents) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350506811434871">Gunnarsson Payne, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350506811434871">2008</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350506811434871">Adams, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, feminism’s coexistence with other movements calls for further investigation into the construction of hybrid-logics.</p></fn>
