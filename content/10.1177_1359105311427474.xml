<abstract>
<p>Rural-dwelling adults face different health concerns and risks than do adults living in urban areas, with reduced assess to care. Studies examining the associations between anxiety and/or depression and blood pressure have yielded mixed results. This study addressed this by examining the association of these symptoms to blood pressure in men compared to women, and for differing racial groups in a rural population in the western United States. Analyses indicate the association between depression and blood pressure differs by race. Further, depressive symptoms were associated with higher diastolic blood pressure for participants at or above the mean of anxiety.</p>

<p>Rural-dwelling adults face different health concerns and risks than do adults living in urban areas. They are at greater risk for death due to cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, report lower overall physical health, and have more chronic health conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311427474">Eberhardt &amp; Pamuk, 2004</xref>). To date, few studies have examined the influence of depressive and anxious symptoms on indices of cardiovascular health and little is known about how these symptoms may differentially influence men compared to women or participants of differing racial backgrounds. This study aims to address these gaps in the literature.</p>
<p>Rural residents report poorer mental health than urban residents and tend to receive less mental health treatment than urban residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311427474">Fortney, Thill, Zhang, Duan, &amp; Rost, 2001</xref>). Prospective studies of rural residents have found that the prevalence of depression ranges from 8.5% over a 12-month period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311427474">Patten, Stuart, Russell, Maxwell, &amp; Arboleda-Florez, 2003</xref>) to 8.9 percent over a five-year follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105311427474">St. John, Blandford, &amp; Strain, 2009</xref>). Depression is significantly more prevalent in adults living in rural areas (i.e., 6.1%) compared to adults living in urban areas (i.e., 5.2%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311427474">Probst, Laditka, Moore, Harun, &amp; Powell, 2006</xref>), with rates as high as 39% in adults presenting at a rural primary care clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311427474">McCrone et al., 2007</xref>). Anxiety, too, is prevalent in rural residents, with generalized anxiety disorder prevalence as high as 21.9% and panic disorder prevalence as high as 9.5%, though these rates are generally similar to those in urban residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311427474">Marks, Wegelin, Bourgeois, &amp; Perkins, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>There have been inconsistent findings on the relations between depression and blood pressure, which is an important indicator of cardiovascular health. For example, a population-based study of older men found that lower diastolic blood pressure was associated with higher scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311427474">Barrett-Connor &amp; Palinkas, 1994</xref>). A more recent study of older Chinese participants found that both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were negatively related to scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311427474">Ng, Feng, Niti &amp; Yap, 2010</xref>). Additionally, a large cross-sectional community based study of 60,799 Norwegian men and women age 20–89 found a significant relationship between depression and anxiety and low systolic blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311427474">Hildrum et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311427474">Kagree (2008)</xref> found that 19.8% of a South African sample of adults receiving treatment for diabetes or hypertension scored at least in the moderate range on the Beck Depression Inventory. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311427474">Niu et al. (2008)</xref> used self-administered home blood pressure readings in a Japanese cross-sectional study of 888 community dwelling older adults and found no association between depression, as measured by the GDS, and diastolic blood pressure. These inconsistencies in results may reflect different patterns of association as a function of gender or race. For example, it is possible that an inverse association is greater men, thus studies collapsing the genders show no association. It is also possible that unmeasured variables that are strongly associated with health and mortality (e.g., social support) may explain the inconsistency of the existing literature. Given the demonstrated association between social support and many key health variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311427474">Holt-Lunstad, Smith, &amp; Layton, 2010</xref>), it is possible that these mixed findings are due to unmeasured variability in social support.</p>
<p>Longitudinal research has also shown mixed results in terms of the association between depressive symptoms and cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors. One study indicated that depressive symptoms did not predict cardiovascular disease at ten-year follow up or death at 12-year follow up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311427474">Atlantis, Grayson, Browning, Sims, &amp; Kendig, 2011</xref>). In contrast, the authors of a large review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311427474">Paz-Filho, Licinio, &amp; Wong, 2010</xref>) reported that depression is a risk factor for the development and exacerbation of cardiovascular disease. When examining blood pressure specifically, one study indicated that depressive symptoms were associated with small, but not significant, increases in both diastolic and systolic blood pressure, during a two-year follow up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311427474">Delaney et al., 2010</xref>). Another prospective study conducted over 24 years, found that repeated depressive episodes increased risk for hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311427474">Nabi et al., 2011</xref>). Taken together, there is greater support these results suggest that depression is associated with at least a mild increase in risk for cardiovascular disease. As above, it is possible that differences in the participants (e.g., age, racial composition) in the Atlantis et al. study led to the different pattern of findings.</p>
<p>To date, both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies examining the influence of anxiety on blood pressure and cardiovascular disease have also found inconsistent results. Trait anxiety has been associated with hypertension when compared with a control group with normotension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311427474">Garcia-Vera, Sanz, Espinosa, Fortun, &amp; Magan, 2010</xref>) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has also been linked with hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311427474">Carroll, Phillips, Gale, &amp; Batty, 2010</xref>). Anxiety has been associated with increased risk for hypertension, heart attack, and coronary heart disease in cross-sectional and prospective studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311427474">Jones &amp; Lando, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105311427474">Rutledge &amp; Hogan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311427474">Scherrer et al., 2010</xref>), including in a sample of rural dwellers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311427474">Moran, Mazzocco, Fiscus, &amp; Koza, 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311427474">Muhsen and colleages (2008)</xref> examined the prevalence of hypertension among Israeli adults with GAD. The authors found that 18% had hypertension. In contrast, some longitudinal studies have indicated that symptoms of anxiety and depression are associated with a longitudinal decrease in blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311427474">Hildrum, Mykletun, Holmen, &amp; Dahl, 2008</xref>) or have no influence on blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311427474">Raikkonen, Matthews, &amp; Kuller, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105311427474">Shinn, Poston, Kimball, St Jeor, &amp; Foreyt, 2001</xref>). As with the inconsistent associations for depression, it is likely that differences in observed associations between anxiety and blood pressure reflect variability that is not accounted for (e.g., gender differences) or differences in the association between anxiety at different severity levels or types (i.e., panic compared to GAD).</p>
<p>Although it appears that depressive and anxious symptoms may have a detrimental influence on cardiovascular health, little is known about the differential association of these symptoms on men compared to women, or for individuals of differing racial backgrounds. These differences may account for the mixed findings in previous research. The present study will address these gaps in the literature by investigating the association between anxiety, depression and blood pressure in a heterogeneous rural population in the western United States.</p>

<title>Participants and procedure</title>
<p>Participants in this study were 363 adults aged 40 and over recruited as part of the larger Project FRONTIER (Facing Rural Obstacles to healthcare Now Through Intervention, Education &amp; Research) study. Project FRONTIER is an ongoing community-based participatory research (CBPR) study investigating a range of psychological and medical conditions in rural-dwelling adults and elders residing in West Texas. CBPR occurs when a community and academic institution partner to address of an area of public health or research that is important to the community. Community members are stakeholders in the project and are more actively engaged in the process and outcome of the research. Detailed information regarding this study has been presented previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311427474">O’Bryant et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, participants were recruited from Cochran County, Texas or Parmer County, Texas. Both are rural counties with ethnic and socio-demographic diversity. As part of the CBRP design of Project FRONTIER, several years have been devoted to establishing and maintaining ties through advisory boards, presentations, community recruiters/assessors, and community partnerships with local entities who have facilitated completion of medical examinations and blood work.</p>
<p>The mean age of this sample was 62.73 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 12.98), with participants ranging in age from 40 to 96. Sixty nine percent of participants were female. Thirty nine percent of participants indicated Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin. The racial composition was 90% of White race (including those who endorsed White race and Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin), 6% of Black race, 3% of American Indian or Alaska Native race, with the remaining participants falling into other categories. Thirty five percent of the sample did not receive a high school diploma or General Educational Development (GED) credential. Annual household income of the sample was as follows: less than $20,000 = 48%, $20,001–$50,000 = 31%, $50,001 or higher = 18%, did not know or refused to answer = 3%. Analyses indicated no significant differences on age (p = .140), education level (p = .265), race (p = .957), or income (p = .768) for male compared to female participants. Similarly, no significant differences were found for age (p = .198), education level (p = .389), income ( p = .190), or gender (p = .304) for participants from different race groups.</p>
<p>This study was approved by the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center Institutional Review Board and all procedures were consistent with the approved protocol. Study sessions were conducted at Cochran County Memorial Hospital, Parmer Medical Center, or in the participant’s own home. A medical examination was conducted by a community clinician (i.e., physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant) at the hospital following standardized procedures. This included review of systems (general, dermatology, HEENT [head, eyes, ears, nose, throat], breast, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastro-intestinal, genitourinary, endocrine, hematologic, musculoskeletal, neurological, psychiatric, and functional), health habits, reproductive/sexual history, and the Hachinski Ischemic Scale. All clinicians were trained by the Project FRONTIER geriatrician before examinations began to ensure reliability of examinations. Fasting blood work, including a lipid panel, was conducted by the hospital laboratory (CLIA certified lab). Each participant then completed a detailed interview including portions of the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) questionnaire, which obtains information regarding diabetes, hypertension, cholesterol, cardiovascular disease, cancer, women’s and men’s health, and physical activity. Objective measures of blood pressure (three times all seated, using standard procedures), pulse, and psychological symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory) were administered. All diagnoses (i.e., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease) were based on consensus review of all information including: medical history, objective findings (Geriatric Depression Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, HbA1c, glucose, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, blood pressure assessed three times during interview and two times during medical exam), and medication use. The consensus review group is made up of two psychologists, a psychiatrist, and an internal medicine specialist. This study was cross-sectional; therefore, all measures were collected during the same study session.</p>

<title>Depression and anxiety assessment</title>
<p><bold>Geriatric Depression Scale</bold> (GDS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105311427474">Yesavage et al., 1983</xref>). The Geriatric Depression Scale is a widely used 30-item scale assessing depressive symptoms. Participants indicate “yes” or “no” for each item indicating how they have felt over the past week. Higher scores on this scale represent more severe depressive symptoms. The GDS was created to screen for depressive symptoms in older adults; however, it has been used worldwide in studies of both adults and older adults. The GDS was chosen for Project FRONTIER because the primary goal of the study is to understand cognitive aging and the GDS has been used in numerous studies related to the link between depression and cognition (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311427474">Lamar, Charlton, Morris, &amp; Markus, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311427474">Lichtenberg, Ross, Mills, &amp; Manning, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105311427474">Rovner, Casten, &amp; Leiby, 2009</xref>). A variety of studies have supported the psychometric properties of this instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105311427474">Sheikh &amp; Yeshavage, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105311427474">Sheikh et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105311427474">Yesavage et al., 1983</xref>) and it has been widely translated (e.g., Spanish, Chinese, Dutch, French, Greek, etc.).</p>
<p><bold>Beck Anxiety Inventory</bold> (BAI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311427474">Beck &amp; Steer, 1993</xref>). The BAI is a 21-item self-report inventory used to assess the presence of general symptoms of anxiety. Participants rate the extent to which they have experienced various anxious symptoms during the last two weeks on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 3 (severely). The reliability and validity of the BAI have been well supported in a variety of populations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311427474">Beck &amp; Steer, 1993</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1359105311427474">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Regression analyses were employed to determine the concurrent influence of anxious and depressive symptoms on systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Because systolic blood pressure was significantly correlated with age and there were significant gender differences, age and gender were controlled in all analyses that did not examine gender as a moderating variable. Age and gender were also controlled in all analyses with diastolic blood pressure as the dependent variable.</p>

<p>There was no significant association between BAI (p = .851) or GDS (p = .887) scores and systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure (ps = .472 and .200, respectively). Adjusting for gender did not change these results. Adjusting for race did reveal several interesting patterns. For black participants, higher depressive symptoms was associated with higher systolic blood pressure (overall β = 6.998, p = .021; black β = 1.291, p = .044; all others β = -,082 p = .642; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1359105311427474">Figure 1</xref>). Among nonwhite participants (i.e., black, non-white Hispanic, American Indian or Alaskan Native), higher depressive symptoms were associated with higher diastolic blood pressure (overall β = -3.359, p = .039; nonwhite β = .694, p = .033; white β = .073, p = .514). Among black participants, higher anxiety or depression scores were associated with higher diastolic blood pressure (anxiety overall β = 4.570, p = .024; anxiety black β = .742, p = .080; anxiety other races β = -.003, p = .973; depression overall β = 5.966, p = .001; depression black β = 1.173, p = .006; depression other races β = .039, p = .718). Finally, depressive symptoms was associated with higher diastolic blood pressure for participants at the mean or one standard deviation above the mean on the BAI (overall β = 1.157, p = .024; at or above mean β = .235, p = .077; below mean β = -.107, p = .546; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1359105311427474">Figure 2</xref>). Interestingly, participants one standard deviation below the mean on the BAI who reported minimal depressive symptoms had diastolic blood pressure that was similar to those with high anxiety and depressive symptoms.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To date, few studies have examined the association between psychological symptoms and indices of cardiovascular health, and fewer still have investigated this relationship in rural populations. The current study found several patterns of association between anxious and depressive symptoms in rural adults that are novel within the context of the existing literature. A significant association was found between depressive and anxious symptoms when diastolic blood pressure was the dependent variable. This indicates a trend toward higher diastolic blood pressure with higher anxiety for participants with higher reported symptoms of depression. The greatest diastolic blood pressure was observed for participants with very elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety scores greater than one standard deviation above the mean on the BAI. As noted above, we found it interesting that participants with anxiety scores one standard deviation below the mean and minimal depressive symptoms had comparably high levels of diastolic blood pressure as those with combined elevations on anxious and depressive symptoms. Taken together, these results may indicate that a moderate, but not high amount of anxiety and/or depression may be beneficial to cardiovascular health in encouraging rural adults to engage in activities and dietary patterns that maximize cardiovascular health. This study was not longitudinal, making it impossible to draw causal conclusions; however, it appears that future studies should examine whether moderate anxiety and depression may buffer against cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>The results of this study extend previous research by providing an indication of the differences in blood pressure in those with anxious or depressive symptoms based on racial background. The results suggest that systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly higher among black participants reporting elevated depressive symptoms compared to other participants. This may indicate that depressive symptoms are associated with cardiovascular disease among black adults living in rural areas. The higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease in black Americans has been linked to higher intake of calories and fat, and lower intake of fruits, fiber, and micronutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311427474">Lancaster, Watts, &amp; Dixon, 2006</xref>). This greater biological vulnerability may then be exacerbated by anxiety or depression more easily than for racial groups with reduced vulnerability. This suggests that practitioners should be especially vigilant to screen and monitor depressive symptoms among black patients to maximize early detection and treatment for depression, as well as cardiovascular health. A similar pattern was observed for white participants on diastolic blood pressure. White race moderated the association between depressive symptoms and diastolic blood pressure, such that higher depressive symptoms were associated with higher diastolic blood pressure for non-white participants.</p>
<p>This study has several unique strengths to offer in the examination of psychological predictors of cardiovascular health in rural participants. This study includes a relatively large sample recruited from several counties in West Texas. Blood pressure was taken three times to ensure reliability of measurement and well-established self-report measures of anxiety and depression were used. Despite these strengths, several important limitations should be noted regarding the findings of this study. This study did not include structured diagnostic interviews aimed at diagnosing anxiety disorders or mood disorders; therefore, it is difficult to know whether it is the presence of elevated symptoms or the full disorder in question that is associated with these cardiovascular outcomes. Second, although the sample size is sufficient for the analyses undertaken, a large sample size would increase our confidence in the generalizability of these results and would allow for more firm conclusions regarding the racial differences observed. Finally, the cross-sectional design of this study limits our ability to determine the causal influence of depressive or anxious symptoms on cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations this study adds significantly to the literature examining the association between psychological symptoms and cardiovascular health. Rural adults are more likely to be seen by primary care physicians with less experience assessing and treating depressive symptoms. These results from this study indicate that these physicians and other providers should seek out training in this area to improve their ability to reduce these psychological symptoms, as well as the negative association with blood pressure and cardiovascular health.</p>
