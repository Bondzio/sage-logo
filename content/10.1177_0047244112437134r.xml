<p>Originally a doctoral dissertation at the University of Paderborn (2010), the argument of this new book on W. G. Sebald runs as follows. While the nature and representability of History are his major concerns as a writer of prose fiction, he believes, as a melancholic, that literary realism cannot do human History justice (p. 85) because of its dialectical nature as a ‘Katastrophengeschichte’ (p. 125) or ‘<italic>historia calmitorum</italic>’ (p. 143) (history of catastrophes/calamities). Consequently, writers need to use the equally dialectical process that was theorized by Lévi-Strauss as <italic>bricolage</italic>. Accordingly, Seitz begins by surveying a range of recent work on Sebald (pp. 9−30), and then sets out the theoretical background of his own discussion (pp. 83−165) by paraphrasing Adorno and Benjamin’s philosophy of History (pp. 31−59) and Lévi-Strauss’s ideas of <italic>pensée sauvage</italic> and <italic>bricolage</italic> (pp. 61−80; cf. p. 144). So it is surprising that Seitz did not consult Sebald’s own, often heavily marked copies of those writers’ works which have been available in the Deutsches Literaturarchiv, Marbach/Neckar, for at least five years. He would have found much to strengthen his argument and perhaps been surprised to discover that <italic>Negative Dialektik</italic>, which he cites about 15 times (pp. 32−44), is not part of Sebald’s library. Indeed, Sebald had so poor an opinion of that work by Adorno that, when interviewed by Toby Green in 1999, he described it as turgid.</p>
<p>A second shortcoming of Seitz’s argument is its one-dimensional account of Sebald’s presentation of History. Although Seitz is well acquainted with Denham and McCulloh’s volume of essays (2006) (p. 175), he seems not to have assimilated Peter Fritzsche’s succinct piece on ‘W. G. Sebald’s Twentieth-Century Histories’ that was published there (pp. 291−9). Here, Fritzsche not only identifies ‘an enduring tension in Sebald’s work between nature and history, between the generic and the particular, between catastrophe and Holocaust, between the dispersed evidence of history and the specific disasters of the twentieth century’ (p. 292), he also senses a second tension between Sebald’s historical pessimism and his nostalgia for the years before World War II, especially the provincial 1930s (p. 298). Like Seitz, Fritzsche understands the importance of Benjamin’s concept of the ‘Sammler’ (collector) and Lévi-Strauss’s cognate concept of the ‘Bastler’ (<italic>bricoleur</italic>) for an understanding of Sebald’s way of working (p. 144). But, unlike Seitz, Fritzsche realized that Sebald’s idea of ‘a post-war present rich only in pre-war debris’ is a dangerous one if it is taken to imply ‘that the only way to relieve the disenchantment of the present is to collect the debris of lost lives just like the collectors of the nineteenth century assembled their botanical specimens, architectural drawings, and encyclopedia articles’ that occur in Sebald’s books (p. 298). Similarly, Seitz is familiar with Ben Hutchinson’s essay in the <italic>Jahrbuch der Deutschen Schillergesellschaft</italic> (2006) (see p. 176) where it is argued, unusually for a Sebald critic, that Sebald’s prose involves a dialectic between his melancholy and such countervailing experiences as ‘idyllic moments, bolt-holes in which the melancholic can find salvation’, moments of ‘joy’, ‘freedom from the pull of gravity’, ‘lightness’ and ’ease’ (pp. 459, 471, 475 and 477). But once again, Seitz has not been able to assimilate this dialectic into his more lapidary account of Sebald’s literary ‘Verlustgeschichte’ (history/narrative of loss) (p. 140).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Seitz is a sensitive and interesting reader of Sebald’s texts (see, for instance, p. 141, n. 340), and in his penultimate section (pp. 144−65) his assessment of Sebald’s prose fiction becomes more complex and searching, especially when he contrasts its ‘Verschachtelung der Erzählstimmen’ (interweaving of narrative voices) with polyphonic prose in the Bakhtinian sense, where ‘the competing voices exist next to one another and are not governed by the authority of one narrative voice’ (p. 148). This leads Seitz to reflect on the authority that governs the voices in Sebald’s work and to conclude initially that it is the ‘Stimme des Erzählers’ (narrator’s voice). But a few pages later and just three pages before the end of his text (p. 169), Seitz uses the phrase ‘auktoriale Perspektive’ (authorial perspective) rather than ‘Erzählperspektive’ (narratorial perspective), a shift which indicates that he has, perhaps unwittingly, sensed the presence of an even more elusive voice in Sebald’s prose fiction − that of the meta-narratorial author who, unlike the painter of a historicizing seascape (p. 85), is not the virtually motionless occupant of a stable vanishing point, but a moving and contradictory presence who illuminates and renders problematic both the narrative events of his text’s surface and his narrators’ evaluative attitudes to those events. In his <italic>Spiegel</italic> interview of 12 March 2001 (cf. p. 174), Sebald distinguished, firmly but somewhat enigmatically, between himself as citizen, writer and narrator and one of the figures who is described in his books. Although Seitz’s argument may not do complete justice to the multiple dialectic processes that generate and are at work in Sebald’s prose narratives, the persistence with which he makes and pursues his case issues in the discovery of a new perspective on those processes which thereby compels their critical re-evaluation.</p>
