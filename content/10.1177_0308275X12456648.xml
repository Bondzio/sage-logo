<p><bold>Reviewed by:</bold> <italic>Irina Carlota Silber, City College of New York, US</italic></p>
<p><italic>El Salvador in the Aftermath of Peace</italic> is a powerful book. Insightful and beautifully written, it provides a compelling argument for analyzing postwar El Salvador through the narratives of postwar violence that circulate in the urban spaces of San Salvador, the nation’s capital. Moodie makes clear that it is imperative to take issue with the still too often dominant view of El Salvador as a success story of peace. She does so by asking a persistent question: “What happened next?” (p. 15). Among a new generation of scholars attempting to analyze this period, Moodie brings to the subject a novel approach to the study of aftermaths that suggests new methods, sites and theoretical models for making sense of layers of violence in transitions to democracy, in El Salvador and beyond.</p>
<p>This is a project that Moodie has been involved in since 1993, shortly after the signing of United Nations brokered peace accords between the Salvadoran government and armed revolutionary forces of the FMLN. The longitudinal depth is complemented by an interest in language such as official proclamations, news stories, the talk of everyday life in middle-class gyms and coffee shops, and the seepage between these spheres. It is through this narrative lens that Moodie identifies postwar crime stories. Her examination of this genre, of people’s repeated, patterned framing of postwar as “worse than the war,” points to a salient finding, the circulation of a depoliticizing discourse of disenchantment.</p>
<p>Specifically, Moodie develops an argument on the shifting subjectivities of postwar times, ruptured from past understandings and characterized by uncertainty, “not-knowing” what comes next, and the attendant new anxieties and individual insecurities. The strength of the book lies in Moodie’s analysis. She convincingly suggests that we read these crime stories in terms of how they recode or “recalibrate” violence (p. 3). Moodie theorizes this as a “critical code-switching,” where official discourse recasts the postwar, erasing traces of war and recoding violence as non-critical, meaning banal, unexceptional, ordinary, anything but political or structural. Violence then is placed on raced, classed, and gendered bodies (young, male, gang member). Simultaneously, in this reframing, “ordinary” Salvadorans are produced through the logic of late capitalism as individuals maneuvering private risk.</p>
<p>Six ethnographic chapters follow a strong Introduction, and the book ends with Moodie’s attempt to move beyond the temporal moment of her study and reflect upon the historic election of FMLN candidate Mauricio Funes in 2009. Chapter 1, “Big Stories and the stories Behind the Stories,” anchors the book through juxtaposing the smaller stories of personal injury against the larger stories of Salvadoran history, from the 1932 massacre known as La Matanza to the big story of the nation’s search for democracy and modernity. In reviewing the literature on the war and the new avenues for the production of knowledge that the war created, this chapter sets up the ways in which postwar violence becomes the problem of postwar life. The following chapter provides ethnographic accounts and textual analysis of critical code-switching.</p>
<p>Chapter 3, “Today They Rob You and They Kill You,” concentrates on two different postwar crime stories, and Chapter 4, replete with more crime stories, illustrates clearly the making of postwar subjectivities, a reshaping, a repositioning, a re-knowing that cuts across gender, race, and class lines where violence is perceived as distinctly unknowable. These chapters lead up well to the fifth and sixth chapters, “Democratic Disenchantment” and “Unknowing the Other” respectively. In the former, Moodie contributes to the anthropology of democracy and, like a growing number of scholars, seeks to analyze the sense of loss that permeated El Salvador during her research. Importantly, she reads Salvadoran conceptions of democracy in these crime stories and identifies what can be read sociologically as a “social imaginary of obligation toward others” (p. 146). By this point in the text, readers should be convinced that in part “worse than the war” reflects a loss of hope. The last chapter captures well the making of criminality through expert discourse, through the media, and in everyday talk that roots the anxieties emergent in the 1990s. It documents the “fixation” on the criminal as the unknown Other, at once visible and invisible, the embodied racialized fantasy of excess violence.</p>
<p>With a critique of deviant, ordinary, criminal violence, Ellen Moodie closes her book by acknowledging that clearly stories in El Salvador are still spinning. In the Epilogue she asks, “What happens now?” And, like so many analysts of El Salvador after the signing of peace, she asks this question because of the unexpected hope that emerges at the tail end of the first decade of 21st century with the 2009 election. This is a good question and a good first attempt to make sense of this historic shift. It may wrap up a bit neatly Moodie’s quiet but insistent thread of resilience throughout the book, and prop analytical hopes for a willful re-imagining and tearing down of “worse than the war.” New research will be asking this question.</p>
<p>This book will be of interest to graduate students in the fields of anthropology, history, Latin American Studies, gender and sexuality studies, as well those interested in the study of war and violence. Given its narrative focus, the book could also be used in advanced undergraduate courses. In short, for experts on Salvadoran processes, as well as those new to the field, this is an excellent book and an important contribution to a growing field.</p>
