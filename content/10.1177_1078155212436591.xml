<p>Radiation recall dermatitis (RRD) is an inflammatory reaction occurring in a previously irradiated area, precipitated by the administration of certain drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212436591">1</xref></sup> RRD often resembles a severe sunburn or radiation dermatitis and is most often characterized by painful erythema, with or without desquamation or ulceration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212436591">2</xref></sup> A considerable amount of time may pass between the radiation exposure and RRD induced by the inciting agent. The drugs most commonly associated with RRD are intravenous antineoplastic agents; however, the frequency of development of this toxicity in clinical practice is unclear.</p>
<p>In this case, we present a RRD reaction secondary to ixabepilone, an epothilone analog that inhibits microtubule dynamics. The reaction occurred with a significant amount of time between radiation and exposure to the inciting agent. We also describe successful rechallenge using an alternative dosing strategy of ixabepilone that allowed the patient to receive the drug without further episodes of radiation recall.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1078155212436591"><title>Case</title>
<p>A 44 year old Caucasian female was diagnosed with stage IIIA, HER-2 positive, ER weakly positive, PR negative infiltrating ductal carcinoma in her left breast in late 2003. She underwent left modified radical mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection, which revealed 4 of 14 nodes positive for involvement with breast cancer. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide for four cycles followed by paclitaxel and trastuzumab as part of the NSABP B31 clinical trial. The patient was only able to complete three of the four scheduled cycles of paclitaxel due to multiple complications, but did complete the full course of 1 year of trastuzumab. Post-mastectomy radiation was completed in September 2004. The patient also received adjuvant hormonal therapy with tamoxifen.</p>
<p>In June 2005, the patient was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer involving the sternum, pelvis, and left supraclavicular, hilar, and mediastinal lymph nodes. The tumor again was ER positive, PR negative, and Her-2 positive. Tamoxifen was discontinued and the patient subsequently underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She was initiated on chemotherapy with the combination of gemcitabine and trastuzumab. She also received zoledronic acid for treatment of bone metastases. The patient progressed after 13 cycles of gemcitabine/trastuzumab, and was then treated with vinorelbine combined with trastuzumab to which she had a complete response. However, in April 2007, PET/CT scan revealed progression of disease including development of enhanced metabolic activity involving a previously seen sclerotic lesion in the left symphysis pubis. The patient received local radiation to the symphysis pubis, and was subsequently initiated on treatment with capecitabine and lapatinib in May 2007. Zoledronic acid was discontinued in May 2007 after 2 years of therapy. The patient experienced significant diarrhea and hand–foot syndrome while receiving the combination of capecitabine and lapatinib, resulting in treatment delay and reduced doses upon reinitiation. Follow-up scans in September 2007 revealed resolution of the pubic lesion and no new evidence of progression.</p>
<p>The patient continued to remain stable on this regimen until February 2008 when scans revealed evidence of local recurrence of metastatic disease involving the sternum and left symphysis pubis. She was again initiated on gemcitabine and trastuzumab; however, follow-up in April 2008 revealed progression of disease. The patient was subsequently initiated on treatment with docetaxel and trastuzumab. The patient experienced significant response to this combination, and was allowed a chemotherapy holiday after eight cycles due to side effects of docetaxel, particularly neuropathy and canalicular stenosis. In January 2009, scans showed progression of a sclerotic lesion within the sternum and return of hypermetabolic activity in the left pubic symphysis. The patient was then initiated on carboplatin and trastuzumab; however, she required transfusion support with platelets and packed red cells during this course of therapy. Follow-up PET/CT in April 2009 showed progression of the lesion in the sternum. She was subsequently referred for Cyberknife radiosurgery to the sternal lesion. She was given a treatment holiday after this procedure, but lesions in the sternum and pubic symphysis were progressing at the next follow-up scan in July 2009. She was subsequently initiated on systemic therapy with a combination of nab-paclitaxel and bevacizumab, to which the patient achieved partial response through January 2010, when she again had disease progression in the sternum and pubic symphysis.</p>
<p>In February 2010, the patient was initiated on a combination of trastuzumab and lapatinib, and re-initiated on zoledronic acid every 6–8 weeks. A PET/CT scan on 8 July 2010 revealed increased metabolic activity at the established lesions within the sternum and pubic symphysis as well as the development of numerous newly involved lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm. Lapatinib was discontinued. The patient continued to receive trastuzumab on a 3-week schedule and was initiated on ixabepilone at the FDA approved dose of 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 3 weeks. She received her first dose of ixabepilone on 19 July 2010, which was well-tolerated other than nausea and increased neuropathy. She reported increased feeling of depression and hopelessness, and was initiated on venlafaxine at a dose of 37.5 mg × 1 week, with subsequent increase to 75 mg daily.</p>
<p>Shortly after the second infusion of ixabepilone, administered on 11 August 2010, the patient reported that she began to experience burning with urination which continued into the next day. Over the next several days, the patient noted the development of a growing area skin irritation and sloughing on her groin near the labia. After 1 week, her second dose of ixabepilone, the patient presented to the clinic with grade 3 neutropenia, chills and sloughing of the labia majora, and surrounding tissue resembling a burn. She was diagnosed with grade 3 RRD and admitted to the hospital for management. There was no evidence of RRD in the post-mastectomy radiation port. The area of radiation recall improved over the next few days with wound care with topical silver sulfadiazine. The patient was discharged to home with instructions to continue the topical application of silver sulfadiazine and oral levofloxacin. Over the next 10 days, her condition resolved.</p>
<p>Given the patient’s extensive history of chemotherapy, there were few chemotherapeutic options active in breast cancer that the patient had not already received at some point. It was determined that ixabepilone was her best available option despite the fact that she could again develop RRD. A viable alternative to the FDA-approved dose of ixabepilone would be to administer at a lower dose more frequently, which has been previously described in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155212436591">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155212436591">4</xref></sup> The patient agreed to begin ixabepilone at a dose of 15 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle on 6 October 2010. The patient was also re-started on every 3-week trastuzumab. RRD did not recur, and the patient tolerated treatment well. A follow-up scan in late December 2010 revealed partial response to therapy. The patient continued on treatment with weekly ixabepilone until eventual progression in June 2011.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1078155212436591" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Ixabepilone is the first epothilone analog approved for use in the US. It received FDA approval in late 2007 for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer no longer responding to other therapies. Similar to taxanes, the mechanism of action of ixabepilone involves stabilization of microtubule polymerization through binding of the beta-subunit of the tubulin, which leads to arrest of the cell cycle in the G2/M phase and apoptosis. However, unlike the taxanes, ixabepilone has low susceptibility to resistance mechanisms such as P-glycoprotein mediated efflux.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212436591">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several antineoplastic agents, including taxanes have been reported to result in RRD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212436591">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212436591"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155212436591"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155212436591">9</xref></sup> Although not initially reported as an adverse event, radiation recall secondary to ixabepilone has been observed in post-marketing surveillance, requiring a labeling change in 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155212436591">10</xref></sup> A case report of radiation recall possibly related to ixabepilone was previously reported in the literature; however, in that particular case ixabepilone was initiated shortly after radiotherapy had finished.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078155212436591">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In order to appropriately assess causality of RRD with the administration of ixabepilone in this case, the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale was utilized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078155212436591">12</xref></sup> The score recorded for this case was a 7, which indicates a “probable” relationship between the RRD and the administration of ixabepilone. This score is a potentially weak representation of the relationship between RRD and ixabepilone as 3 of the 10 questions did not apply to this case for various reasons including lack of rechallenge at a similar dose, lack of utilization of a placebo test, as well as lack of measured or need of measured ixabepilone levels within the blood and/or tissues. It is unlikely that venlafaxine was the precipitating agent given the timing of RRD development relative to venlafaxine initiation and the fact that RRD resolved without discontinuation of venlafaxine. In addition, there are no reported cases of venlafaxine-induced RRD in the literature.</p>
<p>Several factors may influence the development of radiation recall, including total dose of radiation received, dose of triggering drug, characteristics of triggering drug, and time between end of radiation and initiation of triggering drug. Radiation recall often occurs within a few hours to a few days after initial exposure to the precipitating agent. Onset may also be delayed, potentially manifesting after repeated doses of the drug.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078155212436591">13</xref></sup> Perhaps, most striking in this case is that over 3 years had elapsed between the patient’s radiation treatment and initiation of treatment with ixabepilone. However, recall reactions have been reported to develop even after many years have elapsed between radiation treatment and initiation of an inciting agent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078155212436591">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078155212436591">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whether rechallenge with an inciting agent will elicit a recurrence of recall reaction is unpredictable. The decision to expose the patient to the precipitating agent must be highly individualized for the clinical situation. Patients who experience RRD are often not rechallenged due to fears of recurrence. The successful rechallenge presented in this case could potentially be a product of the adjusted dosing scheme: 15 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly, as opposed to 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every three weeks. This has key clinical consequences in that it provides evidence that rechallenge with an alternative but potentially effective dosing scheme is a promising therapeutic option in patients developing RRD triggered by ixabepilone. This is of exceptional utility for many patients who are potential candidates for ixabepilone therapy, as they will typically have undergone extensive prior treatment and available alternative options will have substantially dwindled.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1078155212436591" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Ixabepilone may result in radiation recall phenomenon. From this case, it appears that this effect may occur even years after radiotherapy, and that the dose of ixabepilone may play an important role.</p>
<p>Weekly dosing of ixabepilone appears to be a viable strategy for rechallenge in patients who develop RRD at standard doses, particularly in the face of limited alternatives.</p>
