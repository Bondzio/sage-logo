<abstract>
<p>The study findings showed that homeless childbearing women are at greatest risk for cancer, violence, poor nutrition, sexually transmitted infections, unplanned pregnancy, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Collaborating with personnel at a women’s shelter, the authors studied homeless childbearing women’s knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about general health promotion, healthy pregnancy promotion, and preterm labor prevention. Guided by the Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction and Change, 45 homeless women participated in focus groups. They were 28.7 years old (range 18-44 years), and approximately 87% of these women had custody of their children. Three themes identified included <italic>things you do to stay healthy during pregnancy, where you learned about staying healthy</italic>, and <italic>women’s knowledge about preterm labor and general health promotion</italic>. These findings informed an 8-week educational session (1 hr/week). During the past year, four 8-week sessions were conducted with attendance between 8 and 14 participants. Each week a different health topic was discussed incorporating the associated unique challenges of homelessness.</p>

<p>In the United States approximately 3.5 million people (about 1% of our population) are homeless. Although the majority of adult homeless persons are male, homeless women represent 65% of heads of households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1054773811420769">Baggett, O’Connell, Singer, &amp; Rigotti, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1054773811420769">National Coalition for the Homeless, 2009</xref>). Poor health is known to be closely associated with homelessness as 55% of homeless have no medical insurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1054773811420769">National Coalition for the Homeless, 2011</xref>). Not surprisingly, homeless childbearing women are at greatest risk for gynecologic cancer, violence, poor nutrition, sexually transmitted infections, unplanned pregnancy, and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm labor and preterm birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1054773811420769">Chau et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1054773811420769">Gold, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Preterm labor and subsequent preterm birth occur when an infant is born before 37 completed weeks of gestation and is associated with significant neonatal morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1054773811420769">March of Dimes, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1054773811420769">Moster, Lie, &amp; Markestad, 2008</xref>). Despite the many advances in health care, the rate of preterm labor resulting in preterm birth has only decreased slightly in the United States over the past several decades. In fact, the rate increased from 9.4% in the 1980s to 12.8% in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1054773811420769">Behrman &amp; Butler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1054773811420769">March of Dimes (MOD), 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1054773811420769">National Center for Health Statistics, 2006</xref>) but most recently slightly dropped to 12.3% due to a national campaign focused on elective deliveries prior to 40 weeks gestation. In 2003, the MOD launched a prematurity campaign focused on health promotion education for both health care providers and “moms to be.” According to the MOD, a 3% decline in prematurity has occurred since 2003 due to this campaign. This multifaceted campaign targets preconceptual period, pregnancy and postpregnancy care. During the preconceptual period, increased awareness of folic acid supplementation and risk assessment is stressed. During pregnancy, attending care, exercising and eating healthy, and avoidance of alcohol and recreational drugs are stressed. After pregnancy, awareness of normal physiologic changes, breast feeding promotion, and awareness of stress and fatigue are emphasized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1054773811420769">MOD, 2011</xref>). The most recent data show preterm birth rates are highest in the United States for Black/African American (18.1%) infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1054773811420769">Kramer &amp; Hogue, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1054773811420769">MOD, 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>In the past 10 years, little research has been published focusing on homelessness and pregnancy. Four studies were identified, and these researchers indicated that preterm labor is a particular problem for homeless pregnant women. Little and colleagues found that homeless women and those with insecure living situations were at significantly increased risk of delivering early (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1054773811420769">Little et al., 2005</xref>). Another group of researchers found that more lifelong episodes of homelessness significantly increased homeless women’s risk of delivering prematurely, and this association was most pronounced for Black and Latina mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1054773811420769">Stein, Lu, &amp; Gelberg, 2000</xref>). One group of researchers used a qualitative study design to gain understanding related to homelessness and pregnancy outcomes. These researchers who studied homeless women and their significant others stated women reported challenges in securing prenatal care, negative provider attitudes, drug use, and lack of support from the baby’s father (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1054773811420769">Milligan et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Separately, both preterm labor and homelessness are issues in the Northeast United States, the location where the study was conducted. The rate of preterm birth is highest for Black/African American infants (16.9%), and in the targeted city, state-wide trends continue with an overall preterm delivery rate of 11.8% for all infants and 17.2% rate for Black/African American infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1054773811420769">March of Dimes, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1054773811420769">Philadelphia Health Department, 2007</xref>). Moreover, in the targeted city, a study of the childbearing women seeking emergency shelter found that nearly one quarter of African American women giving birth between 1990 and 1998 sought emergency housing at least once (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1054773811420769">Webb, Culhane, Metraux, Robbins, &amp; Culhane, 2003</xref>). Given the prevalence of homelessness among women in the targeted city, the local homeless women’s shelter leadership anecdotally identified a need for health education with their residents. Due to this need, the leadership collaborated with the investigators to explore the attitudes and beliefs regarding general health and healthy pregnancy promotion among low-income childbearing women who resided at homeless shelters within the targeted city.</p>
<sec id="section1-1054773811420769">
<title>Purpose of the Study</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to identify the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about health promotion, healthy pregnancies, and preterm labor prevention of homeless childbearing women residing in a shelter. Guided by the Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction and Change, we used a focus group methodology and qualitative descriptive research approach. This approach is well suited to eliciting participants’ knowledge, attitudes, normative beliefs, behaviors, and experiences regarding their health promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1054773811420769">Ajzen &amp; Albarracín, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1054773811420769">Fishbein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1054773811420769">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1054773811420769">Sandelowski, 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1054773811420769">
<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>The Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction and Change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1054773811420769">Ajzen &amp; Albarracín, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1054773811420769">Fishbein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1054773811420769">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2010</xref>) explains how individual and family factors influence intentions about behavior. The model is comprised of five concepts postulating that attitudes, subjective normative beliefs, and perceived behavioral control influence intentions that lead to observable behaviors. Behavior is recognized to occur in context of specific environments (such as shelters) and is assumed to be influenced by environmental conditions. External variables, such as knowledge and environment, influence attitudes, normative beliefs, and perceived behavioral control. Thus, this theoretical perspective was consistent with the aims of this pilot study that focused on identifying what knowledge homeless, childbearing women residing in a shelter had related to health promotion, healthy pregnancy promotion, and preterm labor prevention. Informed by the Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction and Change, the results of this pilot study informed the next study phase in the development of an 8-week educational session targeting homeless women residing in a shelter. Each week a 1-hr interactive session on different health care topics identified by the women during the focus groups was held.</p>
<p>The opportunity for this community collaborative research project presented when a staff member from a local homeless women’s shelter contacted the principal investigator regarding health promotion learning needs of the residents. She explained that “lately” a growing number of their residents were pregnant or young mothers with neonates; she suspected these women had recently “aged out” of foster care and were thus lacking the resources required to house themselves and their babies. Not only did these young mothers lack knowledge regarding care during pregnancy and care of their new infants but they also lacked knowledge regarding general health promotion activities (L. Thul, personal communication, March 17, 2008). The study team utilized this opportunity to examine the knowledge related to health promotion, perinatal health promotion, and preterm labor prevention of childbearing women who were residing in a shelter. Community collaborative research can provide the foundation for a strategic, comprehensive approach to ensure that health care prevention strategies are effective in terms of targeted education related to health promotion and risk reduction especially for preterm labor. Partnerships between researchers and community-based providers ensure that interventions are evidence based, sustainable in community settings, and reach intended consumer populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1054773811420769">Jemmott &amp; Jemmott, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Research Design</title>
<p>A qualitative descriptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1054773811420769">Sandelowski, 2000</xref>) study design with self-administered surveys and focus groups were used to elicit participants’ knowledge, perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs regarding perinatal health promotion and preterm labor prevention. The goal was to depict women’s descriptions of their knowledge regarding health promotion, and perinatal health, especially preterm labor prevention. A secondary goal was to identify gaps in knowledge related to health and develop educational sessions for use with an urban childbearing community serving homeless women residing in a shelter.</p>

<sec id="section4-1054773811420769">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>In qualitative research, sample size is not set a priori, but based on data saturation or when no new information is obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1054773811420769">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>). Based on prior studies, an estimation of 30 to 50 participants per setting would be needed for data saturation. After data saturation, a sample of 45 childbearing, homeless, urban, childbearing women living in shelters participated in the study. This type of sampling selects informants who could be helpful in understanding urban, homeless shelter women residents’ knowledge related to the general health promotion, healthy pregnancy promotion, and preterm labor prevention. The inclusion criteria for study participation included childbearing women who (a) receive Medicaid or Medical Assistance or not have health insurance in the targeted state, (b) reside in a shelter in southwest or west area of the targeted city, (c) are age 18 or older, and (d) were English speaking. The study obtained Institutional Review Board approval.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section6-1054773811420769">
<title>Procedures and Data Collection</title>
<p>Within a 6-month period, 6 focus groups totaling 45 participants were held at 2 different women’s shelters in the Philadelphia community. Each focus group was scheduled separately. Informed consent was obtained. Prior to the focus group session, participants completed a brief demographic survey (including age, clinic, insurance, ethnicity/race, selected health history questions). The focus group leaders (one facilitator and one note taker) described the purpose, measures to insure confidentiality, and the right to withdraw from the study or to not answer questions considered too private or uncomfortable to answer. The 2- to 3-hr sessions were audiotaped and participants were paid US$20 remuneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1054773811420769">Ruff, Alexander, &amp; McKie, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Data were collected using an individual demographic survey and conducting six focus groups. The demographic survey included age, insurance status, race, and selected health history questions. The Focus Group Guide consisting of 16 open-ended questions was used to gain insight into multiple perspectives of general health promotion, perinatal health promotion, and preterm labor prevention. The focus group guide was developed with input from the investigative team, community shelter partners, community advisory board, health care provider partners, and women residing at the targeted shelters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1054773811420769">Kerlinger &amp; Lee, 1999</xref>). The content of the focus group guide was informed by the Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction and Change. The guide was piloted with three women residing in the shelter, and subsequent small modifications were made. The following are examples of questions used during the focus groups. (a) What are some things women your age like to do to stay healthy during pregnancy? (probes, diet, exercise) (b) What are some things that get in the way of having healthy behaviors during pregnancy? (c) What do women your age know about preterm labor? (d) What activities can women your age avoid to prevent preterm labor? (e) What is good about avoiding these activities that may cause preterm labor?</p>

<sec id="section7-1054773811420769">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the demographic survey data.</p>
<p>The audio tapes from the focus groups were transcribed and verified for accuracy and read by the principle investigator and at least two other study team members. Content analysis was employed to analyze the focus group data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1054773811420769">Hsieh &amp; Shannon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1054773811420769">Weber, 1990</xref>). The Focus group transcripts were first read as a whole to understand the context of the comments. Then, content analysis was performed using a team approach to increase the trustworthiness of interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1054773811420769">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>). The data were summarized with quotes embedded and placed into a conceptually clustered matrix (Topic × Focus Group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1054773811420769">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). Together, team members examined the data to identify common patterns and themes as well as divergent views. Patterns were identified across focus group transcripts and grouped by common themes guided by the Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction and Change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1054773811420769">Ajzen &amp; Albarracín, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1054773811420769">Fishbein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1054773811420769">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2010</xref>). Data were analyzed as it became available, and data collection concluded when no new themes emerged. Field notes from the focus groups were used to substantiate the common themes identified. The findings were presented to the community advisory board for feedback.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section9-1054773811420769">
<title>Demographic Data</title>
<p>Women were 28.7 years old (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.05, range = 18-44 years); approximately 87% (<italic>n</italic> = 39) of women were multiparous (parity range = 2-7 births), 9% (<italic>n</italic> = 4) of women were primiparous, and 4% (<italic>n</italic> = 2) nulliparous. All women (100%) considered themselves as heads of households. The racial background included 73% (<italic>n</italic> = 33) Black, 9% (<italic>n</italic> = 4) White, 9% (<italic>n</italic> = 4) Hispanic, and 9% (<italic>n</italic> = 4) Other. These demographic data are typical of women from the local community, with women being multiparous, Black, and heads of households.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1054773811420769">
<title>Qualitative Themes</title>
<p>We identified three themes during our study: <italic>things you do to stay healthy during pregnancy, where you learned about staying healthy during pregnancy</italic>, and <italic>women’s knowledge about preterm labor and health promotion</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section11-1054773811420769">
<title>Things you do to stay healthy during pregnancy</title>
<p>Overwhelmingly, the participants stated that attending prenatal care was important for staying healthy during pregnancy and identified barriers to attending care that included transportation and lack of insurance. They also discussed exercise and nutrition as ways to stay healthy during pregnancy. When discussing attending prenatal care, their views focused more on the health of their unborn baby rather than their maternal health. Women often shared it was important to “know that your baby is healthy” and “hearing the baby’s heart beat.” Women wanted reassurance about their role as a pregnant woman. One woman stated she wanted to “make sure you are doing it right.” Another woman stated, “At first I was concerned, I really want to know what I can and can’t do for me and him to stay healthy.”</p>
<p>Women shared difficulties that prevented them for attending care such as “children” and “work.” Transportation and lack of insurance made it hard to attend care. For instance, one woman stated, “My boyfriend is probably at work and can’t take me.” Another woman further elaborated, “Transportation’s not an issue as long as it’s good weather, it’s OK.”</p>
<p>Not only did participants reveal that lack of insurance was a barrier but also spoke about receiving a different type of care if they were uninsured. One participant disclosed, “Sometimes if you don’t have insurance, they treat you differently. They do something opposite . . . or something to try to be a little smart. That’s just my opinion.” Yet another participant shared,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Some clinics are not really good because there are always people who don’t have insurance. They go to the free clinic because that’s the only place they can go to get free prenatal care. So, I mean, it’s more convenient for a lot of people. But there’s too much people and too much going on . . . and I think they (providers) can’t keep their full attention when it comes to that type of care.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some women were afraid to attend care. As one woman said,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Some women who are on drugs are scared to come to the clinic. They get their kids taken and all that. So she came to the hospital and that’s how DHS [Department of Human Services] took them. So I heard a couple people scared to have their kids taken who delivered at home.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another woman reflected, “Because my aunt . . . she’s a drug addict . . . and she had kids and her kids got taken from her. And she started getting herself together and just started getting her kids back.”</p>
<p>Women also discussed that exercise was important for a healthy pregnancy. One woman believed exercise was important “especially if you’re pregnant, walking and shopping, stuff like that.” Some women expressed it was hard to exercise stating, “Worrying about working and being at work all the time would get in the way of exercise,” or “you get so big, I was getting so big,” and lastly, “being tired . . . too tired to walk.” Some women felt their environments were not safe for exercise stating, “It ain’t safe to walk around.” These statements reflect the challenges that women face with exercise during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Eating healthy foods was important for a healthy pregnancy. One woman stated, “It’s not so easy to get healthy food and eat healthy.” Another woman said, “I take my prenatal vitamins. I drink lots of water.” Yet other women shared, “Bad cravings can prevent you from walking and not wanting to eat the right things . . . fruits and vegetables . . . so it’s hard to eat healthy.” Again, these statements reflect the challenges that these homeless women faced with eating healthy foods during pregnancy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1054773811420769">
<title>Where you learned about how to stay healthy during pregnancy</title>
<p>Most often, women stated they learned about ways to stay healthy during their pregnancies from their mothers, doctors, and in health class at school. One woman revealed, “I ask my doctor . . . they talk to you about it a lot when you go to the appointments and give you different papers on it.” Many participants said they learned from their mothers. One woman stated,</p>
<p>She was teaching me about stuff that I should look out for. Number one thing she told me was about the stress that was the number one thing. Me and my step-dad, we really argue a lot, and I was telling her about that. And she was telling me to kind of stay away from that.</p>
<p>Another woman said, “My mom told me, well my feet were really swollen so she told me to cut salt.” Some women were concerned about what others told them about pregnancy. One woman said she just wanted to know the following:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>How to have a healthy pregnancy . . . just the truth. Because people say some stuff, some people say bogus stuff about pregnancy. Like they make up all types of things. These are the things you can and cannot do in your pregnancy. Like what you can and cannot do to prevent a miscarriage.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, participants revealed that they learned about how to stay healthy during pregnancy at an internet-based resource such as My Space. On woman commented, “Everybody gonna be on there . . . even if they don’t have computer at home, they go to the library, they go everywhere for My Space.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1054773811420769">
<title>Women’s knowledge about preterm labor</title>
<p>When the participants were asked about their knowledge concerning preterm labor, most women knew little or nothing about preterm labor. One participant stated,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>So, what we know is that sometimes people are at home and things are happening and they don’t know. And then, so you would ask your mom or your kids would ask you. And then eventually they end up coming here [hospital] because sometimes there’s things you can do to prevent it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another participant wanted to understand the cause of preterm labor resulting in pregnancy loss. She stated,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Why a woman can’t hold her baby. Say she’s pregnant and she wants to know the reason why she lost her baby. That’s a good thing to talk about. Because, it’s like slip and fall. That could have been the reason she lost her baby. Or she ate a bad apple. That could have been it. Or swallowed the seed.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although women discussed that they had little knowledge related to preterm labor, they did believe that preterm labor is related to stress or disease. The sources of stress varied depending on the life experiences of the participants. As this woman divulged the following, “a lot of stress . . . working . . . going from one thing to another . . . too much pressure. You have to think about your child first and is it really worth stressing over this? Putting your baby in danger?” Another woman stated, “Relationships . . . like with guys . . . that stresses you out. Kids really don’t bother me.” Yet another woman disclosed, “C-section [cesarean section] that’s what I was worried about. Because they keep saying the baby wasn’t really growing. I was worried about a C-section. I was worried about having a miscarriage. That’s what I was worried about.” Lastly, one woman shared what decreased stress by saying, “What makes it easier is having other people around that really are willing to do the stuff for you so you don’t have to do it and stress about it.”</p>
<p>In association with other health problems, one woman shared, “Diseases can make a baby come early, like. Well, my baby tried to come early. They run tests on me to make sure. I know I don’t have anything. That’s the protocol . . . because they didn’t understand why she was trying to come early.”</p>

<title>Health promotion interests</title>
<p>As stated earlier, women were very interested in learning more about reasons for and prevention of miscarriages. Diseases that affected people they knew were of a concern to them such as hypertension, diabetes, and female cancers. Overwhelmingly, women wanted to know more about sexually transmitted infections such as transmission, causative organisms, prevention, and treatment. They also had a great deal of interest in discussing family planning, including methods, effectiveness, availability, and so on. For example, one woman stated, “And there’s a strain of gonorrhea and chlamydia that a man can get and he doesn’t have to have any symptoms now, and people don’t know that. So I think that would be good to know.” The women suggested places where these learning sessions could be held. The women were concerned about convenience and a locale without stigmatization. These homeless women preferred the shelter where they were currently staying but in the future when living independently would like to attend sessions at a community center, library, or health fairs. One woman stated, “I think community centers would be good because some people can’t really have a car to share and can’t get that far.” Woman shared that some locations may result in the women being stigmatized. For instance, if women attended a health care center, “some folks will wonder why you are going” or “some things at church, but can’t talk about sex there . . . may not go to church ‘cause it’s in a church, they might not want to talk about it.” Another women further clarified, “Even if you’re a religious person, you still like enter this church, and you still wouldn’t want to discuss certain stuff.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Significant challenges exist when addressing the health needs of homeless childbearing women. Numerous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1054773811420769">Bherman &amp; Bulter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1054773811420769">Blumenshine, Egerter, Barclay, Cubbin, &amp; Braveman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1054773811420769">Kramer &amp; Hogue, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1054773811420769">Lu &amp; Halfon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1054773811420769">Moster &amp; Markestad, 2008</xref>) have shown that women who live in more deprived neighborhoods are at higher risk for adverse birth outcomes along with health outcomes in general. Our study findings were similar to those of other researchers who reported on health discriminants associated with adverse birth outcomes. Interestingly, the homeless women we sampled who were residing in these shelters described themselves as heads of households but did not refer to their homelessness or role as a head of households during our discussions. Our study team is unclear why homelessness was not mentioned, but the team postulated that perhaps the women viewed their current living situation as temporary, not realizing that homelessness may be an added life stressor that may place them at increased risk for suboptimal health outcomes. In the community where our study took place, being a female head of household is not unusual. Prior to this study, the voices of homeless childbearing women residing in shelters who are at greatest risk for cervical cancer, sexually transmitted infections, unplanned pregnancy as well as preterm labor, and subsequent preterm birth have not been specifically studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1054773811420769">Chau et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1054773811420769">Gold, 2006</xref>). Our study findings fill a gap of knowledge indicated that homeless women residing in shelters were interested in obtaining knowledge related to health promotion, healthy pregnancy promotion, and disease prevention.</p>
<p>Other groups of researchers have reported on the relationship of preterm birth and stress, but not specifically on a homeless women’s knowledge of this relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1054773811420769">Denney, Culhane, &amp; Goldenberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1054773811420769">Gennaro, Shults, &amp; Garry, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1054773811420769">Stringer, Ratcliffe, Evans, &amp; Brown, 2005</xref>). Our study participants were well aware of the relationship between preterm birth and stress. Although women had little knowledge about other risks related to preterm labor, these women knew that stress might lead to preterm labor. When they described life stressors that may occur during pregnancy such as attending school, working, and relationships, none of the women identified homelessness as being a stressor. Although researchers have theorized that cumulative stressors from environments of poverty, racism, and neighborhood problems may occur, the effects of homelessness and pregnancy outcomes are understudied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1054773811420769">Collins, David, Handler, Wall, &amp; Andres, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1054773811420769">Lu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1054773811420769">Rich-Edwards &amp; Grizzard, 2005</xref>). Our research team believes future exploration is warranted concerning the relationship between homelessness, pregnancy, and interventions to mitigate some of the negative health effects that may be associated with homelessness during pregnancy. During the learning sessions (seminars) held at the shelters, the research team specifically provided interactive sessions on stress reduction that might be effective for each individual. Initially, the group would explore nonpharmacological methods the women may have used in the past. Emphasis was placed on avoiding the use of alcohol, nicotine, or recreational medications for stress release. During the group sessions, the women experienced in the use of aromatherapy, meditation, imagery, music, and yoga for stress reduction.</p>
<p>Our study findings support that these homeless women believed attending prenatal care was important for staying healthy during pregnancy. Primarily they were interested in the health of their unborn child and what their role might be in achieving a healthy pregnancy. The attitudes, norms, and beliefs identified by the women supported behavioral outcomes associated with healthy pregnancies, including exercise and a healthy diet. Hennessy and colleagues reported that women who skipped meals were 3.57 more likely to have a preterm delivery than women who did not skip meals during pregnancy (Hennessy, Volpe, Sammel, &amp; Gennaro, 2009). Hennessy et al.’s findings coupled with these study findings indicate an opportunity not only to provide education related to healthy diets and pregnancy with the women living in a shelter but also with the shelter providers who control the meal planning. In particular, the policy at the shelters we visited made provisions for meals 3 times a day. For residents who wanted a snack, vending machines were available. The vending machines did not offer a source of protein, fruits, or vegetables as recommended for pregnancy women. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends that during pregnancy, women consume three meals and three snacks daily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1054773811420769">IOM, Committee on Nutritional Status During Pregnancy and Lactation, Subcommittee for a Clinical Application Guide, &amp; ebrary Inc., 1992</xref>). Implementing evidence-based strategies to assist pregnant women who are residing in a shelter to be able to consume three meals and three snacks daily are needed.</p>
<p>Barriers to attending prenatal care, including transportation and lack of insurance, were identified in our study and have been identified previously by other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1054773811420769">Denney et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1054773811420769">Nothnagle, Marchi, Egerter, &amp; Braveman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1054773811420769">Stringer, 1998</xref>). Rarely described by other researchers is the belief expressed by our study women that lack of insurance was associated with a lower quality of care than those women who had insurance. Nowak and Stevens discussed vigilance in parents who experienced a fetal or infant loss. These researchers found that the lack of health insurance delayed entry into prenatal care and when at prenatal care “judgment[s] made by the perinatalogist” negatively affected their care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1054773811420769">Nowak &amp; Stevens, 2010</xref>). In 2005, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) issued a committee opinion stating significant racial and ethnic disparities exist in women’s health. One recommendation was to provide “high quality, compassionate, and ethically sound health care services to all” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1054773811420769">ACOG, 2005</xref>). A new finding by our study participants was their concern that when they attended prenatal care, their children might be removed from their custody. Our study team postulates that this finding may be more prevalent in homeless women who are residing in a shelter as these women are known to have alcohol, drug, and mental health issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1054773811420769">Baggett et al., 2010</xref>). Further research to determine ways to balance the need for prenatal care attendance versus the mandatory reporting of unsafe child environments by health personal is warranted.</p>
<p>Our results had similar findings to May and Evans related to health education needs for homeless populations of both men and women. May and Evans provided education on topics such as self-esteem, stress, first aid, and nutrition, though postprogram evaluation by the attendees indicated that stress and self-esteem were the most desired topics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1054773811420769">May &amp; Evans, 1994</xref>). Our study participants were interested in learning more about stress, self-esteem, and health promotion during pregnancy, preterm labor prevention, and other health-related topics such as female cancers, sexually transmitted infections, and family planning. They were interested in learning ways to prevent cancer, infections, and pregnancy along with the causes and management. Our participants were willing to attend sessions on these topics at the shelter where they currently resided. Interestingly, upon leaving the shelter, they suggested health promotion sessions to be held at environments where women usually gather, such as a community center or library. They were less likely to attend and discuss sensitive topics such as sexually transmitted infections or family planning at religious centers. The women were concerned about attending health centers for health education that was unrelated to a health care visit since within their normative value system their peers interpret any visit to the health center as a visit for a health-related problem. They did not want to be questioned or it be assumed that they had a health care issue.</p>
<p>Our study participants suggested the use of electronic social networks as forums to discuss health promotion topics. They believed that individuals without computers were accessing social networks at the library or other places where free internet service is available. Future research is needed to determine the usefulness of social networks for health promotion.</p>

<sec id="section16-1054773811420769">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>As an initial step following this study, to meet the immediate learning needs of these women and the staff members of the shelter, our hospital nursing personnel made a commitment to provide ongoing 8-week educational series focused on general health promotion, healthy pregnancies, and the prevention of preterm birth. During the past year, four modules were conducted, with each module consisting of a 1-hr session for 8 consecutive weeks at the women’s shelter. Attendance ranged between 8 and 14 participants. Data from the focus groups informed the content of these interactive sessions. Each week a different health topic was discussed, incorporating the unique challenges of homelessness that are associated with the health topic. Topics discussed included healthy pregnancy, reproductive life planning (i.e., pregnancy planning), sexually transmitted diseases, gynecologic cancer, self-esteem, healthy lifestyles (nutrition and exercise), stress management strategies, hygiene, and first aid. Preterm labor prevention education was integrated throughout the learning sessions, including healthy pregnancy, reproductive life planning, sexually transmitted diseases, self-esteem, healthy lifestyles, and stress management strategies. Evaluations of these interactive sessions by participants and staff have been positive. At the end of each session, attendees were provided a certificate of attendance. Upon conclusion of each 8-week-long module, a celebration of module completion was held along with an evaluation of the series content, location, and time of the session. Residents shared that they would prefer an early evening session immediately following dinner and wanted to have their children in attendance too. The residents shared that the content was useful.</p>
<p>Our research team recognizes the major limitation of this study is generalizability to homeless women residing in shelters in other geographic areas with differing demographic characteristics such as age, race, and history of homelessness. The study team does believe these study findings could inform a larger-scale study focusing on homeless childbearing women residing in shelters.</p>
<p>In closing, these homeless childbearing women were interested in obtaining knowledge related to general health promotion, healthy pregnancy promotion, and disease prevention. As homeless childbearing women, they had limited knowledge related to one of their greatest risks, preterm birth. Homelessness was never identified by the women residing in the shelters as a health risk. Homeless shelters provide both a unique and challenging environment for providing health promotion education as the shelter resident does not have complete autonomy in decision making within this community environment. Having the opportunity to reach and provide health education at the shelter with childbearing women who are at greatest risk for suboptimal health outcomes is important. Opportunities exist for community partnerships between health care centers and homeless shelters for women for health promotion and disease prevention especially as it relates to pregnancy.</p>
