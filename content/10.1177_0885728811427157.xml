<abstract>
<p>In this investigation, the authors examine the relationship between individual skills (i.e., career locus of control [LOC], social skills [SOC], and social problem–solving skills [SPSS]) and the school- and perceived career–related adjustment of 211 students with disabilities. Data pertaining to individual skills were gathered from student reports, and data pertaining to adjustment were gathered from student and teacher perceptions. Results of hierarchical regression analyses indicated that together LOC, SOC, and SPSS accounted for a significant amount of variance in student- and teacher-rated school- and career-related adjustment after controlling for disability type. Evaluation of individual predictors indicated that the strength of these associations varied according to data source and the specific predictor under study.</p>

<p>Although the educational experiences of students with disabilities have improved significantly during the past 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0885728811427157">Newman, Wagner, Cameto, Knokey, &amp; Shaver, 2010</xref>), many adolescents and young adults with disabilities continue to face major challenges during and following high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0885728811427157">Wagner, Newman, Cameto, Garza, &amp; Levine, 2005</xref>). Adolescents with disabilities miss approximately one full month of school each year; approximately 48% of secondary age youth with disabilities receive mostly Cs, Ds, and Fs in their classes; and approximately 20% of youth with disabilities are suspended from school each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0885728811427157">Wagner et al., 2003</xref>). School drop-out rates among adolescents with disabilities (25%) are approximately twice the national average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885728811427157">Kaufman, Alt, &amp; Chapman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0885728811427157">Wagner et al., 2003</xref>), and only 32% of students with disabilities receive a standard or regular diploma within 4 years of initial enrollment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0885728811427157">Orfield, Losen, Wald, &amp; Swanson, 2004</xref>). On exit from high school, these youth experience low rates of employment, poor-quality employment, and limited participation in postsecondary education and training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0885728811427157">Murray, Goldstein, Nourse, &amp; Edgar, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885728811427157">Newman, Wagner, Cameto, &amp; Knokey, 2009</xref>). Youth with disabilities have poorer career decision-making skills, lower career outcome expectations, and poorer vocational identities than their peers without disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0885728811427157">Ochs &amp; Roessler, 2001</xref>). Not surprisingly, only about 40% of youth with disabilities are employed during the first 2 years after they leave high school, a rate that is substantially lower than the 63% employment rate for all out-of-school youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0885728811427157">Wagner, Newman, Cameto, Levine, &amp; Garza, 2006</xref>). Moreover, youth with disabilities who attain employment earn lower wages and have fewer employment-related benefits than students without disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885728811427157">Goldstein, Murray, &amp; Edgar, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0885728811427157">Wagner et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the challenges facing adolescents and young adults with disabilities, it is important to identify skills, factors, and processes that can promote positive adjustment among these youth. These factors should be potent in the sense that they should affect student performance across multiple domains, contexts, and developmental periods but should also be malleable to facilitate future intervention efforts. Consistent with ecological models of human development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885728811427157">Bronfenbrenner &amp; Morris, 1998</xref>) and with recent literature reviews in secondary special education and transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0885728811427157">Test et al., 2009</xref>), we believe that there are a relatively broad number of individual skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885728811427157">Gresham, Sugai, &amp; Horner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0885728811427157">Wehmeyer &amp; Schwartz, 1997</xref>), school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885728811427157">Halpern, Yovanoff, Doren, &amp; Benz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0885728811427157">Shandra &amp; Hogan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0885728811427157">White &amp; Weiner, 2004</xref>), family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0885728811427157">Shandra &amp; Hogan, 2009</xref>), and community-related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885728811427157">Bullis, Davis, Bull, &amp; Johnson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0885728811427157">Repetto, Webb, Garvan, &amp; Washington, 2002</xref>) factors and processes that may be predictive of the school- and career-related adjustment of youth with disabilities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0885728811427157">Test et al. (2009)</xref> identified a total of 16 categories that were found to be correlated with improved postsecondary education, employment, and/or independent living. These predictors included individual skills (e.g., self-advocacy/self-determination, self-care, social skills [SOC], career awareness), school factors (e.g., exit exam requirements/high school diploma status, inclusion in general education, occupational courses), family factors (e.g., parental involvement), and community factors (e.g., paid work experience, interagency collaboration, vocational education, community experiences, and work study).</p>
<p>The current investigation was designed to add to the literature on secondary transition by examining how specific <italic>individual skills</italic> were associated with indicators of school- and career-related adjustment among adolescents with disabilities. We were particularly interested in investigating the relationship between specific individual skills that are widely assumed to be important in the context of transition (i.e., locus of control [LOC], SOC, and social problem–solving skills [SPSS]) and students’ school and career adjustment. The identification of skills that are predictive of in-school <italic>and</italic> postschool adjustment indicators is important because increasing demands on teachers along with growing resource constraints in schools require teachers (and schools generally) to be selective about what can and cannot be included in the curriculum. Thus, it is important for secondary transition researchers to identify skills that are potentially potent, malleable predictors of performance across multiple domains of functioning.</p>

<title>LOC</title>
<p>LOC was first conceptualized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0885728811427157">Rotter (1954)</xref> as a generalized expectancy regarding the relationship between one’s own behavior, efforts, or characteristics, and reinforcement. Later researchers described LOC as one’s attribution of causation in consideration of positive or negative life events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0885728811427157">Skinner, 2003</xref>). It is generally accepted that individuals fall along a continuum of LOC ranging from internal to external (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885728811427157">Joe, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0885728811427157">Rotter, 1975</xref>). Internally oriented individuals attribute life events to their own behavior, whereas externally oriented individuals attribute events to environment, luck, or even to the supernatural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0885728811427157">Rotter, 1966</xref>).</p>
<p>Among students without disabilities, an internal LOC has been shown to be positively associated with student engagement, academic performance, educational resiliency, and high school completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885728811427157">Cappella &amp; Weinstein, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885728811427157">Ekstrom, Goertz, Pollack, &amp; Rock, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885728811427157">Finn &amp; Rock, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0885728811427157">Ross &amp; Broh, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0885728811427157">Shepherd, Fitch, Owen, &amp; Marshall, 2006</xref>). Other researchers have shown that an internal LOC is related to higher levels of school satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885728811427157">Huebner, Ash, &amp; Laughlin, 2001</xref>), lower levels of problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0885728811427157">Tony, 2003</xref>), and lower suicide risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885728811427157">Beautrais, Joyce, &amp; Mulder, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885728811427157">Evans, Marsh, &amp; Owens, 2005</xref>). An internal LOC has also been linked to long-term employment outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885728811427157">Ng, Sorensen, and Eby (2006)</xref> reviewed more than 200 research articles focused on LOC and employment and found that an internal LOC was positively associated with a broad range of employment outcomes among adults including job satisfaction, job commitment, job motivation, career success, and job performance.</p>
<p>In the current investigation, we examined career LOC (C-LOC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885728811427157">Millar &amp; Shevlin, 2007</xref>), which focuses specifically on an individual’s expectation that they can influence their career trajectories through personal action. C-LOC has been linked to job search habits and major selection among college undergraduates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0885728811427157">Trice, Haire, &amp; Elliott, 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885728811427157">Luzzo, McWhirter, and Hutcheson (1997)</xref> found that C-LOC was positively associated with part-time employment, such that more internally oriented undergraduates displayed a greater likelihood of choosing jobs that matched their career self-interests. Together, prior research on LOC and C-LOC suggests that students with more internal orientations experience more positive in-school and postschool adjustment than those with more external orientations; however, these relationships have not been examined extensively among adolescents with disabilities.</p>

<sec id="section2-0885728811427157">
<title>SOC</title>
<p>SOC have been defined as “socially acceptable learned behaviors that enable a person to interact effectively with others and avoid socially unacceptable responses” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885728811427157">Gresham &amp; Elliott, 1990</xref>, p. 1). Early SOC have been linked with grade promotion and retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885728811427157">Agostin &amp; Bain, 1997</xref>), and numerous investigations have reported significant positive correlations between teacher ratings of SOC and measures of academic achievement for students during elementary school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885728811427157">Konold, Jamison, Stanton-Chapman, &amp; Rimm-Kaufman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885728811427157">Miles &amp; Stipek, 2006</xref>). SOC are also predictive of the academic, emotional, and behavioral adjustment among adolescents, including adolescents with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0885728811427157">Segrin &amp; Flora, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0885728811427157">Strahan, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0885728811427157">Pierson, Carter, Lane, and Glaeser (2008)</xref> examined associations between SOC and the capacity and opportunity to use self-determined behavior among youth with disabilities and found that SOC accounted for approximately 13% of the variance in students’ <italic>capacity</italic> for self-determination and a small but significant portion of the variability in students’ opportunities to use self-determined behavior. Other researchers have found that SOC is predictive of post–high school outcomes, including the employment status of students of disabilities 1 year after high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885728811427157">Benz, Yovanoff, &amp; Doren, 1997</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-0885728811427157">
<title>SPSS</title>
<p>In addition to C-LOC and SOC, SPSS have been linked to school- and career-related adjustment, particularly behavioral and social adjustment. SPSS can be described as a recursive cognitive and behavioral process that includes (a) identifying problems, (b) generating solutions to problems, (c) selecting a solution, (d) implementing the selected solution, and (e) reflecting on the effectiveness of the enacted solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885728811427157">Crites &amp; Dunn, 2004</xref>). Higher levels of SPSS have been linked with reductions in externalizing problem behavior in children and adults with and without disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885728811427157">Crites &amp; Dunn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885728811427157">Gresham &amp; MacMillan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885728811427157">Huang &amp; Cuvo, 1997</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0885728811427157">Wehmeyer and Kelchner (1995)</xref> hypothesized that increases in SPSS may result in increased levels of job retention for individuals with disabilities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885728811427157">Heppner et al. (2004)</xref> provided some support for this hypothesis in their study of 151 <italic>nondisabled</italic> adults seeking career counseling. In the Heppner et al. study, adults who reported increased levels of problem-solving appraisal over time also experienced increases in career resources and goal directedness during career transitions. Similar findings were reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885728811427157">Henry (1999)</xref> in a study of problem-solving appraisal among minority and disadvantaged premed students. Despite the apparent importance of SPSS, a number of researchers have reported that individuals with disabilities have less developed SPSS than their nondisabled peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885728811427157">Gresham &amp; MacMillan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885728811427157">Huang &amp; Cuvo, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885728811427157">Kavale &amp; Forness, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0885728811427157">Toro, Weissberg, Guare, &amp; Liebenstein, 1990</xref>), suggesting that students with disabilities may be less likely to derive the benefits associated with this skill. Therefore, it is important to develop further understanding about the importance of SPSS among adolescents with disabilities.</p>

<sec id="section4-0885728811427157">
<title>Current Study</title>
<p>Despite increased awareness regarding the importance of C-LOC, SOC, and SPSS, less is known about the importance of these factors among adolescents with disabilities. Furthermore, we know of no studies that have investigated these constructs concurrently to estimate their cumulative and unique contributions to the school- and career-related adjustment of adolescents with disabilities. Based on prior research pertaining to adolescents and adults with and without disabilities, our specific research hypotheses were as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0885728811427157" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Student ratings of C-LOC, SOC, and SPSS would make a significant cumulative contribution to teacher and student ratings of school- and career-related adjustment</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Each predictor (i.e., C-LOC, SOC, and SPSS) would also make a unique (independent) contribution to each of the school- and career-related indicators.</p></list-item>

<sec id="section6-0885728811427157">
<title>Context and Sample</title>
<p>The sample for this study included 211 students with disabilities from three high schools in the state of Oregon. Two of the schools were located in a large metropolitan area and the majority of students (67%) were drawn from these two settings. The remaining students were selected from a third school located in a small town. Students were recruited by nine different teachers. Five of these teachers recruited two classrooms of students from their teaching schedule, whereas the other four teachers recruited only one classroom of students. Participants were drawn from classrooms throughout the school day, including Periods 1 (11%), 2 (27%), 3 (15%), 4 (14%), 5 (18%), and 7 (16%). Overall, there were 254 students attending these settings. However, for the current analysis, 10 students who were part of a community transition program were excluded due to the fact that these young adults were older and were not attending school on a regular basis. An additional 7 youth were dropped from the study because they were not receiving special education services at the time of the study, and 26 more were excluded because they had large sections of missing data or were absent during data collection. Thus, the final study sample included 211 students or 83% of the original target sample.</p>
<p>Approximately 61% of the participants were male, and students were distributed across 9th (24%), 10th (26%), 11th (21%), and 12th (29%) grades. The mean age of students was 16.5 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.33. The racial group demographics of the sample were White (64%), African American (9%), Latino (9%), Multiracial (11%), Native American (5%), and Asian or Pacific Islander (3%). All of the participants were school-identified students with disabilities. The majority (72%) was diagnosed with specific learning disabilities, 7% were classified as having mild intellectual disabilities, 7% had a diagnosis of Autism, 8% were classified as having emotional disturbance, and 6% had Section 504 labels of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0885728811427157">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Data were gathered from students and their teachers. Students completed a self-report instrument that contained items pertaining to C-LOC, SOC, and SPSS. Students also completed measures of their own vocational outcome expectations (VOE) and vocational skills self-efficacy (VSSE). Teachers completed measures of students’ occupational skills, problem behaviors, school engagement, academic competence, and estimated grade point averages (GPAs).</p>
<sec id="section8-0885728811427157">
<title>C-LOC Scale</title>
<p>The <italic>C-LOC Scale</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885728811427157">Millar &amp; Shevlin, 2007</xref>) is a 20-item self-report instrument used to measure adolescents’ perceptions of generalized LOC (internality and externality) within the context of career decision making. Five items are designed to measure an internal C-LOC (e.g., “If I am going to get the job I want I will have to do well and try hard”), and 15 items measure an external orientation (e.g., “Luck is the most important factor in determining whether I will get the job I want”). In the current study, 6 items from the original scale were selected based on the strength of their factor loadings on the original study sample. Items with the highest loadings on the original internality and externality scales were selected based on proportion of items on each scale (2 internal, 4 external). For the current analysis, external items were reverse scored and summed with the internal items such that higher total scores reflect greater internal C-LOC. The Cronbach’s alpha on this adapted measure for the current sample was .67 (<italic>M</italic> = 17.07, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.87).</p>

<p>Student perceptions of SOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885728811427157">Gresham &amp; Elliott, 1990</xref>) were measured by this 39-item self-report form for secondary students. This instrument contains four latent factors pertaining to cooperation (e.g., “I ask before using other people’s things”), assertiveness (e.g., “I make friends easily”), empathy (e.g., “I feel sorry for others when bad things happen to them”), and self-control (e.g., “I ignore other children when they tease or call me names.”). Student ratings are provided on a 3-point scale ranging from 1 = <italic>never</italic> to 3 = <italic>very often</italic>. This widely used instrument has strong psychometric properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885728811427157">Gresham &amp; Elliott, 1990</xref>). For the current study, a total score was calculated by summing student responses across all 39 items.

This instrument has been shown to have good test–retest reliability (<italic>r</italic> = .83–.88), adequate internal consistency (α = .92–.94), and evidence of concurrent validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885728811427157">D’Zurilla &amp; Nezu, 1990</xref>).

These scales were selected because they represent both of the broader constructs measured by the instrument (Problem Orientation and Problem-Solving Skills) and because these two particular subscales are highly correlated with the other subscales within each of the higher order factors. Responses are provided on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 = <italic>not at all true</italic> to 5 = <italic>extremely true</italic> with higher scores indicating greater endorsement of problem-solving skills. For the current analyses, these scales were totaled to provide an overall SPSS. The coefficient alpha for the derived SPSS scale was .76 (<italic>M</italic> = 50.50, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.12).</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Students were assessed in late May prior to the end of the school year. Student assessments were administered by a research assistant and a faculty member in collaboration with each classroom teacher. To help ensure that all students understood items, all of the survey items were included on one single survey document and formatted to appear as one continuous survey. Students were instructed to answer each question to the best of their ability, and one researcher read all items aloud while the second researcher and teacher moved around the room to assist individual students as needed. Students who felt comfortable reading and responding to items were permitted to move through the survey at their own pace but were asked to stop at the end of each section (page) and wait to start the next section as a group. Completion of student surveys took approximately 50 min (i.e., one class period). Two attempts were made to administer make-up assessment sessions for students who were absent on the day of initial testing. These attempts were made during the week directly following initial testing, and approximately 12% of data were gathered through follow-up assessments. Teacher surveys were completed during the same 2-week period as student assessments.</p>

<sec id="section20-0885728811427157">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Correlational analyses of all predictor and outcome variables were conducted followed by two separate sets of hierarchical regression analyses, which evaluated the extent to which the three individual skill variables (i.e., C-LOC, SOC, SPSS) predicted career-related and school-related adjustment. One set of regression analyses focused on student self-report outcomes (i.e., VOE, vocational self-efficacy), and the others focused on teacher-report outcomes (i.e., occupational skills, problem behavior, school engagement, academic competence, and GPA). In both cases, disability status was entered on the first step of each equation followed by the three predictors, which were entered on Step 2. The change in the squared multiple correlations (i.e., <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) between Steps 1 and 2 was used to evaluate the relative contribution of the individual skill variables to child and teacher ratings of career- and school-related adjustment after controlling for disability type.</p>

<title>Zero-Order Correlations</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885728811427157">Table 1</xref>, modest associations were observed among the three predictors with SPSS having the highest association with C-LOC (<italic>r</italic> = .423, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and SOC (<italic>r</italic> = .462, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). The three predictor variables were also modestly associated with student self-reports of outcome expectations and VSSE (<italic>r</italic> = .216, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 to <italic>r</italic> = .588, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Associations between the student-rated predictors and teacher ratings of career- and school-related adjustment were less consistent and varied according to construct. For example, C-LOC and SOC had statistically significant associations with each of the five teacher-rated variables (range: <italic>r</italic> = −.247, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 to <italic>r</italic> = .254, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), whereas SPSS had a significant association with only two of these variables (problem behavior: <italic>r</italic> = −.156, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; GPA: <italic>r</italic> = .176, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Finally, modest to strong associations between the criterion variables were observed providing some support for the validity of these measures of school- and career-related adjustment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between individual skills and student and teacher ratings of school- and career-related adjustment. As a group, the three predictors did contribute to the school- and career-related indicators examined here, a finding that confirms our first hypothesis regarding the cumulative importance of these specific skills as predictors of student adjustment across these domains. It is also noteworthy, however, that the set of skill predictors accounted for between 7% and 11% of the variance in teacher ratings of adjustment, which represents a relatively small proportion of the variance and far less than what was observed in the regressions involving student ratings. There are several possible explanations for this finding including potential problems with the measures selected, inflated estimates on the student-to-student analyses due to same-source error variance or the possibility that there are other important predictors of these outcomes that were excluded. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0885728811427157">Test and colleagues (2009)</xref> identified 16 evidence-based predictors for improving postschool outcomes. Of these predictors, only SOC was included in this investigation as our main interest was to explore additional variables believed to contribute to adjustment among transition-aged students. A goal of future research should be to study the unique predictive power of C-LOC, SOC, and SPSS when combined with additional predictors that were not included in the present analyses. Such efforts would allow for a more complete understanding of skills, factors, and processes that contribute to both the school- and career-related adjustment of adolescents with disabilities.</p>
<p>Our second hypothesis was that each of the individual skills (i.e., C-LOC, SOC, and SPSS) would make a unique contribution to each regression equation. Our findings indicated that the strength of the associations between the individual predictors and criterion variables varied as a function of data source (student or teacher) and the specific predictor and criterion variable under study. For example, SOC was meaningfully related to student ratings of outcome expectations and VSSE, suggesting that students with higher SOC have greater confidence in their vocational skills as well as a more optimistic outlook regarding their future career. SOC <italic>also</italic> made unique contributions to the equations involving teacher ratings of school- and career-related adjustment. These findings are consistent with prior research among students with and without disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885728811427157">Benz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0885728811427157">Segrin &amp; Flora, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0885728811427157">Strahan, 2002</xref>) and suggest that SOC are a relatively robust predictor in the sense that these skills were significantly associated with adjustment across school- and career-related domains regardless of data source.</p>
<p>In addition to SOC, C-LOC also emerged as an important predictor, particularly of teacher-rated occupational skills and school-related adjustment. These findings are consistent with prior research showing that global LOC is associated with school engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885728811427157">Finn &amp; Rock, 1997</xref>). However, our findings extend prior findings by showing that LOC measured in the context of careers is also related to school adjustment indicators such as engagement, academic competence, and grades. Moreover, C-LOC made an independent contribution to teacher ratings of students’ occupational skills. Together, these findings suggest that it is important to develop students’ C-LOC by making explicit connections between their own efforts and subsequent academic and postschool outcomes as well as teaching strategies to reduce faulty attributions of causation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885728811427157">Lebedina-Manzoni, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885728811427157">Luzzo, James, &amp; Luna, 1996</xref>). In one example of such instruction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885728811427157">Luzzo et al. (1996)</xref> used short videos to retrain the attributions of college freshman by showing students videos of college graduates recounting their experiences while pursuing their career goals. In these videos, the graduates emphasized the importance of their own hard work in achieving their goals. Results of this study showed that students in the experimental group showed significant increases in the controllability and causality dimensions associated with career decision making after completing the intervention, suggesting that this approach may be beneficial for building these skills. Similar interventions designed to improve the academic- and career-related adjustment of adolescents with disabilities may prove fruitful in the context of secondary classrooms.</p>
<p>Contrary to our hypotheses, SPSS was not a unique predictor of teacher-rated adjustment and was associated with only one of the student-rated outcomes (VSSE). Our measure of SPSS included items pertaining to recognizing social problems and generating alternative solutions to them. In the current investigation, skills in this area did not appear to be a robust predictor of adjustment when evaluated alongside C-LOC and SOC.</p>
<sec id="section26-0885728811427157">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>Growing pressures on schools pertaining to accountability coupled with declining resources in many school districts require teachers and school administrators to make hard choices about what should and should not be included in classroom curriculum and student programming. Although it would be premature to make any broad recommendations based on the correlational findings presented here, the current study represents an effort to identify robust malleable individual skills that may be predictive of functioning across multiple domains. Identifying such skills is important because they potentially provide teachers, administrators, and other school personnel with an opportunity to target skills that improve student functioning across multiple contexts. Based on our findings, we would recommend that teachers and other school personnel consider implementing curricula to teach C-LOC and SOC. Several commercially available products are available that could be used to teach these skills in the context of secondary classrooms. For example, the Working at Gaining Employment Skills (WAGES; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885728811427157">Johnson, Bullis, Benz, &amp; Hollenbeck, 2004</xref>) curriculum is designed for use with adolescents and contains specific units pertaining to LOC, teamwork, and communication skills. Each unit contains between 5 and 11 lessons and the entire curriculum can be delivered in as little as 9 weeks. This curriculum is relatively affordable (approximately US$35), and it is comprehensive in the sense that both of the skills identified as important in the current study are included within the scope of WAGES.</p>
<p>In addition to curricula that provide instruction in multiple areas, there are a number of widely accessible comprehensive SOC programs for high school–aged students. In a recent literature review of interventions to teach social and communicative skills, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885728811427157">Alwell and Cobb (2009)</xref> found that while the duration and intensity of such interventions varied, they did share many common features including group instruction, role-play, modeling, feedback, and discussion. The results of this review suggest that improving the SOC of transition-age youth with disabilities is not only possible but models are also available to assist teachers in creating their own curricula.</p>
<p>Other curriculum designed to improve other transition skills such as self-determination often include specific lesson plans to teach LOC and SOC. For example, Whose Future Is It Anyway? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0885728811427157">Wehmeyer et al., 2004</xref>) and Steps to Self-Determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885728811427157">Field &amp; Hoffman, 1996</xref>) include comprehensive lesson plans to teach communication skills and autonomy in decision making. Moreover, a recent randomized control trial of the “Whose Future Is It Anyway?” curriculum indicates that the curriculum is effective in promoting self-determination among adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0885728811427157">Wehmeyer, Palmer, Lee, Williams-Diehm, &amp; Shogren, 2011</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section27-0885728811427157">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This investigation suffers from several important limitations that should be considered with the findings. First, these data are correlational in nature and offer no evidence of causality. As a result, the exact nature of the relationship between C-LOC, SOC, and SPSS and measures of school- and career-related adjustment cannot be fully determined. A second limitation is that these data were gathered from a relatively small sample drawn from three high schools, which limits the generalizability of the findings. A third limitation is that student ratings of C-LOC, SOC, and SPSS did not account for a large amount of variance in <italic>teacher</italic> ratings of adjustment. Although these models were statistically significant, the large amount of unexplained variance brings into question the robustness of our set of student-rated variables in predicting teacher-rated indicators of student adjustment.</p>

<sec id="section28-0885728811427157">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Identifying robust malleable factors that are predictive of the school- and career-related adjustment of adolescents with disabilities is an important educational objective. Growing demands and dwindling resources in many school districts will require secondary transition researchers and practitioners to identify factors and processes that improve student functioning in multiple domains of functioning and across multiple contexts. Our findings suggest that SOC and C-LOC are individual skills that potentially provide such benefits. Systematically implementing and evaluating efforts to build these skills along with future research designed to identify additional salient predictors has the potential to improve secondary transition programming and the academic- and career-related adjustment of youth with disabilities in the contexts of schools and communities.</p>
