<abstract>
<p>This article describes the evaluation of an online study skills course unit designed, using evidence-based principles, to support undergraduate students. A mixed-methods approach was employed to establish the extent to which the unit was (a) fit for purpose and (b) effective. Data were obtained from an online survey (<italic>n</italic> = 63) conducted on entry to the unit and on exit several months later and from face-to-face interviews with students (<italic>n</italic> = 12). Moderate to large positive and statistically significant changes between entry and exit measures of student knowledge and confidence in a variety of study-related skills were identified in the survey data. Positive data regarding confidence were also evident in the interview data, which further revealed that, although the unit was generally seen as fit for purpose, there were some issues regarding feedback to students and the supporting face-to-face tutorials that were provided. The literature would benefit from larger-scale and more robustly designed research in this area.</p>

<title>Study skills support and online learning</title>
<p>Study skills support for undergraduates is support that facilitates students to successfully achieve the recognized outcomes of a university-level education such as those outlined in the QAA’s <italic>Framework for Higher Education</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469787412441298">QAA, 2008</xref>). These outcomes can be loosely grouped into several ‘skills clusters’: <italic>self-management skills</italic>, which are underpinned by reflective abilities and an awareness of individual learning styles and idiosyncrasies; <italic>data and knowledge acquisition skills</italic>, which include skills relating to resources and technologies like libraries and the Internet; <italic>interpretative, critical and analytical skills</italic>; and oral and written <italic>communication skills</italic>. The majority of study skills support delivered in British higher education (HE) addresses most, if not all, of these skills clusters, though in implementing such support, arguments tend to favour subject-specific support rather than simple ‘bolt-on’ support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469787412441298">Cottrell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469787412441298">Durkin and Main, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469787412441298">Elander, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1469787412441298">Wingate, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The provision of study skills support for undergraduates has a number of purported benefits. There are claims that it can bolster transferable skills such as communication, teamwork and research skills, foster student independence, enhance intellectual development, promote a deeper approach to learning, increase self-confidence and self-efficacy in students, assist with the process of academic and professional socialization, and decrease attrition arising from academic failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469787412441298">Bailey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469787412441298">Cottrell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469787412441298">Durkin and Main, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469787412441298">Fergy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469787412441298">Gettinger and Seibert, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469787412441298">Lea and Streat, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the purported benefits of study skills support and the fact that such support has been a commonplace activity in HE for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469787412441298">Kirshenbaum and Perri, 1982</xref>), there is surprisingly little evaluative evidence in the literature. Much of the contemporary literature takes the form of expert opinion or descriptive accounts of initiatives rather than empirical research, and the little empirical evidence that is available is often small-scale and qualitative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469787412441298">Bailey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469787412441298">Fergy et al., 2008</xref>). Interest in investigating study skills support seems to have peaked during the latter half of the twentieth century when a number of comprehensive literature reviews were carried out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469787412441298">Entwisle, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469787412441298">Kirshenbaum and Perri, 1982</xref>); indeed, and with some irony, most of these reviews called for further, robust evaluative work – a call that has not necessarily materialized in the ensuing years.</p>
<p>Study skills support not only produces potential benefits for individual students, it can also have institutional benefits in that it can help attenuate many of the challenges currently affecting HE institutions worldwide. These include challenges associated with the expansion in student numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1469787412441298">Schofer and Mayer, 2005</xref>), the related widening participation agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469787412441298">HEFCE, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1469787412441298">Usher and Cervenan, 2005</xref>), rapid advances in technology, student demands for more flexible learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469787412441298">Collis and Moonen, 2001</xref>) and a trend towards independent learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1469787412441298">Wilde et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, in many disciplines and institutions, the need for such support is often amplified by several interrelated factors: lower entry requirements compared with other institutions or disciplines; a disproportionate number of ‘non-standard’, mature or second-career entrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1469787412441298">HESA, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469787412441298">Robinson and Griffiths, 2008</xref>); financial penalties for student drop-out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469787412441298">Pryjmachuk et al., 2009</xref>) and complaints that secondary education ill prepares students for HE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1469787412441298">Wingate, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Online learning is a potential solution to many of the demands facing HE: the expansion in student numbers, demands for more flexible learning, and the move towards independent learning in particular. Online learning offers flexibility to both students and teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469787412441298">Bartolic-Zlomislic and Bates, 1999</xref>), and it can enhance higher-order learning while concurrently reducing the workload of teachers and producing significant cost savings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469787412441298">Fox and MacKeogh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1469787412441298">Twigg, 2003</xref>). Online learning can take many forms, from pure distance learning (with no face-to-face contact) to ‘repositories’ (where printed course materials are replicated online to support a traditional face-to-face course) to more ‘blended’ approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469787412441298">Bonk and Graham, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1469787412441298">McKimm et al., 2003</xref>). Many educators prefer blended learning because pure distance learning can elicit negative experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469787412441298">Farrell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1469787412441298">Ruiz et al., 2006</xref>) and because it is hard to see how a simple repository might promote online <italic>learning</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1469787412441298">McKimm et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Blended learning is a pragmatic approach in that it draws out the beneficial aspects of a variety of learning approaches. ‘Guided discovery’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469787412441298">Mayer, 2004</xref>) is, similarly, a healthy compromise between two competing ideologies that both offer some benefits to learning: ‘constructivist’ models of learning (pure discovery with little or no teacher guidance) and ‘pure instruction’ models (teachers teach, guide and provide feedback). A key feature of guided discovery is ‘scaffolding’, the hints, examples, direction, coaching and feedback that help the student reach his or her objectives. Scaffolding is closely related to formative assessment; indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469787412441298">Shephard (2005)</xref> argues the two are essentially the same.</p>
<p>Offering opportunities for formative work and feedback is a crucial element of high-quality course design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469787412441298">Fox and MacKeogh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469787412441298">Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick, 2006</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469787412441298">Song et al. (2004)</xref> argue that course design is the cornerstone of successful online learning. Other elements of course design that appear to be implicated in successful online learning include <italic>interactivity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469787412441298">Sims, 2006</xref>), a <italic>team approach</italic> involving both content and technology experts and critical feedback from colleagues and students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469787412441298">Bartolic-Zlomislic and Bates, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1469787412441298">Sims, 2009</xref>), <italic>enjoyment</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469787412441298">Chatzoglou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469787412441298">Chiu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469787412441298">Lee et al., 2009</xref>) and a <italic>sense of community</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469787412441298">Song et al., 2004</xref>). Online learning can be thwarted, however, by time constraints, unclear objectives, conflict with personal preferences and technical problems, including poor Internet access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469787412441298">Song et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1469787412441298">Yu et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Face-to-face contact is usually present in blended learning, often in the form of tutorials. Tutorials that provide opportunities for interactivity, scaffolding, feedback and community support are thus likely to enhance the quality of any blended learning approach.</p>
<p>From the literature, it is clear that coupling elements of successful course design with a blended learning approach and guided discovery principles should elicit a high-quality online learning experience for students. However, few educators have tested this notion empirically (through the canvassing of student views, for example) and little, if any, research is available in this area – certainly not as far as study skills support is concerned. Thus, one aim of the current study was to explore whether a notionally well-designed online study skills course unit was ‘fit for purpose’, that is, whether or not it met or exceeded student expectations. Moreover, since there are few, if any, recent studies that have looked at the effectiveness of study skills support and none that have looked at the effectiveness of <italic>online</italic> study skills support, a second aim of the current study was to test the effectiveness of such a notionally well-designed course unit, that is, to test whether it could produce measurable changes in student knowledge, skills or attitudes.</p>

<title>The study skills course unit</title>
<p>The course unit was designed as a first-year, blended learning unit using the virtual learning environment (VLE) <italic>Blackboard Vista</italic>. Its design was underpinned by guided discovery principles and the design principles for successful online courses described in the literature. Its content was geared towards the ‘skills clusters’ described earlier. Though much of the content was generic, it was tailored to the discipline (nursing) because of the arguments against ‘bolt-on’ study skills support in the literature. For similar reasons, it was integrated into the overall programme of study being credit rated at 10 ‘FHEQ Level 4’ credits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469787412441298">QAA, 2008</xref>). The course unit consisted of eight smaller ‘components’, each of which ended with a compulsory task that the student needed to complete (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1469787412441298">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>An introductory face-to-face lecture was held at the beginning of the unit, after which components were released in pairs on a weekly basis over four weeks. Students were allocated timetabled time to complete the activities. Compulsory face-to-face group tutorials were held a week after each component pair was released, and two optional tutorials were provided at later dates. To enhance flexibility, students were given six months to complete all of the compulsory activities. The unit was assessed on a pass/fail basis with a pass (and subsequent award of credits) being contingent on completion of all eight compulsory tasks. Students were able to complete each task an unlimited number of times to improve their score.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Quantitative data were collected using an online survey embedded into the VLE that was administered twice in the same format: prior to the students commencing the course unit (on entry) and some months later when the unit had been completed (on exit). The survey consisted of a series of 45 questions that attempted to measure the cognitive, psychomotor and affective domains of Bloom’s taxonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469787412441298">Bloom, 1956</xref>), more commonly referred to as <italic>knowledge, skills</italic> and <italic>attitudes</italic>. ‘Knowledge’ was measured using 24 multiple-choice questions directly related to the unit content that elicited a single ‘knowledge score’ ranging from 0 to 24. Because the survey required students to self-assess, ‘skills’ were not measured directly; instead, the students were asked to rate, on a scale from 1 to 10 their confidence regarding nine study-specific skills (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1469787412441298">Table 2</xref>). While recognizing that confidence in undertaking a skill is not the same as being able to competently perform a particular skill, confidence is an important aspect of self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469787412441298">Bandura, 1997</xref>) and, since high self-efficacy is associated with successful performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469787412441298">Lane and Lane, 2001</xref>), confidence is a not unreasonable proxy for performance. In addition, 12 study-related ‘attitudes’ were measured via a semantic-differential scale. Some basic demographic data – age, sex, highest qualification on entry and ethnicity – were also collected. The survey data were imported into <italic>SPSS for Windows</italic> (v.15.0.1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1469787412441298">SPSS Inc, 2007</xref>) and subjected to routine data-cleaning techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469787412441298">Pryjmachuk and Richards, 2007</xref>). Exploratory data analysis revealed non-normal distributions, thus non-parametric tests of comparison were used to compare entry and exit measures with the median as the measure of central tendency and <italic>r</italic> (= <italic>z</italic>/√<italic>N</italic>, where <italic>N</italic> is the total number of observations) as the effect size measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469787412441298">Field, 2009</xref>). Statistical significance was achieved where <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05.</p>

<p>Participants for the qualitative aspects were purposively recruited by the course unit tutors so that there was a mix of genders, ages, previous exposure to HE and whether or not English was the student’s first language. A £20 gift voucher was given to each qualitative participant for their time. The qualitative data were obtained via a series of individual and focus group interviews undertaken by PW, an experienced and independent qualitative researcher. Two separate focus groups were held: one while the students were still actively engaged with the course unit and a second after it was completed. In addition, individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with a small number of students. Prior to the interviews, PW undertook ‘desk research’ to familiarize herself with the course unit. Prompt questions for the interviews fell into four main categories: the practicalities of taking the course unit (‘when, where and how’); course content, including assessment; the tutorials; and the overall view of the unit within the broader context of first-year study. Each interview was digitally recorded and subsequently transcribed by PW. The focus groups and individual interview data were pooled together to enhance ‘data richness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469787412441298">Lambert and Loiselle, 2008</xref>) and, once the data were pooled, PW undertook a preliminary thematic analysis, which was subsequently reviewed by other study team members to elicit a definitive analysis.</p>

<title>Results 1: quantitative (effectiveness)</title>
<p>While 166 out of 260 students (63.8%) provided valid responses for the entry survey, only 63 students (24.2%) provided valid responses for both the entry and exit surveys. Consequently, only a small subset provided data that enabled the course unit’s effectiveness to be tested. This subset, however, did not appear to be qualitatively different from the larger group (<italic>n</italic> = 103) who chose to complete only the entry survey, since no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups on the full range of demographic and test variables collected at entry, other than on one of the attitude items.</p>
<p>Of the subset who completed both surveys, 55 (87.3%) were female, most (<italic>n</italic> = 47; 74.6%) described themselves as ‘White British’ and most (<italic>n</italic> = 40; 63.5%) entered the course with FHEQ Level 3 qualifications (British ‘A’ Level or equivalent). Their mean age was 28.5 years.</p>
<p>Overall, the median total knowledge score was 14/24 (58.3% correct) at entry and 17/24 (70.8% correct) at exit (<italic>z</italic> = −5.882, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>r</italic> = −0.52), a large (<italic>r</italic> &gt; 0.5) and statistically significant change. In terms of changes in confidence, there were statistically significant changes in all of the confidence items, all of which were moderate to large in size (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1469787412441298">Table 2</xref>). Unlike the confidence items, the changes on the attitude items from entry to exit were relatively inconsequential overall and have thus been disregarded. Four items did show statistically significant differences, though changes were detected in the median scores for only two of these items and in both cases the effect size was relatively small.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1469787412441298">
<title>Results 2: qualitative (fitness for purpose)</title>
<p>Twelve students were interviewed: ten in two focus groups supplemented by two who were individually interviewed. Almost all of the participants (<italic>n</italic> = 11) were women, most (<italic>n</italic> = 9) were ‘mature’ students aged 25 or more, a third (<italic>n</italic> = 4) did not see English as their primary language and almost half (<italic>n</italic> = 5) had already been exposed to HE.</p>
<sec id="section10-1469787412441298">
<title>Access: where, when and how</title>
<p>Students accessed the unit both at home and on campus, with the majority – especially the more mature students – preferring access from home. Patterns of working were varied: some used tutorials as deadlines for submitting work but others did not; some set regular time aside; some did a large block of work one week and less another. While all of the students had used computers before, many had not previously encountered <italic>Blackboard Vista</italic> and had initial difficulties navigating the course unit because of this. Some were concerned about the anti-social aspects of online study. One student posted on the course unit’s discussion board:<disp-quote>
<p>When I started my course I wasn’t under the impression that it involved so much online learning at home and I feel a little lonely in a sense . . . Overall at the minute I’m not feeling very positive about online learning . . . (Female, &lt; 25 years)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Whatever their initial difficulties, those interviewed felt that using <italic>Blackboard Vista</italic> within the supportive context of the study skills unit helped prepare them for when they encountered the VLE elsewhere in their course. The gaining of online learning skills and the sense of achievement in doing so contributed to increased confidence, not only in those with little prior experience of <italic>Blackboard Vista</italic>. As one student remarked:<disp-quote>
<p>I think the study skills course has maybe given me more confidence in terms of my knowledge around electronic resources as a whole . . . It’s forced me to put a discussion up on <italic>Blackboard</italic> – those kind of things which I would have shied away from. (Individually interviewed female, ≥ 25 years)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1469787412441298">
<title>Course unit design, language and structure</title>
<p>All the students said they found the language very clear and easy to understand; one student, who did not have English as her first language, commented that there were ‘no accents online’, an advantage often overlooked in online communication. They felt that the course unit flowed easily and appreciated the graduated structure: ‘. . . basic, then one step higher, so the higher you go the more you have to think . . .’ (focus group female, &lt; 25 years).</p>
<p>The course unit was described as ‘entertaining’, ‘interesting’, ‘fun’, and it was largely seen as a well-designed online course, though some students had some specific criticisms. One student, who already had a degree, remarked that for her it was just ‘tick, tick, tick and away’ (that is, not sufficiently challenging) and perhaps the unit could have been structured differently for different people, but then conceded that this was probably the best approach for such a diverse group – a view that most of the students held. As one student put it: ‘I think you can only cover the middle ground really because people at either extreme are always going to have different things that they may need’ (focus group female, ≥ 25 years).</p>
<p>Participants expressed differing reactions to individual components. A few found some components – the structure of HE (component 1) and using the Internet (component 3), for example – ‘patronising’, ‘a waste of time’, ‘common knowledge’ and were impatient at having to cover what they felt they already knew. Others, often to their surprise, found these components very useful. One student found component 1 particularly interesting, appreciating how it demystified various academic qualifications. The sections dealing with the library (component 4), literature searching (component 5), referencing (component 7), and writing skills (component 8) were widely appreciated. A number of students remarked that they would have liked to have seen more on reflection in the unit since it plays such an important role in their learning and professional development.</p>
<p>The tasks were felt to be pitched at the right level and were useful for the application and practice of skills. The unlimited attempts the compulsory tasks allowed were welcomed – ‘not many places where you get a second chance’ – though some concerns about (essentially pointless) cheating were raised.</p>
<p>There were differing views, however, as to whether the <italic>Blackboard Vista</italic>-generated numerical marks for tasks 1, 5, 7 and 8 constituted feedback or not; as one student put it, ‘it was just a mark’. Many wanted more specific and personal feedback to help them improve. Others commented that they did get this in tutorials and through email contact with the course unit tutors. A majority were unhappy with the term ‘acceptable’ for the short written assignments; they saw it as negative and would have preferred a more nuanced response. Many wanted more personal feedback on their writing – ‘just to know if I’m on the right track’ – but recognized the difficulties involved with such a large cohort. Model answers (as provided in the referencing task, for example) were not generally seen as feedback.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1469787412441298">
<title>Tutorials</title>
<p>The compulsory face-to-face tutorials were the most contentious area of the whole course unit. Indeed, one student who described a tutorial as ‘interesting and valuable’ and one who described a tutorial as ‘totally useless’ were surprised to discover they were both talking about the same event! In the first focus group, the majority of students were dissatisfied with the tutorial sessions and suggested radical change: discontinue them, make them more structured and focused, or simply make attendance voluntary. Most felt the tutorial groups should have been smaller than the 25–30 student subgroups. Some felt the tutorials were not needed since the course unit was self-explanatory, though the majority of the first focus group seemed to think tutorials would be of most value to older students who have been out of education for some time. The reaction of most members of the second focus group confirmed this view. All were mature students returning to education and all said they valued tutorials as a way to address problems, pose questions and make ‘personal representation’ as opposed to communication by email.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1469787412441298">
<title>Overall value and continuing application of the study skills course unit</title>
<p>Overall, some students felt that having to do the unit was at odds with their status as independent, adult learners but others argued that if it was voluntary they would probably not have done it and thereby have missed out on a useful resource. Even those students who doubted that the unit should be compulsory rated it highly. Asked to express, in marks out of 10, how far this unit met its aims, the majority rated it between 8 and 10.</p>
<p>Aspects of the course unit which students felt were of particular relevance and value have already been mentioned: referencing, using the library, literature searching and critical writing skills. One participant remarked that without this unit many students would have waited till they were doing their first assignment to find out how to do these things – and would have struggled. While all of the students were glad the unit would continue to be available to them post-completion, those interviewed after they had completed it had had few occasions to apply some of the skills they had learnt; the time had been taken up mainly by clinical placements and revision. Consequently some were still unsure – and unconfident – about carrying out activities such as literature searching and referencing.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section14-1469787412441298" sec-type="discussion|conclusions">
<title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>The key results from this study are that an online study skills course unit, designed using evidence-based principles, can produce benefits for students, especially in terms of increased confidence, and that course unit designs need to be evaluated by users because, despite what the literature says and the good intentions of designers, disparities and design errors can occur.</p>
<p>In terms of benefits to students, it is debatable, despite a large and <italic>statistically</italic> significant change, whether a mere three-point increase on a 24-item multiple-choice questionnaire from course unit entry to exit has what might be termed ‘educational significance’. The findings in relation to confidence, however, are more robust in that the quantitative and qualitative data consistently suggest that the unit improved student confidence in study-related skills. Nevertheless, that confidence is merely a proxy measure of performance makes it is difficult to draw anything more than a tentative conclusion, and it is telling that many of those interviewed, although they felt more confident, felt they needed more <italic>practice</italic> in applying their newly found skills.</p>
<p>Although the overall design of the unit largely met student expectations (especially in terms of interactivity, flexibility and enjoyment), there were particular issues with feedback and the tutorial arrangements.</p>
<p>While the formative work (the compulsory tasks) was seen as valuable, the manner in which it was employed was not entirely unproblematic given that many students were unhappy with the feedback processes associated with the tasks. In trying to understand the issues with feedback, judging the procedures and processes used against the criteria that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469787412441298">Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick (2006)</xref> identify as the determinants of high-quality feedback provides some clues as to the students’ discontent. Feedback was not necessarily provided with reference to predefined criteria nor was it necessarily timely, both in the sense of the time delay from submission to feedback and in the sense of the point in time at which students wanted feedback. While the self-tests did provide immediate feedback as a score and/or model answers (which those interviewed certainly did not see as feedback), feedback for the written tasks might not have been available until a few weeks after submission. When it was available, the grading of ‘acceptable’ or ‘not acceptable’ was seen as unhelpful which, in retrospect, is hardly surprising given that students need <italic>corrective</italic> or <italic>diagnostic</italic> advice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469787412441298">Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick, 2006</xref>) and students also need to know what to <italic>do</italic> with feedback once it is received (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1469787412441298">Burke, 2009</xref>). These design errors are easily rectifiable, however. For example, future iterations of the course unit incorporated more specific and timely feedback via use of the ‘grading forms’ function in <italic>Blackboard Vista</italic>.</p>
<p>Aside from feedback, the main issue students had concerns about was the tutorials. Since the follow-up tutorials, in particular, were designed to provide scaffolding and community support, it was surprising to find such antagonism towards them, especially since none of the students interviewed felt that they belonged to an online learning community. It may be that other elements of the course unit design (interactivity and a sense of enjoyment, for example) made the tutorials redundant for many of the students, or the tutorials may not have been flexible enough (in terms of group size and focus) to meet individual student needs. Whatever the case, not wanting face-to-face tutorials creates something of a quandary for course units designed within a philosophy of blended learning. Perhaps the students got a sense of community elsewhere, with the people they sat next to in seminars or lectures at the beginning of the year, for example. Given that the students had to concurrently take other course units, the majority of which were face-to-face, it could be argued that blended learning was an overarching feature of the <italic>entire programme</italic> and not just individual course units. Indeed, both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1469787412441298">Ruiz et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1469787412441298">Yu et al. (2007)</xref> argue that online learning should exist amidst other models of teaching and learning as part of an <italic>overall</italic> blended learning strategy.</p>
<p>Like all studies, this study has limitations that impinge on the validity and applicability of the findings. Firstly, only a single cohort of students in a single discipline in a single university was examined, so it is difficult to generalize the findings. Secondly, for both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the study, only those students who felt sufficiently stimulated by the unit to comment may have taken part. Thirdly, the quantitative measures were unvalidated (a relatively common problem in educational research; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469787412441298">Attree, 2006</xref>) because they were designed primarily as course-evaluation, rather than psychometric, tools. Nevertheless, given the educational and survey-methods expertise of the study team, it could be argued that the online survey had a reasonable degree of face and content validity and, given that Cronbach’s alpha for the entry survey was 0.799, a good level of internal reliability. The quantitative aspect of the study also suffered from a low response rate, which was particularly acute in the exit survey. Moreover, the study lacked a control, so while the quantitative changes in knowledge and in confidence regarding specific study skills were observed, it is hard to say with any certainty that that these changes were down to the course unit or down to other factors such as the familiarization with HE that students experience through the mere passage of time.</p>
<p>Clearly, further research in this area needs to be carried out, particularly research using large samples with validated measures and some sort of control to overcome the shortcomings identified above. However, this small-scale, multiple-methods evaluative study does provides some empirical evidence that study-skills support can be delivered effectively online so long as evidence-based principles are used in the course design, and that online support of this kind can improve student knowledge and confidence in study-related skills.</p>
