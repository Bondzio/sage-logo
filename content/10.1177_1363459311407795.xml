<p>When I first looked at the title of Helen Stanton Chapple’s book <italic>No Place for Dying: Hospitals and the Ideology of Rescue</italic>, I imagined that she would report lots of negative details about hospital emergency rooms (ERs) and intensive care units (ICUs) to convince the reader that deaths full of unnecessary suffering occur in hospitals. Although she does describe events surrounding the deaths of a number of patients, Chapple’s main theme reflected in the title of the book is that: ‘To be acceptable in the U.S. hospital, death should happen with as little dying as possible’ (p. 224). Neither the dying patient nor the dying process has status in the US hospital, especially the ICU part of the hospital; however, Chapple argues at the end of her book, this situation can and should be changed.</p>
<p>A number of other anthropologists and sociologists have studied end-of-life care and death in the ICU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363459311407795">Cassell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459311407795">Guillemin and Holmstrom, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311407795">Kaufman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363459311407795">Moller, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311407795">Zussman, 1992</xref>). In her ethnographic study of deaths in a Catholic community hospital and a teaching hospital (during 2003 and 2004), Chapple found many of the same situations described by earlier authors. However, she differentiates her work from the others’ as she posits the cultural and economic engine powering the ICU as ‘the ideology of rescue’ and the consequent ritual of healthcare professionals in the ICU, which she conceptualizes as the ‘ritual of intensification’.</p>
<p>According to Chapple, the ideology of rescue in US culture arises from the veneration of ‘technology, individualism, equality, and heroism’ (p.10), which allows the country to pretend that all citizens are treated equally. In the atmosphere of emergency, all patients receive heroic, highly technological treatment: ‘Now that critical care had been invented, triage <italic>on the basis of the patient’s clinical condition</italic> could be the new “impartial” discrimination’ (p. 75). In addition, because of the support of rescue within society and medicine, ‘rescue as industry’ (p.129) is an acceptable basis for hospital financial health. Chapple devotes an entire chapter to explain how practices such as the use of ICD-9-CM coding to establish insurance reimbursement reify rescue and stabilization of patients, but abandon the dying of patients. From her perspective, the biggest failure of both bioethics and what she calls ‘the revival of the death movement’ (p. 88) is that they do not challenge ‘the dominance of rescue’ (p. 16).</p>
<p>The ideology of rescue continues to endure because of the hardiness of the view of death as unnatural and ‘socially contaminating’ (p. 83). If death is unnatural, an accident, then it must be resisted: ‘Staving off death is the definition of legitimacy and of endorsable, reimbursable care in the hospital’ (p. 90). The ‘<italic>ritual of intensification</italic>’ (her italics) (pp.88–89) begins when patients remain alive, but they do not improve. Chapple describes the ritual of intensification as ‘an obligatory redoubling of [clinicians’] efforts’ (p. 89) to try every possible measurement or procedure to stabilize and bring patients back to health. As the ritual progresses, patients must not be designated as dying, until every bodily system has failed to respond to every effort to stabilize and repair. The problem, according to Chapple, is that ‘the ritual of intensification takes on a life and impetus of its own’ (p. 90). In other words, the ritual is a series of events characteristic of both individuals and the system much like the ‘cascade effect’ described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459311407795">Stein and Mold (1988)</xref>. The worst part of the ritual of intensification, Chapple says, is the end of it, when the system pressure to ‘“move things along”’ (a concept she borrows from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311407795">Kaufman (2005))</xref> finally pushes the clinicians to define the patients as dying: ‘The urge toward the resolution of uncertainty metamorphoses into generalized suffering and pressure to close down the ritual’ (p. 187). The professionals’ suffering becomes the patients’ suffering, as the former work to use the right language to get the family on board with the idea of death so that the patient can be moved out of the public space of the ICU to the private, failed space of hospice somewhere else in the hospital or in the patients’ homes. This is both death construction and death management, according to Chapple.</p>
<p>Whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363459311407795">Moller (1990)</xref> has described the whole hospital as isolating patients from society, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311407795">Philpin (2007)</xref> has described the ICU itself as isolating patients from public view and interaction, it is important to Chapple to maintain the ICU as public, as opposed to palliative care and hospice as private, because she wants to describe the ritual of intensification as a damaged ritual. She compares this ritual to the rite of passage articulated by anthropologist van Gennep.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[R]ites of passage that occur during important life transitions include three consecutive phases: rites of separation that move the person apart from society; rites of transition that enact the transformation; and rites of incorporation to bring the person back into society in her new position. The ritual of intensification would satisfy the middle portion, the rite of transition, but it has turned the rite of passage itself on its head. Instead of being followed by a rite of incorporation, the ritual of intensification works backward to isolate the person who is dying from society at large. (p. 269)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Chapple’s solution to the low status of dying patients, reflected in the near disappearance of them out of the public space of the ICU, is a rite of incorporation, which would ‘accord stature to the person who is dying, as a pilgrim, an older soul’ (p. 271) with every right to remain in the public space because death is acknowledged as real and natural. I’m not sure that this use of van Gennep’s rite of passage works. Chapple may be confusing the ICU as a reflection of public American values with the ICU as a public location. Her description of the rite of intensification sounds much more like the ‘rites of intensification’ (p. 485) developed and articulated by anthropologists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363459311407795">Chapple and Coon (1942)</xref>, which they clearly distinguished from van Gennep’s rites of passage. Whereas rites of passage are associated with such events as births, marriages or deaths of individuals, rites of intensification, in contrast, ‘help to reinforce the habitual relations within the society, and their relative elaboration is a function of the gravity of the disturbance which it is their purpose to allay’ (p. 528). Chapple’s rite of intensification, the steps of which she has so well explained, seems more like a method of reinforcing the habitual relations involved in rescue, made necessary because of what she sees as the dominant American cultural view of death – an unnatural, grave disturbance.</p>
<p><italic>No Place for Dying</italic> is a significant book within the tradition of medical anthropology and sociology about death. Although I can, perhaps, especially appreciate this work because I once wrote an article entitled ‘The NICU culture versus the hospice culture: Can they mix?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459311407795">Butler, 1986</xref>), the general public, as well as scholars and clinicians in medicine, will enjoy this book. It is fast moving, and her style of writing wonderfully blunt. For example, when she talks about the rescue focus on body parts instead of persons, she says, ‘Finitude is faced down by specialization into infinity’ (p. 81) and ‘people write advance directives for themselves, not for the separable organ systems around which biomedicine arranges itself’ (p. 89). In another example, she says, ‘Technology becomes the currency of justice, entitlement, and hope … [It] transforms the taint of economics in medicine into a blaze of emancipatory and cultural power deployed for social good’ (p. 138). I highly recommend this book.</p>
