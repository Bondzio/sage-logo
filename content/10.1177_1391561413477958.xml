<p>The Brookings Institution and the National Council of Applied Economic Research held a conference on 13–14 July 2010, in New Delhi, the outcome of which is this book titled <italic>India Policy Forum 2010–11</italic>. This book comprise of five different papers covering topics related to services sector, corporate profits, infrastructure, political reservation and institutions—all with respect to India, mostly covering post-reform period, that is, starting early 1980s. It is to be noted that reforms in the form of economic liberalization actually started during early 1980s, with full-fledged reforms in the form of globalization (in addition to liberalization) taking place since early 1990s.</p>
<p>The first paper by Barry Eichengreen and Poonam Gupta examines the question of whether the rapid growth in service sector is inclusive in nature, that is, able to absorb vast mass of population stuck in the agriculture sector. Popular perceptions suggest that skill and education requirements of modern service sector jobs make them impractical destination for the rural masses. If this is true, then it has bad implication for distribution of income. Particularly, because agriculture sector in India explains only 15 per cent of the national income while employing around 57 per cent of the population. The concern is if service sector continues to grow fast, and India fails to supply quality labours, then the growth of service sector cannot be sustained. Sceptics point out that whatever absorption is happening is taking place for the low-end type jobs, such as informal sector, personal service and public administration, with limited spillovers and relatively little scope for productivity improvement. Categorizing service sector into three groups—traditional service sector (such as wholesale trade, transport and storage, public administration, etc., with low value addition), modern service sector (such as financial service, legal service, etc., with very high value addition) and hybrid of modern and traditional service sector (such as health, social work, hotels and restaurants, etc.)—this paper finds little evidence to support that labour absorption is happening only in traditional service sector. Hence, the perception that the growth of service sector has simply disguised manufacturing activities is not correct. The implication is that it is no longer obvious that the manufacturing sector is the exclusive destination for the vast majority of Indian labour moving into the modern sector, or that modern services are a viable destination only for the highly skilled few. To test the hypothesis, the authors ran regression for the period between 1970 and 2005. One limitation of this paper is the failure to capture data revisions that have happened in the national account statistics during this time period.</p>
<p>The second paper by Ashoka Mody, Anusha Nath and Michael Walton addresses the question whether the liberalization during the last two decades has led to increase in competition, characterized by innovation and growth, or because of profiteering through increase in market power of the large firms, making it difficult for the new firms to enter. While the authors consider various indicators of market structures, the main focus of their analysis is the evolution of the profit rate at the firm level for the period starting liberalization. Their sample consists of all firms with turnover of more than `2.5 crores, and covers the period between 1989 and 2010. The results suggest that the story of corporate expansion in India for the period following late 1980s is more because of increase in innovation and growth in the face of increased competition, rather than concentration of market power and economic entrenchment. This is in spite of concerns raised by other authors over the continued importance of public sector ownership and of the business house organizational form. Profits realization during post-reform period is because of increase in economic efficiency, and there is a strong relation between increase in firm-level profitability and the resultant increase in market share. On the contrary, results suggest limited evidence in favour of market expansion because of economic entrenchment. As objective of firms may vary, one limitation of this paper is the failure to draw conclusions by segregating firms according to economic objectives. For instance, profits in all the sectors in the Indian economy are not driven by same set of variables. For some sectors it may be the market, in others it may be rent seeking. Many firms in the real estate, mining and telecommunication are driven by rent-seeking objective, and hence it would have been better to separate out these firms while running regressions.</p>
<p>The paper by Ram Singh addresses an important issue which is to understand why there is cost and time overrun (read, delay) for the infrastructure projects in India. The author considers 17 projects with reference to road and railways. The literature cites several factors, such as delays in land acquisition, shifting of utilities, environmental and inter-ministerial clearances, shortage of funds, litigations over land acquisition and contractual disputes, as the reasons for the cost and time overruns. The paper finds that since 1980s there has been a drop in cost and time overruns, although both exists. Cost overruns have systematically declined not only in absolute terms but also as a percentage of project cost. Similar is the case with delay. The analysis suggests that incompleteness of project designs and contracts may be one of the leading causes behind delays and cost overruns observed in public procurement of infrastructure in India. This is more pronounced for the railway sector in comparison to the road sector. The contract management for the former is much poorer relative to the latter. The incompleteness of designs and contract results in an addition to the list of the project works in the middle of the construction phase. Additional works naturally add to the project cost and the execution time leading to delay and time overruns. Changes in the ongoing work cause wastage of resources, apart from delays in implementation. The wastage becomes increasingly pronounced with increase in project size or its complexity. The empirical findings suggest that compared to the non-construction projects, those involving construction are more susceptible to cost overruns. In comparison to other sector projects, roads, railways, and urban development projects are more vulnerable to cost overruns. A better initial designing may help reduce delays and cost overruns, especially in the railway sector that suffers from poor project coordination. One limitation of this study is the failure to capture how different macroeconomics regimes, such as foreign exchange controls, industrial delicensing and ability to borrow from outside India, etc., may influence the project cost.</p>
<p>The paper by Lori Beaman, Esther Duflo, Rohini Pande and Petia Topolova examines whether there is a need for gender-based affirmative-action policies in India. Despite recent progress in India towards social inclusion and empowerment of women, their representation in national policy and law-making bodies remains low. This raises question about how well women’s interest are represented, and are heard at the national level. Literature suggests that women have different policy preference than men, and elected leaders tend to implement policies in line with their own personal policy preferences, regardless of earlier campaign promises. There are two main concerns in using affirmative action to redress gender imbalances in politics. The first has to do with effectiveness of affirmative action in empowering women. If female underrepresentation in politics reflects a women’s low status within the household, then reservation may not effect any significant change. Husbands of elected female leaders may maintain power by controlling the action of their wives. The second point is regarding crowding out. Women’s reservation may crowd out representation for other historically disadvantaged groups (presumably because women from these groups are less likely to stand for election) such that gains for one disadvantaged group come at the expense of another. Working with data involving political reservation for women in the village councils, this paper finds that because of women’s reservation there is no evidence of crowd-out of other disadvantaged groups (here Muslims). The finding also suggests that female leaders increase female participation and responsiveness to female concerns in village meeting, thus changing the nature of policy activism across Indian villages.</p>
<p>Finally, the paper by T.N. Srinivasan and Jessica Seddon Wallack focuses on the evolution of institutions, namely, the Planning Commission (PC) and the Finance Commission (FC)—the two bodies responsible for intergovernmental transfers of funds from centre to the states, and the rules governing this transfer. Planning Commission was created to advice the centre on planning and plans for national development, whereas Finance Commission was created to ensure that the states have predictable and stable resources, and autonomy in their use. In practice, Finance Commission has played a limited role. On the contrary, Planning Commission has played a much larger role in allocating transfers than advising would necessarily imply. As a transfer mechanism, it facilitates central government’s oversight of state development policies and has ample scope for central government’s discretion in transfers. This paper finds that there will be limited change in intergovernmental transfer system, something that is worrisome, given India’s ability to adjust economically and politically to changing circumstances. Not only does conventional public finance theory favour decentralization of decision-making with respect to the financing and provision of public goods and services, as in the case with heterogeneous society, but there is a need to hear from the people at the grass-root level about their local requirement. This is based on the presumed notion of heterogeneity across localities, districts, states or region within a country, and above all preferences of their residents reflecting the trade-offs among the various goods and services they would like to see provided as well as their shares in financing of their provisions.</p>
