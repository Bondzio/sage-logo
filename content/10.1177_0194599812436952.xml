<body>
<p>For most medical conditions, diagnosis and decisions regarding treatment are reached on the basis of a combination of symptoms, signs, and confirmatory testing. In this regard, laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is an anomaly. Until recently, the diagnosis of LPR was typically made in one of a few ways: (1) symptomatic response to empiric treatment with a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), most frequently measured as improvement in a patient’s Reflux Symptom Index (RSI); (2) endoscopy-assessing patterns of mucosal injury/inflammation, most frequently described using the Reflux Findings Score (RFS); or (3) observation of acidic reflux events using a pH probe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812436952">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although originally conceived as a measure of symptomatic response to treatment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812436952">2</xref></sup> many clinicians worldwide have come to consider a pretreatment RSI of 13 or greater to be consistent with a diagnosis of LPR. While the presence of any of the endoscopic findings that comprise the RFS may raise suspicion for LPR, none are pathognomonic,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812436952">1</xref></sup> and as yet, the RFS has not been validated in a large-scale randomized trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812436952">3</xref></sup> Twenty-four-hour ambulatory pH monitoring has long been considered the gold standard method for the diagnosis of LPR, as this gives the clearest picture of reflux events over time. However, the original double-lumen pH probes used for monitoring are large, expensive, and not well tolerated by patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812436952">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812436952">5</xref></sup> As such, confirmation of the diagnosis of LPR with pH testing has become the exception rather than the rule in clinical practice. More recently, an oropharyngeal pH probe (Restech Dx-pH probe) has been developed that is better tolerated by patients and has been shown to be reliable in the detection of reflux events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812436952">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812436952">6</xref></sup> Despite the availability of this technology, many clinicians continue to treat patients for LPR on the basis of clinical symptoms with or without abnormal examination or pH findings.</p>
<p>There are many theories proposed to explain why meta-analysis of recent studies does not confirm the clinical efficacy of PPIs in the elimination of LPR symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812436952">7</xref></sup> One of the proposed explanations is that many patients with symptoms of LPR do not really have acidic reflux and are therefore not helped by PPI therapy. In a previously published study, we demonstrated significantly better success in improving LPR symptoms in patients with an abnormal pH study (using the Dx-pH probe) compared with patients treated empirically on the basis of their symptoms and examination findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812436952">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this study is to clarify the relationship between the RSI and the pharyngeal pH environment in a large group of patients assessed for LPR; specifically, we hope to better define the relationship between abnormal RSI (≥13) and an abnormal Dx-pH study. We hypothesize that symptom severity should correlate strongly with pH abnormality in this patient population.</p>
<sec id="section1-0194599812436952" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Methods and Materials</title>
<p>This study was conducted as a retrospective analysis of data extracted from a prospective computerized database. Approval for this review study was granted by the Advocate Health Care Institutional Review Board (Park Ridge, Illinois).</p>
<sec id="section2-0194599812436952">
<title>Initial Patient Pool</title>
<p>Potential subjects were identified from a list of more than 500 adult patients (aged &gt;18 years) seen at a single clinical site (Advanced Center for Specialty Care, Chicago, Illinois), who underwent 24-hour ambulatory pharyngeal pH monitoring between January 2009 and June 2011.</p>
<p>In keeping with the current standard of practice at our center, pH testing was offered to all patients in whom a diagnosis of LPR was suspected. All patients underwent laryngopharyngeal endoscopy. An RSI of 13 or greater and/or the presence of any endoscopic findings suggestive of LPR (based on those comprising the RFS) were considered indications to offer confirmatory pH testing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0194599812436952">
<title>Inclusion Criteria</title>
<p>Inclusion criteria for review of data were: (1) completed 24-hour pharyngeal pH monitoring with Dx-pH probe, (2) complete pH data including Ryan Score available, (3) patient not on a PPI at the time of study or within 2 weeks of study date, (4) pretest RSI data available, (5) data on the history of smoking available, and (6) other demographic data including age at time of study, sex, and body mass index (BMI) at time of study available.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0194599812436952">
<title>Reflux Symptom Index</title>
<p>The RSI is a validated 9-item questionnaire for assessing treatment outcomes in LPR. Patients indicate the severity of their LPR symptoms on a scale from 0 to 5. The scores are then combined, resulting in the overall RSI score. The RSI ranges from 0 (asymptomatic) to 45. An RSI of greater than 13 is considered to be clinically significant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812436952">2</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599812436952">
<title>Endoscopy</title>
<p>Patients undergoing fiber-optic laryngoscopy for the assessment of reflux symptoms or other indications were offered pH testing if any of the following features were present: subglottic edema, ventricular obliteration, diffuse or arytenoid erythema, vocal cord edema, laryngeal edema, hypertrophy of the posterior commissure, granulation, or thickened laryngeal mucus. All patients had laryngeal findings recorded. Multiple examiners, however, described qualitative findings without recording RFS. For this reason, the objective oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal findings comprising the RFS were not used for statistical analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0194599812436952">
<title>24-Hour pH Monitoring</title>
<p>The diagnosis of LPR was confirmed by 24-hour pH monitoring using a wireless probe (model Dx-201 Dx-pH Probe; Restech Respiratory Technology Corporation, San Diego, California). Probe calibration and monitoring were performed as described in a previous publication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812436952">8</xref></sup> A Ryan Score was calculated using the provided Dx-pH DataView Lite software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0194599812436952">
<title>Calculation of Ryan Score</title>
<p>At pH thresholds of 5.5 upright and 5.0 supine, the Ryan Score is calculated based on 3 values:</p>
<list id="list1-0194599812436952" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>the number of episodes of pH falling below the established pH threshold,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the duration of the longest episode during which pH remains below the threshold, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the percentage of total time spent below the threshold.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A patient is considered to have significant LPR if the software-generated Ryan Score is greater than 9.41 when the patient is in the upright position or greater than 6.81 when the patient is in the supine position.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812436952">9</xref></sup> These cutoff values represent a combination of data points for pharyngeal pH that lie outside the 95th percentile of the general population at these specified pH thresholds.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0194599812436952">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>One hundred sixty-three patients met all of the above inclusion criteria and had data included for review. Patients were divided into 2 groups on the basis of a positive or negative Ryan Score (70 positive, 93 negative).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0194599812436952">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<sec id="section10-0194599812436952">
<title>Between groups</title>
<p>Demographic data (age, sex, BMI, history of smoking) and pretest RSI were compared between groups. The proportion of patients with RSI ≥13 was also compared between groups and used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).</p>
<p>The 3 Ryan Score parameters (described above) were compared between groups for both the upright and supine positions at a range of pH thresholds (6.5, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0).</p>
<p>Between groups, the 2-tailed independent Student <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare differences in continuous variables, and χ<sup>2</sup> analysis was used to test the association between categorical variables.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0194599812436952">
<title>Between RSI ≥13 and RSI &lt;13</title>
<p>Our 163 patients were then recategorized according to RSI ≥13 (n = 88) versus RSI &lt;13 (n = 75). χ<sup>2</sup> analysis was used to test the independence of patient demographic factors (sex, BMI, history of smoking) from RSI ≥13.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0194599812436952">
<title>Linear regression</title>
<p>The DataView Software was modified to allow us to calculate the total percentage time below any given pH threshold, in addition to upright and supine Ryan parameters. RSIs from all 163 patients were then plotted against these values obtained at pH thresholds 6.5, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, with RSI acting as an independent variable. Regression analysis was performed to determine the correlation (coefficient of determination, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) between these variables.</p>
</sec>

</sec>
<sec id="section13-0194599812436952" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 163 patients who underwent pH testing are included in this study (69 men, 94 women; mean age 50.9 ± 16.9 years). Following pH testing, patients are then separated into either the Ryan Score–positive (n = 70) or Ryan Score–negative (n = 93) group. Baseline characteristics for these 2 groups including age, sex, BMI, history of smoking, and RSI are compared in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812436952"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. A statistically significant difference in BMI is noted between the groups (Ryan positive 30.47 ± 8.22; Ryan negative 27.44 ± 5.84; <italic>P</italic> = .012). The groups are otherwise homogeneous. No significant difference in RSI is found between Ryan-positive and Ryan-negative patients (<italic>P</italic> = .161). A positive Ryan Score is found to be independent of an RSI ≥13, as determined by χ<sup>2</sup> analysis (<italic>P</italic> = .701). Using these same data, the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for RSI ≥13 are calculated (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812436952"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The diagnosis and treatment of LPR is primarily important because of the high proportion of ENT symptoms related to reflux. In addition to more common complaints, serious conditions such as subglottic stenosis and laryngeal carcinoma have also been linked to LPR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812436952">10</xref></sup> pH testing is considered the gold standard for diagnosing LPR; however, the diagnosis is most frequently made on the basis of symptoms (with or without abnormal endoscopic findings) and response to empiric treatment.</p>
<p>There are 2 pitfalls to this latter approach. First, the degree of concurrence between symptom severity (RSI) and pH findings as reported in the literature is inconsistent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812436952">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812436952"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812436952">13</xref></sup> Second, although effective for controlling symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, resolution of LPR symptoms with PPI treatment has been reported in the range of 58% to 75%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812436952">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812436952"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812436952">16</xref></sup> and a meta-analysis found response to be no better than placebo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812436952">7</xref></sup> Recent studies implicating PPIs as a cause of osteoporosis have also made patients more wary about accepting treatment without a firm diagnosis.</p>
<p>The goal of this study was to clarify this relationship between abnormal symptomatology and abnormal pH findings in patients being assessed for suspected LPR. In examining one of the largest series of patients reported to date (n = 163), we hypothesized we would be able to correlate the RSI with oropharyngeal pH findings (particularly percentage time below pH thresholds). That BMI was found to be higher in the Ryan-positive patient group is not surprising, considering obesity is a recognized risk factor for both gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and LPR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812436952">1</xref></sup> However, that no significant difference in RSI was seen between the groups was unexpected. Contrary to our hypothesis, Ryan positivity was found to be independent of RSI abnormality, and no correlation was found between RSI and any component of the Ryan score at any pH threshold greater than 5.0, including total percentage time below each threshold. Our values of sensitivity 55.71%, specificity 47.31%, PPV 44.31%, and NPV 58.67% contrast with those documented in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812436952">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812436952">13</xref></sup> and go against our expectations.</p>
<p>Based on the standards for the diagnosis of GERD on esophageal monitoring,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812436952">1</xref></sup> the widely accepted definition of LPR on dual-probe testing has been a single episode of pH &lt;4 or 1% total time spent below pH 4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812436952">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812436952">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812436952">7</xref></sup> Despite the diagnostic utility of dual-lumen pH testing, its popularity has waned because of patient discomfort and the invasive nature of the procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812436952">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812436952">5</xref></sup> Other studies have reported poor sleep and dysphagia with the use of similar probes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812436952">17</xref></sup> In the event that the patient cannot maintain his or her normal diet and activity during the testing period, the results generated may not be truly representative of his or her disease.</p>
<p>Recently, an oropharyngeal probe developed by Restech has been introduced for the diagnosis of LPR. The sensor does not require fluid or tissue contact for electrical continuity, detects both liquid and aerosolized acid, and resists drying.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812436952">9</xref></sup> Several studies have demonstrated the reliability of this probe in detecting reflux events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812436952">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812436952">6</xref></sup> Some went further to suggest that because of the gradient of increasing pH from the lower esophagus to the oropharynx and the discovery that laryngeal mucosal damage can occur at higher pH values because of the prolonged activation of gastric pepsin, the original diagnostic threshold of pH &lt;4 needed revision when using the Dx-pH probe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812436952">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812436952">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 2009, DeMeester/Ayazi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812436952">9</xref></sup> developed the Ryan Score. Parameters for the calculation of this score have since been validated at pH 5.5 while upright and 5.0 while supine. While a positive Ryan Score has been accepted as the definition of significant LPR, it has been suggested that data obtained at higher pH thresholds be studied to further define a spectrum of disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812436952">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Historically, RSI ≥13 has shown good correlation with abnormal pharyngeal pH findings on dual-lumen probe testing at the pH threshold of 4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812436952">11</xref></sup> This comes as little surprise, as the abnormal RSI threshold of 13 was originally derived by calculating the 95% confidence interval (CI) of patients who tested negative using this same probe and pH threshold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812436952">2</xref></sup> Musser et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812436952">11</xref></sup> compared RSI findings to dual-lumen probe findings at pH thresholds of both 4 and 5. Their data suggested that there is a statistically significant correlation between RSI and events at a threshold 4 but no such association at 5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812436952">11</xref></sup> In the current study, using a different testing modality (Dx-pH probe) and diagnostic threshold (Ryan parameters and percentage time below pH levels between 5 and 6.5), we find very little correlation between severity of symptoms and pH abnormality. In scrutinizing this phenomenon, several questions are raised:</p>
<list id="list2-0194599812436952" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1. Could symptom severity be linked to a different mechanism of laryngeal damage/irritation, rather than the pH environment itself?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Multiple prospective studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812436952">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812436952"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812436952">20</xref></sup> and review articles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812436952">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812436952">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812436952">21</xref></sup> have discussed the role of gastric pepsin in laryngopharyngeal mucosal damage. Pepsin is activated from precursor pepsinogen at low pH in the stomach, but becomes irreversibly inactivated only at pH levels in excess of 6.5. Partially inactivated pepsin may become reactivated if reexposed to acid at a pH &lt;6.5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812436952">20</xref></sup> Since the Dx-pH probe measures pH at the nasopharyngeal level, pH levels at the hypopharynx may be lower. Reactivated pepsin may therefore be playing a role in LPR even with a normal Dx-pH study.</p>
<p>Smoking is another potential laryngeal irritant that may contribute to a higher RSI; however, in our patient population, an RSI ≥13 is found to be independent of a history of smoking (<italic>P</italic> = .581).</p>
<list id="list3-0194599812436952" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>2. Could anxiety or depression be playing a role in our population, through either symptomatic overreporting or underreporting by affected patients?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Oyer et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812436952">12</xref></sup> examined the correlation between RSI and pH-metry in groups of patients with and without a prior or current diagnosis of anxiety/depression. Looking at Dx-pH probe-confirmed LPR specifically, in the nondepressed group, they describe a PPV of 87.5% and NPV of 75% for an RSI ≥13. When combined with the depressed group, the overall PPV and NPV fell to 65% and 66.6%, respectively. Given that the drop in PPV was far greater than the drop in NPV, we can infer that patients with anxiety and depression are much more likely to overreport rather than underreport their symptoms.</p>
<p>Applying this knowledge to our own results, if we assume that anxiety and depression are playing a role in our population, we will observe artificial deflation of our PPV (44.3%). However, our NPV is far less likely to be influenced. The NPV of 58.7% is potentially one of the most important findings in our study, as this suggests that more than 40% of patients with an RSI &lt;13 will have a positive Ryan Score.</p>
<list id="list4-0194599812436952" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>3. Given our findings for the diagnostic utility of the RSI, might sensitivity and specificity be improved using a different RSI threshold?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Adhering to the premise of the original RSI validation study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812436952">2</xref></sup> in our patient population, the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for RSI in those with a negative Ryan Score is found to be 17.3. Using RSI ≥17 as a discriminatory cutoff, sensitivity and specificity are found to be 45.7% and 59.1%, respectively. PPVs and NPVs are unchanged. The lack of sensitivity and specificity of LPR symptoms for the presence of confirmed disease in our study strengthens the argument for adopting a multimodal approach for the diagnosis of LPR.</p>
<p>An obvious limitation in performing the hypothetical analysis (described in discussion point 3) is that the 95% CIs for RSI in our Ryan-positive and -negative groups overlap, whereas patients with normal and abnormal pH findings in the original study were statistically distinct in this regard. All RSI values used in our analysis were isolated recordings, and as such, we are unable to take into account the potential for temporal variability. When considering smoking as a potential confounding factor, our analysis was limited to a positive or negative history of smoking only. In future studies, it may be useful to correlate a pack-year history of smoking with symptoms.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In our population of patients with suspected LPR, we are unable to identify any pretest characteristics or RSI threshold that can reliably distinguish those who will test positive using the Dx-pH system from those who will not. Our recommendation is that the diagnosis of LPR, and treatment decisions in particular, should be made only once evidence from a combination of sources (symptoms, endoscopic findings, and objective testing) has been considered.</p>
