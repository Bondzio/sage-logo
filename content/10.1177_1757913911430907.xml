<p>‘<italic>The foundations of adult health are laid in early childhood and before birth’</italic> (WHO 2003)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Public health has historically been closely related to and integrated within midwifery practice. However, more recently the role of the midwife has come to the fore with the focus on the impact of pregnancy, the reproductive period and early years of life on longer term health.</p>
<p>Within the UK, the Marmot Review highlights, as its primary objective, that every child should have the best start to life. This places the midwife firmly at the centre of public health policy. Midwifery 2020,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913911430907">1</xref></sup> was set up to review the work of midwives and their contribution to women’s experiences of pregnancy and childbirth including a specific strand focusing on the public health role of the midwife. Evidence based pre and postnatal interventions that reduce adverse outcomes and promote well-being in pregnancy and infancy are needed to achieve this policy objective. We conducted a systematic review of reviews on the public health role of the midwife which was incorporated into the final public health report. A number of effective interventions that could promote public health which are currently part of routine midwifery care were highlighted in the review however overall systematic review evidence of effectiveness in this area was limited. Three key areas were identified as central to the future public health role of midwives: reducing the social gradient through promoting well-being and preventing ill health; enabling children to have the best start in life through early intervention; and the opportunity for midwives as co-ordinators of care to identify vulnerable groups.</p>
<p>Reducing the social gradient in order to promote well-being and prevent ill health has significant implications for the delivery of care, particularly in relation to how public health interventions are implemented across the childbearing population. Viewing health inequalities in society on a gradient means that greater intensity of action can be directed towards those with greatest disadvantage, which is particularly relevant in the current economic context. Internationally, there has been a shift away from relying solely on measures of mortality and morbidity to reflect global health to include measures of well-being. This policy shift to support the measurement of well-being as an outcome is of particular value for midwifery care where the goal for most women is enhancement of well-being rather than absence of illness.</p>
<p>Ideally, ensuring the best start in life begins even before conception but for the midwife a major opportunity to contribute to maternal and child health is through antenatal care. The perinatal period is a time when women are in regular contact with health care services and midwives are in a key position to educate and support women in relation to health and well-being, to identify women who are vulnerable and require additional support or services. Antenatal care provides the overarching mechanism to facilitate the delivery of education and support in relation to pregnancy, childbirth and parenting. However many antenatal interventions used by midwives have not been evaluated for example the effectiveness of the content, delivery and format of antenatal education classes on birth outcomes.</p>
<p>The third key area is the potential for midwives to identify vulnerable groups of women and co-ordinate their care. The Marmot Review highlighted a number of vulnerable groups who need additional support through policy and practice including those with mental illness, disability or chronic illness, ethnic minorities, asylum seekers and those on low incomes. Midwifery led models of care are recommended for most women and for those women with significant medical or obstetric complications there is also a role for midwives to be involved in their care. The final report from Midwifery 2020 also identifies the midwife as the lead health professional to promote well-being for women with straightforward pregnancies, and it also outlines a pivotal role for midwives in coordinating the journey through pregnancy for all women, ensuring they are referred to other services where appropriate and that holistic care is provided to optimise each woman’s birth experience regardless of risk status.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, more obvious professional leadership in public health is required to optimise the impact of midwives on the long term health of the population. A shift is already evident with the appointment of consultant midwives with a specific public health remit. However to achieve current policy objectives more leadership is required in the development and implementation of effective public health interventions which are midwifery led. Midwifery and public health are inextricably linked. It is therefore important in going forward that the midwifery profession and those external to the profession work together to identify and implement effective care in the perinatal period that can have significant short, medium and long term impact on the health and well-being of women and their families.</p>
