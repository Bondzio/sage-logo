<abstract>
<p>Severe pulmonary involvement in malaria has been frequently reported in cases of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infection but rarely in vivax malaria. We look at a case of a 38-year-old man living in a malaria endemic area who presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by <italic>P. vivax</italic>. DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed that it was not a mixed infection. After specific antimalarial therapy and intensive supportive care, the patient was discharged from the hospital. This case illustrates that <italic>P. vivax</italic>-induced ARDS is not uncommon and should be readily recognized by the treating physicians. A confirmatory test with PCR is required in order to exclude <italic>P. falciparum</italic> co-infection.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0049475513485733" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Malaria is endemic in many countries in South America and Asia. Malaysia is considered as a low-sensitivity for malaria country. All four species of malarial parasites can be found there and the fifth type of malaria, also known as simian malaria, has been reported in the country over the past few years.</p>
<p><italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> infection has been regarded as a benign malaria, whereas <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> have the potential to cause severe, life threatening complications such as acute renal failure, acute cerebral oedema and, less commonly, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We report a case of <italic>P. vivax</italic> infection that presented with atypical features for such a benign disease.</p>
<sec id="sec2-0049475513485733" sec-type="cases"><title>Case description</title>
<p>A 38-year-old man was admitted to Hospital Sultanah Nur Zahirah, Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia, suffering from a high grade fever, headache and vomiting. He had been well until four days prior to admission, when he started to experience high grade fever and headache. This was later followed by nausea and an episode of vomiting. He also had mild abdominal pain but no diarrhoea. He also denied any muscle or joint pain. On the day of admission, he complained of a worsening of the headache and onset of mild chest discomfort.</p>
<p>He was a smoker, worked in a private oil and gas company and travelled abroad, especially to the South East Asian countries, quite frequently. Two weeks prior to the onset of the fever, he visited one of the states in India during his business trip and spent about 2 weeks there. He had no history of previous malaria infection and had not received anti-malarial prophylaxis.</p>
<p>Thirty-six hours after admission, he complained of a rapidly progressive onset of shortness of breath and was coughing out minimal blood streak sputum. Clinically he looked toxic; the conjunctiva was not injected. He was: mildly tachypnoeic with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min; tachycardic with pulse rate 120 beats/min; his admission temperature was recorded at 38.6°C; blood pressure was 130/80. Using a high flow mask, his oxygen saturation was maintained at more than 96% of 10 L/min. Lung examination revealed equal air entry on both sides of the lungs and no additional sounds were heard. His liver was mildly tender. All other examinations were uneventful.</p>
<p>Initial investigation showed: moderate thrombocytopenia with platelet of 41,000; aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 176 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 263 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was 225 IU/L; and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was 50.4 s. However, his renal function was normal and urine output was reasonably good at 40 to 50 mL/h. A chest radiograph showed the classical appearance of ARDS evidenced by the presence of mixed reticulo-nodular opacity associated with thickening of right transverse fissure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0049475513485733">Figure 1</xref>)<bold>.</bold>
<fig id="fig1-0049475513485733" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Patient's chest radiograph on the day of admission showing generalized reticulo-nodular opacities consistent with ARDS.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0049475513485733-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The patient was treated for acute leptospirosis complicated by ARDS. He received an intravenous ceftriaxone of 2 g daily together with an intravenous azithromycin of 500 mg daily. Arterial blood gases showed a Type 1 acute respiratory failure. He was subsequently transferred to the medical intensive care unit where non-invasive mechanical ventilation was pursued.</p>
<p>Twelve hours later, he suffered another episode of shortness of breath with oxygen saturation under bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ranging from 85% to 88%. A repeat chest X-ray shows worsening features of ARDS. He was then intubated and connected to a synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilator (SIMV) mode. However, he further deteriorated and required high concentrations of inspired oxygen with high pulmonary end expiratory pressure in order to maintain adequate oxygenation. Subsequently he became persistently hypotensive requiring inotropic support. Streaks of blood and blood clots were present in the endotracheal tube (ETT). The coagulation profile was normal and screening for the disseminated intravascular coagulation was negative.</p>
<p>A blood film for malaria parasites was positive for <italic>P. vivax</italic>, with the parasitaemia level of 16/µL blood for asexual and 3/µL blood for the sexual form. The possibility of mixed infection could not be ruled out. Due to the severity of the manifestations and inability to rule out <italic>P. falciparum</italic> co-infection, intravenous artesunate 130 mg (2.4 mg/kg) loading dose followed by 65 mg (1.2 mg/kg) 12 hours later then daily was given for 7 days. Oral primaquine 15 mg daily was given the next day for 2 weeks.</p>
<p>The parasitaemia was cleared after 3 days of treatment. The patient made progressive improvement, reducing the requirement for ventilator support, and he was discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU) on day 7. A repeat chest radiograph a week later showed a marked resolution of lung haziness. Dengue immunoglobulin G and M (IgG, IgM) were negative. The leptospirosis and melioidosis serology were negative. Confirmation of <italic>P. vivax</italic> mono-infection was made via molecular detection of <italic>P. vivax</italic> DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR for H1N1 was negative. No organism was isolated from the blood.</p>

<p>Malaria due to <italic>P. vivax</italic> typically runs a benign course and is not known to cause severe complications. However, mild complications arising from this infection have been reported. The most commonly recognized associated parameters in <italic>P. vivax</italic> infection are mild to moderate thrombocytopenia and raised transaminases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0049475513485733">1</xref></sup> Quite recently, several pulmonary syndromes in severe vivax malaria have been described, such as ARDS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049475513485733">2</xref></sup> acute pulmonary injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0049475513485733">1</xref></sup> and interstitial pneumonia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0049475513485733">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>ARDS is a recognized complication in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria and, thus, it is important to exclude a mixed infection in non-falciparum infection. Respiratory complications in <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria are often under-diagnosed. Scattered cases of <italic>P. vivax</italic> causing severe malaria have been reported in the last 30 years. To our knowledge, there are only a few well-documented reports of ARDS in <italic>P. vivax</italic> infected cases. In a small number of cases, the confirmations of mono-infections were made through molecular detection of <italic>P. vivax</italic> DNA, i.e., by PCR.</p>
<p>Evidence is emerging that <italic>P. vivax</italic>-associated ARDS is a condition whose underlying pathophysiology is likely to reflect processes that are independent of parasite sequestration in the pulmonary microvasculature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0049475513485733">4</xref></sup> The number of parasites present in the lung tissue appeared to be mild compared with the host leukocyte response and the degree of hyperparasitaemia. In this case there was a relatively low level of peripheral parasitaemia but the patient presented with a severe form of ARDS. This observation raises the possibility that end organ damage in fatal malaria caused by <italic>P. vivax</italic> may be unrelated to parasite load within failing organs and may be a result of an exaggerated intravascular inflammatory response.</p>
<p>A literature review by Price et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0049475513485733">5</xref></sup> found that, for most patients, severe pulmonary complications of vivax malaria usually appear from 6 h to 8 days following the initiation of anti-malarial treatment. Significant respiratory symptoms or radiographic abnormalities appeared after the initiation of antimalarial treatment, leading to the postulation that pulmonary involvement is a result of an inflammatory response after the treatment (paradoxical reaction).</p>
<p>However, in this case, the respiratory symptoms developed much earlier, that is, before the initiation of antimalarial treatment. This suggests that severe pulmonary involvement is not necessarily a consequence of an inflammatory response produced after anti-malarial treatment.</p>
<p>In order not to overlook the possibility of mixed <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection, all patients should be subjected to a thorough diagnostic evaluation which should include: repeated and meticulous peripheral blood film (PBF) examinations; a rapid diagnostic test for malaria based on detecting specific <italic>Plasmodium</italic> lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) antigen by using monoclonal antibody directed against isoforms of the enzyme; and PCR. In this case, confirmation was made through the molecular detection of <italic>P. vivax</italic> DNA by PCR. The PCR for other plasmodiums, particularly <italic>P. falciparum,</italic> was negative.</p>
<p>ARDS in <italic>P. vivax</italic> infection generally runs a benign and self-limiting course. Our patient was ventilated for less than 1 week and discharged well without any significant sequelae.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0049475513485733" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria may no longer be a paradigm for uncomplicated malaria. It should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with an epidemiological history, acute febrile syndrome and severe respiratory symptoms. Clinicians treating vivax malaria should be aware of the pulmonary complications of <italic>P. vivax</italic> infection. The severity of presentation does not seem to correlate well with the level of parasitaemia. Treating empirically for possible mixed infection is justified while the physician is awaiting the results of the confirmatory tests. With the appropriate ICU care and ventilatory support, the outcome of acute pulmonary complication in <italic>P. vivax</italic> is usually excellent.</p>
