<abstract>
<p>To stem the spread of the novel H1N1 virus, U.S. public health officials put forth a variety of recommendations, ranging from practicing social distancing and frequent hand washing at the individual level, to furloughs and continual cleaning of commonly touched surfaces at the level of the organization. Although these steps are amenable to implementation in an office, school or hospital setting, they are nearly impossible to apply in the public transit environment, where large numbers of people remain in close quarters, with no running water and limited opportunities for disinfection. Recognizing the need to offer adequate protection from infection to employees and customers alike, transit officials expressed the need for H1N1-specific training, tailored to industry needs and limitations, to Rutgers University’s Center for Transportation Safety, Security and Risk. The resulting course, which was informed through a combination of literature-based and primary research, combined the most current public health data with best practices gleaned from some of the nation’s largest transit agencies, in a just-in-time format.</p>

<p>The influenza virus is the pathogen believed most likely to cause pandemics; and in the 20th century alone, three such events are known to have occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839911399432">Nicholls, 2006</xref>). The most recent outbreak—that of H1N1 or “novel swine flu”—first appeared in the United States during the summer of 2009, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported it responsible for between 43 and 89 million hospitalizations and deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839911399432">CDC, 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>Although considerable, the effects of the outbreak could have been much greater. Some had even speculated that secondary and tertiary waves of widespread infection would cause devastating losses of life on par with those witnessed as a result of the 1918-1919 Spanish Flu, which is believed to have affected roughly one third of the global population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839911399432">Nicholls, 2006</xref>). To stem the spread of the disease, therefore, the nation’s public health infrastructure responded to the outbreak with a massive campaign, which included the development and distribution of an H1N1-specific vaccine. Central to this CDC-spearheaded effort, however, was the promotion of nonmedicinal safeguards, including telecommuting, social distancing, and proper hand washing and cough etiquette. These recommendations could be easily implemented by organizations such as hospitals and schools, and they arguably helped limit the spread of infection. They were not, however, well matched to the needs and abilities of another element of our nation’s critical infrastructure: public transportation agencies.</p>
<p>By its very nature (i.e., large numbers of people in close quarters, no running water, and limited opportunities to sanitize surfaces), transit is ill suited to enacting many basic public health precautions. Researchers at Rutgers University’s Center for Transportation Safety, Security and Risk (CTSSR) were already well aware of this limitation when, in July 2009, they set out to create a generalized pandemic preparedness training for the transit industry. The salience of this limitation became fully apparent, however, when one month later, consultations with health experts at the nation’s largest transit agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839911399432">Dickens &amp; Neff, 2010</xref>), New York City’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), revealed heightened concern about the H1N1 pandemic that was expected to hit their service area full force in the coming months.</p>
<p>The MTA could not wait for the more generalized pandemic training that was already under development; they needed an abbreviated, H1N1-specific course that could be rolled out immediately. To be useful, the training could not merely restate standard public health recommendations, it had to provide all agency personnel—from policy makers to “frontline” employees such as bus drivers and train conductors—with a basic understanding of the disease, as well as actionable precautions they could take to help limit its spread among and between employees and the riding public.</p>
<p>This article details the process by which CTSSR staff worked in consultation with members of the target audience to create this much-needed course. Also described here is the unique partnership between the Center and a sister organization, the National Transit Institute (NTI), which facilitated the dissemination of the training through web- and classroom-based forums. Not only did this collaboration put educational materials in the hands of end users in a timely fashion, it was the first instance in which funding from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) was combined to support a project of this kind.</p>
<p>A large number of courses related to disease and pandemic awareness and prevention are available from academic and private providers alike. What makes this effort worthy of specific consideration, however, is that unlike many similarly focused courses, the process by which CTSSR’s “Understanding H1N1 Risks in the Transportation Sector” was created and disseminated provides insight into a methodology for tailoring generic, widely available public health information in such a way as to be relevant to users for whom it was not originally intended.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<sec id="section2-1524839911399432">
<title>Transit and Disease</title>
<p>Logging well more than 10 billion trips annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839911399432">Dickens &amp; Neff, 2010</xref>), public transit is a critical component of our national infrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839911399432">DHS, 2009</xref>). Some 7,700 agencies operate within the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839911399432">Dickens &amp; Neff, 2010</xref>), providing a convenient, affordable travel option for riders of all descriptions. The benefits typically associated with transit are many and include lower per-rider environmental impacts and energy savings as compared with personal vehicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839911399432">Shapiro, Hassett, &amp; Arnold, 2002</xref>); increased physical activity among users of transit, particularly lower income and minority individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839911399432">Besser &amp; Dannenberg, 2005</xref>); reductions in travel times for passengers and congestion on roadways; and the provision of low-cost travel options for anyone living or working in the service area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839911399432">FTA, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>These benefits result from some of transit’s defining characteristics, namely, the movement of large numbers of people, in close proximity to one another, through the labor of relatively few individuals. These same traits, however, are not without their downsides; the more concerning of which relate to infectious diseases and the industry’s inability to enact traditional public health safeguards to help stem their spread.</p>
<p>Air travel’s role in disease transmission has been the subject of considerable scrutiny; and researchers have repeatedly identified this form of transportation as contributing to the speed and ease with which pathogens pass between distant locales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839911399432">Brownstein, Wolfe, &amp; Mandl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839911399432">Epstein et al., 2007</xref>; Grais, Ellis, Kress, &amp; Glass, 2007). In contrast, the effect of public transit in this regard has been largely overlooked by the academic community. Anyone who has ever ridden in a cramped subway or public bus and watched the myriad passengers squeeze together on the tiny plastic seats, grab ceiling straps and door handles, and do their best to avoid a neighbor’s cough or sneeze, however, can attest to the fact that a transit environment is rife with opportunities for diseases to spread.</p>
<p>Whether it is through direct or droplet contact, fomites, or airborne transmission, virtually every mechanism of disease transmission occurs regularly on buses, trains, and the like. Also, with just one or a handful of employees on board and limited scheduled service breaks, opportunities to clean and disinfect vehicles are few and far between. It is hardly surprising, then, that a recent study in which cultures were taken from commonly touched surfaces determined that public buses ranked third (behind day care facilities and playgrounds) with regard to the presence of bodily fluids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839911399432">Gerba, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>One may reasonably wonder what, if anything, can be done to remedy the situation, and this concern becomes particularly pressing in times, such as in the latter portion of 2009 and early 2010, when a flu pandemic is underway. The automatic (and correct) response of many organizations is to turn to official government sources such as the CDC, as well as state and local public health agencies, for guidance. As was evident throughout the most recent outbreak, these sources promote a cadre of (typically) low-cost strategies for preventing the spread of infection, including vaccination, proper hand washing and cough and sneeze etiquette, regular disinfection of commonly touched surfaces, social distancing, and, when necessary, furloughs and facility closings. All are viable options for many of their target audiences (i.e., office buildings, schools, etc.), but few can be effectively implemented in the transit context, and some, such as facility closings, may negatively affect transit agencies’ ridership as normal customers are no longer required to commute to school and work.</p>
<p>Yet despite the obvious inability of public transit to promote or enforce social distancing, disinfect surfaces between contacts, or furlough vehicle operators, there is no official transit industry–specific guidance for disease prevention. Without such guidance, the burden of crafting preparedness and prevention strategies falls to the thousands of individual systems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1524839911399432">
<title>Course Motivation</title>
<p>Pandemic preparedness was an issue of concern among transit agencies before H1N1. Motivated by past outbreaks, including the SARs epidemic that affected Hong Kong in 2003 and produced a drop in transit use among members of the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839911399432">Lau, Yang, Tsui, &amp; Kim, 2003</xref>), as well as the perceived threat of bird flu reaching U.S. shores, many of the larger systems have devoted resources to implementing safeguards. Typical strategies include the provision of personal protective equipment, hand-sanitizing gel, and informational signage to employees and the public.</p>
<p>The nature and extent of transit agencies’ disease preparedness efforts vary considerably between organizations, and many smaller systems may lack the resources necessary to spearhead such undertakings. It is not surprising, therefore, that during a 2006 needs assessment meeting between industry stakeholders, representatives of the DHS’s Department of Science and Technology, and the heads of the newly formed DHS National Transportation Security Center of Excellence (NTSCOE), the idea of creating a pandemic-focused professional training was quickly identified as a priority undertaking.</p>
<p>Responsibility for crafting the course was given to CTSSR, a NTSCOE member organization housed at Rutgers University’s Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy. Center researchers trained in public health, risk analysis, and transportation set out to develop a curriculum that included both standard public health safeguards, tailored for use by the transit industry, as well as best practices already enacted by some of the larger, more advanced transportation agencies. It was during a meeting with the MTA intended to explore the agency’s approach to general pandemic preparedness that the desire for H1N1-specific training was first articulated. Recognizing this as an opportunity to respond to a critical, time-sensitive need, CTSSR temporarily suspended development of the original project, in order to create a course focused specifically on the impending threat.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1524839911399432">
<title>Course Development</title>
<p>Much of the training content (i.e., disease-related terminology, transmission pathways, etc.) could be adapted from the originally planned pandemic training for use in the H1N1-focused undertaking. The compilation of content specific to the novel virus, however, necessitated targeted, original research. To be both accurate and useable, this research relied on a combination of official information sources and repeated consultations with industry and public health experts.</p>
<p>During the summer of 2009, the ongoing H1N1 pandemic was a critical international and domestic concern, and outbreak-specific information was widely available and continually evolving. Many of the most timely and reliable sources were government-sponsored websites, including those maintained by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839911399432">CDC (2010a)</xref> and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839911399432">World Health Organization (2010)</xref> as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839911399432">U.S. Department of Health and Human Service’s flu.gov (2010)</xref>. Much of the H1N1-specific course content was drawn from these sites, where in addition to vaccination, recommendations for infection prevention focused on personal hygiene (i.e., cough and sneeze etiquette and proper hand washing), social distancing, and organizational adaptations such as altered work schedules, furloughs, and facility closings.</p>
<p>Because of the special conditions present in the transit environment, standard public health recommendations had to be adapted for use by the industry. To facilitate this process, representatives of organizations known to be leaders in pandemic preparedness, namely, the MTA; the New York, New Jersey Port Authority; and Amtrak were queried about their agencies’ practices. Individual interviewees’ titles varied, but all had in common the task of identifying potential threats to public health and designing and implementing programmatic, agency-wide mitigation strategies. The lessons learned and best practices gleaned from these conversations helped inform the creation of a realistic and useful training product.</p>
<p>In addition to insights from the industry, public health expertise was required to ensure that any “transit appropriate” recommendations were also effective at stemming the spread of the virus. To this end, infectious disease and epidemiology experts from Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, and New York City Transit were consulted on an ongoing basis throughout the course development process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1524839911399432">
<title>Course Content</title>
<p>Tailored for delivery by agencies’ in-house trainers in half-day sessions, the course materials were designed to provide instruction to transit employees at all levels, ranging from “frontline” workers such as bus drivers and ticket salespeople, to decision makers in upper management. Instructors were furnished with a copy of the course leader guide and companion PowerPoint presentation for use in the classroom. Participants received a resource book that included more detailed coverage of the topics presented throughout the training as well as a trifold pamphlet. The pamphlet, which could serve as an easy, take anywhere reference, was created in both English and Spanish language versions and summarized a number of the course’s key points, such as proper hand washing techniques and symptoms of the flu.</p>
<p>The PowerPoint presentation was structured to teach attendees how to prepare for the possibility of widespread illness among passengers, coworkers, and even their own family members. Rather than introduce novel approaches and interventions that had not been widely endorsed by the public health establishment, the course taught participants how to apply standard recommendations in a way that would effectively reduce their risk of infection, taking into account the unique characteristics and limitations present in the transit environment.</p>
<p>To ensure students’ comprehension of course content, as well as to facilitate their understanding of disease-related materials in the popular media and elsewhere, the program began by introducing basic public health terminology. In this initial section of the training, terms such as <italic>pandemic</italic> and <italic>pathogen</italic> were defined and relevant examples described.</p>
<p>Next, characteristics of the H1N1 virus, including its origins, transmission, and symptoms, were discussed. The common misconception that the virus was, in fact, a “swine flu” was also dispelled, and a brief explanation of the virus’ true origins provided. An overview of the body’s natural defenses against infection, as well as a discussion of how simple lifestyle choices, such as exercising and eating healthfully, can help bolster immune system functioning were also included.</p>
<p>Transit-appropriate disease prevention strategies, arguably the most original portion of the training, were then described. Those public health recommendations that could be easily implemented—namely, the use of hand sanitizer and effective hand washing techniques, as well as proper cough and sneeze etiquette—were covered in detail as outlined by the CDC and other official sources. Employees were also encouraged to avoid touching their faces with unclean hands to avoid infection. Social distancing (i.e., the practice of remaining 3-6 feet from others) was described; however, given its limited utility, participants were not encouraged to implement it at all times but only when physically possible to do so, particularly when in the vicinity of visibly ill individuals.</p>
<p>The disinfection of regularly touched surfaces and objects was also endorsed. For the sake of practicality, and because studies had shown that existing vehicle cleaning protocols were sufficient to reduce the spread of disease among users, however, students were prompted to focus their cleaning efforts more on their immediate work areas (i.e., steering wheels, telephones, etc.) than on public areas, with the most concentrated efforts occurring at the start of a new shift.</p>
<p>The training concluded with a discussion of at-home preparedness, stressing, among other precautions, the need to discuss care giving plans with loved ones and stockpile vital supplies. Participants interested in receiving the most up-to-date information were then referred to regularly updated websites and toll-free telephone numbers, such as those maintained by the CDC.</p>
<p>In addition to classroom instruction, the course included participant takeaway materials meant to expand their understanding of the course material and provide an easy, on-the-job refresher for some of the most important information. To this end, an eight-page resource book contained in-depth discussion of topics, such as disease evolution and immune system functioning, which were only briefly covered by the instructor. A trifold pamphlet, in contrast, provided a series of bulleted lists, such as how to avoid the flu and what to do should you become ill.</p>
<p>Although the training focused on communicating best practices and encouraging universally agreed-on precautions, it was recognized that the approaches used to implement these recommendations would vary between organizations according to individual capacities and priorities. To make the training materials more user-friendly, therefore, all elements, including participant takeaways, included prompts for the instructor to input agency-specific information related to policies, procedures, and points of contact and the like, prior to teaching the class.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1524839911399432">
<title>Course Dissemination</title>
<p>As a Department of Homeland Security Center of Excellence, CTSSR was able to use existing funding to create the H1N1-specific training, but it lacked support for its dissemination. Once the materials had been approved by DHS officials, therefore, they were turned over to NTI for dissemination using a portion of the organization’s existing FTA funding. This partnership represented a unique collaboration between the two federal agencies and made possible the rapid development and wide distribution of these time-sensitive materials.</p>
<p>Promotion of the course began at NTI’s Transit Trainers’ Workshop, which was held in Cleveland, Ohio, in October, 2009. Training materials, including an abbreviated version of the instructor PowerPoint, were placed on CDs, which were distributed to the workshop attendees. Those interested in including the course in their organizations’ preparedness efforts were encouraged to participate in either a forthcoming webinar or to host an NTI-delivered train-the-trainer session at their agency.</p>
<p>Course materials were made available free of charge to anyone who expressed an interest regardless of factors such as agency size, location, or ridership demographics. The first distribution, a 1½-hour-long webinar hosted for NTI by BT Conferencing in December, 2009, was attended by 178 individuals, representing 149 organizations. Subsequent to this, a series of 18 train-the-trainer sessions were held between January and May 2010.</p>
<p>Organizations in locales ranging from Flint, Michigan, to Honolulu, Hawaii, hosted the train-the-trainer course, which was attended by a total of 231 people. The majority of participants were employed by large transit agencies (those with a service area of 200,000 people or more) with considerable workforces (more than 500 individuals); however, systems with smaller territories and staff (approximately 31% of and 25% of respondents, respectively) were also represented.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1524839911399432">
<title>Evaluation</title>
<p>In conjunction with the train-the-trainer sessions, participants were asked to evaluate the course materials. Because of the time-sensitive nature of the course, CTSSR relied on a preexisting NTI-generated instrument, which was filled out either in the classroom immediately after the training’s completion or at a later time using a web-based instrument. Response rates for the two approaches varied from 93% (in-class) to 40% (web-based). This considerable discrepancy likely stems from the lag time between receiving training and being prompted to complete an evaluation (longer for web-based), as well as the relative ease with which participants could access the instruments (easier for in-class). It was noted by the instructors, however, that those completing the web-based evaluations tended to provide responses to a greater number of questions and were more likely to complete open-ended queries. Overall, 52% of participants submitted answers to the 29-question instrument, and the data garnered from several of the questions make clear the transit industry’s enthusiastic response to the course.</p>
<p>When asked whether they believed that pandemic preparedness posed a challenge for the transit industry, fully 84% of respondents chose <italic>agree</italic> or <italic>strongly agree</italic> from the available responses, which were presented in a 5-point Likert-type scale that also included <italic>neutral, disagree</italic>, and <italic>strongly disagree</italic>. The evaluation also asked participants about their agencies’ current levels of pandemic preparedness. In response, nearly 60% of attendees indicated that their organizations had yet to provide any kind of training specific to H1N1, and only a handful (17%) identified classroom instruction (as opposed to safety briefings and informational materials) as among their existing efforts.</p>
<p>Attendees were also asked to rate the quality, content, and utility of the CTSSR course, and their answers testified to their positive impressions of the materials. For example, when asked “What was your overall impression of this course?” more than 90% of attendees rated it as “good,” “very good,” or “excellent.” Furthermore, fully 94% answered “agree” or “strongly agree,” when asked whether the course materials were relevant to their organizations and employees.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1524839911399432">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Public transit is a vital part of our nation’s critical infrastructure, providing relatively inexpensive and accessible transportation options to millions of riders and creating a multitude of environmental and other benefits in the process. Transit remains vulnerable to the effects of infectious disease, however, and because of its public, often cramped nature, great difficulty exists in implementing some of the most common public health precautions.</p>
<p>Recognizing these realities, as well as the time-sensitive need to furnish disease-focused training specific to the ongoing H1N1 pandemic, CTSSR redirected existing DHS funding to support the creation of a half-day training to address the disease preparedness and prevention needs of the industry. In developing the course, which was disseminated under the title “Understanding H1N1 Risks in the Transportation Sector,” the Center researchers made use of web-based information sources, interviewed officials from some of the nation’s foremost transit agencies, and consulted public health professionals to create a collection of disease awareness and infection prevention–focused recommendations. Web-based and in-class evaluations completed in conjunction with the train-the-trainer sessions confirmed the utility of the course, which also represented a unique collaboration between two federal agencies.</p>
<p>The major limitations of the effort stemmed from the short timeline for course creation and dissemination. Although additional time dedicated to research and compilation of the classroom materials could have allowed the development of an even better product, the primary effect of this time crush was evident in the course evaluation process. Ideally, all participants would have completed the instrument in the same manner (i.e., either in the classroom or online), and additional, course content–specific questions would have been included. Evaluation of the training’s long-term effects on pandemic preparedness within the transit industry would also be illustrative; however, such an effort has not been undertaken. Despite these shortcomings, however, it appears that this novel training satisfied a recognized need among members of the transit industry and was well received by attendees.</p>
