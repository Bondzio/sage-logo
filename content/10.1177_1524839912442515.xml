<abstract>
<p>Ethical conduct plays a vital role in ensuring that issues such as health inequities are addressed. The Interactive Domain Model (IDM), a comprehensive best practices approach, provides a guiding framework to integrate ethics into health-related practice. Its five tenets emphasize the importance of developing multiple best practices to ensure sensitivity to local circumstances; taking into account the complex and interactive nature of the world; ensuring consistency between practice and key elements such as values, theories, evidence, and understanding the environment; engaging in ongoing critical reflection; and following a continuous improvement practice cycle with active participation from priority populations. Ethical implications for each tenet and ways to meet the challenges related to acting ethically are discussed.</p>

<p>Organizations with a mandate to increase health—from hospitals and universities to government agencies and pharmaceutical companies—thrive, whereas health inequities remain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839912442515">Shaw-Ridley &amp; Ridley, 2010</xref>). Populations disadvantaged because of low income, discrimination, and other marginalizing circumstances suffer poorer health and die younger than the mainstream population. These differences in health status constitute a socially unjust state of health inequity. Identifying ethical processes and activities will direct us to the actions required to achieve optimal health for all, for example, by ensuring that evidence regarding the root causes of health inequities is acted on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839912442515">Shaw-Ridley &amp; Ridley, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This article highlights the Interactive Domain Model (IDM) as a guiding framework to fully integrate ethics into health-related practice. The IDM, a comprehensive best practices approach to health promotion and public health with demonstrated benefits for its users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912442515">Kahan, Groulx, &amp; Wong, 2007</xref>), firmly embeds ethics in its practice approach, making it uniquely suited to the task of facilitating ethical conduct. According to the IDM,
<disp-quote>
<p>Best practices in health promotion/public health are those sets of processes and activities that are consistent with health promotion/public health values, goals and ethics, theories and beliefs, evidence, and understanding of the environment, and that are most likely to achieve health promotion/public health goals in a given situation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912442515">Kahan &amp; Goodstadt, 2005</xref>, p. 8)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the IDM approach, ethical practice is strongly connected to values and the other elements mentioned above. Acting ethically means exploring and understanding these elements to the best of our ability, then applying that understanding to practice to increase our chances of achieving the most positive and sustainable results possible for the populations we work with.</p>
<p>This article outlines five tenets central to the IDM and implications of each tenet for strengthening ethical practice, how a group might use the IDM to heighten the ethical nature of its practice, and how to minimize challenges to ethical practice.</p>
<sec id="section1-1524839912442515">
<title>Interactive Domain Model Tenets and Implications for Ethics-Based Practice</title>
<p>In discussing the IDM’s five tenets, each of which links to the others, the term <italic>practitioner</italic> refers to program planners and implementers, managers, policy makers, and researchers. The IDM was developed and revised based on an extensive literature review (e.g., see the references in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912442515">Kahan &amp; Goodstadt, 2001</xref>); peer review; field testing with community health centers, public health units, and hospitals; and feedback from people using the IDM in various situations. This section draws on key IDM-related sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912442515">Kahan &amp; Goodstadt, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912442515">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839912442515">Kahan, Groulx, &amp; Wong, 2009</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-1524839912442515">
<title>Tenet 1: A Multiplicity of Best Practices Exists, Not a Single Best Practice</title>
<p>Best practices vary according to the specific context. What works in one situation—with a particular group of people or setting or in a particular time period—may not work as well in another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839912442515">Green, 2001</xref>). A program appropriate for an Aboriginal population may be unsuitable for a group of Somalian refugees, even though they live in the same city.</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Implications for ethical practice</italic>: Ethical practitioners tailor processes and activities to fit the unique cultural and other circumstances of each group they work with rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1524839912442515">
<title>Tenet 2: We Live in a Complex and Interactive World</title>
<p>The world contains numerous interactive dimensions. Geography affects economies; human activity affects climate; policies of one country affect other countries. The IDM mirrors this complexity by identifying key elements that influence each other and that also influence, and are influenced by, practice.</p>
<p>The IDM organizes these elements and practice into three domains (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1524839912442515">Figure 1</xref>) that exist in the context of social, political, and economic structures and systems and physical and psychological conditions:</p>
<list id="list2-1524839912442515" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Underpinnings</italic>: values, goals, ethics; theories, concepts, underlying beliefs, and assumptions; evidence</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Understanding the environment</italic>: analyses of organizational and health-related environments; vision of how we wish our environments to be</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Practice</italic>: processes and activities to address organizational and health-related issues and conduct research (including evaluation)</p></list-item></list>

<list-item><p><italic>Implications for ethical practice</italic>: Ethical practitioners consider the interactivity among the above domains when making practice decisions, for example, by understanding how values underpin research methods. In addition to focusing on values, theories, beliefs, and evidence, ethical practitioners shape practice according to environmental vision and analysis of the priority issues. Their analysis identifies the following: stakeholders affected by, and who affect, the issues; relevant strengths and challenges; underlying factors affecting the issues such as political systems and geography; and best ways to positively influence the issues.</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1524839912442515">
<title>Tenet 3: Consistency Is Crucial to Ethical and Effective Practice</title>
<p>Aligning processes and activities with values/goals/ethics, theories/beliefs, and evidence and with vision and analysis of sociopolitical and other conditions greatly increases the likelihood of positive impacts and reduces the likelihood of negative impacts.</p>
<list id="list4-1524839912442515" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Implications for ethical practice</italic>: This tenet forms the core of the IDM’s ethical position. Beyond doing no harm, the IDM requires ethical practitioners to improve situations to the best of their ability by acting congruently with their values, beliefs, knowledge, and understanding.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Unless practitioners, individually and collectively, identify and define their values and other critical elements and then manifest these elements in practice, ethical disconnects will occur. Examples include listing inclusion as a value while excluding members of priority populations from boards and committees or believing that how people relate to each other is necessary to success but spending little time building and maintaining high-quality relationships.</p>
<p>Another ethical disconnect is knowing that the social determinants of health—factors such as degrees of income and power equity, social and educational status, and nature of social networks—profoundly affect quality of health of individuals and populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912442515">Wilkinson &amp; Marmot, 2003</xref>), yet ignoring that knowledge when developing or implementing policy. In the United States, data show that states with higher degrees of income inequity have higher rates of infant mortality and shorter life expectancy in their general population than states with a smaller income gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839912442515">Wilkinson &amp; Pickett, 2009</xref>). The conclusion from an ethical perspective is that dedicated action to increase societal equity, thereby decreasing health inequity, is required in order to reflect in practice (a) the value of social justice and (b) the evidence of the social determinants’ impact on health.</p>

<sec id="section5-1524839912442515">
<title>Tenet 4: Without Ongoing Critical Reflection We Are Doomed to Perpetually Suffer the Status Quo</title>
<p>Best practices rely on ongoing critical reflection. Regularly reviewing attitudes, actions, relationships, and the world around us makes today’s best practices even better tomorrow. Critical reflection increases chances of learning from mistakes, basing decisions on complete and accurate information, and being open to new ideas.</p>
<p>Critical reflection also assists us to make explicit our values, beliefs, and other key elements, providing us with opportunities to</p>
<list id="list5-1524839912442515" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>increase the soundness of practice foundations, for example, by correcting mistaken assumptions and gaining greater clarity about underlying socio-political influences;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>better comprehend how to realign processes and activities to more closely match what we value, believe, and know; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>identify areas where we agree with or differ from others, facilitating collaboration and avoiding working at cross-purposes.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Critical reflection promotes positive change: “It is easier to maintain the status quo when assumptions are concealed, and more difficult to maintain the status quo when concrete evidence of inconsistencies between discourse, values and practices are documented” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839912442515">Kahan et al., 2009</xref>, p. 532).</p>
<list id="list6-1524839912442515" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Implications for ethical practice</italic>: Ethical practitioners maintain a questioning attitude. They answer their questions based on their experiences, values, theories, and beliefs; assessment of the evidence; and insights into the contexts in which practice and priority issues exist rather than uncritically accepting the views of others. They also explore better ways of doing things regardless of tradition or what others are doing.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Ethical practitioners question their way through various layers to achieve in-depth understanding. If inequities in the social determinants of health cause health inequities, what underlies the social determinant inequities? If the answer is government and private sector policies, which factors influence the nature of current policies?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1524839912442515">
<title>Tenet 5: A Continuous Improvement Practice Cycle That Includes Priority Populations Brings Us Closer to Where We Want to Go</title>
<p>A scattered approach to practice, executed with little initial thought or consequent review, is unlikely to achieve positive change. To continuously improve practice the following are required: a strong foundation for practice; an action and evaluation plan; implementation of the plan while documenting, reflecting on, and evaluating practices and results; and revising practices based on ongoing learning.</p>
<p>This continuous improvement practice cycle is, however, insufficient to achieve the best results possible. A further requirement is participation in the practice cycle by the populations whose daily lives are most immediately affected by the issues, and by other stakeholders as appropriate. Regarding stakeholder involvement in policy making, “participation should not be limited to the design of programme delivery, but rather be seen as the contextual process itself, through which policy is made, converted into programmes and services, delivered, experienced, and evaluated” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912442515">Commission on Social Determinants of Health, 2008</xref>, p. 160).</p>
<p>Working together strengthens communities through building knowledge, relationships, capacities, feelings of inclusion, and collaborative decision making, ensuring more relevant and sustainable solutions.</p>
<list id="list7-1524839912442515" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Implications for ethical practice</italic>: Ethical practitioners apply the continuous improvement practice cycle to all aspects of their work. To build strong foundations, they develop guidelines, examine the current situation, and envision the desired future. To reach measurable objectives, ethical practitioners identify who does what, when, and how. While implementing action and evaluation plans, ethical practitioners answer questions about what they did, how they did it, and what the results were. They ask what needs to change and revise accordingly.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Ethical practitioners also ensure that stakeholder participation is as successful as possible. Ethical practitioners work with participants to</p>
<list id="list8-1524839912442515" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>describe their unique perspectives, identify where consensus exists, and broker agreement about how to address the inevitable differences that impede collaborative efforts; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>identify and address power differentials. Priority population members generally have much less formal power available to them than other stakeholder groups. Ethical practitioners facilitate the meaningful participation of priority population members in collaborative efforts by assisting them to move from powerlessness to a place of mutual power sharing.</p></list-item></list>

<title>Applying the Interactive Domain Model</title>
<p>To illustrate the IDM in practice, consider a hypothetical group applying the IDM to the issue of increasing ethical conduct in health-related practice. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1524839912442515">Figure 2</xref> presents possible results of the group’s first two sessions (as imagined by the author). The group identifies social justice as the priority value; choosing another priority value, such as financial profit, would lead to very different results.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1524839912442515-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<p>In subsequent sessions, participants add more values and beliefs and identify theories to inform their practice, such as complexity theory (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839912442515">Matheson, Dew, &amp; Cumming, 2009</xref>). They delve into questions such as how to define the “fair” distribution of resources—“social justice and fairness can be interpreted differently by different people in different settings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839912442515">Braveman &amp; Gruskin, 2003</xref>, p. 254)—and the characteristics of an economic system compatible with social justice. Participants regularly review and revise their values and other key elements, using these to guide their practice cycle.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1524839912442515">
<title>Discussion of Major Recommendation and Its Challenges</title>
<p>The author’s major recommendation to diverse health-related practitioners is to follow the IDM’s five key tenets regarding multiple best practices, complexity and interactivity, consistency, critical reflection, and working for continuous improvement with priority population participation. Translating ethical principles based on values, evidence, and other key elements into processes and activities will ensure ethical practice. Discussed below is how to meet the challenges facing practitioners following this recommendation.</p>
<sec id="section9-1524839912442515">
<title>Restrictions to Practice Choices</title>
<p>Organizational constraints such as lack of time or resources and other realities restrict practice choices but do not prevent us from exploring values/ethics, theories/beliefs, evidence, and environmental vision and analysis in relation to practice. This exploration provides a thoughtful and grounded basis to practice and a positive example for others. Individuals can further act as catalysts for change as members of teams, organizations, and communities by initiating discussions on how to increase ethical practice. We all assume certain limits; individuals who question assumptions may push those limits further than expected. Recognizing the existence of power other than the officially sanctioned kind, for example, nuisance and moral power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839912442515">Woelk, 2011</xref>), provides us with more tools to use.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1524839912442515">
<title>Limitations of the Individual</title>
<p>Although individuals can accomplish much, their range of influence is limited, making it important to seek like-minded others with whom to work for ethical change. Groups have the power of numbers.</p>
<p>Ethics-based organizations provide the support necessary for practitioners to practice as ethically as possible. Partnerships and coalitions, composed of members from within and outside the health/illness sector, have the potential to spread ethical practice widely by using a variety of strategies, such as awareness raising, advocacy, capacity building, and community mobilization—and by celebrating others who practice from an ethical base and calling to account those who do not.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1524839912442515">
<title>Lack of Belief in the Possibility of Deep-Seated Change</title>
<p>People may avoid tackling the social determinants of health because they believe meaningful change is unachievable. However, a number of initiatives are improving the determinants. For example,</p>
<list id="list9-1524839912442515" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Pathways to Education aims to reduce poverty by increasing educational levels of low-income youth. In Regent Park, a low-income neighborhood in Toronto, Canada, school dropout rates for program participants have declined substantially and postsecondary enrollment rates have increased substantially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912442515">The Boston Consulting Group, 2011</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Vibrant Communities works with communities across Canada. After 9 years, results range from positively influencing poverty-related government policies to financial benefits for 170,903 households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839912442515">Gamble, 2010</xref>).</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1524839912442515">
<title>Conflicting Perspectives</title>
<p>The main challenge to achieving widespread ethical change is conflicting perspectives. For example, “Many core values of health promotion are not shared by funding bodies and policy makers, and perhaps not by younger generations in the broader society-at-large” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912442515">Bauman et al., 2007</xref>, p. 4). Furthermore, practitioners disagree over which sociopolitical systems will reduce health inequities and whether to emphasize individual or collective responsibility for improving health. In many cases, tension arising from differences brought into the open will lead to new insights and ideas; in other cases, where vested interests are most strong, resistance to change will be equally strong. Those of us who highly value social justice must work together to develop methods to increase the range of our ethical processes and activities, currently constrained by conditions buttressed by those for whom other values, such as economic gain, are more important than social justice.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1524839912442515">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Individually and collectively reflecting on practice in relation to values and other key elements, questioning rather than accepting the status quo, exploring new ways of doing things, adopting a holistic view, and collaborating with priority population members for continuous improvement—all these will lead to more effective methods for increasing the degree of ethical practice in our communities. Achieving optimal health for all will not happen without great struggle, but the more of us there are who practice ethically—basing processes and activities on a comprehensive best practices approach—the closer we will come to the goal of health equity.</p>
