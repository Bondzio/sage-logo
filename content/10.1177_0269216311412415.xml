<title>Background:</title>
<p>Opioid switching to methadone is reported frequently to improve pain control in patients with an unacceptable balance between pain control and side effects during treatment with first line opioids, but carries a risk of drug accumulation and respiratory depression. To justify this risk it is required that less risky treatments are tried beforehand and that a sufficiently large proportion of patients experience a long-lasting improvement in pain control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269216311412415">
<title>Research questions:</title>
<p>How large was the proportion of patients remaining on long term methadone treatment after a switch from a strong opioid to methadone? How long had the patients been treated with opioids before the switch to methadone?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0269216311412415">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Longitudinal pharmacoepidemiological study from the complete national Norwegian Prescription Database.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269216311412415">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>One hundred and thirty (77%) cancer patients received more than one dispensed prescription of methadone. Forty-nine (40%) chronic non-malignant pain (CNMP) patients continued to have methadone prescriptions dispensed more than 6 months after the switch. Of 168 cancer patients, 48 (29%) had tried two strong opioids prior to the switch to methadone whereas 21 (12.5%) had tried three or more strong opioids. Similar numbers for 124 CNMP patients were 26 (21%) and 34 (27%), respectively.</p>

<sec id="section5-0269216311412415">
<title>Interpretation:</title>
<p>Opioid switching to methadone appears to provide a long lasting improvement in pain control in a significant proportion of patients. However, the study raises concerns that treatment options with less risk are not being exhausted prior to switching to methadone.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Methadone is increasingly used as a second line opioid in treatment of cancer pain or chronic non-malignant pain when other opioids fail to provide an acceptable balance between pain control and side effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311412415">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311412415">2</xref></sup> A Cochrane review on opioid switching concluded that a ‘switch to an alternative opioid may be the only option for symptomatic relief’ in some patients with cancer pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311412415">2</xref></sup> However, most studies on opioid switching to methadone have methodological weaknesses such as few patients, non-randomization, non-blinding, short follow-up, retrospective designs and non-standardized titration of first line opioids before the switch. In spite of the mentioned weaknesses and the low level of evidence, it appears to be established that opioid switching to methadone improves pain control in many patients. Recently it has been reported from a chart-review study that opioid rotation to methadone was successful, with improved pain control and acceptable side effects in 85 of 100 outpatients with cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311412415">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The opioid history of a patient before a switch to methadone will depend on what causes the pain, which opioids and formulations are available (restrictions), cost and setting/level of care. The few studies providing opioid history are retrospective and often incomplete regarding how long opioids are used before a switch to methadone, which opioids have been tried before the switch and how long methadone is utilized after the switch. Most clinical studies only report data on the opioid and opioid dose used immediately prior to the switch. With few exceptions, the observation period in clinical studies of opioid switching to methadone has been too short to determine long term effects. In one small non-blinded prospective study of patients with chronic non-malignant pain, four of 12 patients terminated methadone within the first week after the switch, one patient terminated methadone 1 month after the switch and the remaining seven patients continued on a stable dose of methadone throughout the 9 months of follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311412415">4</xref></sup> In an open prospective study of 50 patients starting methadone for chronic neuropathic pain, 90% of patients had tried at least one other opioid before initiation of methadone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311412415">5</xref></sup> Fifty-two per cent of the patients reported mild to complete pain relief after starting methadone and remained on methadone for an average duration of follow-up of 21 months. Similar data are not available from patients switching to methadone for cancer pain.</p>
<p>Several cases of overdose and severe respiratory depression have been reported in relation to opioid switching to methadone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311412415">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311412415">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311412415"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311412415"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311412415">9</xref></sup>. The different opioids are reported to cause comparable degrees of respiratory depression at equianalgesic doses. However, the complex pharmacokinetics of methadone may place patients at a higher risk of hypoventilation than other opioid agonists. Furthermore, methadone treatment is associated with a risk of torsade de pointes arrhythmia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311412415">1</xref></sup> In order to justify these risks it is required both that other less risky treatment options are tried beforehand and that a sufficiently large proportion of patients experience a long lasting improvement in pain control or decrease in side effects.</p>
<p>The Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD) offers a unique opportunity to investigate the prescription pattern of drugs to outpatients. In this complete national database, data are recorded on all drugs dispensed in Norway since 1 January 2004. Each patient is identified through a unique pseudonym and all drugs dispensed to one patient can be followed over time. Reimbursement codes are recorded in NorPD and can be used to stratify patients into those receiving symptom relieving drugs for palliative treatment of malignant disease and non-palliative patients. In this study data from NorPD will be used to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of opioid switching to methadone in Norwegian outpatients.</p>
<p>The research questions for this study are 1) how large was the proportion of patients remaining on long term methadone treatment after a switch from a strong opioid to methadone and 2) how long had the patients been treated with opioids before the switch to methadone?</p>

<title>Data source</title>
<p>Data were drawn from the NorPD. From 1 January 2004 all pharmacies in Norway have been obliged to submit data electronically to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health on all dispensed drugs on a monthly basis. NorPD contains information on all prescription drugs, reimbursed or not, which are dispensed at pharmacies to individual patients outside institutions. Each record contains a unique person-identifier, which makes it possible to follow chronologically all prescriptions to each individual patient. For each prescription the recorded data include patient specific data (age, gender, place of residence), prescriber data (age, gender, completed specialist training), drug data (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)) code, strength and package size, reimbursement, date prescription was dispensed) and pharmacy data (municipality). Because data are collected from pharmacies, only prescriptions that are actually dispensed are captured. Neither drug use by patients in nursing homes or hospitals nor prescriptions lacking the complete unique person-identifier are registered in NorPD. During the study period 91.1% of dispensed volume of methadone capsules and 87.9% of all opioids are accounted for by NorPD at an individual level.</p>
<p>All medicines dispensed in Norway are classified according to the ATC classification system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311412415">10</xref></sup> Drug quantities are measured as Defined Daily Doses (DDDs). The DDD for each drug is determined by the WHO collaborating centre for drug statistics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311412415">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>Opioid switching</title>
<p>In this study an opioid switch to methadone was defined as initiation of methadone in a patient who prior to the switch had received another strong opioid. According to therapeutic traditions, patients switching to methadone for cancer pain often receive a rapid and short acting formulation of another opioid for breakthrough pain. Patients were considered to have switched opioid even if they continued with the pre-switch treatment for breakthrough pain.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269216311412415">
<title>Study population</title>
<p>The study is based on data from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2009. All subjects receiving one or more prescriptions of methadone tablets were identified (<italic>N</italic> = 585) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269216311412415">Figure 1</xref>). Subjects receiving any formulation of opioids with the reimbursement code for palliative treatment of malignant disease were categorized as having cancer pain, while patients receiving tablets or capsules of methadone without reimbursement for palliative treatment of malignant disease were categorized as having non-malignant pain. Patients who had received large amounts of methadone mixture for oral administration or buprenorphine formulations in ATC group N07B (<italic>N</italic> = 159) were excluded from the study because they were likely to be on opioid maintenance therapy. Furthermore, patients who had received methadone without reimbursement for cancer pain but other opioids with reimbursement for cancer pain were excluded from the study (<italic>N</italic> = 90). These patients were presumed to be patients with malignant disease in opioid maintenance therapy. The total volume of methadone dispensed in Norway during the study period was 17,748,235 DDDs. Because methadone is mainly used in opioid maintenance therapy, the pain patients included in this study accounted for 2.2% of this volume.</p>

<title>Analysis strategy</title>
<p>All analyses were performed separately for cancer pain patients and chronic non-malignant pain (CNMP) patients. The reimbursement code for palliative treatment of malignant disease is used as a proxy for diagnosis of cancer or non-cancer pain. Patients who did not receive methadone during 2004 were considered methadone naïve when methadone was initiated and are included in analyses of incidence and when specific cohorts are studied. All patients in the study population are included in analyses of prevalence. The cohorts starting methadone treatment in 2005, 2006 and 2007 are used for analyses focusing on long term follow-up after switching to methadone, whereas the cohorts starting methadone treatment in 2007, 2008 and 2009 are used to investigate treatment before switching to methadone. In analyses of cancer patients only strong opioids dispensed with reimbursement for palliative treatment of malignant disease are included in analyses of pre-switch opioid treatment.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>The software SPSS 17.0 for Windows was applied for descriptive statistics. Means, standard deviations and percentages are presented when appropriate. Because this nationwide study was based on data from a complete national database, the study population was not a sample. Thus statistical testing of significance was not considered appropriate.</p>

<title>Patient characteristics</title>
<p>From 2005 to 2009 a total of 292 patients switched from another opioid to methadone in Norway. Of these 168 (58%) were cancer patients and the remaining 124 (42%) were patients with chronic non-malignant pain. While the incidence of opioid switching to methadone for chronic non-malignant pain remains fairly stable at 22 to 28 patients each year, the incidence for cancer pain increased markedly from the first to the second half of the study period, from approximately 20 to 50 patients each year (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216311412415">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Of 124 patients with chronic non-malignant pain switching to methadone, 26 (21%) had tried two strong opioids prior to the switch to methadone, 34 (27%) had tried three or more strong opioids and 64 (52%) had tried one opioid before the switch (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269216311412415">Table 3</xref>). The most common pre-switch strong opioids were oxycodone (61 [49%]), buprenorphine (40 [32%]), morphine (34 [27%]), fentanyl (28 [23%]) and ketobemidone (28 [23%]). Of the 22 to 28 patients switching to methadone each year, nine to 17 had received a strong opioid the previous year. During the entire study period 68 (55%) of 124 patients had received a strong opioid the year before the switch to methadone. Of 22 patients switching to methadone in 2008, five had received a strong opioid as early as 2004, as had six of the 24 patients switching to methadone in 2009.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The primary findings in this study are that 20 to 25% of patients with CNMP switching to methadone continue on methadone for more than 2 years and that 75% of cancer patients switching to methadone receive two or more dispensed prescriptions of methadone. This indicates that a moderate proportion of patients with chronic non-malignant pain and a large proportion of patients with cancer pain experience a lasting and clinically significant improvement in the balance between pain control and side effects after a switch to methadone. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that in both cancer patients and patients with CNMP the switch to methadone was performed long after initiation of opioid therapy in the majority of patients. This indicates that opioid switching to methadone in most cases is performed in patients who initially responded to first line opioids and that the development of tolerance is a frequent reason for opioid switching to methadone. However, this finding also may indicate that, when first line opioids fail to provide an acceptable balance between pain relief and side effects, a trial of several successive opioids is not attempted.</p>
<p>In the present study only 20 to 25% of patients with CNMP continued methadone treatment for longer than 2 years. This is a smaller proportion than could be expected based on the findings from Fredheim et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311412415">4</xref></sup> Moulin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311412415">5</xref></sup> and Gardner-Nix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311412415">11</xref></sup> This discrepancy might in part be explained by selection bias and close follow-up in clinical studies. Irrespective of the cause of this discrepancy, it is an important finding that in a real life clinical situation the success rate is lower than reported in previous clinical studies. Thus, when considering an opioid switch to methadone for non-malignant pain, the high risk of opioid overdose should be weighed against what appears to be a low probability of long term treatment success.</p>
<p>Because the switch to methadone carries a risk related to both opioid overdose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311412415">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311412415">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311412415"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311412415"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311412415">9</xref></sup> and torsade de pointes arrhythmia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311412415">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311412415"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311412415"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311412415"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311412415">16</xref></sup> the switch should only be performed by physicians who have experience with the drug and when treatment options with less risk have been exhausted. The findings from the present study indicate that only a minority of patients switching to methadone have tried both morphine and oxycodone prior to the switch to methadone. Previous clinical studies from both cancer pain patients and patients with CNMP have indicated that an opioid switch to other opioids than methadone has a fairly high rate of success.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311412415">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311412415">18</xref></sup> Thus it appears that in most patients less risky treatment options have not been exhausted prior to the switch to methadone.</p>
<p>International recommendations advise that one should prescribe a short acting opioid in addition to a long lasting opioid to cancer patients. The present study shows that only 35% of cancer patients switching to methadone received dispensed prescriptions of a short acting opioid in addition to methadone after the switch. The successful use of methadone for breakthrough cancer pain has been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311412415">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311412415"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216311412415">21</xref></sup> Even though oral methadone appears to be effective for single episodes of breakthrough pain, the long half life could be expected to cause drug accumulation and side effects in patients with frequent and short episodes of breakthrough pain. With a prevalence of breakthrough pain, depending on setting, of 19 to 95% in general cancer pain populations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311412415">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216311412415"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269216311412415"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216311412415">25</xref></sup> it is an issue of concern that only one-third of cancer patients switching to methadone are provided another rapid and short acting opioid formulation for breakthrough or incident pain.</p>
<p>The major strength of the present study is that individual prescription data on all dispensed drugs are available for the entire population. Furthermore, a survey of all patients in the population switching to methadone provides data which might reflect clinical reality better than data from clinical studies or chart reviews in single centres. However, several factors make it necessary to interpret the findings from the present study with caution. A general weakness of studies based on data from prescription databases is that not all dispensed drugs are necessarily used by the recipient. The most important specific weakness in the present study is that opioid switching to methadone for cancer pain in some cases is performed on inpatients. Data on drug use during hospitalization are not captured by NorPD. It is also likely that some patients who switch to methadone as inpatients have tried other treatments during their hospital stay and that some patients who have switched to methadone as inpatients are not discharged on methadone therapy. Thus, our study may underestimate the prevalence of opioid switching to methadone, underestimate the number of opioids which have been tried prior to the switch to methadone, and overestimate the rate of treatment success from switching to methadone in cancer patients. When the criteria for case definition of patients switching to methadone for non-malignant pain were decided, a high specificity was given higher priority than a high sensitivity. Thus, our study might underestimate the prevalence of opioid switching to methadone for non-malignant pain.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study has provided new insight into the long term outcomes from opioid switching to methadone. Opioid switching to methadone appears to provide a long lasting improvement in the balance between pain control and effects in a significant proportion of the patients. However, the study raises concerns regarding treatment options with less risk not being exhausted prior to a switch to methadone. A second concern is that a majority of cancer patients switching to methadone do not receive rapid and short acting opioids for breakthrough pain.</p>
