<p>In Malaysia, landfills are being filled up rapidly due to the current daily generation of approximately 30 000 tonnes of municipal solid waste. This situation creates the crucial need for improved landfilling practices, as sustainable landfilling technology is yet to be achieved here. The objective of this paper is to identify and evaluate the development and trends in landfilling practices in Malaysia. In 1970, the disposal sites in Malaysia were small and prevailing waste disposal practices was mere open-dumping. This network of relatively small dumps, typically located close to population centres, was considered acceptable for a relatively low population of 10 million in Malaysia. In the 1980s, a national programme was developed to manage municipal and industrial wastes more systematically and to reduce adverse environmental impacts. The early 1990s saw the privatization of waste management in many parts of Malaysia, and the establishment of the first sanitary landfills for MSW and an engineered landfill (called ‘secure landfill’ in Malaysia) for hazardous waste. A public uproar in 2007 due to contamination of a drinking water source from improper landfilling practices led to some significant changes in the government’s policy regarding the country’s waste management strategy. Parliament passed the Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management (SWPCM) Act 2007 in August 2007. Even though the Act is yet to be implemented, the government has taken big steps to improve waste management system further. The future of the waste management in Malaysia seems somewhat brighter with a clear waste management policy in place. There is now a foundation upon which to build a sound and sustainble waste management and disposal system in Malaysia.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Various driving factors influence the waste management system in a country. Thus, identifying related obstacles are a necessary first step towards achievement of a sustainable practice. Waste management has become an issue of concern ever since humans began to build communities within a concentrated area. The greater the population density the more important is a proper waste management system. Initially, waste management systems were implemented solely to remove food and breeding media for flies and rats, removing wastes from and near living spaces and depositing it ‘out of sight’. The main objective of the disposal system was to take care of the sanitation and health of the community. However, with the development of modern civilization, simply removing waste became an insufficient solution because waste disposal dumps became major sources of regional environmental contamination due to emissions of leachate and gas into groundwater and surface water; dumps were soon recognized as unsuitable and unsustainable disposal practices. Therefore, various strategies have been introduced to improve the concepts of waste management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12437564">Agamuthu et al., 2009a</xref>).</p>
<p>Waste reduction, reutilization and recycling, the 3Rs concept, is widely practiced throughout the globe in order to achieve sustainable waste management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12437564">Agamuthu et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12437564">2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12437564">Damgaard 2009</xref>). However, a final disposal element is still necessary since there is neither technology available to prevent all unwanted materials from the waste stream nor funds available to achieve zero waste. Therefore, sustainable landfilling is a necessary part of an efficient integrated waste management system. Modern sanitary landfills are designed, constructed, and maintained to minimize the adverse environmental impacts from the waste disposal over both the short and long terms.</p>
<p>Various impacts from improper landfilling activities had been reported which includes leachate contamination to surface and groundwater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12437564">Fauziah et al., 2005</xref>), infestation of pest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12437564">Ojeda-Benitez and Beraud-Lozano, 2003</xref>) and emission of landfill gases such as methane (40–50%) and carbon dioxide (50%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12437564">Agamuthu, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12437564">Buivid et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12437564">Halvadakis et al., 1988</xref>). Therefore, it is crucial that landfills are to be managed sustainably to minimize the potential risk to the environment. In addition, the concept of sustainable landfilling has been introduced to make waste disposal sites more acceptable to neighbouring communities and reduces the overall cost of waste management and environmental protection (e.g. by minimizing the potential for future contamination that would cost more to remediate than prevent in the first place). Nowadays, sustainable landfilling practice promises much greater security in terms of pollution prevention, as well as generating continuous revenue even after the landfill is closed (e.g. from sale of landfill gas for use as a fuel). Among the successful implementations of the sustainable landfilling concept are in Vienna and Osaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X12437564">Best Practice UN-Habitat, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Annual generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) in Malaysia has exceeded 11 million tonnes in recent years, resulting in an urgent need for a more efficient waste management system and a more sustainable landfilling practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12437564">Agamuthu and Fauziah, 2011</xref>). Until recent years the absence of an integrated waste management system resulted in more than 10 million tonnes of MSW being deposited into dumps or minimally controlled landfills per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12437564">Fauziah and Agamuthu, 2009</xref>). This resulted from the practice of direct disposal of 95% of the total MSW into the disposal sites.</p>
<p>The immense dependency on landfills in Malaysia necessitates that they are managed effectively and in a sustainable manner in order to reduce environmental impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12437564">Latifah et al., 2009</xref>). However, sustainable landfilling technology is yet to be achieved particularly among the developing countries such as Malaysia. Thus, the importance of sustainable landfilling practices in Malaysia needs to be highlighted. This paper sets forth the range of landfilling practices in Malaysia. Past and present status is addressed while future prospects are forecasted.</p>

<title>Management of the MSW in Malaysia (1970–1980s)</title>
<p>Solid waste management is defined as a discipline that encompasses solid waste generation, storage, collection, transfer and transport, processing and disposal by taking into consideration environmental, economic, aesthetics and public concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12437564">Agamuthu, 2001</xref>). However, the ability of any given solid waste management system to achieve optimal effectiveness and cost-efficiency is highly dependent on the economic, social and technological conditions of the region and/or country.</p>
<sec id="section3-0734242X12437564">
<title>Past practices in Malaysia</title>
<p>In Malaysia, government focus on solid waste issues was not evident until the late 1970s. Organized solid waste management operations began with street cleaning and the collection and transportation of municipal solid waste to already established disposal sites (typically open and often burning dumps) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X12437564">JICA, 2007</xref>). Overall, solid waste management was quite primitive, yet sufficient to handle the daily generation of MSW (estimated at about 0.5 kg capita<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12437564">Agamuthu et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12437564">Latifah et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X12437564">Table 1</xref> shows the generation of MSW from 1970 to 2010. Waste disposal activities were conducted only by local authorities (LAs) namely the city councils, municipal councils and district councils.</p>

<p>The LAs are mainly empowered through provisions under the national Streets, Drainage and Building Act 1974, Local Government Act 1976, and the Town and Country Planning Act 1976 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12437564">Agamuthu et al., 2004</xref>). Solid waste management in the LAs was handled by the Department of Urban Services, where the responsibility ranged according to the size of the district under its jurisdiction. As a result, in most cases waste collection service was only available in urban areas while citizens in rural communities managed and handled the disposal of their own waste via burying or burning within their compound, without any assistance from the LAs.</p>
<p>Disposal sites then were mere open-dumping grounds owned by the LAs. Their sizes were small corresponding to the small communities they served and were scattered throughout the country. In 1970s, disposal sites were to be found near urban areas with higher population density. The selection of these dumping areas was based on convenience to the LAs rather than the crucial environmental considerations such as groundwater level, soil type and the proximity to residential areas. The location and use of close-in disposal sites was convenient for local citizens and also minimized the cost to transport MSW from the generation centers.</p>
<p>In early 1980s, Malaysia’s expanding economy resulted in a significant growth of population in the country’s urban centers, accompanied by expansion of commercial, industrial and housing centres. This development also caused the price of land to escalate, particularly land in or near to urban areas. This led to the locating of new waste disposal facilities in more remote and marginal areas (ex-mining land etc) away from urban centers. The suitability of this land for waste disposal was often not considered. In addition, progress in industrialization and commercialization saw the generation of increasingly more MSW overall and per capita, and that contained a wider range of components than just a few decades earlier. Thus, existing waste disposal practices became increasingly ineffective. As a result, efforts to improve the management of municipal and industrial wastes were instigated at the national level to reduce the environmental and public health risks associated with improper handling and disposal. In particular, waste disposal regulations were developed for the Refuse Collection &amp; Disposal By –Laws (1983), and the hazardous waste management centre was also opened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12437564">Agamuthu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X12437564">Noorhajran, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The national programme was developed to provide the foundation for managing municipal and industrial wastes more systematically. However, the initial regulations did not achieve the desired level of improvement in waste disposal site operations and/or construction to preclude unacceptable levels of environmental degradation; for example, surface water pollution due to leachate generation, air pollution from uncontrolled landfill fires and landfill slope failures continued (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://landslides-gib.blogspot.com">landslides-gib.blogspot.com</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12437564">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12437564">Fauziah and Agamuthu, 2003</xref>). With the increase in living standards, many Malaysian citizens became more vocal opponents of proposed disposal sites in their neighborhoods, not unlike similar protests in developed countries in Europe and Northern America.</p>
<p>The public’s not-in-my-back-yard (NIMBY) attitude can be a particularly significant obstacle to improving waste management system when rapidly filling dumps needs to be replaced in a short timeframe. Additionally, the cost for proper waste management was projected to require the expenditure of more than 60% of annual LA budgets, a costly obligation for local governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12437564">Agamuthu et al., 2004</xref>). Having to satisfy public needs for a more efficient waste management system, the national government decided to establish a network of private contractors to perform the basic waste handling services in designated areas of the country.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0734242X12437564">
<title>Privatization in Malaysia, 1983 through the present</title>
<p>Privatization is normally considered an action by a governmental agency to delegate waste handling duties from government forces to private contractors. The government agency maintains the overall responsibility for waste management as a public health protection measure, but simply contracts out the means to accomplish this public good. Privatization in Malaysia was initiated as a national policy in 1983, to transfer the management and functions from the public sector to the private sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X12437564">Zainal, 1997</xref>). The objectives of the privatization initiated by Malaysian national policy which was also incorporated into the waste management sector are as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0734242X12437564" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Reducing the financial responsibility of the government and minimizing their administrative duties;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Improving efficiency and productivity;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Facilitating economic growth;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reducing the presence of the public sector in the economy;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Assisting the country in meeting its national development policy goals.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The privatization of urban solid waste management in Malaysia commenced in 1993 with the objective to provide an integrated, effective, efficient, and technologically advanced solid waste management system. It was also expected to resolve the problems in solid waste management faced by the LAs such as insufficient funding for capital investment, lack of expertise, illegal dumping, open burning and lack of proper solid waste disposal sites. Following an open bidding process, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government selected and contracted four private waste management consortiums, each allocated a concession for a designated region of the country (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12437564">Figure 1</xref>). The four contractors are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12437564">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Privatization resulted with transfer of responsibility of waste collection and disposal, from the LAs to the waste managing consortiums. More investment was made to improve waste collection strategies and purchase waste collecting vehicles, to gain public approval. The waste managing concessionaires initially gave lesser priority to improve landfilling practices due to the fact that the general public was perceived to be less concerned about disposal issues as compared with issues of waste collection. This is generally due to the fact that the ‘out of sight and out of mind’ concept is strongly embedded among the citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12437564">Fauziah and Agamuthu, 2010</xref>). Therefore, disposal sites were not significantly upgraded during the initial phases of the privatization process. Existing disposal sites, including dumps, were still used. As a result, these existing dumping grounds were continuously receiving waste, sometimes for longer than the intended operating period.</p>
<p>The ability of the concessionaires to invest and improve waste management facilities within their jurisdiction varied with their capacity to generate revenues from waste management services. These revenues were supposed to be obtained from the LAs based on the volume of waste handled, but at later stages of the privatization, there were more dilemmas, when the waste managing consortiums were not paid promptly. The uncertainty of income flows resulted in delays by the waste managing consortiums in closing dumps and constructing more modern landfills. Therefore, the level of service provided by the private contractors was inconsistent and varied depending on the timeliness of payments.</p>
<p>Due to the inability to generate revenue and maintain the operation efficiency, two consortiums failed during their concession period and terminated their contracts. As a result, only two remained to date, namely Alam Flora (P) Ltd. (AFPL) and Southern Waste Management (P) Ltd., to cater for the needs of only part of the country’s waste management demand. In recent months it has been reported that AFPL is experiencing such a serious financial problem that the State government of Selangor has to decide to take-over the responsibility of public cleansing management from the concessionaire to relieve it of its burden. However, two of the nine LAs in Selangor are currently facing financial and manpower constraint that take over the public cleansing from AFPL have been hampered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12437564">Bernama, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The surviving waste managing consortiums face various challenges to improve the quality of their services. For instance, it has been reported that loans from financial institutions are not available to these waste managing consortia. As a result, more focus was given to maintaining good public relations by ensuring waste collection services are at the most efficient level to satisfy the immediate needs of the public. Few citizens voiced concerns about continuation improper waste disposal.</p>
<p>The operation cost of MSW management systems increasingly absorbed more and more of the total budget over the years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12437564">Agamuthu and Fauziah, 2011</xref>). Due to the lack of focus on landfill management aspects, Malaysia faced serious problems due to the pollution from landfills and solid waste management, particularly improper waste disposal, which is considered as one of the three major environmental problems faced by most municipalities, besides water and air pollution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12437564">Agamuthu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12437564">Choy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12437564">Fauziah and Agamuthu, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X12437564">World Bank, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The adoption by the Malaysian government of the concept of sustainable development in 1995 resulted in more focus being given to the sustainability of waste disposal facilities. As a result, improvement strategies for the country’s waste management system were implemented. This included the establishment of the first sanitary landfill and a secure landfill in Malaysia. The former was to accommodate the MSW from Kuala Lumpur and its outskirts, while the latter was for the treatment and disposal of the nation’s hazardous wastes. To accommodate the needs to dispose medical waste, five regional medical waste incinerators, with a capacity of 20–500 kg h<sup>−1</sup>, were constructed in 1995. Thus, major changes were observed in the waste management system in the country.</p>

<title>Current conditions</title>
<p>A more systematic waste management program was gradually put in place by end of the 1990s. However, rapid economic development, continued increases in urban population and improvements in the standard of living resulted with an average daily per capita MSW generation rate of 1.2 kg in 2007, and more than 1.5 kg in 2010. It is estimated that MSW generation is increasing at a rate of 3% per annum. Urban centres, which constitute more than 65% of the total population, is the main source of MSW.</p>
<p>Although waste management practices have been steadily improving since the 1990s, waste generation has increased by at least 60 and 170% over the last 10-year and 30-year periods, respectively. Increasing waste flows began to alarm waste managers due to the rapid utilization of waste cells in the dumping ground which are non-sanitary landfills. The absence of an integrated waste management system such as proper material recovery practice and appropriate planning of waste management strategies resulted in premature closure of many of these disposal sites.</p>
<p>In 2006, leachate contamination of the Klang valley drinking water source led to the government’s increased involvement in the country’s waste management system. As a result, more sanitary landfills are being built, and new dumps are strictly forbidden; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12437564">Table 3</xref> summarizes the classification system for new disposal sites in Malaysia. Non-sanitary landfill in Malaysia refers to controlled dumps constructed without a proper engineering plan. These disposal sites lacked the landfill bottom liner system which is needed to confine and collect leachate emissions. In the meantime, existing non-sanitary landfills are to be upgraded to Class IV landfills to minimize the pollution emissions from these dumping grounds or are required to cease operations on site-specific dates. This action has resulted in a better management and monitoring of landfills in the country.</p>

<p>Resulting from the direct order from the federal government, and publicity from the media, the management of landfills in Malaysia began to see some improvement. Among others was the immediate closure of disposal sites adjacent to rivers, particularly those which posed risks of surface water contamination. As a result, the total number of landfills in the country has been drastically reduced, as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X12437564">Table 4</xref>.</p>

<p>Currently, 291 MSW-controlled dumps or known as non-sanitary landfills are recorded throughout the country. These controlled dumps lacked landfill liners which are considered necessary to confine landfill emissions from polluting the environment. With only 12 sanitary landfills available, 155 existing and actively operating controlled dumps play an important role as the final depository of MSW in Malaysia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X12437564">Table 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the 1970s, a total of 111 disposal sites were closed when these facilities exhausted their capacity to receive MSW, and/or due to its unsuitable location. The controlled dumps are currently undergoing upgrading to Class IV category in order to abide by the strict regulations stipulated by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government (MHLG) since 2007. It is also aimed at reducing the environmental impacts that originated from the dumping grounds. To date, more sanitary landfills are being proposed to meet the ever increasing need of waste disposal in the country. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0734242X12437564">Table 5</xref> lists the sanitary landfills in Malaysia which are newly constructed as a result of SWPCM Act <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X12437564">2007</xref> (with exception to the closed Air Hitam Sanitary Landfill).</p>

<p>Future landfilling practices are expected to improve substantially as open dumps and non-sanitary landfills are now prohibited and are being phased out. These stringent requirements are stipulated in the Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management (SWPCM) Act <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X12437564">2007</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0734242X12437564">
<title>Background to the Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management Act 2007</title>
<p>The public uproar in March 2006 (leachate contamination) is the most significant event that prompted the promulgation of an aggressive ruling by the government to improve current waste management systems in Malaysia. This resulted with the passing of the SWPCM Act <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X12437564">2007</xref>, which had been debated in the Parliament since 1997. The Act has been implemented in September 2011 with two years grace period before its strict enforcement. The 4 years gap is generally due to the fact that new departments namely the Department of National Solid Waste Management (DNSWM) and Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management Corporation (SWPCMC) are to be set up to handle, manage and enforce the Act.</p>
<p>The 88-page Act which was approved in August 2007 is administered by DNSWM of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. The objective of the Act is to improve and ensure higher quality services in solid waste management. Adapted from the Best Management Practices in solid waste management from Japan, Denmark, Switzerland, Germany and the United States, the Act also focused on public cleanliness management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12437564">Agamuthu et al., 2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>Among the main strategies to improve MSW management in the country, efficient solid waste treatment, interim treatment, and appropriate final disposal of solid waste are to be implemented. It includes the management of amenities from roads and toilets to drains, food courts and grass by the roadside. The Act covers the management of solid waste from commercial centres, public sites, construction sites, households, industrial zones and institutions, as well as imported solid wastes.</p>
<p>Various changes are observed after the implementation of the Act on 1 September 2011. Among others are the aggressiveness of the DNSWM in compiling data and information on current solid waste management system in Malaysia since, carrying out of comprehensive studies on different types of waste including food waste, plastics, tires and paper, and the revision of the key performance index of the concessionaires.</p>

<title>Future prospects for landfills in Malaysia</title>
<sec id="section8-0734242X12437564">
<title>Fees and levy of waste management services</title>
<p>A provision to enable charges for waste collection, treatment and disposal services is also included in the Act. Waste generators are required to pay a fee or levy to the private company service providers. Prior to Act, budget for waste management services are extracted from the assessment fees paid to respective municipalities. However, with the implementation of the Act, separate charges will be imposed on the waste generator with direct billing by the waste managers. Waste generator who fail to pay the waste collection service fees will be liable to a minimum fine of RM10 000 (€2220) or 5 years imprisonment. Additional penalties (RM50 or €11) will be charged for additional days on which the offence is committed.</p>
<p>By imposing these direct charges to waste generators, it is intended that the revenue can be collected by the waste management companies and applied to upgrade their facilities and equipment. It is expected that private contractors will be better able to allocate funds from service revenues for the improvement of landfills.</p>
<p>The Act also includes a provision of the establishment and the administration of the Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management Corporation Fund by the SWPCMC. The fund consists of allocations provided by the Parliament, investments and revenues by the Corporation, consultancy fees earned by the Corporation and other source of income of the Corporation. The fund is established to finance activities including research and development in solid waste management.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0734242X12437564">
<title>Source separation and recycling</title>
<p>Implementation of source separation programmes is included under Clause 74 of the Act. Mandatory source separation will enable higher recovery of recyclables and consequently reduce the final disposal significantly. Currently, more than 60% of the total MSW in Malaysia is recyclables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12437564">Fauziah and Agamuthu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12437564">Mohamad Osman et al., 2009</xref>). The collection of at least some of these recyclables from the MSW stream will extend the useful lives of country’s landfills.</p>
<p>In addition to that, private waste management firms will be given full authority to conduct waste collection, transfer and disposal activities. Unsanctioned recovery activities, such as scavenging and illegal transaction of recyclables, will be liable to fines of RM10 000 (€2220) within Clause 71 of the Act. As for the existing informal recycling sector, the grace period allows individual entities to be registered as licensed party, legalizing their activities with the implementation of the Act.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0734242X12437564">
<title>Illegal dumping issues</title>
<p>Illegal dumping, a serious issue to be tackled by waste manager, is also addressed in the Act. The Act includes a prohibition against unauthorized disposal of waste, where upon conviction, the defendant will be liable to a fine of RM10 000 up to RM100 000 (€2220–€22 220), or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both. This facet of the law is intended to discourage littering and illegal dumping and thus minimize the contractor’s need to devote resources to maintain sanitary conditions in the community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0734242X12437564">
<title>Decisive power on waste management facilities</title>
<p>The Act also empowers the Ministry to adopt suitable strategies in respect to solid waste and public cleansing management. This includes the formulation and planning of the location, type and size of new treatment facilities, the coverage areas of the facilities and time-scale for the implementation. This will enable the Ministry to bring about improvements to the waste management infrastructure as new technologies emerge over time.</p>
<p>Apart from that, Part III of the Act also includes clauses related to the construction, alteration or closure of disposal facilities. The clauses call for contractors to obtain Ministry approval prior to initiating any activities that involve the construction, alteration or closure of landfills. This provision is to enable authorities to monitor the management of landfills and prevent unpermitted landfill practices.</p>
<p>Construction or alteration of any waste management facilities without written consent from the Ministry or not in accordance to the approved specifications is an offence. Upon conviction, the offender can be fined a maximum fine of RM100 000 (€22 220) or 5 years imprisonment or both.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0734242X12437564">
<title>Closure of waste management facilities</title>
<p>Additionally, owners of any waste management facility who intend to close or cease operation are obliged to submit a written application and an acceptable closure plan to the Ministry. This provision will enable the Ministry to monitor, record and update the number of waste management facilities in the country.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no definitive database of the number of waste management facilities in Malaysia, such as disposal sites (including illegal dumps) and waste treatment facilities such as recycling centres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12437564">Agamuthu and Fauziah, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12437564">Latifah et al., 2009</xref>). Lack of this basic information is an impediment to proper planning for future strategies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0734242X12437564">
<title>Licensing provision</title>
<p>Also addressed in the Act is the licensing provision whereby a strict set of permit conditions can be imposed on government contractors. The provision under Part IV of the Act requires provider of solid waste management services to obtain licence from DNSWPCM and comply the condition ruled under the licence. Licensees are required to pay the prescribed fees within the prescribed period and comply with the conditions imposed including the nature, extent, frequency of services provided, area and scheme of services, availability of solid waste management facilities and deposit of prescribed amount for safe closure of solid waste management facilities. Non-compliance will result in refusal of licence renewal or revocation of licence. This is considered an important provision of the Act because current waste management licence holders have not shown the willingness to improve or upgrade the waste management facilities under their control. With reference to Clause 20 of the Act, it is mandatory that all licensers comply with the licence conditions. In addition, with the implementation of the Act, new landfills will be equipped with appropriate facilities making it possible for landfill gas collection a potential type of project for which funding may be available under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). On-going project at the Seelong Sanitary Landfill in Johor Bharu, the most southern city in Peninsular Malaysia allows the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs to purchase the total 303 353 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> from Malaysia from July 2007 to June 2014 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ScandAsia.com">ScandAsia.com</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X12437564">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X12437564">UNFCCC, 2011</xref>.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In the past, waste management practices in Malaysia were relatively primitive characterized by hundreds of open and often burning dumps. This unacceptable situation precipitated the need for improvements to the country’s waste management systems, particularly as waste generation rates rapidly increased and the composition of waste became more diverse.</p>
<p>Current practices reflect noted improvements through the gradual replacement of open and/or controlled dumps with landfills that incorporate at least some environmental protection measures. In some cities more sanitary landfills have been developed. The improvement trend continues with the passing of the SWPCM Act <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X12437564">2007</xref>, which aims for the development of a nationwide network of modern, sustainable sanitary landfills. The future of waste management in Malaysia seems brighter as the country’s waste management policies and strategies are phased in to meet the expectations of its citizens and the needs of a modernizing society aided by the in-place waste management policy.</p>
