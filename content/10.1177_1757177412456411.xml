<p>The journal watch feature is provided as a service to our readers. The intention is to highlight new research and other developments in infection prevention and control and related fields that have been published elsewhere. A brief description of each article and its main findings are given here; readers are encouraged to refer to the full published article for the details of the work. The editorial management group would welcome feedback and recommendations for articles to feature in this column; for comments and recommendations please contact the editor: <email>editor@ips.uk.net</email></p>
<p>The first two articles featured, both from the <italic>American Journal of Infection Control</italic>, give those of us who practise in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, i.e., the majority of the membership of the Infection Prevention Society (IPS), an insight into developments in our specialty from ‘over the pond’ in the USA.</p>
<p>Both these articles reflect aspects of the IPS Strategy and remind us of the similarities in our specialty wherever it is practised. The first of these concerns an issue in which IPS has been consistently ‘ahead of the curve’ – the continuing development and description of a competency framework for practitioners in infection prevention – and the second gives the results of a survey of the research priorities of members of APIC (the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology Inc.)</p>
<p><bold>Murphy DM, Hanchett M, Olmsted RN, Farber MR, Lee TB, Haas JP, Streed SA. (2012) Competency in infection prevention: a conceptual approach to guide current and future practice. <italic>American Journal of Infection Control</italic> 40: 296–303</bold>.</p>
<p>This paper reflects a strategic commitment by APIC to ‘develop a conceptual model of IP competency that could be applied in all settings’ and describes competencies on a continuum from novice to expert infection prevention practitioner or ‘infection preventionist (IP)’ as it is termed in the USA. This model is based upon core competencies, the knowledge aspects of which are examined by the ‘Certificate in Infection Control (CIC)’, the standard qualification for IPs in the USA (see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbic.org/UserFiles/file/2012CandidateHandbook_v1.pdf">www.cbic.org/UserFiles/file/2012CandidateHandbook_v1.pdf</ext-link>). The CIC examination is seen, in this model, as part of the bridge from novice to proficient practitioner but the actual competencies are viewed as common across the continuum from novice to expert, though practised with ever increasing complexity and expertise. The paper presents the conceptual model visually as a circular diagram with patient safety at its centre and four domains that spread outwards across concentric circles of expertise and career progression for the IP. These four domains, though titled and organised differently, have much in common with the four domains of the IPS’s ‘outcome competences for practitioners in infection prevention and control’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177412456411">Burnett, 2011</xref>), which this paper acknowledges and references. APIC describe their four domains as ‘1. Leadership and Programme Management, 2. Infection Prevention and Control, 3. Technology and 4. Performance Improvement and Implementation Science.’ These are relatively self-explanatory but for example Domain 1 includes critical thinking skills and Domain 2 includes education and research, which in the IPS competencies are described as domains in their own right. In common with the IPS competencies this model is seen as a tool to assist IPs in assessing themselves and identifying development needs and opportunities. Interestingly APIC see this model, which they describe as a white paper, as focusing in particular on those areas of IP practice that will be ‘especially critical in the next 3 to 5 years’. UK and Republic of Ireland infection prevention practitioners should find the similarities and contrasts between our current state and future challenges and those in the US worthy of some reflection.</p>

<p>The second paper produced by APIC and published in their journal concerns research priorities and again this reflects discussion and debate within both IPS and the wider UK and Republic of Ireland infection prevention and control community. Readers may recall the IPS research priorities exercise conducted around 2008 which helped to inform the priorities of the IPS Research &amp; Development Committee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177412456411">Loveday et al, 2009</xref>). These US survey results are a follow up to a similar Delphi-based process from about ten years ago and identify the research priorities as perceived by members of APIC. What may strike readers of this journal are both the consistency of these priorities, both over time, and between the US and the settings in which we work. The process for identifying these priorities included presenting the results of the previous exercise and asking respondents to rank them, as well as giving the opportunity to present new issues not previously identified. It could be argued that this approach makes it more likely that similar themes will be identified, but the consistency of priority ranking is quite powerful. The results are divided into top, high and mid importance and the consistency in ranking, particularly of the ‘top’ priorities over time is striking. Only one item has changed ranking in the top seven items (more on this below). The very top priority reflects the discussion in the Journal Watch Column in the July 2012 issue of this journal regarding human behaviour; ‘Apply behavioral and management science to achieve compliance with infection prevention (e.g. hand hygiene, isolation precautions, sharp injury prevention)’. Many of the other priorities will be recognised by readers of this journal, such as improving information systems and extending infection prevention knowledge beyond secondary care settings; readers are encouraged to refer to the full article. It is a reflection of the differing evolution and history of infection prevention in the UK and USA that priority number 2 concerns the development of meaningful surveillance indicators, perhaps not surprising now, but in the USA this is unchanged from 10 years ago…</p>
<p>The only ‘new entry’ into the top priorities links us very neatly in to the next paper for discussion: ‘Develop methods to improve the clinical diagnosis, prevention and management of ventilator-associated pneumonia, including timing of tube changes, effect of weaning schedules, mouth care, bed position and other factors among patients of all ages.’</p>
<p><bold>O’Grady NP, Murray PR, Ames N. (2012) Preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia; does the evidence support the practice? <italic>JAMA</italic> 307(23): 2534–9</bold>.</p>
<p>This article, which is described as ‘Grand Rounds – Clinician’s Corner’, provides a potted overview of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) – risk factors, microbiology, pathogenesis (particularly the contribution of the oral microbiome) and prevention, based around a case study. The paper then goes on to challenge current practice, and in particular the infection prevention aspects of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s (IHI) ventilator bundle (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ihi.org/knowledge/Pages/Changes/ImplementtheVentilatorBundle.aspx">www.ihi.org/knowledge/Pages/Changes/ImplementtheVentilatorBundle.aspx</ext-link>). The article first of all points out, quite correctly, that the bundle is not a VAP bundle, but a bundle designed to prevent complications from mechanical ventilation, including but not limited to VAP. The authors point out that the use of histamine-2 antagonists to prevent peptic ulcers may, as part of the overall bundle, conversely increase the risk of VAP. The article then describes and critiques each aspect of the VAP prevention elements of the bundle, suggesting that both elevating the head of the bed and daily interruption of sedation may have mixed positive and negative effects, rather than being always automatically beneficial; and that oral care with chlorhexidine has an evidence base that is limited to specific patient groups. The authors conclude by discussing the pros and cons of some more or less novel approaches to preventing VAP that aren’t currently part of the standard bundle; alternative positioning including head down, subglottal suctioning, methods to prevent biofilm formation and a ‘mucus shaver’. Overall, while this is an interesting and stimulating read, a certain amount of caution is required. The article isn’t and doesn’t claim to be a systematic review of the evidence and the authors, for the purpose of stimulating debate, may have been selective in their presentation of the evidence. Nevertheless readers may wish to reflect on the need to constantly question even the most established wisdom.</p>
<p>As a previous member of the Scientific Programme Committee for the annual conferences organised by and on behalf of IPS, I remember the event management company commenting worriedly on the proposed programme about what they perceived as a lack of ‘bugs’; so the remaining articles concentrate back on the bugs …</p>
<p><bold>Weigand PN, Nathwani D, Wilcox MH, Stephens J, Shelbaya A, Haider S. (2012) Clinical and economic burden of <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection in Europe: a systematic review of healthcare-facility-acquired infection. <italic>Journal of Hospital Infection</italic> 81: 1–14</bold>.</p>
<p>Using recognised data extraction tools the authors of this paper systematically reviewed the literature on <italic>C. difficile</italic> infection (CDI) in European healthcare facilities between 2000 and 2010 with regard to the outcomes of mortality, recurrence, length of stay and cost. This review will serve any infection prevention practitioner as a quick reference to the burden of CDI including the impact of ribotype 027 in terms of increased disease severity and mortality. The authors identified a range of measures of mortality, including 30 day and attributable mortality, and within these a range of results across the countries from which data were available. For example the range of attributable mortality in Europe identified was 0 to 70% and this, the authors suggest, says as much about the heterogeneity of methods and definitions used as it does about CDI mortality. Nevertheless there are some consistent themes within the findings; in particular, wherever ribotype 027 has been identified, mortality (however measured) has been higher. Definitions of recurrence were found to be also inconsistent and rates of recurrence range from 1% in a Paris study to 36% in a study set in Ireland. The authors do not comment on the nature of said recurrences, i.e. whether relapse or reinfection, presumably because this has been investigated only rarely. Most of the estimates of length of stay lacked a control group and the incremental length of stay was rarely studied, but where available it ranged from (a surprising) 0 to 18 additional days. Finally the data on costs are most striking for the lack of recent cost estimates from the UK where the well known figure of circa £4000 calculated by Wilcox and colleagues in 1996 remains in common use. In the rest of Europe the authors identified incremental costs of around £4500 to £8800 (standardised to 2010 values and GB£). This paper contains a wealth of information as well as a frustrating lack of consistency in how these important outcomes are measured and reported.</p>
<p><bold>Matthews JE, Dickey BW, Miller RD, Felzer JR, Dawson BP, Lee AS, Rocks JJ, Kiel J, Montes JS, Moe CL, Eisenberg JNS, Leon JS. (2012) Systematic review. The epidemiology of published norovirus outbreaks: a review of risk factors associated with attack rate and genogroup. <italic>Epidemiology &amp; Infection</italic> 140: 1161–72</bold>.</p>
<p>This is a wide-ranging review which goes well beyond the world of health care and healthcare associated infection and is included primarily as a reminder that there is a world (and a world of literature) outside the narrow confines of most of our everyday work experiences. The authors examine global epidemiological trends in human norovirus outbreaks in all settings, and including all types of transmission, in a systematic review covering the years 1983 to 2010. In a total of 830 published outbreaks, those in healthcare settings were the second most common type after those associated with food service (which included catered events), with other settings such as leisure and schools also identified. Once again this article presents a wealth of data and merits a full reading, the main messages for those working in healthcare settings are perhaps comforting; attack rates were found to be significantly lower in healthcare settings, and the authors suggest that the emphasis on interventions to limit spread in these settings may have an impact. It is interesting to note that the genogroup most associated with outbreaks in winter (compared with autumn), containing genogroup GII strains, is also the group associated with all of the healthcare outbreaks (<italic>n</italic>=47) where genogroup data were available; so it seems that ‘winter vomiting disease’ remains a reasonable description!</p>
<p>Once again we find that the published literature on issues related to infections, their epidemiology, consequences and their prevention is wide-ranging. Readers are again urged to refer to the full papers and reflect on their findings as well as the articles published here in the <italic>Journal of Infection Prevention</italic>.</p>
