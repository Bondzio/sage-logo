<abstract>
<p>The climatic conditions in Kuwait necessitate almost all buildings to be centrally air-conditioned with the latest HVAC system to provide the comfortable thermal environment for occupants. Mosques are used five times a day for a maximum time span of about half an hour or less for regular prayers. The study period was selected in the month of November when the ambient temperatures are moderate and cooling or heating is not required. The influence of natural draft through doors and other indoor/outdoor air exchange sites was examined for indoor air quality, degree of comfort, and different sorts of satisfaction during prayers. The indoor air quality is of major concern for mental, spiritual, and social satisfaction of the chaotic lifestyle of the present-day community. A weeklong study was conducted to measure temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, and over 70 volatile organic compounds indoors and in the ambient air in the vicinity of the selected mosque.</p></abstract>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X12441807" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fahaheel is one of the Kuwait largest cities. It is located in the southern part of Kuwait on the coast of Al-Ahmadi governorate, which is one of the six governorates in Kuwait. The geographic coordinates of Fahaheel are 29° 4′ 57.96″N, 48° 7′ 39.10″E, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X12441807">Figure 1</xref>. According to the latest census 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X12441807">1</xref>], from the public authority for civil information, Fahaheel has a population of 87,331, which makes up 12.85% of the total population of Al-Ahmadi. This large population occupies 118,341 residential units being scattered across 12 blocks. The different areas of Fahaheel are used for commercial, industrial, and residential purposes.
<fig id="fig1-1420326X12441807" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Location of Fahaheel city in Kuwait map.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X12441807-fig1.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>Kuwait’s main source of income comes from the oil and petroleum products, and has many of its facilities situated in and around Al-Ahmadi, such as Greater Burgan Oil Fields, which is the oldest and largest oil field in Kuwait. Fahaheel city is situated in the north of Shuaiba Industrial Area, which consists of petroleum refineries, petrochemical industries, cement and caustic industries and a wide range of small industries.</p>
<p>Air quality is an interesting subject, which is gaining more attention day-by-day in various parts of the world. Understanding indoor air quality (IAQ) has been a major challenge and is important because many people spend most of their time indoors, either at home or in their offices, especially in Kuwait where hostile weather condition exists.</p>
<p>Statistical data about indoor environmental condition in Kuwait mosques have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X12441807">2</xref>], which concluded that the neutral temperature during prayer in the mosque in Kuwait is about 26°C and the predicted mean vote (PMV) is 23.3°C. This difference is higher than those predicted by the PMV model; confirming that thermal comfort temperature cannot be related to those given by the international standard, ISO 7730 and ASHRAE 55-2004 standard. Energy consumption and thermal comfort conditions were monitored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X12441807">3</xref>] and the results showed no dependence of thermal comfort on energy load in several mosques in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Different worship places were studied for contribution of incense burning to increase concentrations of particulate matters (PMs) and adherence of polynucleic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to dusts and PMs, which can severely affect IAQ in these environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X12441807">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X12441807">5</xref>]. The influence of air-borne fungi, carpet allergens, and CO<sub>2</sub> in children in two elementary schools were reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X12441807">6</xref>]. Quantified trace metals were found in personal, indoor and outdoor exposed samples associated with PM<sub>2.5</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X12441807">7</xref>]. Various nitrogen oxide concentrations inside and outside the church were reported and the indoor concentrations of N<sub>2</sub>O, NO and NO<sub>2</sub> were found to be higher due to heterogeneous reaction between the reactive gaseous species and the walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X12441807">8</xref>].</p>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are used as a measure of IAQ; CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations ranged between 769 and 2001 ppm with an average of 1396 ppm being reported inside lecture rooms at Durian Tunggal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X12441807">9</xref>]. A developed ventilation-based model was used to predict theoretical CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in UK school buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X12441807">10</xref>]. They concluded that fresh-air ventilation failed to maintain CO<sub>2</sub> levels below 1500 ppm. Therefore, special building material and different ventilation designs were proposed to mitigate the build-up of CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the classrooms of a typical UK school. The CO<sub>2</sub> levels indicated the circulation rate, which determine the comfort level of occupants. The CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were 2.5 times more than the prescribed limits.</p>
<p>Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in Kuwait city have been compared with Phoenix, Arizona [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X12441807">11</xref>]. The 4 years of hourly data of concentration revealed an average value of 369.2 ppm, with an hourly maximum of 741.8 ppm in winter and a minimum of 320.6 ppm in summer, mainly reflecting the influence of metrological parameter effect – the diurnal cycle which provides an indication of road traffic contribution to CO<sub>2</sub> concentration levels. A trend of 1.42 ppm/year increase was noted based on this limited period of study. Furthermore, air quality in a typical residential area in Kuwait was assessed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X12441807">12</xref>], where road traffic was considered as the dominant source of pollution. The concentrations of measured pollutants were within the limit set by Kuwait Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the month of May 1994.</p>
<p>In the State of Kuwait, Government facilitates different services, such as health care, education, mosques and others. These are provided in almost all localities for the welfare of citizens. Currently, Fahaheel area has 22 mosques, each serving about 3970 residents.</p>
<p>In the present study, indoor air pollution for a mosque in Fahaheel city was monitored, especially focusing on CO<sub>2</sub> and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The reason for choosing this specific mosque is due to the large number of people who attend the mosque regularly, and is a good indication of IAQ in Fahaheel area. The mosque accommodates many people with different ages and gender, and it is important to improve the IAQ. Poor IAQ can result in the emergence of sick building syndrome (SBS).</p>
<p>In this study, CO<sub>2</sub> levels were measured to assess the IAQ inside the mosque and to determine the CO<sub>2</sub> trends existing throughout the day. CO<sub>2</sub> is a combustion by-product that is generated by burning fossil fuels. It is also produced naturally by human respiration process. CO<sub>2</sub> is considered as one of the greenhouse gases, which is responsible for the global warming of planet Earth. Seventy-two VOCs, relative humidity and air temperature were measured during the selected period of study.</p>
<sec id="sec2-1420326X12441807"><title>Data Collection</title>
<p>The environmental data were monitored for a week in a mosque in Fahaheel City. The mosque (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X12441807">Figure 2</xref>) is located in block 10 in Fahaheel City on the Coastal Road. The mosque hall has a volume of 17 × 17 × 4.8 = 1387 m<sup>3</sup>and has three doors that are closed all the time, except at prayer times. The reason for selecting this mosque is due to the unique location between commercial and residential blocks and also because the mosque is visited regularly by many worshipers. The period was selected at the end of the autumn season, when the temperature was moderate and HVAC systems were switched off to enjoy the pleasant natural climate.
<fig id="fig2-1420326X12441807" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>(a) The external layout of the mosque. (b) The internal features of the mosque during the sunset prayer.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X12441807-fig2.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>The outdoor air exchange only occurred during the prayer times as attendees used the main door for entrance. Indoor air in all air-tight buildings is regulated through HVAC system most of the times for extreme hot or cold conditions but there is very short spell at the start and also at the end of winter, when ambient temperatures are moderate and HVAC system is not required and IAQ is of real importance for such air-tight buildings.</p>
<p>Around 2016 valid measurements of concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>, relative humidity, and temperature measurements were undertaken during the period from 8 November 2010 to 14 November 14 2010. A USA-Model CO25 Meter (Extech Instruments Corporation), that uses non-dispersive infrared detection technology, was used to record the data. These measurements were taken for exactly 1 week in 5-min intervals to produce a clear trend of the concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> and to know the effects of attendees on the CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the mosque. The maximum recorded concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> was 1662 ppm, the minimum was 601 ppm, and the mean was 790 ppm at different times of the day.</p>
<p>Four types of VOCs, namely aliphatic, aromatic, oxygenated, and halogenated were sampled using silicon-coated stainless steel canisters of 6-liter capacity for 24 h during weekends and weekdays inside and outside the mosque. For VOCs analysis, the 24-h air samples were obtained from the roof of the mosque, at the right top corner, 10 m from the centre and central top row position, reflecting VOC concentrations inside and outside the mosque. The concentration values inside the mosque at the right top corner and central top row positions were not very different and reflected indoor concentrations. Air samples were analysed by Agilent gas chromatograph with Entech cryogen system using US EPA Compendium, TO-15 method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X12441807">13</xref>] for the determination of 72 VOCs, maintaining quality control and quality assurance. HVAC system was not functional during the study period, where relative humidity and temperature were indicative of the prevalent weather pattern. The indoor relative humidity varied between 22.9% and 65.9%, while the temperature varied between 21.4°C and 27°C.</p>
<p>Ambient air has a strong influence on the IAQ. There is a fixed air quality monitoring station owned by Kuwait EPA, located 2.3 km towards the west direction from the study site, where CO<sub>2</sub>, non-methane hydrocarbons, and all meteorological parameters are continuously measured. Meteorological data were used to show wind speed and direction influencing the air quality during the study period from 8 November 2010 to 14 November 2010. The wind rose was plotted as 16 sectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X12441807">Figure 3</xref>) depicting the maximum frequency of 62.5% for wind class of 0.5–2.1 m·s<sup>−1</sup> predominately blowing from southwest, while there was light wind blowing from ESE and NWN sectors.

<p>CO<sub>2</sub> concentration can be affected by ventilation rate, number of occupants, age and level of activity of the occupants. The space in the mosque is crucial in determining the air quality. The mosque has ventilation (through door opening) during the whole study period and most of the occupants were of similar age and activity levels, while the only variable parameter was the number of occupants. The number of attendees in the mosque was visually counted during each prayer session. Nevertheless, combustion is the main source of CO<sub>2</sub> and removing or reducing the combustion process could be a solution to maintain CO<sub>2</sub> level to within the specified limits. In the present case, there was no apparent fixed combustion source in the vicinity of the mosque. The major source for CO<sub>2</sub> was the road traffic, with people driving down to the mosque at prayer times.</p>
<p>The present investigation revealed that CO<sub>2</sub> concentration varied with time due to the occupants who attended the prayer at regular pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X12441807">Figure 4</xref>). There were five peaks that occurred during each day with different concentrations during the study period, reflecting the number of attendees at each prayer time in the mosque. It is clear that the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration peaks represented the occupancy levels and that the slope after each peak was less steep because the occupants usually left the prayer at varying times.
<fig id="fig4-1420326X12441807" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>CO<sub>2</sub> concentration at the mosque from 8 November 2010 to 14 November 2010.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X12441807-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The average background concentration was measured between 01:00 and 03:00 h at the monitoring site, when there was no occupancy at the mosque. The average background concentration was 781.7 ppm.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1420326X12441807"><title>Volatile Organic Compounds</title>
<p>It was observed that VOCs concentrations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X12441807">Table 1</xref>) were higher in outdoor air than indoor air, with the exception of oxygenated organic compounds. Predominant sources of VOCs in and around the vicinity of the Mosque are petroleum related activities, extraction, storage, transportation, refinery, distribution and consumption. The oxygenated organic compounds were mainly from alcohol used either in perfume or as an antiseptic on minor injuries or wounds. The time of this investigation was selected, when HVAC system was not in use and indoor air quality was strongly dependent on ambient air.

<p>The 24-h sampling of ambient air at the roof indicated a propane concentration of 47 ppb which is the highest concentration, aliphatic hydrocarbons measured in the atmosphere; the concentration of the total aliphatic hydrocarbons measured was 66 ppb during weekday. As Friday is an official holiday with minimal activity, there was a reduction in the total VOC load in ambient air with 32 ppb of total aliphatic compounds and a highest concentration of 23 ppb was measured for propane. The indoor air samples obtained from two places did not show much variance and the average concentration of total aliphatic hydrocarbons was 40 ppb during weekdays, with propane being predominant at 24 ppb, which was almost half of the outdoor concentration of propane. With a high participation of worshipers on Friday and the doors being more often open, facilitating good exchange between outdoor and indoor air, there was a decrease in the propane concentration (14 ppb) out of the total aliphatic hydrocarbons of 24 ppb. Indoor concentrations of total aliphatic hydrocarbons were slightly lower than outdoor, indicating an outdoor source for aliphatic hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>A total concentration of 23 ppb aromatic hydrocarbons being the highest during weekdays in the ambient air, Toluene (9 ppb) was the major constituents in the air samples. The measurements and also the activities in the mosque also indicated the prevalent influence of external sources for these compounds. The outdoor concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons on Friday were almost 50% less than those during the weekdays, due to a minimum activity because holiday. The total aromatic hydrocarbons concentration was 11 ppb with the highest being that of toluene, which was about 4 ppb. The concentration of aromatic compounds was the lowest as compare to aliphatic, oxygenated and halogenated compounds.</p></sec></sec>

<p>At first, the CO<sub>2</sub> daily average peak value during the dawn prayer was slightly increased by approximately 1.4% from the background concentration, reflecting a low number, 24, of attendees. This explains the occurrence of lower peak during dawn prayer than during other prayer times. The dawn prayer duration was short about 15 min and the CO<sub>2</sub> levels dropped down to the background concentration subsequently. The minimum CO<sub>2</sub> concentration occurred before the high noon prayer due to indoor/outdoor exchange through windows and doors fittings.</p>
<p>At high noon prayer for the whole week with the exception of Friday prayer, the occupants were in a large number of about 100, which had caused the average daily CO<sub>2</sub> peak (five-minute concentration) to rise to 847.5 ppm. The 3-h interval between high noon and afternoon prayers resulted in a reduction in the CO<sub>2</sub> levels due to infiltration and diffusion. An average daily peak value of 815.7 ppm was found during the afternoon prayer, reflecting low number of occupants of about 50. The maximum peak was 1662 ppm, which occurred during Friday prayer at high noon time. On Friday, usually the mosque is fully occupied with approximately 350 people attending the sermon and Friday prayer, and during this time a 96% increase in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was observed, as compared with the CO<sub>2</sub> levels during other high noon prayers. The CO<sub>2</sub> levels were always within the specified standard guideline, 1755 ppm proposed for lobbies/perfection by ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X12441807">14</xref>].</p>
<p>The CO<sub>2</sub> levels during both sunset and evening prayers were almost the same and followed similar patterns. The average daily CO<sub>2</sub> peaks during sunset prayer and evening prayer were 1004.7 and 1160.6 ppm, reflecting total number of attendees 144 and 160, respectively. The time difference between sunset and evening prayers was short, over an hour, producing less diffusion within the atmosphere. After the evening prayer, the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration would decrease until it reached the background concentration.</p>
<p>The daily average peak CO<sub>2</sub> concentration values were plotted against the respective number of attendees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X12441807">Figure 5</xref>). The data were correlated by linear equation showing an addition of 2.91 ppm per person irrespective of prayer times. The average background concentration was 635 ppm represented by the intercept during non-occupancy status of the mosque.

<p>The indoor concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> was clearly much higher than the ambient concentration because the prevalent source, namely the human respiration produced by the occupants, which has a strong influence on the indoor CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. The dilution of CO<sub>2</sub> was controlled by indoor/outdoor air exchange through windows and doors. The background concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> inside the mosque was about 122% of the ambient outdoor level.</p>
<p>The indoor CO<sub>2</sub> level reached over 200% of the ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1420326X12441807">Figure 7</xref>) due to the large number of attendees regularly visiting the mosque, five times a day for the duration of approximately 30 min each. The minimum indoor concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> was indicative of the exchange of indoor/outdoor air, which led to approximately 50% excess of ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. The average indoor CO<sub>2</sub> concentration for the study period was about 790 ppm.

<p>The halogenated compounds are mainly used in HVAC system and there might be a possibility of a leak that resulted in the build-up of indoor concentrations of halogenated VOCs from base fluid used in air refreshers and also insecticides. The concentrations of these compounds were the highest among all different types of hydrocarbons present in the air sample. The outdoor concentrations were found to be 248 and 98 ppb on weekdays and Friday, respectively. The highest halogenated compound in ambient air was observed to be vinyl chloride (98 ppb during weekday and 39 ppb during Friday). The measurement of indoor air samples during week days indicated a total halogenated hydrocarbons concentration of 229 ppb; these are predominantly comprising of refrigerant, 1,2-dichlorotetrafluoroethane (87 ppb). On Friday, there were many attendees and all mosques doors were opened for longer times, matching the indoor to outdoor concentrations of the total halogenated compounds, which was about 99 ppb, and the major compound was found to be vinyl chloride (about 35 ppb), followed by 1,2-dichlorotetrafluoroethane (33 ppb).</p>
<p>VOCs monitored in the mosque has second highest concentration of oxygenated compounds, which were most commonly used as solvents in furniture, paint, glue and also as perfume base and has some medical applications such as medical bandage used as antiseptic for minor injuries. Carbonyls, ketones, alcohols and esters were detected in higher concentrations in the indoor air as compared to ambient outdoor air, indicating local indoor sources. Furthermore, the indoor concentrations of oxygenated compounds for both weekdays and Friday were 131 and 79 ppb, respectively, with highly volatile alcohols showing the highest concentration of about 69 and 42 ppb for weekdays and Friday, respectively. The outdoor concentration of oxygenated compounds was 55 ppb during weekday; these are mainly low molecular weight alcohols of about 16 ppb. The concentration of oxygenated compounds on Fridays was 40 ppb, where volatile alcohols concentration was 12 ppb.</p>
<p>It was noticed that the non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) levels at continuous monitoring station between 06:00 and 09.00 h in Fahaheel in the ambient air exceeded Kuwait EPA standard almost during the entire study period. During the evening, between 19:00 and 21:00 h, the NMHC level was high due to the traffic activities around the monitoring site, mainly from Fahaheel highway and other sources such as industrial area and traffic activities inside the Fahaheel city. The NMHC levels during the evening time in weekends were found to be higher than those during weekdays, especially due to large number of cars passing nearby the monitoring site as well as due to people doing their weekend shopping. The concentration rose for NMHC is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1420326X12441807">Figure 8</xref> illustrating the prevalent source which was contributing to the deterioration of air quality. It is obvious that the maximum concentration was from the west-north-west direction indicating road traffic source, and possibly a contribution from the oil storage tank farm in Al-Ahmadi, and oil production from Greater Burgan Oil Fields.

<sec id="sec8-1420326X12441807" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In the present study, a continuous 5-min CO<sub>2</sub> measurement in one of the mosques in Fahaheel city was carried out to determine the IAQ. The CO<sub>2</sub> values revealed different activities at the respective timings based on the number of occupants present in the mosque. Five distinct concentration peaks occurred every day, which were related to the regular prayer times. A large CO<sub>2</sub> peak was found on Friday at high noon prayer, which represented the maximum occupancy. However, all the measured values were within ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2007 guidelines which were proposed for lobbies/perfection. It is recommended to regulate the fresh air intake only during the prayer- times to avoid the high build-up of CO<sub>2</sub> and conserving the energy during the time of no occupancy.</p>
<p>The measurement results revealed higher concentrations of total halogenated compounds, followed by total oxygenated compounds during weekday than during Friday, when the air exchange rate was high due to frequent opening of the doors by the many attendees of the mosque. The likely source for the aliphatic hydrocarbons would be mainly from external sources; higher outdoor concentration than indoors were found, irrespective of Friday or weekdays, while local indoor sources would be more likely for oxygenated hydrocarbon compounds; higher concentrations indoors were measured than the ambient air.</p></sec>
