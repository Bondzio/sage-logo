<abstract>
<p>The role of critical appraisal of qualitative studies in systematic reviews remains an ongoing cause for debate. Key to such a debate is whether quality assessment can or should be used to exclude studies. In our study, we extended the use of existing criteria to assess the quality of reporting of studies included in two qualitative systematic reviews. We then excluded studies deemed to be inadequately reported from the subsequent analysis. We tested the impact of these exclusions on the overall findings of the synthesis and its depth or thickness. Exclusion of so-called inadequately reported studies had no meaningful effect on the synthesis. There was a correlation between quality of reporting of a study and its values as a source for the final synthesis. We propose that there is a possible case for excluding inadequately reported studies from qualitative evidence synthesis.</p>

<body>
<p>The internal validity of a systematic review is dependent on both the quality of included studies and the reliability of their findings. The exact meaning of both quality and reliability in the context of quality assessment is vigorously contested. Debate is especially vocal when the review evidence is qualitative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312452937">Barbour, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312452937">Eakin &amp; Mykhalovskiy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312452937">Popay, Rogers, &amp; Williams, 1998</xref>). For example, the heavy reliance on direct observation in anthropology and ethnography has led some commentators to caution against any attempt to assess the quality of such research indirectly using predetermined criterion-based checklists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312452937">Power, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding such reservations, many of those involved in research synthesis, ourselves included, take a pragmatic and fundamentally utilitarian stance toward the potential contribution of qualitative research. Indeed, calls for just such a pragmatic approach have recently been issued from this very journal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732312452937">Thorne, 2011</xref>). We contend that if findings from individual qualitative data studies are to contribute to a collective understanding of a particular phenomenon, then the resulting synthesis must be based on how the original researchers report their findings. Furthermore, even though reviewers might prefer to access insights from the wider context within which the research has been conducted, in the absence of such insights they can base assessments of internal coherence and technical consistency only on the published accounts of such research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312452937">Sandelowski &amp; Barroso, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Currently, there is much debate and little consensus around the feasibility and usefulness of the quality assessment of qualitative studies in evidence synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312452937">Dixon-Woods et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312452937">Dixon-Woods, Shaw, Agarwal, &amp; Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312452937">Dixon-Woods et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312452937">Hannes, Lockwood, &amp; Pearson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312452937">Lincoln, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312452937">Mays &amp; Pope, 1995</xref>). In some techniques, such as metaethnography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312452937">Campbell et al., 2003</xref>), critical interpretive synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312452937">Barnett-Page &amp; Thomas, 2009</xref>), and framework synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312452937">Brunton, Oliver, Oliver, &amp; Lorenc, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312452937">Oliver et al., 2008</xref>), studies might be excluded explicitly on the basis of the quality assessment. In other examples of qualitative evidence synthesis, quality assessment has not been used at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312452937">Gomersall, Madill, &amp; Summers, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Consequently, researchers have called for both empirical research and theoretical debate to address important questions about the purpose of quality assessment in such types of evidence synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312452937">Dixon-Woods et al., 2007</xref>). Key to the controversy surrounding quality assessment is an understanding of the effects of including articles of differing quality within an interpretive synthesis. It is generally agreed that some form of quality assessment is required to identify flawed research that might distort a review’s findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312452937">Dixon-Woods &amp; Fitzpatrick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312452937">Dixon-Woods et al., 2004</xref>). We therefore aimed to assess whether excluding those studies that inadequately report their methods demonstrates any effect on the findings of qualitative evidence synthesis. By examining the effect of exclusion of studies on the basis of the adequacy of reporting of methods, we sought to advance the ongoing debate concerning quality assessment in qualitative evidence synthesis.</p>

<title>The Data</title>
<p>We had previously performed two systematic reviews of qualitative data on the following topics: young people’s views relating to school sexual health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312452937">Carroll, Lloyd-Jones, Cooke, &amp; Owen, 2012</xref>) and health professionals’ views and experiences of online education techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312452937">Carroll, Booth, Papaioannou, Sutton, &amp; Wong, 2009</xref>). Both systematic reviews included so-called views studies. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312452937">Harden et al. (2004)</xref>, views studies are studies that “attempt to understand . . . issues from the perspectives of the people they affect” (p. 794). Authors of such studies place “people’s own voices at the centre of their analysis” (Harden et al., pp. 794-795). Previous published reviews of people’s views have include studies that use a wide variety of methods. Data collection methods used by such studies include interviews and focus groups, as well as questionnaires, which use frequencies to quantify the proportion of people with a particular view or preference (Harden et al.). Our own systematic reviews included studies in which authors had employed a similar variety of methods. Data could be structured or unstructured, were often textual, and described people’s own, personal, subjective experiences or views of the service or intervention of interest.</p>
<p>We extracted these data from the results sections of included studies, and the data were analyzed qualitatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312452937">Dixon-Woods, Agarwal, Jones, Young, &amp; Sutton, 2005</xref>). We chose a grounded theory, inductive approach to data analysis in both reviews, namely, secondary thematic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312452937">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). We used this reductive approach in classifying the extracted data into themes. Themes that related to each other were placed under a new, broader theme. The resulting thematic framework reflected the experiences and views of participants toward the phenomena of interest and was based on our own interpretation of the data. Our synthesis involved interpreting and integrating, rather than aggregating, findings from multiple studies. We excluded no study from either review on the basis of quality.</p>

<sec id="section3-1049732312452937">
<title>The Quality Assessment Process</title>
<p>We derived a simple checklist for quality assessment based on four questions relating to key procedural elements of research. These criteria have previously appeared as elements of other qualitative research checklists, tools, and discussion papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312452937">Dixon-Woods et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312452937">Mays &amp; Pope, 1995</xref>). For example, these four questions represent Items 3, 4, 5, and 7 from the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312452937">Public Health Resource Unit, 2006</xref>) and Items 1, 15, 25, 30 and 31 from the Evaluation Tool for Qualitative Studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312452937">Health Care Practice Research &amp; Development Unit, 2009</xref>). However, in making our own assessment we focused only on how adequately each methodological issue was addressed by the descriptions presented in each included article (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049732312452937">Table 1</xref>). In other words, we assessed only the text describing these elements, rather than attempting to appraise the actual conduct of each study, which is more typically the intention behind appraising qualitative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312452937">Dixon-Woods et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312452937">Hannes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312452937">Mays &amp; Pope, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732312452937">Whittemore, Chase, &amp; Mandle, 2001</xref>). We believe that our empirical study represents the first practical attempt to evaluate the value of each study to a systematic review by explicitly and solely assessing the adequacy with which procedural elements are described in a study.</p>

<p>We took the decision to focus on quality of reporting for two reasons. First, researchers have pointed out previously that any appraisal checklist essentially assesses only what is reported in a publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312452937">Dixon-Woods et al., 2004</xref>). The limitations of judging quality on the basis of a published account apply equally to all types of research. Debates on criteria acknowledge all too infrequently that we cannot really begin to assess anything about a study unless it is adequately reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312452937">Dixon-Woods et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312452937">Mays &amp; Pope, 1995</xref>). Arguably, it is not possible to assess the validity of a study, for example, in terms of credibility, truthfulness, authenticity, believability, and so forth, if authors do not report, or only report inadequately, the information required to make such a judgment. Such information might include the authors’ theoretical perspectives, how and why the data were collected, the application and appropriateness of any validation tests, and the relationship between the authors’ interpretations and their data.</p>
<p>Despite opinions to the contrary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312452937">Hannes et al., 2010</xref>), the quality of reporting is a determinant of any assessment of methodological soundness. Reviewers can apply assessment criteria only once they have established that the analysis and findings have been reported transparently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312452937">Mays &amp; Pope, 1995</xref>). We therefore chose to focus on the auditability and transparency of the methods of each study, as reported in the publication, because this intuitively seemed a good place to start. We did not evaluate whether the methods described were either appropriate or well conducted. We assessed only whether the methods were reported in adequate detail. We acknowledge the possibility that inadequately reported studies can be well conducted and can be used to offer important insights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312452937">Dixon-Woods et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312452937">Hannes et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, a reviewer must be equipped with adequate information to make such an assessment. Even though reporting of primary research studies might be constrained by limited word counts and restrictions imposed by journal formats, these should not be allowed to mitigate in favor of their potential quality. A reviewer cannot afford to be forgiving when authors fail to report how they chose the study design or selected participants, or how they collected and analyzed their data.</p>
<p>The second reason for adopting the chosen approach was recognition that elements of a study relating to reporting of methods are more easily judged and apprehended than other study features. Assessment of such elements consists simply of determining whether each publication clearly describes the question and study design, how the participants were recruited or selected, and the methods of data collection and analysis used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049732312452937">see Table 1</xref>). Similar criteria have been used by other systematic reviewers in more extensive quality assessments of views studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312452937">Barnett-Page &amp; Thomas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732312452937">Thomas &amp; Harden, 2008</xref>). The same criteria have also figured in lists of prompts and other checklists for the consideration of qualitative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312452937">Dixon-Woods et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312452937">Mays &amp; Pope, 1995</xref>). We extended their use here by utilizing them as exclusive assessment criteria, rather than merely as prompts with which to begin to critique a piece of research.</p>
<p>The relatively small number of criteria described above have universal application to published research. They might in fact be more practical than checklists with greater numbers of questions. More extensive checklists have been found to generate low interrater reliability scores even among experienced qualitative systematic reviewers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312452937">Dixon-Woods et al., 2007</xref>). Two of us independently applied these criteria to all included studies in each review. We assigned definitions to these criteria to make them more easily understood and to minimize the likelihood of subjective judgments by assessors. Our focus on how methods were reported in a publication meant that we did not need to make potentially disputable judgments on such contested issues as researcher bias and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312452937">Dixon-Woods et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312452937">Hannes et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Such an approach might seem to treat qualitative research or views studies as a unified body of work, which they clearly are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312452937">Dixon-Woods et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312452937">Dixon-Woods et al., 2004</xref>). Our aim was to be reductive, to simplify for practical purposes. We did not attempt to evaluate the validity or test–retest reliability of this brief checklist, or to compare its technical performance to that of existing published checklists. We considered this unnecessary given that this checklist embodies questions already commonly used in many existing checklists. We simply chose to focus explicitly and exclusively on the single domain of reporting or description of each study.</p>
<p>In conducting an assessment, the primary reviewer (Carroll) read the original publication and extracted any text that addressed the quality assessment questions, where available, into the checklist form. Such text was principally identified from the introduction and method sections, or their equivalents, of each publication. The reviewer then assigned an answer of <italic>yes</italic>, <italic>no</italic>, or, in cases of uncertainty, <italic>unclear</italic> against each criterion. A second reviewer (Booth or Lloyd-Jones) then validated or challenged the assessment by examining both the extracted text and the original publication before arriving at their own judgment.</p>
<p>We then dichotomized studies into “adequately reported” or “inadequately reported” groups. The review team decided that studies that had been assigned a clear <italic>yes</italic> against two or more criteria (i.e., the publication clearly satisfied at least two of the key quality criteria) would be categorized as adequately reported studies. Conversely, where a study was assigned only a single clear <italic>yes</italic> response (i.e., where only one of study design, recruitment, data collection, and analysis was adequate), or where it received no <italic>yes</italic> responses at all, it was categorized as inadequately reported. For illustrative examples of adequately reported and inadequately reported categorizations, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049732312452937">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>The reviewers discussed any differences of opinion when assigning criteria to studies and reached a consensus on categorization to one of the two groups. We dichotomized studies into adequately and inadequately reported studies because the scale used (either zero or one, or two, three, or four) accommodated a binary outcome of include or exclude for each study and simplified the subsequent sensitivity analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732312452937">
<title>Sensitivity Analysis</title>
<p>We then performed a sensitivity analysis for each review in which the inadequately reported studies were excluded from the analysis. We assessed whether and, if so, to what extent the synthesis was affected by exclusion of these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312452937">Downe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312452937">Sandelowski, Barroso, &amp; Voils, 2007</xref>). First we evaluated whether any of the themes generated in the original syntheses were lost because of the exclusion of these studies. Then we assessed whether exclusion of studies affected the composite “thickness” of detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312452937">Popay et al., 1998</xref>) or richness of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312452937">Patton, 1990</xref>) within the synthesis. In other words, we wished to identify where a theme remained but at the expense of its complexity, richness, or dissonance, that is, the presence of alternative points of view and perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312452937">Paterson, Thorne, Canam, &amp; Jillings, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>By examining actual findings, and the degree to which they contributed to the final synthesis, we did not privilege how methods in included studies were reported over their findings. Instead, we took both methods and findings into account. We conducted these sensitivity analyses to examine whether we had introduced a possible bias in favor of the procedural elements of the constituent research. In examining for such a bias, we hoped to counter the oft-cited criticism of quality assessment methods, namely, that studies of low methodological quality can nevertheless be the source for novel insights not provided by adequately reported studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312452937">Dixon-Woods et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312452937">Pawson, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Only 10 of the 19 included studies in the review of young people’s attitudes toward school sexual health services were adequately reported. Nine studies were judged to be inadequately reported, and these were excluded from the synthesis for the purposes of our sensitivity analysis. The exclusion of such a large number of studies had a negligible impact. We used thematic analysis to generate eight principal themes reflecting factors affecting young people’s use or nonuse of the services in question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312452937">Carroll et al., 2012</xref>). Each of these principal themes emerged from other themes generated from the primary studies. No single principal theme was completely dependent on data from inadequately reported studies. For example, although 13 of the 19 studies were the source for the theme of confidentiality and disclosure, only three of these were inadequately reported studies. No additional data emerged as exclusive findings from the inadequately reported studies.</p>
<p>All of the themes identified in this review of sexual health studies contained comparable ratios of contribution from the adequately and inadequately reported studies. None of the themes were affected by exclusion of studies for the sensitivity analysis. Five of the nine excluded studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312452937">Emihovich &amp; Herrington, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312452937">Guttmacher et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312452937">Kirby et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312452937">Nelson &amp; Quinney, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049732312452937">Zabin, Stark, &amp; Emerson, 1991</xref>) were a source of data for only one or two of the eight themes, with two being a source for only three of the eight themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312452937">Schuster, Bell, Berry, &amp; Kanouse, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1049732312452937">Zeanah et al., 1996</xref>). The two remaining studies were a source for data for five and six themes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732312452937">Tanner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732312452937">Washkansky, 2008</xref>). Findings from these ubiquitous studies contributed little in terms of variety, dissonance, or a novel perspective within each of the themes. The limited contribution derived from these two studies reflected the fact that their data largely mirrored those reported by adequately reported studies, and thus we interpreted them in the same way to generate the same themes.</p>
<p>Limited additional richness was provided by data derived from the less adequately reported studies. For example, participants in one excluded study made the point, not expressed elsewhere, that the gender of staff was important to service users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312452937">Guttmacher et al., 1995</xref>). In another study young people expressed a preference for provision of comprehensive health services compared to sexual health services alone, not because of concerns about accessing the latter, but because they simply wanted easy access to more comprehensive health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1049732312452937">Zeanah et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Data from adequately reported studies, by contrast, were markedly more substantial and richer. For example, 7 of these 10 studies were the source for between five and all eight of the themes. What is more noteworthy, however, is that we found that, with the exception of the two cases cited above, all instances of dissonance, richness, or complexity for each theme emerged from one or more of these adequately reported studies. For example, the barrier to service use presented by personal anxiety about disclosure, and the facilitator represented by users’ confidence in the levels of privacy was described in five adequately reported studies. Thus, each of these studies proved a source for a more rounded-out or balanced perspective on the same phenomenon.</p>
<p>The review of experiences of online learning among U.K. health professionals also demonstrated a negligible effect of exclusions. We excluded 9 of 19 studies from the analysis on the basis of inadequate reporting of methods used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312452937">Carroll et al., 2009</xref>). None of the 10 subthemes or five principal themes generated from the data using secondary thematic analysis depended exclusively on the inadequately reported studies. We found that one excluded study was a source for every principal theme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312452937">Anthony &amp; Duffy, 2003</xref>) and another study for four of the five themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312452937">Kinghorn, 2005</xref>). Of the remaining seven inadequately reported studies, two were the source for a single theme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312452937">Hare, Davis, &amp; Shepherd, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312452937">Hurst, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>By comparison, 3 of the 10 adequately reported studies contributed to every theme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312452937">Hall, Harvey, Meerabeau, &amp; Muggleston, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049732312452937">Whittington, Cook, Barratt, &amp; Jenkins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049732312452937">Wilkinson, Forbes, Bloomfield, &amp; Fincham, 2004</xref>). A further three studies were the source for three out of the five themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312452937">Conole, Hall, &amp; Smith, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312452937">Gresty, Skirton, &amp; Evenden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312452937">Larsen &amp; Jenkins, 2005</xref>). Only one adequately reported study was the source for only a single theme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312452937">Thorley, Turner, Hussey, Hall, &amp; Agius, 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, some of the richness of the synthesis was generated from data from the inadequately reported studies in the e-learning review. Seven of the eight studies that were focused exclusively on the online learning experience of nurses were included in the nine inadequately reported studies. Excluding these studies from the synthesis would have resulted in the loss of valuable data from, and about, nurse learners. As a consequence, differences between nurses and other groups, most notably doctors, might have been concealed.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our investigation enabled us to examine several issues. We were able to explore the extent of the contribution from individual studies to a synthesis, based on the adequacy of the description of their basic methods, whether multiple themes were present in individual studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312452937">Sandelowski et al., 2007</xref>), and whether the synthesis was adversely affected by excluding so-called inadequately reported studies. We also performed sensitivity analysis for a third review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312452937">Carroll, Booth, &amp; Cooper, 2011</xref>) but, as no article was excluded, we have not included findings from this review as an additional case study. The main contribution of our sensitivity analyses was to identify the potential omission of findings relating to one particular professional group, found to predominate in one set of inadequately reported studies. With the exception of this observation, our sensitivity analyses revealed that exclusion of inadequately reported studies from the syntheses did not affect the findings in any meaningful way. That is to say, no theme or subtheme generated by either of the syntheses depended on those studies with the most limited reporting of methodology.</p>
<p>Further examination of the contribution made by inadequately reported studies indicated that they tended to lack thickness of detail in comparison to the adequately reported studies, and thus contributed little in the way of richness. Simply put, data derived from inadequately reported studies did little to supplement data from adequately reported studies. Such a conclusion remained true whether we judged their contribution in terms of individual constituents to a theme or in terms of different perspectives within the themes or the resultant synthetic model. Such an observation is perhaps not surprising because, if design or methods of participant selection, data collection, or analysis are not clearly described in a published study, then that study is unlikely to be a source for findings of more than limited value. Conversely, themes present in the final syntheses were determined only by data from adequately reported studies.</p>
<p>We did not assess contribution only in terms of the number of studies contributing to the themes present within the resultant model or framework (i.e., thus reducing qualitative data synthesis to a quantitative sensitivity analysis). We also evaluated the richness or thickness of the detail within each theme, including identifying the presence of alternative viewpoints or dissonance. We found that very few inadequately reported studies proved to be the source for novel or diverse contributions that were retained in the subsequent elaboration of the themes. We acknowledge that it is difficult to gauge the exact additional value of the limited number of original insights over those already derived from data in the adequately reported studies. Nevertheless, we did conclude that none of the unique contributions was sufficiently substantial to generate a new theme. If anything, such insights were able to add nuances only to themes that had already emerged from groups of adequately reported studies.</p>
<p>Two review teams have previously reported a lack of specific impact from relatively lower-quality studies following sensitivity analyses for their qualitative reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312452937">Noyes &amp; Popay, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732312452937">Thomas &amp; Harden, 2008</xref>). In these reviews the authors attempted to assess both what was said to be done as well as what was actually done (validity). Both teams reported that the contribution from apparently poorer studies was less in terms of both material and the depth of the synthesis. We augment these findings by offering an analysis of an additional two reviews. In contrast to these previous analyses that used extensive quality assessment checklists, we focused explicitly and exclusively on criteria associated with the quality of reporting. We describe an approach that represents a relatively straightforward and pragmatic alternative to the lengthy checklists employed for assessment of studies of qualitative data.</p>
<p>The simple assessment criteria applied here, requiring only extraction and evaluation of what is actually described or reported, might also afford a more consistent means of appraisal. Program evaluation research has demonstrated that simple, clearly defined approaches achieve more consistent results than more lengthy, complex, or vague programs or tools with their greater scope for variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312452937">Grol et al., 1998</xref>). The process of critical appraisal, especially of qualitative studies, is reported to suffer from similar tendencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312452937">Dixon-Woods et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312452937">Dixon-Woods et al., 2007</xref>). When compared to other appraisal checklists, the assessment system reported and applied here might minimize the potential for appraiser bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312452937">Mays &amp; Pope, 1995</xref>). Assessors are not required to make subjective judgments concerning, for example, theoretical perspectives, the link between theory and methods, or the validity, that is, the authenticity or credibility of findings from a study. Instead, they simply identify, extract, and assess the actual text relating to the stated criteria.</p>
<p>The research also underlines the practical realities of having to deal with the inadequacies of poor reporting or thin description of qualitative studies. Half of the studies in our reviews were inadequately reported. Such a ratio is comparable to that for other reviews: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312452937">Noyes and Popay (2007)</xref> judged 7 out of their 27 included studies to be “thin,” and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312452937">Harden et al. (2004)</xref> reported that only 4 out of their 35 included studies satisfied all seven of their quality criteria. In both of these reviews, the reviewers extended quality assessment criteria beyond simple methodological descriptions by also attempting to assess validity. Notwithstanding vigorous academic debate over criteria for, and approaches to, quality assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312452937">Dixon-Woods et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312452937">Hannes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312452937">Mays &amp; Pope, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732312452937">Whittemore et al., 2001</xref>), the practical reality for the systematic reviewer of qualitative or views studies is that the reporting found in many studies will be inadequate to permit a robust assessment of validity. Consequently, the resultant assessment is more often of the reporting than of the validity.</p>
<p>Calls for a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312452937">Schulz, Altman, &amp; Moher, 2010</xref>) type of approach to the reporting of qualitative research might serve to address such a situation in the future. Current syntheses will continue to be constrained by the potential inclusion of inadequately reported qualitative or views studies published in the past decade and before. Isolated examples do exist where no studies would be excluded on the basis of quality of reporting. Indeed, this was the case for the authors’ own experience of a review of people’s views of various chemopreventive agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312452937">Carroll et al., 2011</xref>), in which all 20 studies met the criteria outlined above. However, for inclusion studies had to have been published in 2003 or later. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312452937">Noyes and Popay (2007)</xref> reported that more recent studies identified by their updated review were better, that is, had greater thickness of detail, than studies identified for the original review. These more recent, thicker studies were also the source for two new themes in the synthesis. Such a finding suggests a possible improvement in reporting or description of qualitative research over the past 5 years. Limiting retrieval to recent studies might therefore serve as a surrogate quality threshold.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732312452937">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>On the basis of this exploratory research, we believe that there is an increasingly strong argument for excluding inadequately reported studies from qualitative systematic reviews. This argument is confirmed by sensitivity analyses across four different reviews, two reported here and two published by other review teams. Several published methods for the synthesis of qualitative studies, such as meta-ethnography, critical interpretive synthesis, and framework synthesis, already advocate exclusion of apparently low-quality studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312452937">Barnett-Page &amp; Thomas, 2009</xref>). Our findings suggest that a similar approach might also be appropriate when performing secondary thematic analysis or other interpretive (i.e., nonaggregative) approaches. Alternatively, where a qualitative systematic review team does not feel able to exclude studies presynthesis based on the adequacy of reporting, they should at least assess the adequacy of the published description of the methods to inform a subsequent sensitivity analysis.</p>
<p>A default position, until these emergent findings are confirmed beyond reasonable doubt, would be to require that reviewers conduct a postsynthesis sensitivity analysis to assess whether anything, no matter how apparently insignificant, might have been lost to the synthesis by excluding inadequately reported studies. Such an analysis would gauge the impact of excluding inadequately reported studies on the final synthesis. It would also inform reflections on the robustness of the resulting synthesis. For example, it would allow identification, and subsequent investigation, of instances where a particular finding or group of findings is dependent, either exclusively or disproportionately, on one or more inadequately reported studies.</p>
<p>The review team would then be in a position to make an informed and appropriate decision on how they are to handle this. In our e-learning case study, we identified a group of inadequately reported studies that reported the perspectives of a single professional group. Excluding such studies on the basis of reporting quality might have affected the external validity of the review findings. Where reviewers feel that external validity has been compromised in such a way, they could make an explicit decision whether to retain inadequately reported studies. Sensitivity analysis would also identify where findings from an adequately reported study contradict those from less completely reported alternatives. Techniques for sensitivity analysis remain incompletely specified within qualitative evidence synthesis and so offer a promising target for future empirical work and methodological guidance.</p>
<p>Alternatively, an evaluation of the basic reporting of methods prior to synthesis could become a critical preliminary exclusion stage for every qualitative review. Findings from a synthesis that are clearly supported by methodologically transparent and well-described primary research studies are potentially more robust than those from a synthesis based in part or in whole on studies for which a validity assessment proves elusive because of an absence of relevant information. Given how problematic it is to evaluate validity in the absence of transparency of reporting, it is likely that thorough assessment is possible only for adequately reported studies anyway.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049732312452937">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Our research has several limitations. The review team might have encountered different findings had they employed either different synthesis techniques or different quality assessment approaches, or both. Qualitative synthesis is inherently interpretive, so different reviewers might generate slightly different synthetic models from the same data, with differential impact from excluding the inadequately reported studies. There are issues around the reproducibility and validity of the appraisals, as for any such assessment of qualitative studies. We aimed to control for such variability by keeping the criteria simple and defined, and by putting in place procedures to validate independently the judgments made by the primary reviewer. Such validation was followed by discussion and consensus on how studies had been categorized.</p>
<p>It is also possible that, because the sensitivity analyses performed were post hoc, small novel contributions to the syntheses derived from inadequately reported studies were simply absorbed by the power of the interpreted themes, given the potential tendency to seek commonalities rather than dissonance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312452937">Petticrew &amp; Roberts, 2006</xref>). We initially hoped to base assessments of quality solely on text from the introduction and method sections of the published studies. However, it became apparent during the assessments that additional relevant information on methods appeared elsewhere. Some information was contained in authors’ own reports of the limitations of their study, typically in the discussion section. In such instances, the additional data simply confirmed the categorization based on the earlier data. Nevertheless, we do recommend that future reviewers make a specific attempt to harvest data from discussion sections when conducting their preliminary assessment of reporting quality.</p>
<p>Finally, we focused only on the adequacy of descriptions of methods within publications. Reporting of methods is clearly not a proxy for the methodological soundness of a study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312452937">Hannes et al., 2010</xref>), and a potentially unsound study can receive an adequate assessment following application of our criteria. Nevertheless, we consider such transparency to be a first step toward being able to assess the more fundamental and essential elements that determine the quality of qualitative research. If the reporting of a study is inadequate in the first place, it will prove difficult to apply validity criteria at all.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732312452937" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We extended and applied simple, pragmatic quality assessment criteria to reports of studies included in two systematic reviews of people’s views in topics from public health and the education of health professionals. Our quality assessment focused explicitly on the reporting or description of a small number of clearly defined elements of research procedures within these qualitative data studies. We then performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of excluding the inadequately reported studies from the two syntheses. We found that in no case did these exclusions appear to affect either the overall conceptual findings of these systematic reviews or the richness of the data underpinning their results.</p>
<p>The implications of the above are twofold. Reviewers could apply the given critical appraisal criteria (presynthesis) to exclude inadequately reported studies. Alternatively, they could test the robustness of review findings (postsynthesis) through sensitivity analyses. Different reviewers working on different topics need to utilize both strategies to assess the value of each to their particular qualitative systematic review. It would also be useful to compare the criteria and approaches described here with other approaches to quality assessment such as that proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312452937">Sandelowski and Barroso (2007)</xref>. We submit these findings as a contribution to the ongoing debate on the critical appraisal and quality assessment of studies within the field of qualitative evidence synthesis.</p>
