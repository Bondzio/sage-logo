<p>How bad is a near miss? After the fact, the collision probability is zero. The real concern is what might have happened under slightly different conditions. In this article, I propose a safety measure commensurate with probability of collision for an <italic>event reenactment</italic> that depends on estimating the variability of closest proximity between vehicles. Example calculations are provided for several combinations of vehicles passing, stopping, or converging. Until recently, this radically different approach has been impractical, but new technology to measure and store proximity data changes that outlook. Various means are suggested by which the metric can be used to enhance driver safety.</p>

<body>
<p>Discovering the probability of collision for any near-miss event can be useful in driver behavior research and analysis.</p>
<p>After a near miss occurs, one reacts with something like “Whew, that was close!” and then tries to forget it. Some near misses (better worded as <italic>near collisions</italic>) are regarded as serious, whereas others are not. Is the best severity metric for a near miss simply the inverse of how close the vehicles came to one another? Common sense rules out that metric. For example, cars normally and safely pass one another at high speeds in opposite directions at very close proximity because lateral deviations are tightly controlled.</p>
<p>Following what one regards as a near miss, the concern is what might have happened if conditions were slightly different. But how does one put structure to that premise and define severity? In this article, I propose a severity measure that is commensurate with the probability of collision for an <italic>event reenactment.</italic> That probability depends on the measurement of the closest proximity for a given event, compared with the variability of that measure derived from previous such measures for the same type of maneuver.</p>
<p>Accordingly, by conventional statistical inference, I will show that the probability of collision for any given near-miss event reenactment can be estimated. This feedback could be useful in driver training, driver behavior research and analysis, traffic control, intelligent transportation systems, and in-vehicle warning system design.</p>
<sec id="section1-1064804613477862">
<title>The Basic Idea</title>
<p>I employed the event reenactment variability idea in an article for aircraft near misses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1064804613477862">Sheridan, 2010</xref>). The situation for highway near misses is simpler in some ways; vehicle size need not be considered, and for highway misses, one need not consider the vertical separation. On the highway, however, there are different near-collision maneuvers (different combinations of vehicles passing and stopping), which is not the case for aircraft.</p>
<p>Vehicle position variability has entered into highway vehicle crash analysis in various other work, including, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1064804613477862">Allen and Parseghian (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1064804613477862">Davis, Hourdos, Xiong, and Chatterlee (2011)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1064804613477862">Kuchar and Yang (2000)</xref> did so for aviation. Unfortunately, data on the closest proximity between highway vehicle positions for each event are not readily available in standard format; such data would depend on the type of maneuver surrounding a potential collision. Therefore, the assessment technique described here begs the questions of how to measure closest proximity, how to classify potential collision maneuvers, and whether obtaining such data should have a greater place in future highway safety research, especially given that the technology for gathering such data is becoming more readily available.</p>
<p>The proposed approach is in contrast to deterministic models that derive crash prevention boundaries from analysis of initial dynamic conditions, driver brake response time, and level of deceleration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1064804613477862">Burgett &amp; Gunderston, 2001</xref>). Also, although the new approach involves inference of collision probability from statistical distributions of data, it does not depend on statistics of collisions per se, which are very rare. Rather, one can use near-miss data to infer collision probability estimates, near misses being much more frequent. The point is that as measured proximities of near misses approach zero statistically, they are excellent predictors of collisions for a reenactment of the same maneuver, given likely variation in the trajectory of the reenactment.</p>
<p>The proposed metric could enhance driver safety through the collection of closest-proximity data in the vehicle black box or otherwise for various classes of maneuvers. This metric could reveal to the driver, or owner of the vehicle if there are multiple drivers, the level of risk being taken relative to some established norms.</p>
<p>With the proposed metric, one may also offer driver training schools a means to review the dangers to which some drivers subject themselves—a gentle suggestion that these trainees need to avoid taking the evidenced risks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1064804613477862">
<title>New Technology Offers Design Potential</title>
<p>There is no way to know statistically how close one is to a collision when no records are kept, and previously there has been no practical way to make precise objective measurements of proximity to other vehicles. What I propose here is that new proximity measurement technology enables a new approach to assessing near misses—and, indeed, can provide data from which to evaluate the probability of collision in specific instances as well as globally for certain categories of collision-avoidance maneuvers.</p>
<p>So what is the emerging technology that makes this measurement practical? There are multiple emerging technologies, and all are under rapid development. Perhaps most promising in terms of accuracy is <italic>lidar</italic>, the optical equivalent of radar. Inexpensive lidar range finders have been used in the building industry for years. Next is short-range radar, currently used in adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning. Then there is short-range sonar, commonly used in cameras for focus and for automobile backup systems.</p>
<p>All these technologies require mechanical devices for scanning of the vehicle surround, and in the long run, mechanical scanning would probably have the greatest influence on cost. Because lidar operates at light frequency (very short wavelength), it is most amenable to rapid scanning to complement the pinpoint range accuracy of a laser by scanning electronically or using a spinning mirror. Sonar would be worst in this respect because of the wide beam. It should be noted that surfaces of objects, especially at angles far from perpendicular to line of sight, can present problems. Getting optical, radar, or sound responses from trees, shrubs, road edges, and so on is normally more difficult than from other vehicles, and for that reason, the proposed approach is confined to potential crashes with other vehicles.</p>
<p>Finally, there is GPS. If the GPS is operating on only one vehicle, its accuracy is far too poor for the purpose described here, but if two vehicles have GPS, there can be electronic means to cancel out the errors. The latter fact enables more accurate mutual proximity sensing, as used in current vehicle-to-vehicle safety developments, but this technology is still insufficient for close-proximity sensing and depends on both vehicles being suitably equipped.</p>
<p>In addition to proximity measurement, the proposed approach requires the storing of such data in some variety of a “black box” in the vehicle. Today, such black boxes are employed in commercial and government vehicles to record safety data and already include data on braking, speed, and steering. At this time, incriminating data are barred from use against private drivers. However, collection of personal data is now common in social networks to allow company sponsors to target their advertising. In an analogous way, close-proximity data from automobiles could easily be relayed in de-identified form to centralized databases and tabled as a function of what kind of maneuver was being made. (Later I present details of how the maneuver discrimination might be made.)</p>
<p>The fact remains that proximity measurement and scanning technology are advancing rapidly, so I assume that practical means will be widely available in the near term.</p>

<title>Examples of Different Maneuvers to be Considered</title>
<p>Example calculations are provided next for several combinations of vehicles moving or stopping and converging at various angles. Full “badness” (severity) assessment also depends on closing speed (an indicator of kinetic energy if there were a collision), which might best be used to categorize near-miss incidents. Experimental issues of obtaining requisite variability are discussed as well as various potential uses of the proposed metric to enhance safety.</p>
<p>I suggest near-miss reenactment analyses for four example cases, subsuming many of the vehicle maneuver situations that come to mind:</p>
<list id="list1-1064804613477862" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>parallel vehicle trajectories (same or different directions),</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>trajectories whereby one vehicle stops and the other continues past,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>two converging vehicles brake to a stop, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>one vehicle crosses the path of the other.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In each case, I suggest some criteria by which to discriminate that particular maneuver from the other three (using computer logic).</p>
<sec id="section4-1064804613477862">
<title>Case 1: Own vehicle passes other vehicle in parallel</title>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1064804613477862">Figure 1</xref> (page x), the line of closest separation, S, is perpendicular to the trajectories. This particular maneuver can be identified because closest-proximity S observed on either side converges with time to a flat line (constant minimum) during the pass, then diverges. There is no braking. These characteristics are contrasted to those for other maneuvers.</p>
<fig id="fig1-1064804613477862" position="float">

<sec id="section5-1064804613477862">
<title>How the reenactment collision metric is made for Case 1</title>
<p>Closest separation proximity S measures are continually made as the cars pass. Over time, many such measurements are recorded and frequencies assigned within multiple categories of S magnitude. It is assumed that these data may lack any actual collisions (no data to the left of zero). It is not unreasonable to assume, even though there are no data for collisions, that the recorded frequency data would fit a symmetric probability density function, such as a normal curve, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1064804613477862">Figure 2</xref></p>
<fig id="fig2-1064804613477862" position="float">
<label>Figure 2.</label>

<p>The estimated probability density of S fit to repeated measures of closest proximity.</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1064804613477862-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>This data fit would yield a mean and standard deviation (σ) of S values and, thus, an estimation of where the zero collision point (S = 0) would occur. The most critical data would be in the region just greater than the collision threshold, as indicated in the figure. The data fit thus yields the estimated fraction of events (for all occurrences of this passing maneuver) resulting in collision; namely, the area to the left of S = 0. This statistical inference would be true whether or not any collisions actually occurred in the sampling. This data fit can be done easily by computation in the vehicle after sufficient data are recorded. The probability density curve could take any form similar to the Gaussian if it resulted in a better fit to obtained data.</p>
<p>Now consider a hypothetical reenactment of a given event, depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1064804613477862">Figure 3</xref>. By chance, on the reenactment and according to the estimated σ, the separation distance could be greater or could be smaller than the particular S that was measured in the actual event, as indicated. Note that the same probability distribution as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1064804613477862">Figure 2</xref> is now wrapped around the particular S that actually occurred. The point S = 0 on the reenactment scale defines the threshold of collision.</p>

</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1064804613477862-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Now for this reenactment of the particular actual event, the probability of collision can be estimated as the area to the left of S = 0 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1064804613477862">Figure 3</xref>. If the measured S is small, the estimated reenactment collision probability will be significant, as seen in the figure. That is, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1064804613477862">Figure 3</xref> depicts the reenactment probability distribution for a serious near miss, with actual S closer to zero than the mean S in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1064804613477862">Figure 2</xref>. The reenactment collision probability is the objective correlate to the “whew” experience alluded to earlier.</p>
<p>Now consider the other maneuver cases listed earlier, but with different geometries. For each type of maneuver, data would be stored separately, yielding a different M and σ. The procedure for obtaining the probability of collision for a hypothetical reenactment for each of the maneuvers described next is exactly the same as in Case 1. The question, then, is how the vehicle computer can discriminate between maneuvers. Such a criterion is provided in each of the following cases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1064804613477862">
<title>Case 2: Own vehicle brakes while other continues past</title>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1064804613477862">Figure 4</xref> (page x), while the other vehicle continues past, own vehicle brakes to a stop. This case can be identified (discriminated from Case 1) because the minimum proximity signal occurs roughly toward the front and is relatively constant during the pass.</p>
<fig id="fig4-1064804613477862" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1064804613477862-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>After accumulating enough data and determining the σ for this maneuver type, the area to the left of S = 0 on the reenactment probability density function is the estimated probability of collision for a given near miss of this particular type of maneuver, as before.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1064804613477862">
<title>Case 3: Vehicles converge toward collision, both brake</title>
<p>In this case, both vehicles brake to stop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1064804613477862">Figure 5</xref>). Here, the minimum proximity observed at some angle to own vehicle’s direction of travel becomes constant when both vehicles are stopped. The estimation of collision probability for any near miss reenactment is the same as in Case 1.</p>

<title>Case 4: Own vehicle crosses path (in front of or behind) the other, both moving</title>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1064804613477862">Figure 6</xref>, neither vehicle brakes, and therefore S keeps changing, so the minimal proximity signal occurs for a very brief time (is never flat).</p>

No claim is made that the aforementioned categorization of maneuvers is unique or comprehensive. The examples are provided only to show that given proper instrumentation for proximity measurement as a function of time, it is feasible to discriminate among types of maneuvers.

<title>The Importance of Speed and Other Variables</title>
<p>The severity of a collision obviously depends on speed, given that kinetic energy (crash damage to both vehicle and passengers) increases with the square of speed. Thus, a derived estimate of collision probability for reenactment of a near miss might be multiplied by the relative velocity with which the two vehicles are approaching at the moment of closest proximity. The relative velocity might be most easily measurable by radar much as police use today, although lidar and sonar can work as well.</p>
<p>Note that relative velocity for a collision in Case 1 is very different from rate of change in S for a near miss, as the former is the sum of forward velocities (for converging vehicles) rather than the rate of lateral proximity. In each of the other cases, the relative velocity for a collision is also different from the rate of S and depends on the angle of approach.</p>
<p>Very-low-speed maneuvers in parking lots that are potential “fender benders” are different from near misses at higher speeds or when suddenly braking, as required at intersections. Own speed might be used as a parameter for categorizing near-miss threats.</p>
<p>A comprehensive assessment of collision severity would also include structural crashworthiness, fatality, injury, and property damage factors, but discussion of these factors is beyond the intended scope of this article and is widely included in other highway safety literature.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1064804613477862">
<title>Ways in Which the Near-Miss Reenactment Metric Might Be Used</title>
<p>Before widespread closest-proximity instrumentation of highway vehicles is implemented, experiments should be conducted with few or relatively small numbers of vehicles. This research could be done, for example, in tests such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration–sponsored 100-Car Naturalistic Driving Study performed in Virginia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1064804613477862">Klauer, Dingus, Neale, Sudweeks, &amp; Ramsey, 2006</xref>) and its more recent, ongoing Strategic Highway Research Program 2 naturalistic driving research. Allegedly the latter involves some 1,900 instrumented vehicles on the road now with an aim to collect data from 3,000 drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1064804613477862">Davis &amp; Hourdos, 2012</xref>). Doing so might obviate the need for time-consuming visual analysis of video records to determine near misses, although video observation and computer video analysis can surely be used to augment proposed closest-proximity measurements.</p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, feedback of collision probability associated with given near misses can be used to educate novice and other drivers on driving safety implications and why near misses could easily have been crashes. Such feedback could take the form of a real-time display, based on the result of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1064804613477862">Figure 3</xref> (page x). But this display could be distracting in real time, so it might be safer to make records of near misses available to the driver after the vehicle is stopped. There is clearly no point in bothering drivers with near-miss feedback for S values outside the critical region shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1064804613477862">Figure 2</xref> (page x).</p>
<p>For vehicles equipped with GPS, location data could be relayed (otherwise de-identified as to vehicle owner or driver) to stationary receiving stations to record and correlate with the lidar-measured frequency and severity of near misses. Pinpointing these risky roadway intersections, ramps, curves, and so on would be considerations in highway design and traffic regulation.</p>
<p>Finally, closest-proximity measurements can be integrated with other ongoing studies of the effects on driving safety of distraction, alcohol, and drugs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1064804613477862">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>New technology for measuring closest proximity to other vehicles enables a proposed method for evaluating near misses with other vehicles on the highway in terms of estimated probability of collision for event reenactments, such that if any given event were reenacted, there could be a collision. The method requires collecting data and fitting a probability function for a large set of near-miss events for any given class of maneuver. The classes of maneuvers can be discriminated as part of the measurement process.</p>
<p>The method enables objective feedback to the driver of what might have happened had that event been reenacted with expected separation variation on the reenactment. The method highlights the need to acquire better variability data on closest proximities for various classes of maneuvers.</p>
