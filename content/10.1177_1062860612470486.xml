<abstract>
<p>Lean Six Sigma (LSS) process analysis can be used to increase completeness of discharge summary reports used as a critical communication tool when a patient transitions between levels of care. The authors used the LSS methodology as an intervention to improve systems process. Over the course of the project, 8 required elements were analyzed in the discharge paperwork. The authors analyzed the discharge paperwork of patients (42 patients preintervention and 143 patients postintervention) of a comprehensive integrated inpatient rehabilitation program (CIIRP). Prior to this LSS project, 61.8% of required discharge elements were present. The intervention improved the completeness to 94.2% of the required elements. The percentage of charts that were 100% complete increased from 11.9% to 67.8%. LSS is a well-established process improvement methodology that can be used to make significant improvements in complex health care workflow issues. Specifically, the completeness of discharge documentation required for transition of care to CIIRP can be improved.</p>

<p>Transitions between levels of medical care place patients at heightened risk for adverse events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612470486">1</xref></sup> During these transitions a “handoff” should occur during which care responsibilities transition from one health care professional to another.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612470486">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612470486">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The literature on transitions of care has concentrated primarily on the transitions between inpatient and outpatient settings (inpatient physicians and primary care physicians in the community).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612470486">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612470486"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612470486">6</xref></sup> Lapses in communication because of documentation errors have been associated with adverse events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612470486">6</xref></sup> Appropriate and correctly documented transitions between inpatient levels of care also are important, but the literature on this topic is limited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1062860612470486">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612470486">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Efforts to standardize patient care handoffs and the associated documentation have been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612470486">9</xref></sup> Standardization has proven difficult because transition points vary between interunit handoffs, interservice handoffs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612470486">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612470486"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612470486">12</xref></sup> and hospital to primary care physician handoffs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612470486">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612470486">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1062860612470486">13</xref></sup> Examination of the records in the authors’ 1085-bed academic teaching center revealed that in fiscal year 2010 (June 2009-June 2010), 4358 patients (9% of all discharges from the hospital) were transitioned to another level of care instead of being discharged home.</p>
<p>Transitions from an acute hospital admission to a rehabilitation setting are particularly important because optimal medical management is necessary to maximize rehabilitation efforts. These transfers to another level of care may be to a variety of rehabilitation or post–acute care settings: comprehensive integrated inpatient rehabilitation programs (CIIRPs), subacute inpatient rehabilitation, skilled nursing facilities, extended care facilities, and others. In spite of this, the documentation necessary for appropriate handoffs to rehabilitation settings has not been described in the literature. A recent presentation reported that 83% of discharge paperwork received by a CIIRP lacked important information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1062860612470486">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The discharge summary, or discharge paperwork, is foundational for continuity of care for patients discharged from acute services. This summary is especially important for patients admitted to CIIRPs, where close monitoring by physicians and nurses is required to ensure patient safety and optimal outcomes. Discharging a patient from acute care and admitting him or her to rehabilitation requires a collaborative effort between the discharging and receiving units or facilities. Multiple disciplines are involved in a smooth transition. Optimizing communication through the discharge paperwork can benefit all parties and help ensure an optimal outcome for the patient while possibly decreasing unnecessary use of resources.</p>
<p>The discharge paperwork contains important information that is vital to the rehabilitation team’s ability to formulate a patient’s plan of care. Inconsistent, inaccurate, or incomplete information can negatively affect patient safety, treatment, and care management, potentially resulting in patient harm or increased inpatient days and cost.</p>
<p>Because transitions of care are part of the patient’s continuum of care, the authors opted to use Lean Six Sigma (LSS) methodology, a process-centered approach to quality improvement that seeks to systematically define, measure, analyze, improve, and control processes. In this study, the goal was to use LSS methodology to improve the proportion of patients with complete acute care discharge paperwork at admission to CIIRPs. First, the essential information elements that must be included in all discharge paperwork to CIIRPs were identified. Second, an automated system was implemented to incorporate these elements into all discharge paperwork. Finally, the impact of the intervention was assessed by measuring the completeness of discharge paperwork before and after intervention. It was found that using the LSS methodology resulted in a significantly increased proportion of individuals with complete discharge paperwork at admission to CIIRPs. This intervention ultimately led to improved communication between discharging and admitting facilities, which is essential for patient care and safety.</p>

<title>Setting</title>
<p>The study was conducted in a tertiary hospital setting in which transitions were occurring between acute medical care hospital services and a CIIRP. Patients require daily medical monitoring and aggressive therapy of various specialties (for a combined 3 hours per day total) to be suited for this level of care.</p>

<title>Lean Six Sigma</title>
<p>LSS is a progressive hybrid of Lean Thinking and Six Sigma process improvement methods. Lean Thinking, coined by Toyota in the 1950s as part of their Toyota Production System, focuses on the streamlining of system processes by waste reduction. In the context of health care, this tool can be used to facilitate changes in communication processes and promote improvement by reducing time wasted in rectifying incomplete discharge paperwork.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1062860612470486">15</xref></sup> Six Sigma, developed by Motorola in 1986, focuses on defects, variation reduction, and customer satisfaction. In the health care setting, it can be used to reduce medical errors while maintaining patient and provider satisfaction through the development of a sustainable patient care model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1062860612470486">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1062860612470486"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1062860612470486">18</xref></sup> Ultimately, these 2 components work synergistically in the health care setting by addressing both quality and optimization of patient care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1062860612470486">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1062860612470486">18</xref></sup> Together, LSS uses 5 major steps to improve processes: define, measure, analyze, improve, and control. These 5 steps are the basis of this process improvement project and are explained in the following sections.</p>

<title>Define</title>
<p>Using the multidisciplinary team, the authors identified critical to quality characteristics for this analysis. A subjective failure mode and effects analysis was used to prioritize which characteristics (elements, variables) should be required for all discharge paperwork for a patient transitioning to CIIRP.</p>
<p>To assess the parties involved (stakeholders) in the transition and handoff, a process map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1062860612470486">Figure 1</xref>) was developed to show stakeholders in the transition-of-care process. Once stakeholders were shown the process map, a stakeholder, or voice of the customer, analysis was performed.</p>

<title>Measure</title>
<p>Using the defined discharge elements (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1062860612470486">Table 1</xref>) a review was performed on 42 charts to analyze the discharge paperwork used for transitions of care at baseline; the practice standard was to use the dictated discharge summary or provider generated discharge paperwork (PGDP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1062860612470486">19</xref></sup> To keep the chart review process consistent, a standard questionnaire was created that was used to measure improvement throughout the project. The context of the patient’s clinical condition was considered in the questionnaire. For example, if a discharge element was not relevant to a patient’s discharge, such as wound care instructions, the discharge element was tagged appropriately. Data from the baseline chart review process were graphed on a control chart and served as one of the benchmarks to monitor changes in chart completeness.</p>

<title>Analyze</title>
<p>The goal of this phase was to determine potential causes of system breakdown. A root cause analysis and an Ishikawa cause and effect diagram (fishbone diagram) were used to help determine possible causes for incompleteness of documentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1062860612470486">Figure 2</xref>). The fishbone diagram used addressed the areas where breakdown can occur (people, polices, process, and equipment), resulting in deficiencies.</p>

<p>During process analysis, the authors sought to compare the PGDP with other potential systems that may provide discharge information to the CIIRP. In their institution’s electronic medical records system, a computer-generated patient discharge worksheet (CGDP) is created for each discharge in addition to the PGDP. Preintervention, the CGDP was used only to help educate patients at discharge but was not used as a discharge document for subsequent health providers. The CGDP autopopulates medication orders and problem lists directly from the computerized provider order entry system. The authors recognized the potential benefits of a computer-generated system and so analyzed the CGDP “discharge worksheet.”</p>
<p>Using the same 42 baseline charts, Pareto charts and Fisher exact test statistical analysis were used to compare the completeness of discharge elements generated by the PGDP and CGDP. This analysis enabled the determination of whether the CGDP was potentially a better system to generate the discharge documents and which discharge elements needed the most attention and focused improvement. The analysis at this stage showed that the CGDP was better at including 3 discharge elements: activity precautions, dietary restriction, and follow-up appointments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1062860612470486">
<title>Improve and Control</title>
<p>When it was recognized that the CGDP included more discharge elements, a tiered implementation approach was used to further improve the computer-generated system. After baseline measurement, the first improvement effort was a policy change requiring the CGDP to accompany patients at the time of admission. For the second improvement, the authors worked with the institution’s information technology department to develop the appropriate logic for each of the discharge elements. For example, in the original CGDP system, a patient without known allergies would have a discharge document missing the allergy field instead of stating “No known allergies.” After all changes were made, an additional 143 patient CGDPs were reviewed for completed elements using the same questionnaire to show sustained improvement. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1062860612470486">Figure 3</xref> is a control graph showing the number of discharge element deficits per chart in the preintervention and postintervention phases.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>In all, 42 charts were audited prior to intervention and 143 after the intervention (preintervention and postintervention). The proportion of complete elements for each discharge element was compared before and after intervention using the Fisher exact test. A χ<sup>2</sup> analysis was used to compare the number of 100% complete charts in the preintervention and postintervention groups. Paired <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare the percentage of total complete discharge elements per chart in the preintervention and postintervention assessments.

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 42 charts were analyzed before the intervention; 37 (88.1%) of the 42 charts analyzed were missing at least 1 element. Of the required discharge elements, 61.8% were complete per chart when audited. In the postintervention assessment, 143 charts were analyzed. Of the required discharge elements, 94.2% per chart were complete. The proportion of complete discharge elements per chart was significantly higher in the postintervention phase (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The number of 100% complete charts was significantly higher (67.8%, 97 of 143 charts having 100% completion) in the postintervention phase compared with the preintervention phase (11.9%, 5 of 42 charts having 100% completion; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>A significant improvement in completeness for 5 of the 8 required elements was found when each discharge element was analyzed individually (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1062860612470486">Table 1</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to improve completeness of discharge documentation on arrival to the CIIRP. Specifically, LSS methodology was used to assess and improve this process. Ultimately, this led to significant improvement in the completeness of discharge documentation that accompanied patients to their CIIRP admission.</p>
<p>This study demonstrates that LSS models can be used to improve process performance in patient handoffs. The LSS team determined that the first step of analysis was to improve the completeness and presence of the information. The team recognized that the CGDP improved completeness of the handoff data compared with the PGDP. Therefore, an important finding is that electronic medical records systems can enhance patient safety by autopopulating critical information into the patient’s chart. Electronic medical record systems can vary in their capabilities, and this potentially limits the generalizability of these results. As hospitals move to electronic medical records, they may benefit from systems that have autopopulation capabilities for this purpose. This may not only improve clinician efficiency but also accuracy, particularly with regard to standard items such as allergies and medication lists. The LSS team also found that working closely with the health system information technology team is important because that information technology expertise was able to be used to improve the existing CGDP system for a broader purpose. For example, the original CGDP system improved completeness in 3 of the 8 discharge elements, and further modifications to the system improved completeness in 5 of the 8 elements. The tools used in this project also can be applied to other types of patient handoffs.</p>
<p>Gandara et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612470486">8</xref></sup> have documented handoff documentation incompleteness as it relates to transfers to skilled nursing facilities, but the authors are unaware of other studies investigating methods to improve handoffs to CIIRP. Patients discharged to CIIRP tend to be more medically complex than those discharged to skilled nursing facilities. Patients admitted to a CIIRP also must meet strict requirements for participation with intensive rehabilitation therapies. The CIIRP physicians must have a good understanding of the medical health risks that require frequent monitoring and continued treatment before engaging the patient in activity. The completeness of transfer-of-care documentation has a critical impact on patient safety and decreased iatrogenic morbidity.</p>
<p>The Joint Commission (TJC) has worked to guide requirements for the paper form used at discharge from a TJC-accredited facility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1062860612470486">20</xref></sup> However, these requirements are generic and not specific to the needs of an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Even though the authors’ discharge elements are targeted for a rehabilitation setting, the strategies used for analysis and implementation could prove to be transferable to other non-rehabilitation-specific requirements as well. With these accreditation standards affecting hospital and rehabilitation accreditation, the importance of complete discharge paperwork is ever increasing.</p>
<p>Although it is essential for health care systems to create familiarity with Lean and Six Sigma disciplines, it is even more important to integrate LSS into the institution’s culture of improvement and change management. The existing culture of clinical practice and management must be recognized as an important barrier to making improvements in health care processes. Clinical leadership can assist in this endeavor by promoting “buy-in” through the involvement of multidisciplinary frontline teams in quality improvement processes. Ultimately, medical education must include training in quality improvement tools.</p>
<p>Because of the “whole system” and multidisciplinary approach of the LSS methodology, there are some potential confounding factors limiting the interpretation of the results. The authors hoped to minimize discipline bias or oversight by using a multidisciplinary team with experience in patient care and management. The required elements included in the analysis reflected the team’s opinion of critically important elements in a discharge summary to CIIRP, not necessarily scientifically proven items. These required elements could vary by team and institution, potentially limiting their generalizability. Also, the authors did not measure the increased institutional awareness of the importance of handoffs and patient safety as a result of this project. This factor may have influenced providers to complete discharge paperwork with increased diligence. Finally, only the completeness of the information provided in the discharge paperwork was evaluated, not its accuracy.</p>
<p>This quality improvement project demonstrated improvements in most of the outcome measures, with the exception of discharge paperwork inclusion of antibiotic stop date. Post hoc chart evaluation revealed that this information was missing in many of the charts because of uncertain treatment plans. Examples of these cases included empirical antibiotic treatments that were started with infectious speciation pending on admission to CIIRP and extended antibiotic treatments that were initiated with the plan to follow up with infectious disease or internal medicine providers after CIIRP completion. Based on the criteria that were standardized at the onset of the study, these charts were audited as noncompliant. These types of cases illustrate the challenge of using predetermined guidelines in judging outcomes in uncertain medical decision-making situations. The LSS team opted to use the most conservative approach to assess for improvements in the measures. Ultimately, this analysis was used as an opportunity within the institution to engage and educate discharging teams to include more explicit documentation in situations where plans of care will be determined after discharge to CIIRP.</p>
<p>The LSS method has been well documented in the business world and is a standardized process for systems improvement in many industries. Its use in health care is trending to show similar improvement with complex process analysis and improvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1062860612470486">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1062860612470486">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1062860612470486">22</xref></sup> This study shows that a LSS project can dramatically improve the quality of discharge paperwork in a large, complex academic medical center.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The LSS process is designed to assist in streamlining flow and quality of product (ie, discharge paperwork) for the benefit of the customers (ie, patients). In an age when documentation accuracy and continuity are crucial for patient safety, litigation protection, and third-party health care services repayment, it is valuable to have a proven means to improve compliance and inclusion of crucial information. This article presents a model to significantly improve compliance of residents, midlevels, and other clinical staff to complete quality and practice requirements in an actual clinical setting. This is important because documentation is crucial for admission orders and patient care on arrival to a CIIRP. If an error or omission is found in the documentation, it can take a significant amount of time to reconcile the information, leading to decreased efficiency for the admitting team. Additionally, this is increasingly important because of TJC’s prioritization of mandating and monitoring handoff communication in the inpatient setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1062860612470486">23</xref></sup> Most important, complete and accurate handoffs are essential for patient safety.</p>
<p>The authors’ institution is developing an electronic discharge summary that will automatically carry forward most of these essential data elements from other sections of the medical record. It is hoped that this will further enhance the process in the near future.</p>
