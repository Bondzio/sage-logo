<p>Many will know Maria Luisa Ardizzone for her pioneering book on Dante’s <italic>primo amico</italic>, Guido Cavalcanti (Ardizzone, 2002). This study not only provided considerably deeper intellectual context to Cavalcanti’s poetry than had been available in English previously, but also raised some intriguing issues with regard to his great friend and rival, Dante Alighieri. Readers curious as to what, or to whom, the ‘other’ of that book’s title referred will be amply rewarded by the present study, where Ardizzone treads in the illustrious footsteps of Bruno Nardi and Maria Corti by exploring Dante’s intellectual and philosophical background.</p>
<p>The sensualist materialist of the Cavalcanti of <italic>The Other Middle Ages</italic> remains an ever-present foil throughout <italic>Il paradigma intellettuale</italic>. Ardizzone maintains the approach of her prior work, concentrating on a strictly limited corpus of lyric texts (‘una silloge d’autore’, p. ix) and delving deeply into their connections with the intellectual heritage of the Latin Middle Ages. The introduction presents Dante’s work as indebted to a ‘linea agostiniana’ (p. xvii) that originally brings it into a polemic with Cavalcanti’s medical and natural philosophical Aristotelianism, whereas in later poems the poet seeks to absorb his friend’s thought through dialectic. What emerges is a suggestive reading of difficult, highly troped poems whose novel intellectual quality is intentionally propaedeutic for the reader. The four subsequent chapters set out to adumbrate this précis of Dante’s early work via close readings of lyrics included in the <italic>Vita nova</italic> and <italic>Convivio</italic>: ‘Donne ch’avete intellecto d’amore’ (Chapters 1 and 2); the sonnets ‘Amore e’l cor gentil sono una cosa’, ‘Negli occhi porta la mia donna Amore’, ‘Io mi senti’ svegliar dentro allo core’, ‘Tanto gentile e tanto onesta pare’ and ‘Vede perfectamente ogne salute’ (Chapter 2); ‘Voi che’ntendendo il terzo ciel movete’ (Chapter 3); and ‘Amor che nella mente mi ragiona’ (Chapter 4). The book displays a strong argumentative line, beginning with the chapters on the lyrics of the <italic>Vita nova</italic>, which develop the ascendant praise of Beatrice as an intellectually illuminating exercise based on Augustinian notions of prayer. The two <italic>canzoni</italic> later commentated in the <italic>Convivio</italic> then expand this process with new cognitive elements from the Aristotelian tradition (Ardizzone calls these ‘contenuti’) – cosmological and natural philosophical knowledge in ‘Voi che’ntendendo’, philosophy of mind and ethics in ‘Amor che nella mente’.</p>
<p>Like the ongoing edition of Dante’s <italic>rime</italic> by her colleague Teodolinda Barolini, Ardizzone’s work seeks to strip Dante’s lyrics of the authorial mythology that his own commentaries and subsequent interpretations have constructed around them. Instead, the author claims to place the poems in a ‘zona neutra’ (p. 118) in which they may be interpreted as they were when first written. This aspect of her project lies behind the subtitle <italic>Un ‘inventio’ degli anni fiorentini</italic>, since all of these lyrics, including the two <italic>canzoni</italic> glossed in the post-exilic <italic>Convivio</italic>, were written while Dante was still living in his native city. The point is an important one, given Ardizzone’s vision of Dante’s poetics as a ‘paradigma intellettuale’ that invites the reader to divine philosophical and theological ‘contenuti’ behind the poems’ tropes. The critical myth of an exiled Dante who turns from love poetry to philosophy for the first time in the prose of the <italic>Convivio</italic> is convincingly undermined as Ardizzone demonstrates how these early lyrics, and the <italic>Vita nova</italic>, were profoundly influenced by intellectual figures such as Cicero, Augustine, Boethius, Gregory the Great, Alan of Lille, Albertus Magnus, and Thomas Aquinas.</p>
<p>Ardizzone’s grip on her material is formidable and her fellow scholars will be well served by her careful plotting of the trajectory that a term such as ‘honestum’ has followed from Cicero’s <italic>De officiis</italic> to late 13th-century Italy (pp. 71–73, 108–114). On the topic of Dante’s debt to Augustine alone, Ardizzone’s work is of great import: the parallels that she draws out between Dante’s anthropology and the Bishop of Hippo’s doctrine of the interior word in the <italic>De Trinitate</italic> will be essential to any future research on Dante’s Augustinianism. Simone Marchesi’s (2011) contemporaneous monograph, for example, ignores the <italic>De Trinitate</italic> and so fails to account for Augustine’s centrality to Dante’s anthropology. The latter half of Ardizzone’s book, meanwhile, is notable for its exquisitely, at times excessively, nuanced treatment of the poet’s engagement with the many varieties of 13th-century Aristotelianism, both orthodox and heterodox.</p>
<p><italic>Dante: Il paradigma intellettuale</italic> left me wanting both more and less. The ‘silloge d’autore’ seemed narrow and I wondered why the author did not explain how other contemporaneous texts by Dante might fit with the ‘intellectual paradigm’ for which she argues. The 114 pages on lyrics of the <italic>Vita nova</italic> hewed almost entirely to the <italic>stilo de la loda</italic> chapters, with scant mention of the problems that Dante’s praise poetry encounters elsewhere in the text – the <italic>gabbo</italic>, the death of Beatrice, the <italic>donna gentile</italic>. Meanwhile, the <italic>rime petrose</italic>, also written in Florence and heavily engaged with philosophical sources, could have been a natural point of reference for the <italic>Convivio canzoni</italic>. At the same time, the force of the contribution noted above was often dissipated by the sheer weight of detail cited from learned sources, with subtle debates among thinkers rehearsed in full, only to be followed by a somewhat timid pronouncement on Dante’s knowledge or use of the texts in question.</p>
<p>Finally, while I gained insight from the ‘contenuti’ that Ardizzone uncovers, I remain unconvinced that the language of philosophical speculation and debate can fully encompass the reader’s intellectual experience of these poems. Surely their form and language, as well as their relationship to their social context, can also play discrete phenomenological roles. Ardizzone alludes to these considerations, but her insistence on the primacy of intellection makes them secondary. For me this relegation begs the question: Why did Dante write verse in the vernacular first and theoretical Latin treatises only later in his career?</p>
