<p>The economy remains weak. Output has been broadly flat for the past 2½ years, unemployment remains close to 8 per cent of the labour force, CPI inflation is still above target and the hoped for rebalancing of the UK economy looks to be a considerable way off, with a deficit on the balance of payments averaging 3.7 per cent of GDP in 2012.</p>
<p>The preliminary estimate for GDP growth in the first quarter of this year does not change this. Much of the attention focused on the avoidance of a ‘triple-dip’, rather than another quarter of relatively weak economic growth. Revisions to data mean that it is increasingly unclear whether there was even a ‘double-dip’. As we have noted many times before, obsessing about a couple of quarters of minute falls in output distracts us from the clear trend: that of a stagnating economy.</p>
<p>Recovery is defined as a period of above potential (or trend) economic growth, a necessary condition if a negative output gap is to be closed. The performance of the economy in the first quarter of this year does not suggest we have yet got to a point that can be viewed as a sustained recovery. We expect growth of 0.2 to 0.3 per cent per quarter through the rest of this year, leading to an overall rate of growth of 0.9 per cent for 2013. This forecast is broadly unchanged from that published in our February <italic>Review.</italic></p>

<p>We expect economic growth of 1½ per cent per annum in 2014, accelerating to just over 2 per cent per annum for the period 2015–17. We estimate that the potential rate of growth is around 2 per cent per annum. Mechanically, growth in the period 2015–17 would be consistent with ‘recovery’ – just. Over this period of time we expect the unemployment rate to follow a path with a clear downward trajectory, consistent with the pick-up in demand absorbing the significant spare capacity in the economy.</p>
<p>There is little sign of rebalancing. The current account deficit is expected to narrow from an average of 3.7 per cent of GDP in 2012, but to remain around 2½ per cent of national income over the forecast horizon.</p>
<p>The government's primary target of its Fiscal Mandate is for the cyclically-adjusted current budget to be in surplus in five years time (currently 2017–18); we think this will be achieved. However, it remains our view that fiscal policy can be used to support the economy in the near term through fiscal instruments that support the government's other long-term policy goal of raising the potential rate of growth. As Besley <italic>et al.</italic> (this <italic>Review</italic>) note, investment in education, innovation and infrastructure is essential for future economic growth. With 10-year government bonds attracting yields of less than 2 per cent, the government can finance additional investment in much needed infrastructure at little cost. With an economy in such a depressed state the fiscal multipliers are likely to be far higher than in normal times. The government should use the next <italic>Comprehensive Spending Review</italic> to re-evaluate future levels of public sector investment.</p>
