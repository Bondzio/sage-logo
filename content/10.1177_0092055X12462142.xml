<abstract>
<p>Both “theory” and “writing” engender a great deal of anxiety for the typical undergraduate sociology major. Writing-intensive theory courses increase this feeling exponentially. Active learning approaches to teaching theory are often advocated as a way to combat these fears, but few studies have tested whether these innovations effectively reduce student anxiety. This article describes and evaluates the Film Analysis Papers writing assignment designed to reduce student anxiety in an undergraduate theory course. I present data from a questionnaire that asked students to assess the effect of writing about film on theory anxiety. Findings show that the film assignment reduced anxiety about writing theoretically and improved student confidence in their ability to theorize. This study is unique in that it isolates the effect of active learning approaches on theory anxiety in order to understand whether anxiety mediates the relationship between active learning and learning outcomes in theory classes.</p>

<p>Most sociological theory courses rely on writing as a primary means for helping students learn to think theoretically or to theorize. This reliance is the result of a general understanding that writing promotes learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092055X12462142">Bain 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092055X12462142">Bean 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092055X12462142">Emig 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0092055X12462142">Hudd, Smart, and Delohery 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0092055X12462142">Stokes, Roberts, and Kinney 2002</xref>) as well as a course-specific recognition that the practice of theorizing is a skill best learned in discussion and reinforced through writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092055X12462142">Coker and Scarboro 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092055X12462142">Holtzman 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0092055X12462142">Rinehart 1999</xref>). However, anxiety is a significant impediment to both writing to learn and learning to “do theory.” If both “theory” and “writing” engender a great deal of anxiety for the typical undergraduate sociology major, writing-intensive theory courses increase this feeling exponentially. Therefore, theory instructors often go to great lengths to help students connect with theoretical texts, see the relevance of theoretical ideas in their everyday lives, and increase motivation to learn while simultaneously lowering levels of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0092055X12462142">Macheski et al. 2008</xref>). Many class activities and pedagogical strategies have been developed with the intention of addressing these issues, but few studies have tested whether these innovations effectively reduce theory anxiety.</p>
<p>To alleviate anxiety, I developed an innovative “writing to learn” approach for the Development of Sociological Theory course I teach at a medium-size midwestern university. This article assesses whether this strategy effectively reduces student fears about writing and thinking theoretically. The course involves a series of low- and high-stakes writing assignments. Low-stakes writing assignments are designed to help students practice and develop the skills of thinking and writing theoretically and are intended to reduce the fear that students have about the course content and its writing requirements. I will discuss several of these assignments briefly, but the focus of this article is the high-stakes, formal writing assignment that asks students to apply theory to film. This Film Analysis Papers project asks students to use film as a vehicle for discussing the theories covered throughout the course and is designed to help students master the skills of thinking and writing theoretically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0092055X12462142">Pelton 2012b</xref>). Applying theory to film—or, using film to help students see theoretical concepts at work—in this way helps to make theory less abstract and irrelevant.</p>
<p>The topics covered in this article are not new: We know a good deal about the connection between writing and learning, the use of film to enhance sociological understanding, and the anxiety that accompanies theory classes. I contribute to this literature by weaving a thread through them, suggesting that film can be used to alleviate student anxiety about writing and thinking theoretically, which should lead to greater understanding. Anxiety, then, is conceptualized as mediating the relationship between films and learning outcomes in the theory class. This study is unique in that it isolates the effect of film on anxiety in an attempt to understand better the first part of the larger causal chain.</p>
<p>In what follows, I discuss existing literature on these topics and provide a brief description of the course. Then, I discuss the Film Analysis Project and several smaller writing assignments. Finally, I present data collected over the past four semesters in which students were asked to assess the effect of writing about film on their anxiety about writing and thinking theoretically. Student evaluations of the assignment suggest that <italic>watching</italic> films helped to make the theoretical concepts come alive and reduced their anxiety about writing theoretically. Students also report that <italic>writing</italic> about the films helped them to connect with the theories we covered and that applying theoretical ideas to contemporary films helped deepen their perceived understanding of theory.</p>

<title>Using Film to Alleviate Anxiety</title>
<p>The problem of anxiety is a longstanding one for instructors of sociological theory courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092055X12462142">Holtzman 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092055X12462142">Lowney 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0092055X12462142">Macheski et al. 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092055X12462142">Lowney (1998</xref>:69) diagnosed it as a “special trepidation” students feel about having to learn about theory. These high levels of anxiety are the result of a number of factors. First, there is the perception, which is sometimes exacerbated by the institutional student culture, that theory courses are more difficult than substantive courses are and that they require “higher-order cognition skills in order to master the material” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0092055X12462142">Macheski et al. 2008</xref>:43). This fear is increased by the fact that theory is a required rather than elective course, so students feel forced into it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0092055X12462142">Macheski et al. 2008</xref>). Most importantly, anxiety is related to the fact that the theories and theoretical ideas we cover are abstract and seem irrelevant to students’ lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092055X12462142">Holtzman 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092055X12462142">Lowney 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0092055X12462142">Pedersen 2010</xref>). The result is that theory feels “strange, abstract, and useless” to students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092055X12462142">Lowney 1998</xref>:69). Thus, theory instructors face the dilemma of having to help students get over their theory anxiety while simultaneously helping them to deal with the complexity of theoretical thought.</p>
<p>High levels of theory anxiety are thought to be a significant barrier to learning in theory courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092055X12462142">Eglitis 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092055X12462142">Holtzman 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092055X12462142">Lowney 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0092055X12462142">Ormrod 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0092055X12462142">Rinehart 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0092055X12462142">Segady 1990</xref>). But <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0092055X12462142">Segady (1990)</xref> suggested that theory instructors can use student apprehension to their advantage because high levels of anxiety lower student expectations of success, so even minor breakthroughs in understanding can result in strong, positive reactions. Given this, he was an early advocate of an active learning approach to teaching theory, which emphasized having students: take an active role in comprehending theoretical texts, develop the ability to think in abstract and critical terms, see the need for a sociological perspective, and understand the scope and implications of theoretical concepts and ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0092055X12462142">Segady 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Since then, a variety of classroom activities and pedagogical strategies for reducing anxiety about theory have been written about, including puzzles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092055X12462142">Lowney 1998</xref>), games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092055X12462142">Holtzman 2005</xref>), literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0092055X12462142">Weber 2010</xref>), film (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092055X12462142">Fails 1988</xref>), case studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0092055X12462142">Ormrod 2011</xref>), online discussion boards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0092055X12462142">Scarboro 2004</xref>), and collaborative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0092055X12462142">McDuff 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0092055X12462142">Rinehart 1999</xref>). These student-centered approaches to teaching theory are often met with great success and seem to reduce anxiety, build confidence, and enhance understanding. Using film, for example, has been shown to generate high levels of student satisfaction and achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092055X12462142">Fails 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0092055X12462142">Smith 1982</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092055X12462142">Lowney (1998)</xref> uses puzzles to help reduce students’ fear of theorizing, which allows them to relax and builds confidence in their ability to think theoretically. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0092055X12462142">Rinehart’s (1999)</xref> collaborative learning approach generates greater student engagement and enthusiasm by empowering students to “do theory” in groups and on their own. And, students reported greater perceived understanding and an ability to see connections between theory and everyday life after completing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0092055X12462142">Scarboro’s (2004)</xref> online discussion board and current events activities. Student evaluations of each of these approaches confirm that careful attention to the issue of anxiety and disengagement in the theory classroom can yield positive results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0092055X12462142">Macheski et al. 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>None of the articles cited previously provide concrete evidence that these kinds of teaching innovations lead to reductions in theory anxiety, though I am sure that they do. I have found this to be the case since I began using film in my own theory class. Why might using film or other activities in a theory course have such an effect? Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092055X12462142">Lowney’s (1998)</xref> analysis, we can infer that using film decreases anxiety over the difficulty of theory courses because it distracts students from these fears, allowing them to relax. Film also introduces an element of the familiar into what can be a daunting list of unfamiliar texts, words, and concepts and builds an element of fun into what can be a dreaded requirement. At a basic level, then, film provides an immediate source of rapport between students and the instructor that is the first step to alleviating anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0092055X12462142">Macheski et al. 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The fact that students find theoretical ideas “abstract and generally archaic” and thus irrelevant to their lives and the world around them is another particularly strong source of theory anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0092055X12462142">Pedersen 2010</xref>:197; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092055X12462142">Holtzman 2005</xref>). Creating connections between difficult subject matter and students’ experiences has been shown to be highly effective for the learning of abstract sociological concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092055X12462142">Cadwallader and Scarboro 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092055X12462142">Hudd and Bronson 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0092055X12462142">Roberts 1993</xref>) because it enables the student to integrate new information into his or her existing cognitive structure more easily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092055X12462142">Cadwallader and Scarboro 1982</xref>). Several studies have shown that popular film is a valuable tool for demonstrating the relevance of sociological thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0092055X12462142">Tipton and Tiemann 1993</xref>) and making concepts seem more “real” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092055X12462142">Collett, Kelly, and Sobolewski 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0092055X12462142">Scarboro 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0092055X12462142">Tipton and Tiemann 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0092055X12462142">Tolich 1992</xref>). This is because film analysis requires students to connect theory to the “reality” presented in the plot and characters of the movie. This connection then becomes a bridge between students’ personal theoretical knowledge and experiences and the academic practice of sociological theorizing, building confidence in their ability to discuss theoretical ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0092055X12462142">Rinehart 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>If we can curtail student fears about the difficulty of theoretical ideas by using film, we remove one stumbling block on their path to reaching the kind of complex understanding that is a priority for most theory instructors. This type of higher order learning is typically translated into the desire for students to learn how to “do theory” or develop the capacity for “theorizing.” As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0092055X12462142">Rinehart (1999</xref>:216) describes it, “turning theory into theorizing” is a collaborative venture in which “students share responsibility for interpreting texts, coming to some agreements about their meanings or clarifying disagreements.” “Doing theory” requires a set of skills that we generally call “critical thinking,” broadly understood as the ability to reflect, critique, synthesize, and evaluate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092055X12462142">Bain 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092055X12462142">Bean 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0092055X12462142">Roberts 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0092055X12462142">Segady 1990</xref>). Because film analysis requires students to reflect, apply, and evaluate, it also engages them in the process of learning to theorize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092055X12462142">Bean 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0092055X12462142">Tipton and Tiemann 1993</xref>). Specifically, analyzing film involves synthesizing complex systems of thought; considering a range of interpretations from which one may view a film; being comfortable with ambiguity; learning the relationship between evidence, reasoning, and conclusions; and reflecting on their own thought processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0092055X12462142">Roberts 2002</xref>). Developing these skills as students watch films provides a concrete, but approachable, way to practice “theorizing” throughout the semester, which will build student confidence in their abilities and lower theory anxiety.</p>
<p>Presumably, once a student feels confident in his or her ability to think theoretically, the task of analyzing film in writing will be less daunting. Because thinking and writing are parallel processes—both are the result of a multifaceted process of engaged reflection and analysis according to the writing to learn perspective—an ability to think theoretically should translate into an ability to theorize in writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092055X12462142">Emig 1977</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092055X12462142">Bean 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092055X12462142">Cadwallader and Scarboro 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092055X12462142">Coker and Scarboro 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092055X12462142">Fulwiler 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0092055X12462142">Stoecker et al. 1993</xref>). In fact, writing appears to be particularly well suited to developing the ability to theorize as it enhances the capacity for independent, critical thought necessary to thinking theoretically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092055X12462142">Friere 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092055X12462142">Fulwiler 1982</xref>). This is especially true of argumentative or analytical writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092055X12462142">Bean 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Because writing is an act of “making meaning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092055X12462142">Fulwiler 1982</xref>:19), it also gives students ownership over the interpretation of theoretical texts, further embodying the act of theorizing and enhancing commitment to learning in depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0092055X12462142">Roberts 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0092055X12462142">Stokes et al. 2002</xref>). For example, we know that “students who are provided with intellectually challenging writing participate more deeply in the learning process” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0092055X12462142">Hudd et al. 2011</xref>:180). Seeing their ability to think theoretically improve as they are writing reduces student resistance and encourages greater participation and commitment to learning theory. Developing this sense of ownership and growth through writing is particularly important to the process of reducing anxiety.</p>
<p>Although writing improves student engagement, theory instructors must still work to reduce anxiety about writing. Writing about film can become part of a context that optimizes learning by sustaining interest in and creating an environment conducive to learning how to communicate theoretically in writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092055X12462142">Bangert-Drowns, Hurley, and Wilkinson 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092055X12462142">Grauerholz 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0092055X12462142">Walvoord and Smith 1982</xref>). In a course focused around film, for example, theoretical conversations will inevitably turn to the films students are watching and analyzing; a common language of discourse is formed, upon which theoretical understanding can be more easily built (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0092055X12462142">Macheski et al. 2008</xref>). These conversations, then, build student confidence in their ability to write about theoretical ideas and concepts indirectly.</p>
<p>In addition to helping faculty create an environment conducive to learning theory, film analysis can also work directly to reduce anxiety about writing. Because most sociology majors are not used to writing film analyses, this kind of assignment provides incentive for instructors to get more involved in the writing process, an element crucial to creating a successful writing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092055X12462142">Grauerholz 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0092055X12462142">Walvoord and Smith 1982</xref>). Introducing students to a new type of writing creates an opportunity to talk directly about the process of viewing films, writing sociological film analyses, and our expectations for successful papers, which are all recommendations for best practices in supporting student writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092055X12462142">Grauerholz 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>The Course, In Brief</title>
<p>Development of Sociological Theory is a 400-level undergraduate theory course designed to cover the evolution of sociological thought from the early foundations of the discipline up to and including contemporary theoretical perspectives (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0092055X12462142">Pelton 2012b</xref>). Our walk through history begins with early social theorists like Auguste Comte, Harriet Martineau, and Frederick Douglass; focuses heavily on classical theory, including but not limited to Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, and Max Weber; and touches upon critical, feminist, and postmodern theorists like Herbert Marcuse, Judith Butler, and Jean Baudrillard. Students read original works from 20 different theorists. Because of my dual commitments to teaching the ability to think theoretically and supporting student writing, ideal enrollment is 20 to 25 students, although some classes have reached a maximum of 35. I establish a seminar-style environment that routinizes student participation and involvement, and I employ collaborative learning methods in the classroom in order to accomplish these goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0092055X12462142">Pedersen 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0092055X12462142">Rinehart 1999</xref>). Students share responsibility for interpreting texts, lead discussions throughout the semester, and practice critical reflection and consensus building in small group work that is designed to provide a safe space for students to grapple with difficult material.</p>

<title>Description of the Writing Assignments</title>
<sec id="section4-0092055X12462142">
<title>High-stakes Writing: Writing about Film</title>
<p>The core, required assignment for this course is a Film Analysis Papers project that provides students a creative and interesting way to apply the knowledge they learn throughout the semester (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0092055X12462142">Appendix A</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0092055X12462142">Pelton [2012a]</xref> for complete assignment). This high-stakes written assignment is designed with the course goal of having students master the skill of theorizing and the need to address student anxiety in mind. These objectives resonate with students, as becomes evident on the very first day of class. Students often suggest that writing a “film analysis” sounds easier than simply writing “theory papers” and excitement seems to rise with the realization that they will be required to watch movies for class. The choices described below may sound purely logistical at the outset, but this flexibility is designed specifically to further ease the fears of students with high levels of writing and theory anxiety.</p>
<p>I have purposely chosen films that either make reference to or can be used to illustrate key concepts and ideas from the various theorists we cover. Students are required to complete four of seven paper options, each of which is four to six pages in length. Each option pairs a particular film or set of films with a specific theorist or theoretical paradigm (e.g., <italic>Matewan</italic> or <italic>Norma Rae</italic> with Marx or <italic>Boys Don’t Cry</italic> with feminist theory). As mentioned earlier, assigning films with which students are familiar promotes the transfer or integration of new theoretical knowledge into their existing experiences, so I try to do so as much as possible. Due dates are clearly laid out in the assignment guidelines and syllabus, and I emphasize the power students have to choose which papers they will write and which due dates will work best for them. Paper deadlines fall one to two weeks after completing each section of the course to allow ample time for students to reflect on their understanding of the theory or theorists, watch the film, and engage fully in the process of writing. I want them to put theory to work as they analyze each film (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0092055X12462142">Ormrod 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0092055X12462142">Rinehart 1999</xref>) and this takes time to develop. To address writing anxiety, I want students to have ample time to work completely through the process of writing, revising, and editing so that they construct papers of which they can be proud.</p>
<p>This assignment does not ask students to write what might be considered a traditional film analysis, film critique, or film review. These kinds of analyses vary tremendously, including but not limited to: shot by shot descriptions of scene, cinematography, sound, and editing; summaries of the plot and character development; and explorations of why a film works, how it works, what it means, and what effects it has on people. As conveyed in the handout to students, these film analysis papers simply use each film as a vehicle for discussing the theories covered throughout the course (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0092055X12462142">Appendix A</xref>). That is, their main objective should be to demonstrate theoretical understanding. Rather than let the movie’s narrative control the paper, students should use the movie to tell a theoretical, sociological story. In fact, film summaries are highly discouraged—their job is not to summarize the plot of the movie but to focus on aspects that are of sociological relevance.</p>
<p>Further, I tell students to emphasize only what is theoretically relevant to the argument they are making, rather than attempting to include every potential idea or concept covered in class lectures or reading materials. This places a premium on in-depth understanding of a particular theoretical work over the need to “cover everything.” Students must consider the range of possible ways to interpret the film from a theoretical vantage point. In the process of choosing among the most relevant concepts, they demonstrate learning in depth. It also allows for the fact that students will not identify with and comprehend the details of every theoretical perspective introduced throughout the course because films give students greater freedom to cover the concepts that are most meaningful to them. This kind of analysis is designed to generate exactly the kind of independent thought that leads to greater engagement with theoretical ideas advocated by the writing to learn perspective: It is engaged reflection.</p>
<p>Discussion of the film itself should never take up more than one-third of the entire paper. In fact, I push students to write complex theoretical papers that seamlessly integrate discussions of theoretical texts with illustrations from the film. In very specific language, for me, this means that theoretical concepts are intertwined with discussions of the film within each and every sentence of their paper. At the very least, I insist that each paragraph include discussion of both theory and film to help students avoid summarizing the film and then summarizing the theory. Either way, students are actively working to synthesize theoretical and cinematic content into a coherent whole. I try to help students improve their writing throughout the semester, moving beyond simplistic forms of integration (i.e., “Durkheim defines the sacred as . . . and this scene in <italic>Varsity Blues</italic> exemplifies this idea . . . ”) to more analytical, academic prose (see the example thesis in the following). This type of writing embodies the kind of critical sociological thinking described previously and becomes evidence of a student’s ability to theorize.</p>
<p>Critical to the construction of a fully integrated analysis is a well-articulated thesis statement. More than simply making connections between the theory and film, the best papers should analyze. By that, I mean students should examine an issue, present an opinion, or argue a point. The best papers have a clearly stated thesis around which the entire paper is structured and a complex argument that focuses on a specific conceptual theme prominent in the theorist’s work.</p>
<p>The following is an example of just the kind of thesis that enables students to construct this kind of analysis: “<italic>Fight Club</italic> demonstrates the extreme power of collective effervescence; it can lead individuals to over-identify with and sacrifice their identity for the greater good of the group.” This thesis is a prime example of how film analysis papers demonstrate the development of a student’s critical thinking abilities. The argument laid out in this statement illustrates how they have reflected upon the connection between movie and theory, critiqued the events of the film, synthesized difficult theoretical concepts, and evaluated the many ways in which theory and film speak to one another. The resultant paper, using excerpts from Durkheim’s <italic>Elementary Forms of Religious Life</italic> and <italic>Suicide</italic> to examine the role of the individual in social action and group life, spoke to the fact that they were engaged deeply in the process of theorizing; the student’s choice of theoretical concepts is not immediately or obviously part of the film.</p>

<title>Low-stakes Writing: Getting Students Ready to Write Theoretically</title>
<p>Students do not arrive on the first day of class prepared to write these kinds of papers. Therefore, I employ a number of in-class writing activities that help students learn the skills necessary for theoretical writing, though I only discuss two of the most important assignments here. These low-stakes writing assignments provide a foundation for the high-stakes writing described previously. They are intended to help reduce both theory and writing anxiety by getting students writing early and often in the semester.</p>
<p>The first low-stakes assignment is a set of reading guides that focus on “internalizing” course content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0092055X12462142">Stokes et al. 2002</xref>), promoting understanding, and creating a basis for forming new knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0092055X12462142">Hudd et al. 2011</xref>). Reading guides typically include a list of terms that students should recognize and be able to define and/or explain as they read and a set of comprehension or elaboration questions (sample reading guides are available upon request). These worksheets give us a place to start talking and let me know how to focus our discussion. Students are required to complete five of the eight possible guides and are awarded up to 10 points for each. Giving students the ability to choose which guides to complete increases their commitment to understanding the chosen text and allows them the flexibility to plan out when they will have time to devote to theoretical reading and writing. Extra credit is offered for every guide over five completed. To keep the assignment “low-stakes,” students who appear to have put a good deal of effort into completing the guide receive few point deductions. In fact, I emphasize the fact that these guides are works in progress and students are encouraged to trace the development of their thoughts as they fill out the worksheet. This assignment allows students to begin the practice of theorizing on their own, in writing, and helps them to feel more confident about their ability to read, write about, and discuss theoretical texts.</p>
<p>The second low-stakes writing assignment takes place within a two-day writing workshop. Though writing does not take place at each stage, every component is a necessary step in preparing students to write theoretically about film. I highly recommend adopting these activities in conjunction with assigning the film analysis papers. I begin with a “practice” film analysis in class where we watch and analyze the opening scenes in Chaplin’s <italic>Modern Times</italic> after finishing the unit on Marx. This activity gives me a chance to talk about how students might go about watching films, how to take notes, and what kinds of things to look for. <italic>Modern Times</italic> is quite easy to analyze from a Marxian standpoint, so it lowers student fears that they will not be able to make <italic>any</italic> connections suitable for the papers.</p>
<p>Next, students read and assess a sample of five papers from a past semester. I give them my grading rubric (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0092055X12462142">Appendix B</xref>) and ask them to use it as they consider the positive and negative aspects of each paper. Students then work in groups, discussing the extent to which each paper meets the stated paper expectations, and assign a group grade to each paper. We reconvene as a class and compare group grades. This naturally leads to a conversation about what makes a paper good, average, or poor in the context of this class (as well as a critique of the variability built into the process of grading itself). In evaluations, students regularly suggest that reading other student papers (good and bad) helped them feel much more confident in their ability write theoretically.</p>
<p>Students then engage in free-writing about the connection between Marx and <italic>Modern Times</italic>. The assignment is simple: Write for five minutes, without stopping, about anything that comes to your mind regarding Marx and the events that unfolded in the first 10 minutes of the film. This stream-of-consciousness writing typically produces several paragraphs, to the surprise of most students who thought they “wouldn’t have anything to say.” A quick-write like this shows students that they can write theoretically and that doing so is not as difficult as it seemed at first. Many students leave this day feeling as if they had already written an outline or the beginning of their paper and had learned a new strategy for jump-starting a writing project they were feeling particularly apprehensive about.</p>
<p>This assignment emphasizes the importance of using a variety of pre-writing strategies during the planning and organization stage, including but not limited to talking, problem posing/problem solving, keep a journal, outlining, drawing diagrams, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0092055X12462142">Walvoord and Smith 1982</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092055X12462142">Grauerholz 1999</xref>). In discussion, I also stress the importance of revising, telling them that it involves more than simply correcting errors in word choice or sentence structure. I describe my own writing and revising process as an example to convey the importance of allowing the time it takes to truly engage in this kind of <italic>revising</italic> as well as <italic>editing</italic>. Demonstrating, engaging in, and discussing good writing practices are crucial to alleviating writing anxiety in this class.</p>
<p>Finally, I also have students construct a thesis statement for their imaginary <italic>Modern Times</italic> paper. As was made clear in the previous section, successful film papers, as conceived in this writing assignment, are contingent upon a clearly stated, complex, argumentative thesis. I have found that this is a skill acquired through practice, however, so we repeat this writing exercise several times throughout the semester. We spend time in class and in one-on-one consultations writing thesis statements for upcoming papers. By having students imagine how they might weave together a theoretical idea and a theme from the film in a sophisticated way, they become more comfortable with the process of constructing, as well as writing, a theoretical paper.</p>

<title>Assessing the Effectiveness of the Film Assignment</title>
<p>I began administering a supplemental film analysis evaluation in addition to university-mandated evaluations to assess students’ perceptions of the effect of this film analysis writing assignment on anxiety and theoretical understanding. This questionnaire has been used to collect demographic data about students in the class as well as feedback regarding the film analysis project over the last four semesters. (Institutional review board approval for this study was applied for and received.)</p>
<p>Sixty-seven questionnaires have been collected so far, out of the 73 total students who have completed the course. Of the 67 students who completed the survey, 87 percent are undergraduate sociology majors. About 9 percent are students in our master’s degree program, who were required to complete the course as a prerequisite to full admission to the program. These students come with “deficiencies” in their undergraduate record, typically meaning that they have never taken an undergraduate theory course. The remaining 4 percent are drawn from a variety of other departments across the college of arts and sciences. A comparison of means showed that graduate students and non-majors were slightly less anxious about writing theory papers compared to undergraduate majors but do not differ significantly in their assessment of the film analysis assignment. Students who completed the survey range in age from 21 to 48 and are overwhelmingly female (70 percent). Since all sociology majors are required to take this course in order to graduate, I do not have reason to believe that this sample is statistically different from the population of students in the sociology program at this university.</p>
<p>Regarding their level of overall anxiety, students were asked to report, retrospectively, how nervous they were about reading theoretical texts and writing theoretical papers at the beginning of the semester (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0092055X12462142">Figure 1</xref>). Forty-two percent of students recalled feeling “very” nervous about <italic>reading</italic> original works of theory, compared to 43 percent who were “somewhat” nervous and 15 percent who were “not at all” nervous. Students were much more anxious about <italic>writing</italic> theoretical papers, with 58 percent reporting feeling “very” nervous and 33 percent feeling “somewhat” nervous. These findings support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0092055X12462142">Macheski et al.’s (2008)</xref> claims regarding the level of anxiety associated with core sociology courses, giving us a sense of just how nervous students are about succeeding in Theory.</p>

</fig>
<p>Students were asked several closed-ended questions regarding the effectiveness of viewing films and writing film analyses. They were also encouraged, in open-ended form, to explain why they agreed or disagreed with each of the aforementioned items. First, students were asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the following statement: “Viewing films made it easier to understand the theories and ideas we covered throughout the semester.” Ninety-four percent of students either agreed or strongly agreed with this statement (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0092055X12462142">Figure 2</xref>). Given their high levels of anxiety at the start of the course, it is particularly encouraging to see that many students felt viewing films helped them to understand the theories covered in class. As one student put it, “Seeing the theory is believing.” In their explanations, other students wrote:</p>

</fig>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s hard to tear through the sociological jargon sometimes but if you see it in a film, especially the more recent films, it makes it easier to grasp.</p>
<p>Viewing the films &amp; using theory to analyze them required a greater understanding of the theory being applied. It was like trying to teach someone else.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One student suggested that while films certainly helped them understand the theory better, they “were not the only aides [<italic>sic</italic>] for understanding.” They “relied on the theory itself, discussion, notes, handouts, and outside sources” for help comprehending particular theoretical texts, but the film “helped bring out my understanding of theory and tie concepts together.” Student responses to this question suggest that they believe watching films helped further clarify or solidify their grasp of difficult readings and complex theoretical arguments.</p>
<p>Most students also felt less anxious about writing theoretical papers after viewing films. Again, an overwhelming number of students (90 percent) felt that viewing the films made them feel more confident in their ability to write about the theories we covered (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0092055X12462142">Figure 2</xref>). Those students who agreed or strongly agreed with this item wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>Drawing out major themes from the film to explain theories made the task of writing theoretical papers more manageable.</p>
<p>They [the films] give a good foundational support for writing the paper. Watching films increased my confidence in my ability to understand and apply the theories.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Student responses to this item provide the clearest evidence that viewing films helps to reduce anxiety related to having to write about what are admittedly difficult concepts and ideas.</p>
<p>It is plausible that this reduction in anxiety is a result of asking students to think critically about the application of theory to film. Student responses to the statement “Writing film papers helped me see the connections between readings and everyday life” confirm what other theory teachers suspect: Making theory relevant to students’ lives via the experience of viewing a film helps them to understand the texts they read. Forty-six percent of students strongly agreed with this statement and many of their comments reflect the importance of relevant and relatable examples to understanding abstract course content (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0092055X12462142">Figure 2</xref>):<disp-quote>
<p>The paper helped me become more aware of how these theories &amp; concepts surround us every day. It makes me think differently than I had in the past.</p>
<p>The films helped provide relatable or relevant applications of the classic theories, helped modernize them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, students also attested to the fact that <italic>writing</italic> the film papers helped them “think more clearly and critically about the theories [they] read.” Fifty-two percent of students <italic>strongly</italic> agreed with this statement and 40 percent agreed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0092055X12462142">Figure 2</xref>). No student strongly disagreed with this statement. In their comments, many students suggested that the clarity they felt after writing these papers was largely due to the real-world applicability of the analysis. However, some were able to isolate the positive effects of the process of writing itself; critically analyzing films using various theoretical perspectives deepened their understanding of the texts they read. One student suggested that it was “eas[ier] to move info from [the] visual field to writing.” Others stated that writing this type of paper essentially forced them to think and write differently:<disp-quote>
<p>Writing is also a great way to bring out knowledge and understanding—what [I] mean is, sometimes we don’t think, or are unsure if we “get it,” until we write it out and read our thoughts back.</p>
<p>By taking time to understand what I was writing about, I was able to clearly see how it did relate. If I wanted a good grade, I really had to accept the challenge that was presented to me by several difficult theorists.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These comments give voice to the fact that students understand the connection between writing and learning. Although this study does not directly measure whether writing about film leads to greater understanding, the students were able to see their ability to think theoretically grow as they were writing. This type of writing seems to have given these students ownership over the interpretation of theoretical texts and challenged them to participate more deeply in the learning process.</p>
<p>Writing film analysis papers did not appeal to all students. However, no student has <italic>strongly</italic> disagreed with <italic>all</italic> of the questions described previously. There is only one “strongly disagree” response for three of the four statements. And, only a handful of students (three to five) have answered in the negative, stating that they “disagree” with any particular statement about the effect of writing film papers. A small number of students every semester have a difficult time figuring out how to use theory to analyze films. Many find the sheer amount of material represented in the characters, scenes, and plot of a film too difficult to sift through. Several students explicitly stated in their evaluations that they would have preferred to write straightforward theoretical papers for this class. A handful of qualitative responses suggest that students do not always believe films helped them see the connection between theory and the real world because they do not see film as representing “reality.” However, the majority of students react positively to the process of writing film papers.</p>
<p>Finally, though the small sample size prohibits strong statistically significant findings, there is a positive correlation between the level of anxiety at the start of the course, as reported retrospectively, and evaluations of the film analysis project. That is, bivariate relationships between theory and writing anxiety and all four measures described previously were positive, if not significant. Those who were very nervous about reading theoretical texts were more likely to report that the film papers helped them understand the theory, see connections between theory and everyday life, and feel more confident about writing theoretically. The same is true of those who were very nervous about writing theory papers. Two relationships stand out as particularly interesting.</p>
<p>First, students who reported feeling more nervous about reading theoretical texts at the beginning of the semester were more likely to agree that viewing films made it easier to understand the theory (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092055X12462142">Table 1</xref>). Fifty-four percent of students who were very nervous about reading theory agreed that the films helped them understand the assigned texts, and 46 percent strongly agreed. Second, an association exists between feeling nervous about writing at the beginning of the course and reporting that viewing the films helped them feel more confident about writing theoretical papers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0092055X12462142">Table 2</xref>). Sixty percent of students who were very nervous about writing theory papers agreed that films helped boost their confidence and 34 percent strongly agreed. These two relationships in particular add support to my claim that applying theory in the process of writing film papers does, in fact, decrease anxiety and increase perceived levels of understanding. Those students who were acutely nervous at the start of the class report stronger effects of the film paper. Theory-anxious students found that watching films helps reduce their fear of not being able to understand theoretical texts and writing-anxious students reported that the films helped alleviate fears related to theoretical writing.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Based on these initial findings it does appear that the film analysis project used in this class has a significant positive effect on anxiety and subsequently, perceived understanding, as measured by students’ subjective reports. Because films provide “real-world” examples to which students can relate and papers ask them to apply the theories we cover, the assignment reduces anxiety related to thinking and writing theoretically.</p>
<p>The data presented here are by no means perfect. As it is currently administered, this questionnaire is only able to capture students’ recollections of how nervous they felt at the beginning of the course. Had pre- and posttest data been gathered, I would be able to claim more strongly that the film assignment has a direct impact on writing and theory anxiety by measuring the change in anxiety over the semester. However, measuring theory anxiety at the start of the semester would likely have picked up on students’ general fears of having to take a theory course. Their anxiety levels would likely be elevated by the fear of the unknown: not knowing about course expectations, required assignments, content, and so on. As it stands, however, the data still indicate that students believe watching films and writing about them reduced their fears. In addition, the survey does not directly measure student learning, merely perceptions of increased mastery over theoretical concepts. Generally speaking, paper grades do increase over the course of the semester, but this is not simply an indication of increased theoretical understanding. A student’s grade will improve as they become better at theoretical writing, figure out the tricks of argumentative writing, or become more adept at meeting the film analysis guidelines. Again, gathering pre- and posttest data regarding theoretical understanding in future work would be ideal.</p>
<p>The Film Analysis Project described in this article began modestly as a simple attempt to engage undergraduate students in the study of sociological theory, but it has led me to a deeper understanding of what student-centered teaching means. Film might grab students’ attention and help them focus their theoretical writing, but a focus on “writing to learn” clearly entails much more than having students write more and more often. Low-stakes writing assignments might help students internalize content but they still need systematic instruction in what it means to “theorize.” Those skills need to be practiced both in class discussion and in writing. To alleviate writing anxiety, attention had to be paid to the process and mechanics of writing as well as learning to write theoretically. Film became the thread that could tie these lessons together. It allowed me to help students to become accomplished “theorists” because they were less nervous about the class, learning theory, and writing theoretically.</p>

<title>Film Analysis Papers</title>
<p>Many of the ideas we will cover in this course have unlimited potential to speak to our contemporary world. I’m hoping that analyzing films will be a creative and interesting way for you to synthesize, evaluate, and apply the knowledge you have learned throughout your study of classical and contemporary sociological theory. Film analysis can also allow us to assess the continued relevance of these theories as we watch representations of social phenomena come alive on the screen. Some filmmakers purposefully incorporate theoretical ideas into plot and character development as well as cinematography, while others simply allude to them. A synopsis of <italic>Brazil</italic> explicitly discusses bureaucracy, for example, while <italic>Office Space</italic> is an implicit critique of that organizational form. I have attempted to choose a handful of films that either make reference to or can be used to illustrate your understanding of the theories you have read.</p>
<sec id="section9-0092055X12462142">
<title>Task and Purpose</title>
<p>Your papers should use each film as a vehicle for discussing the <italic>most relevant</italic> concepts, ideas, or theories covered throughout the course. Be sure to <underline>define</underline> specific concepts and <underline>describe</underline> how examples from the film <underline>illustrate</underline> the particular concept you are discussing. Create a strong <underline>argument</underline> and structure for your paper that <underline>applies</underline> theory to the film. Your discussion of examples from the film should present a clear and concise picture of a social world that your reader has no experience of, such that anyone reading your paper can clearly grasp your argument and your use of the film as an illustration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0092055X12462142">
<title>Format</title>
<p>These papers are not expected to be “film reviews” in the strictest sense, though they may incorporate certain features of traditional film analyses. Because they are “tests” of your comprehension and mastery over theoretical principles, your papers must be analytical, academic, and sociological. Technical requirements: 4-6 pages, double-spaced (please do not manipulate font size or margins to meet length requirements). <bold>Proper in-text citation of course materials is expected</bold>. If outside sources are used, please submit a complete bibliography.</p>

<title>Evaluation</title>
<p>A good analysis will: 1) incorporate and accurately discuss the most relevant course content, 2) be well organized and articulate so that sentences are fluent (flow), and 3) be free of grammatical error. The best analyses will have a clearly stated thesis around which the entire paper is structured and a complex argument that focuses on a specific conceptual theme prominent in the theorist’s work (i.e., “Office Spaces: The Irrationality of the Modern Bureaucratic Iron Cage” or “Merchants of Cool: Disciplinary Mechanisms of the Simulacra”).</p>
<sec id="section12-0092055X12462142">
<title>You are required to complete 4 of the following 7 paper options</title>
<p>The descriptions found below are meant for inspiration only; you have complete creative control over the direction of your paper. Please think carefully as you decide which options to complete, taking paper deadlines as well as your interest in the theory and theorist into account. I strongly recommend trying to write one of the first two papers in order to ensure timely and extensive feedback.</p>
<list id="list1-0092055X12462142" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Option 1 Film: <italic>Matewan</italic> or <italic>Norma Rae</italic> Theorist: Marx</p>
<p>Both <italic>Matewan</italic> and <italic>Norma Rae</italic> (films about unions/union leaders) deal with central concerns in Marx’s theorizing—the standardization and alienation inherent in the modern organization of labor and the revolutionary consciousness of the working class.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Option 2 Film: <italic>Fight Club</italic> or <italic>Varsity Blues</italic> Theorist: Durkheim</p>
<p>Do you think that the U.S. obsession with football qualifies as a religion? In what ways do you think that <italic>Varsity Blues</italic> illustrates the central aspects of Durkheim’s ideas about religion, human knowledge, and consciousness? You might take on the same ideas in an analysis of <italic>Fight Club</italic>. Or, tackle the issues of integration, regulation, and solidarity as discussed in <italic>Suicide</italic> as well.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Option 3 Film: <italic>Office Space</italic> Theorists: Weber and/or Simmel</p>
<p>Imagine if film critics Ebert and Roeper were replaced by Simmel and/or Weber. What would their review of <italic>Office Space</italic> concern? What ideas from their work would they see reflected in the reality of this film?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Option 4 Film: <italic>Meet the Parents</italic> Theorist: Goffman</p>
<p>A comedy of errors, everything that can go wrong does in this film. Ben Stiller’s character illustrates virtually all of the concepts and processes central to Goffman’s <italic>Presentation of Self</italic> in his attempts to impress his fiancé’s father. Document Greg Focker’s “performance” of self as he engages in the “arts of impression management.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Option 5 Film: <italic>Boys Don’t Cry</italic> Theorists: Feminist</p>
<p>How does this movie illustrate various aspects of the social construction of gender? How much of Brandon Teena’s gendered experience is this theory able to explain? Is a “social construction” theory able to explain homophobia and violence depicted in the film adequately? If not, why? If yes, how?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Option 6 Film: <italic>The Merchants of Cool</italic> Theorists: Critical/Contemporary</p>
<p>Use the ideas of contemporary theorists (i.e., simulacra, power, corporate production of culture, the public sphere, disciplinary mechanisms, etc.) to make sense of teenagers’ experiences as they confront the “merchants of cool.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Option 7 Film: <italic>Brazil</italic> or <italic>The Handmaid’s Tale</italic> Theorist: Any</p>
<p>Numerous utopic and dystopic films, because they intend to address social issues and ills, address topics of central concern to sociological theory. Pick any theory or theorist (or multiple theories/theorists) in your analysis of either of these films.</p></list-item>
