<abstract>
<p>Intra-abdominal vascular trauma is an injury that continues to challenge the general surgeon and leads to high morbidity and mortality even at busy urban trauma centers. The majority of patients arrive in hemorrhagic shock; therefore, rapid evaluation, resuscitation, and transfer to the operating room are necessary to treat these patients. In the operating room, the surgeon must have a well-planned surgical approach to the variety of potential injuries encountered in the retroperitoneal space. This article reviews the incidence, diagnostic strategies, treatment principles, and expected outcomes when dealing with intra-abdominal vascular injury.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1460408612464018"><title>Epidemiology</title>
<p>Intra-abdominal vascular injuries (IAVI) continue to result in significant morbidity and mortality amongst trauma patients. Though many advances have been made in overall management and care of the injured patient, the mortality of patients suffering from major IAVI has remained largely unchanged over the past 30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408612464018">Asensio et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1460408612464018">Davis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1460408612464018">Eachempati et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1460408612464018">Paul et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1460408612464018">Tyburski et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Penetrating trauma remains the cause of major IAVI in most recent reported series in the literature with 70% to 88% of IAVI being related to penetrating trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408612464018">Asensio et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1460408612464018">Paul et al., 2010</xref>). Major IAVI is infrequent in most trauma centers and is reported in less than 1% of all injured patients seen at level 1 Trauma centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408612464018">Asensio et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1460408612464018">Paul et al., 2010</xref>). However, when considering patients admitted to hospital with abdominal trauma, the incidence rises to 5% for blunt injury and to 25% for penetrating injury and it is the most frequent cause of death in these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1460408612464018">Cox, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1460408612464018">Feliciano et al., 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>As trauma systems throughout the world continue to develop and mature, surgeons involved in the care of these patients need to gain and maintain skills and knowledge related to these injuries if outcomes are going to be improved. Because of the severe blood loss and acuity of the presentation, the surgeon needs to be able to approach IAVI with confidence and a plan to obtain rapid control of bleeding, identify and control associated injuries, and then definitively manage the vascular injury. This article provides an overview of the management of life-threatening injuries to major intra-abdominal vascular structures.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1460408612464018"><title>Diagnosis</title>
<sec id="sec4-1460408612464018"><title>General principles of management</title>
<p>The patient presenting with suspected IAVI is likely to arrive to the hospital in shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1460408612464018">Davis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1460408612464018">Paul et al., 2010</xref>). However, many patients with contained retroperitoneal injuries will be transient responders and require a high index of suspicion to make a quick and accurate assessment. As with all injured patients, the evaluation and management of the patient should begin with the basic principles taught by the Advanced Trauma Life Support Course of the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408612464018">American College of Surgeons, 2008</xref>). The primary survey, consisting of an assessment of airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure should be performed while immediate resuscitative efforts begin with crystalloid fluids.</p>
<p>When assessing the abdomen for vascular injury, the anatomic landmarks include the nipples superiorly, pubic symphysis inferiorly, and anterior axillary lines laterally. One must consider IAVI in patients with flank wounds and back wounds as well. The landmarks defining the flank include the level of the nipples superiorly, iliac crest inferiorly, and anterior axillary line to posterior axillary lines. The back can be defined as extending from the tips of the scapula to the sacrum and posterior axillary lines laterally.</p>
<p>If the patient is determined to have evidence of shock and penetrating injury to the abdomen, they should be transferred immediately to the operating room for definitive surgical exploration as the incidence of intra-abdominal organ injury overall is near 90% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1460408612464018">Moore et al., 1980</xref>). Most situations will allow the resuscitating team to obtain plain anteroposterior x-rays of the chest and abdomen in cases of gunshot injuries to provide information as to the potential path of the bullet. Knowing the path will provide the surgeon with some expectation as to the likely injured structures to begin planning for the exploration.</p>
<p>Penetrating injuries to the anterior abdomen secondary to gunshot injuries without evidence of shock should still be explored due to the high risk of intra-abdominal organ injury. However, penetrating trauma to the flank or back without evidence of peritonitis or hemodynamic compromise should undergo imaging to determine the trajectory of the penetrating object and provide further information regarding the need for operative exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408612464018">Biffl and Moore, 2010</xref>). Contrast CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis have been shown to be helpful to define the extent and depth of injury in this situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408612464018">Biffl and Moore, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408612464018">Boyle et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1460408612464018">Himmelman et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1460408612464018">Ramirez et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Patients presenting with stab wounds to the abdomen without peritonitis or shock should be managed differently than those of gunshot injuries. These patients have significant intra-abdominal injuries requiring surgical correction only 20–30% of the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408612464018">Biffl and Moore, 2010</xref>). Several authors have recommended local wound exploration followed by serial examinations, diagnostic peritoneal lavage, or single or triple-contrast CT scanning if the wound exploration demonstrates penetration of fascia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408612464018">Biffl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408612464018">Biffl and Moore, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408612464018">Boyle et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1460408612464018">Ramirez et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Patients presenting with blunt trauma to the abdomen and evidence of peritonitis or shock with free fluid identified on ultrasound should likewise be transferred to the operating room immediately. On the other hand, patients who are hemodynamically normal, without evidence of peritonitis, can undergo further imaging with CT scans to evaluate for intra-abdominal injuries. Blunt IAVI should be suspected or at least considered in patients after significant deceleration mechanisms and particularly in cases where a seat-belt sign is present without a history of airbag deployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1460408612464018">Kulvatunyou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1460408612464018">Lalancette et al., 2006</xref>). Likewise, significant bony fractures of the pelvis may lead to laceration of pelvic vessels and high morbidity and mortality due to pelvic hemorrhage if not recognized early (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1460408612464018">Verbeek et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec5-1460408612464018"><title>Classifications</title>
<p>It is useful to classify IAVI in order to better understand and conceptualize the management of these patients. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1460408612464018">Moore and colleagues (1992)</xref> on the Organ Injury Scaling Committee of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma published an Abdominal Vascular Organ Injury Scale in 1992 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1460408612464018">Table 1</xref>).

<p>For the surgeon encountering IAVI in the operating room, a more useful and simple classification system involves dividing the retroperitoneum into three zones in order to predict the structures injured and guide surgical management. The zones of the retroperitoneum include:</p>
<sec id="sec6-1460408612464018"><title>Zone 1</title>
<p>This area includes midline, central hematomas from the diaphragmatic hiatus to the sacrum. Central hematomas may indicate injury to the aorta, inferior vena cava, celiac axis, renal arteries and veins, or superior and inferior mesenteric arteries and veins. Due to the difference in surgical approaches, zone I injuries are frequently subdivided into supra or inframesocolic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1460408612464018"><title>Zone 2</title>
<p>Hematomas associated with the lateral aspects of the retroperitoneum are classified as zone 2 injuries. These hematomas should raise suspicion for the presence of renal vascular or kidney injury.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1460408612464018"><title>Zone 3</title>
<p>These hematomas include the lateral pelvic region and suggest iliac artery or vein injury.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1460408612464018"><title>Principles of management</title>
<p>The initial surgical approach to IAVI differs by mechanism of injury (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1460408612464018">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1460408612464018">2</xref>); therefore, the next section will begin by focusing on the surgical management of blunt IAVI versus penetrating IAVI based on the retroperitoneal zone of injury.

</fig></p>
<sec id="sec10-1460408612464018"><title>Blunt</title>
<p>Central hematomas (zone 1) should always be explored. If the injury is supramesocolic and arterial injury is suspected, a left to right medial visceral rotation should be performed. The aorta should be controlled at the aortic hiatus prior to opening the hematoma. If the injury is inframesocolic, the proximal control can be obtained at the base of the transverse mesocolon.</p>
<p>In the setting of blunt trauma, lateral hematomas (zone 2) should only be explored if expanding, ruptured, pulsatile, or if the patient remains in hemorrhagic shock secondary to this isolated injury.</p>
<p>Similar to blunt traumatic zone 2 hematomas, pelvic hematomas (zone 3) should be opened only if expanding, ruptured, pulsatile, or if the patient remains in unresponsive shock. The absence of an ipsilateral iliac or femoral pulse would also necessitate hematoma exploration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1460408612464018"><title>Penetrating</title>
<p>The management of retroperitoneal hematomas in the setting of penetrating trauma consists of exploration of the area in the respective zone. The exception to this rule may be that of zone 2 injuries in which previous imaging was obtained and demonstrates no significant arterial injury or blush.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1460408612464018"><title>Operative approach</title>
<p>In the setting of emergent exploration for abdominal trauma, the patient should be prepped from the neck to the knees to allow for exposure of the saphenous veins or jugular veins for use as autologous conduits. A long midline laparotomy incision should be made. The fascia should be incised, leaving the peritoneum intact until it is all exposed so that rapid entry into the entire abdomen is possible by a quick spreading of the peritoneum along the length of the incision. All four quadrants should be packed off with laparotomy pads while the anesthesia team maintains a rapid infusion of crystalloid and blood as necessary to maintain perfusion. Intra-abdominal bleeding from solid organs, bowel, or bowel mesentery should be quickly identified and controlled with immediate application of manual pressure and resection or ligation of bleeding peripheral vessels. The retroperitoneum should be evaluated for evidence of hematomas once active intra-abdominal bleeding is controlled.</p>
<p>All zone 1 hematomas in the supramesocolic position should be explored whether due to blunt or penetrating trauma. Typically, control of the aorta at the level of the diaphragm or just above the diaphragm by cutting the left crux is necessary to control proximal bleeding at this level of injury. Control of the aorta may be obtained initially using manual compression, an aortic occluding device or a large aortic vascular clamp. In order to completely control and visualize the injury at the level of supra renal aorta, a left to right medial visceral rotation is necessary. This should include the complete mobilization of the spleen and left kidney to bring them into the midline abdomen.</p>
<p>Injuries to the aorta should be repaired after obtaining proximal and distal control or by isolationg the injury by using a side-biting Statinsky clamp. Small injuries may be closed primarily in a transverse fashion or by using patch aortoplasty with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE); however, larger injuries or multiple injuries will likely require the use of an interposition graft using a 12, 14, or 16 mm woven Dacron, albumin-coated Dacron, or PTFE graft sutured in place with 3 or 4-0 prolene suture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408612464018">Accola et al., 1987</xref>). Given the size of the artery, there are few options for a conduit to repair the aorta. Despite the risk of graft infection, prosthetic graft can be safely used even in the setting of contamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1460408612464018">Dente and Feliciano, 2008</xref>). Another option for conduit may be that of cryopreserved cadaveric vessels that have been successfully used in transplant operations and vascular surgery though no data is currently available to support the use of these autologous grafts in the setting of trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1460408612464018">Castier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1460408612464018">Hwang et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Vascular injuries to the celiac axis, portal vein, superior mesenteric artery and vein, proximal splenic artery and vein, and left renal artery are frequently difficult to identify and repair due to the amount of dissection required to visualize and control them. Control of the hepatic artery and portal vein is best accomplished by occluding the proximal hepatoduodenal ligament by manual compress and ultimately with a vascular clamp (Pringle maneuver) prior to opening the hematoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408612464018">Asensio et al., 2002</xref>). Complete dissection to mobilize the common bile duct to the left followed by primary repair in portal vein is ideal. The hepatic artery can routinely be ligated without significant hepatic ischemia. However, repair of the portal vein should be attempted. If the portal vein is ligated due to the patient’s severe shock, a second look laparotomy should be planned to evaluate the bowel and liver and for consideration of reconstruction when the patient has stabilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408612464018">Asensio et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1460408612464018">Pearl et al., 2004</xref>). The neck of the pancreas may need to be divided in order to expose distal portal vein, superior mesenteric artery and vein, and splenic artery and vein injuries. Tangential injuries to the renal arteries or veins can be repaired primarily without the need for grafts or conduits; however, nephrectomy for main renal artery injury has similar outcomes to those of vascular reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1460408612464018">Elliott et al., 2007</xref>). Consideration should be made for ligating proximal celiac axis and superior mesenteric vessel injuries if severe shock is present as there is good collateral circulation and most young trauma patients do quite well with ligation of these vessels though little data exists to support or refute this practice in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408612464018">Asensio et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>If a vena caval injury is suspected given the trajectory of penetrating trauma, a right to left medial visceral rotation (Cattell-Braasch maneuver) should be performed leaving the kidney down and mobilizing the right colon and duodenum off of the vena cava. This is a technically simple procedure that will provide excellent exposure to the inferior vena cava and can be extended to expose the inframesocolic aorta without much difficulty. Primary repair should be performed in a transverse fashion in order not to narrow the lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1460408612464018">Figure 3</xref>). If necessary, patch angioplasty with saphenous vein may be necessary to maintain adequate luminal size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1460408612464018">Figure 4</xref>).

</fig></p>
<p>Juxahepatic vena caval and hepatic vein injuries are notoriously difficult to manage, have a high mortality, and if suspected, deserve great caution and planning. Many authors suggest that these hematomas should not be explored due to the high mortality associated with operative repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408612464018">Buckman et al., 2000</xref>). Many have written about the use of atrio-caval shunts to bypass these injuries during repair, but very few surgeons have placed these and accordingly, morbidity and mortality is extremely high when these extraordinary attempts at salvage are performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408612464018">Buckman et al., 2000</xref>). A potentially better option if this injury is suspected is to put the patient on venovenous bypass or cardiac bypass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1460408612464018">Figure 5</xref>). Published case reports have demonstrated reasonable outcomes with these techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408612464018">Biffl et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1460408612464018">Kaoutzanis et al., 2011</xref>). Veno-venous bypass requires cannulating the femoral vein and axillary or internal jugular vein and placing the patient on venous bypass during the operative repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408612464018">Biffl et al., 1998</xref>). Other successful approaches have included venous stenting and arterial embolization in the interventional radiology suite when these juxtahepatic injuries are identified early but the patient appears to continue to bleed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408612464018">Buckman et al., 2000</xref>).

</fig></p>
<p>Zone 2 hematomas are managed differently depending upon whether the trauma is blunt or penetrating and whether imaging was performed pre-operatively. In blunt trauma, the hematoma is not opened unless there is ongoing bleeding. In cases of penetrating injury, when preoperative imaging demonstrates no significant bleeding these injuries may be observed without exploration of the injury as well. In all other cases of penetrating trauma, however, the hematoma should be opened and the tract of the injury explored. Authors debate whether a lateral to medial or medial to lateral approach to the renal hilum is better. Data is clear that if a lateral to medial approach is made, the incidence of nephrectomy is higher than when renal artery and vein are controlled centrally prior to opening Gerota’s fascia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1460408612464018">Shoobridge et al., 2011</xref>). This data may be somewhat slanted due to the fact that if there is active bleeding coming from the perinephric hematoma, most surgeons will appropriately perform a lateral to medial dissection to control the bleeding rather than taking the time to dissect out the medial hilum which is a technically more difficult procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1460408612464018">Shoobridge et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In the multiply injured patient in shock, penetrating injury to the renal vessels typically leads to ligation and nephrectomy as long as the surgeon has assured there is a contralateral kidney present. If the patient is hemodynamically normal, the renal artery or vein may be repaired primarily or with an interposition graft using the hepatic artery on the right or the splenic artery on the left with good outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1460408612464018">Kansas et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Zone 3 hematomas should not be opened in patients suffering blunt trauma. If a blunt injury to pelvic arteries is suspected, an attempt at control by interventional radiology using embolization or stenting is appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1460408612464018">Pinto et al., 2010</xref>). Penetrating trauma to the lateral pelvis mandates exploration to identify not only iliac artery or vein injuries but also to visualize and assure no injury to the ureter is present. Two approaches are espoused when exploring these hematomas. The first approach involves obtaining proximal control of the aorta and inferior vena cava above the hematoma and distal control of the femoral artery and vein through a groin incision. The second approach is that of opening the hematoma directly over the site of likely injury and controlling the bleeding with manual compression or by compressing the vessels with sponge sticks until complete dissection and isolation of the injuries is complete. Primary repair or the use of a PTFE interposition graft is acceptable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1460408612464018">Figure 6</xref>). I prefer a direct approach to the dissection as the collateral blood flow from the internal iliac and sacral plexus typically leads to substantial bleeding despite control of the femoral vessels. However, this does require a second surgeon capable of assisting in the control and dissection of the vessels.

</fig></p>
<p>The bifurcation of the common iliac vein is a notoriously difficult area to control. One approach to this injury is to transect the right iliac artery and roll the aorta and left iliac artery to the patient’s left in order to completely visualize and control the iliac veins at this site. Once the vein is repaired or ligated, the right common iliac artery is primarily repaired.</p>

<sec id="sec13-1460408612464018"><title>Damage control</title>
<p>An important consideration for all IAVI is whether to take the time to perform a repair of an injured vessel or whether shunting or ligating is more appropriate. Recent series reported in the literature demonstrate that ligation is the most common treatment strategy at busy urban centers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1460408612464018">Table 2</xref>). The first step is controlling the bleeding. Once this is accomplished, the surgeon must take into account the level of shock and amount of resuscitation that is taking place by the anesthesia team. This mandates operative team collaboration with excellent communication with the anesthesiologists. If the patient is severely acidotic, cold, or coagulopathic despite appropriate aggressive resuscitation, then the injured vessel should be either ligated or a shunt put into place as the outcomes support damage control maneuvers in this situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408612464018">Asensio et al., 2001</xref>).

<p>This use of a shunt has been shown to be beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408612464018">Asensio et al., 2000</xref>). The shunt should be tied in place and should correspond as closely as possible with the size of the vessel requiring shunt placement. Straight vascular shunts of various sizes ranging from 8 french to 16 french should be available in the event they are needed in this situation. After shunt placement or vascular ligation, a temporary closure technique can be utilized such as a homemade or commercially available (ABThera<sup>TM</sup>) vacuum closure device. Patients may now be transferred to the intensive care unit for aggressive resuscitation and correction of acidosis, coagulopathy, and hypothermia. Once the patient is stabilized, they can return to the operating room for definitive repair or maintenance of the ligation as is necessary depending upon the vessel injured and the amount of ischemia or vascular congestion present as a result of the ligation. The optimal time for a planned return is between 24 and 72 hours depending upon associated injuries. Many young trauma patients will survive and do relatively well despite ligation of most of the venous structures in the abdomen including the inferior vena cava and portal vein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408612464018">Asensio et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1460408612464018">Pearl et al., 2004</xref>). If the iliac veins or inferior vena cava is ligated, the surgeon must consider a prophylactic four-compartment fasciotomy of the lower extremities. Untreated or delayed treatment of compartment syndrome due to ischemia, venous congestion, and reperfusion leads to unacceptably high morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1460408612464018">Sullivan et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1460408612464018"><title>Endovascular approaches</title>
<p>Whether as a first-line technique or performed after initial damage control operation, endovascular techniques have become an option for definitive or temporary control and repair of IAVI. Though data is limited in this area, several case reports and series have espoused the use of angioembolization and stenting for patients with IAVI. Outcomes are variable, and a surgeon should always be involved in the decision-making when considering an endovascular treatment strategy in the setting of traumatic injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1460408612464018">Boufi et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>Complications associated with IAVI are similar to those of patients with other significant injuries. Infection is a common complication of all injured patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408612464018">Asensio et al., 2000</xref>). The dreaded complication of prosthetic graft infection is thankfully rare or at least rarely reported even in the setting of massive contamination. Suture line dehiscences at the sight of vascular anastomosis or thrombosis of repaired vessels are complications worth noting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408612464018">Asensio et al., 2002</xref>). In the setting of repaired or ligated veins, thrombosis is quite high though authors do not agree as to recommendations for anticoagulation or antiplatelet prophylaxis. The best approach to decrease the risk of thrombosis is to maintain as large of a lumen as possible at the conclusion of the repair as narrowing and vasoconstriction due to ongoing shock leads to a substantial increase in thrombosis risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408612464018">Asensio et al., 2002</xref>). A last complication that should be considered especially for aortic or iliac injuries is that of vascular-enteric fistulas. This complication is most likely to occur at a suture line and may be lessened by closing retroperitoneal tissue or suturing omentum over the repaired vessel to act as a barrier to the bowel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1460408612464018">Feliciano, 1992</xref>).</p>
