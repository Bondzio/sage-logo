<body>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I was encouraged by the article “Breastfeeding Duration in Relation to Child Care Arrangement and Participation in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children,” as I found the content interesting and relevant. Based on the dataset studied, it would also be interesting to evaluate the proportion of first child propensity to breastfeed versus the second or earlier born. As the study suggests, this added variable might help narrow the primary at-risk group even further which can be used to promote educational programs. This specific “target market” could be the highest priority for educational or community/peer support interventions and could help the child obtain the best nutrition during the first 6 months of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412447081">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Women who never initiated breastfeeding and those who ceased before the 4-month threshold were combined for study purposes and listed as a limitation. The difference was stated to not be material, or similar, to results that break this piece of data out. I think this information is useful in identifying higher-risk individuals. Based on this study limitation, the shorter-duration (&lt; 4 mo) breastfeeding group is 30% weighted by mothers who never initiated breastfeeding. The intervention changes considerably and a major hurdle in beginning to nurse the baby has been achieved for the remaining 70% (overall population). The syllabus for this group, which initiated then ceased, would cover nutritional benefits, but more importantly, it would focus on day-to-day challenges seen in the workforce. Also, the information provided could include material on speaking with supervisors at work or how to make time at home to nurse or express milk via breast pump. By extracting this data subset, the educational course would change, as the focus of the educational material could be more precise.</p>
