<abstract>
<p>This article reviews a classroom application titled “The Quest for Kudos Challenge,” which is a long-term, multitask, large group competition to attain a reward that was designed to adhere to the recommendations for creating a cooperative learning experience while maintaining the elements of a constructive competition. The application was implemented in a course mid-semester, allowing for a comparison of the results before and after the introduction of the Kudos Challenge. Furthermore, the outcomes for the classes that participated in the Kudos Challenge are compared with classes from a previous semester that did not implement the application. Results show that students in the Kudos Challenge classes received higher exam scores, increased classroom participation, and made more voluntary contributions than the Comparison classes from the previous semester. Qualitative feedback from the Kudos classes was overwhelmingly positive. Furthermore, several positive instructor outcomes resulted from the implementation of the Kudos Challenge, including positive feedback from the students, colleagues, and school administrators; higher student evaluations; and an innovative teaching award.</p>

<p>Despite the growing literature regarding the basic elements of cooperative learning and constructive competition, faculty who wish to use these new paradigms often struggle with actual implementation of the techniques in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1052562912451738">Millis, 2010</xref>). The primary objective of the current article is to provide instructors with a tool to assist with the incorporation of these elements. The classroom application, titled “The Quest for Kudos Challenge,” was specifically designed to adhere to the research-based guidelines for cooperative learning and constructive competition. The application enhances the level of complexity and sophistication of a competitive-cooperative learning experience, while remaining generablizable to various classroom settings with basic steps that make implementation manageable. The current article outlines the basic theoretical framework that supports the application, followed by the logistics of implementation and evidence of effectiveness.</p>
<sec id="section1-1052562912451738">
<title>Basic Elements of Cooperative Learning</title>
<p>Individualistic reward systems can result in destructive behaviors, as lower performing students label successful students as “overachievers” in an attempt to discourage competitive efforts from this high performing group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1052562912451738">Slavin, 1996</xref>). Refocusing the efforts of students toward a common goal by implementing a cooperative learning experience can create positive classroom norms where students encourage one another <italic>toward</italic> academic success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562912451738">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2009</xref>). To foster a cooperative learning environment, it is critical that each of the “basic elements of cooperation” be considered—(a) positive interdependence, (b) individual accountability, (c) promotive interaction, (d) social skills, and (e) group processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1052562912451738">Johnson, Jackson, &amp; Smith, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1052562912451738">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562912451738">2009</xref>). <italic>Positive interdependence</italic> exists when individuals are linked to others in a group by a mutual goal that can only be achieved if every member in the group succeeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1052562912451738">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Individual accountability</italic> exists when the performance of individuals in the group is assessed and the results are evident to the individual and fellow group mates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562912451738">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2009</xref>). <italic>Promotive interaction</italic> is evident when group members assist one another and encourage fellow group members to increase their motivation toward achieving the overarching group goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1052562912451738">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Social skills</italic>, including “leadership, decision-making, trust-building, communication, and conflict management skills,” are considered beneficial for enhancing the productivity and achievement for group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1052562912451738">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>, p. 24). <italic>Group processing</italic> is a periodic time for reflection among the group members to pinpoint contributions that have been beneficial, as well as identify actions that have been contrary to achieving the group goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1052562912451738">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2008</xref>). Overall, researchers have outlined the five basic elements discussed above as guidelines for instructors, declaring that in these propitious conditions, the benefits of cooperative learning will flourish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1052562912451738">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1052562912451738">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1052562912451738">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562912451738">2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1052562912451738">
<title>Maintaining a Constructive Competition</title>
<p>Although the term <italic>competition</italic> often holds a negative connotation, it is an unavoidable phenomenon in the business world. Specifically when instructing business students, it has been noted the “both competition and cooperation are as necessary in business as they are in other aspects of our lives” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1052562912451738">Berg, 2010</xref>, p. 176). Business students who learn in a purely cooperative environment might not be fully prepared for the competitive environment that awaits them on graduation. As with cooperative learning, there are three conditions outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562912451738">Johnson and Johnson (2009)</xref> that need to be adhered to in order to ensure that a competition is constructive. The first element of constructive competition is that <italic>winning should not be perceived as extremely important</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562912451738">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2009</xref>). When placed in a competitive setting where winning is perceived as crucial, the productivity of individuals can be stunted by high levels of anxiety and a fear of failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1052562912451738">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1989</xref>). The second element for a constructive competition is to ensure that participants feel that <italic>they have a chance of winning</italic> if the appropriate amount of effort is put forth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562912451738">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2009</xref>). The literature on goal setting supports this condition with findings that indicate frustration when individuals were given unattainable goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1052562912451738">Latham &amp; Locke, 2006</xref>). The third element for a constructive competition is the presence of <italic>clear rules and an unambiguous time frame</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562912451738">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, implementing the conditions for both cooperative learning and constructive competition sets the stage for a healthy group experience that combines the benefits of each strategy. As a means of providing instructors with a tool that incorporates the research outlined, the following sections provide details for an application that adheres to these guidelines.</p>
</sec>

<title>Implementing the Quest for Kudos Challenge</title>
<p>“The Quest for Kudos Challenge” is an application that adds a competitive element to the classroom, while maintaining a cooperative learning environment. The Kudos Challenge is structured as a long-term, multitask, large group competition where students are offered opportunities to compete for rewards. The details of the application are outlined in the following sections, with examples applied to an undergraduate Organizational Behavior course.</p>
<sec id="section4-1052562912451738">
<title>Creating a Group Reward System: What are “Kudos?”</title>
<p>The primary objective of the Kudos Challenge is for the groups to obtain as many “Kudos” as possible (details regarding group formation discussed later). <italic>Kudos</italic> is a term used to refer to the points specifically associated with the Kudos Challenge. The term was coined to avoid the potential confusion that could result if an instructor simply used the term <italic>points</italic>, which could be confused with regular course points. In an effort to adhere to the recommendations for a clear start and end time for the competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562912451738">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2009</xref>), students should be informed during a class session that The Quest for Kudos Challenge will be effective immediately and will continue until the final class session. Furthermore, it is critical to provide the students with “clear and specific rules, procedures, and criteria for winning” to facilitate a constructive competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562912451738">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2009</xref>, p. 370). In the present example, at the start of the Kudos Challenge, each student was provided with a detailed handout (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1052562912451738">Appendix A</xref>).</p>
<p>Throughout the Kudos Challenge, various components can serve as <italic>Kudos</italic> opportunities. In addition, <italic>Kudos</italic> can be deducted for dysfunctional behavior. Overall, the guidelines for the Kudos Challenge should be reviewed in the introductory class to ensure that each student clearly understands the regulations.</p>
<p>At the final session and conclusion of the Challenge, the accumulation of <italic>Kudos</italic> among the participating groups is compared and the rankings announced. In this case, the incentive for winning the overall competition was a reward of bonus points applied to each group member’s individual grade for the course. The number of bonus points secured was associated with each designated group ranking at the end of the Challenge—1st place, 25 bonus points; 2nd place, 14 bonus points; 3rd place, 4 bonus points. This incentive structure meant that the winners had the opportunity to raise their percentage in the course by approximately 3%.</p>
<p>The reward structure of the Kudos Challenge was designed with the elements for a constructive competition in mind, as the designated incentive creates a situation where winning is not an overwhelming imperative for the participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562912451738">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2009</xref>). Although the students perceive bonus points as beneficial to their grade, the amount should not be excessive. Creating a situation where losing the competition could have a major negative impact on an individual’s grade will stimulate perceptions of threat and anxiety. Thus, the Kudos Challenge is <italic>not</italic> designed to be implemented as a major course requirement that consists of a large percentage of an individual’s course grade.</p>
<p>Overall, the reward structure of the Kudos Challenge was designed to abide by the research guidelines for a cooperative–competitive learning experience. In addition, the flexibility of the Kudos Challenge provides instructors with the freedom to adjust the reward system to fit the objectives of a particular course. Instructors should take into consideration the total number of points available in the course (bonus points accounting for a small percentage of the points) and the average grade in the course (avoiding grade inflation).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1052562912451738">
<title>Opportunities to Gain or Lose Kudos</title>
<p>With the application of the Kudos Challenge, instructors can reward any desired behavior, while discouraging undesirable behaviors. <italic>Kudos</italic> opportunities can simply be individual course requirements that can simultaneously serve as <italic>Kudos</italic> secured for the group. <italic>Kudos</italic> opportunities can also be provided with additional activities or tasks beyond the standard course requirements used to determine individual grades. Details regarding the elements used in the present example are provided in the following sections.</p>
<sec id="section6-1052562912451738">
<title>Exams</title>
<p>One of the primary objectives of any course is to increase student knowledge of the course topics. In this case, the course incorporated three exams that tested student knowledge. Exam 1 was given prior to the introduction of the Kudos Challenge and a comprehensive Final Exam was given after the conclusion of the Kudos Challenge. Exam 2 was given after the introduction of the Kudos Challenge with each individual exam score also converted into <italic>Kudos</italic> for the group. With the implementation of the <italic>Kudos</italic> incentive structure, individuals recognize that their exam scores no longer solely affects their own grades but are also linked to the number of <italic>Kudos</italic> their group accumulates. The sense of individual accountability pushes an individual to conform to the goals of the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1052562912451738">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562912451738">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2009</xref>). Positive interdependence creates a situation wherein group members support one another and recognize that the success of each member is important for the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1052562912451738">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1989</xref>). One would expect higher scores on an exam with this type of incentive structure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1052562912451738">
<title>Class Participation</title>
<p>Students often shy away from classroom participation due to an overwhelming fear of being evaluated by others and appearing incompetent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912451738">Rocca, 2010</xref>). On the other hand, vocal students can end up dominating the session discussion, which can then quickly deteriorate into a conversation between the instructor and a few select students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562912451738">Desiraju &amp; Gopinath, 2001</xref>). An instructor is often faced with the challenge of trying to limit students who are dominating the discussion, while at the same time trying to encourage the participation of those who are less vocal. Researchers have recommended shifting the incentive structure of classroom participation to focus on a collective goal rather than individualistic goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562912451738">Hollander, 2002</xref>). In the present example, individual participation scores in the course also served as the number of <italic>Kudos</italic> earned for the group. Students in this case were expected to participate in at least 50% of the class discussions to earn the maximum number of points for this course component. Once the maximum number of participation points was secured for an individual, further contributions would not be beneficial for the individual’s grade or for the Kudos Challenge. With the implementation of the Kudos Challenge, it would be expected that discussion-dominating students would quickly realize that limiting opportunities for their fellow group members to participate would negatively affect their group’s performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1052562912451738">
<title>In-Class Activities</title>
<p>In addition to course components, instructors can adapt any standard classroom activity into a <italic>Kudos</italic> opportunity. In the present example, several in-class activities were converted into <italic>Kudos</italic> opportunities (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1052562912451738">Appendix B</xref> for a complete list). Certain activities, such as the Jeopardy challenge, allowed the groups to compete against the opposing groups to achieve the most <italic>Kudos.</italic> Competitive activities serve to increase group cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1052562912451738">Brown, 2000</xref>) and stimulate boundary interdependence by drawing attention to competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1052562912451738">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>). On the other hand, some activities allowed each group to attain the maximum number of <italic>Kudos.</italic> It should be noted that not every single class session requires a <italic>Kudos</italic> opportunity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1052562912451738">
<title>Volunteer Opportunities</title>
<p>In most cases, requesting that students to go beyond the course requirements is not likely to be a success endeavor. Demonstrating competence beyond the norms of the class could incur social costs, such as being labeled a “nerd” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1052562912451738">Weiner, 2005</xref>). The Kudos Challenge overcomes this issue by altering the norms of behavior and creating an environment wherein students can enhance relatedness needs by increasing academic motivation. The following sections outline suggestions for voluntary <italic>Kudos</italic> opportunities.</p>
<sec id="section10-1052562912451738">
<title>Kudos essay</title>
<p>On the second exam, individuals were provided with an opportunity to gain <italic>Kudos</italic> for their group by responding to an optional graduate-level essay question. Research results have shown that student self-efficacy can be enhanced by providing the opportunity to succeed on a difficult task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1052562912451738">Schunk, 1991</xref>). The Kudos Essay provides an opportunity to increase individual self-efficacy and earn <italic>Kudos</italic> for the group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1052562912451738">
<title>Leadership positions</title>
<p>The second voluntary <italic>Kudos</italic> opportunity was presented in the form of voluntary leadership roles (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1052562912451738">Appendix A</xref> for leadership role descriptions). Each group was allowed to hold two leadership positions and secured 75 <italic>Kudos</italic> for each position. These leadership positions were included as a means of enhancing the culture of the class. The addition of the leadership roles also provided an opportunity for the students to enhance their social skills with instructor guidance. Coaching and developing social skills, such as leadership, are believed to enhance a cooperative learning experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1052562912451738">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1052562912451738">
<title>GROOP assignment</title>
<p>The final voluntary <italic>Kudos</italic> opportunity was a Group Reflective Observation Optional Paper (GROOP) assignment. Each group could earn <italic>Kudos</italic> for applying terms/concepts from the course to its experience during the Kudos Challenge. Each application needed to clearly demonstrate knowledge of the concept and provide a direct application to the group’s experience. Correct applications that met these criteria were awarded 20 <italic>Kudos</italic> each. A maximum was not placed on the number of potential <italic>Kudos</italic> that could be secured with the GROOP assignment. This final voluntary element of the challenge was implemented as a means of promoting a constructive competition and maintaining the belief that winning the competition was possible for all groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562912451738">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2009</xref>). This open-ended <italic>Kudos</italic> opportunity would help counteract feelings of helplessness that could result if a group had not done well during an in-class activity.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section13-1052562912451738">
<title>Kudos Deductions</title>
<p><italic>Kudos</italic> deductions can be applied if group members engage in undesirable behaviors. In this example, for each individual absence, 20 <italic>Kudos</italic> were deducted from a group’s accumulated total. Adding this element to the Kudos Challenge was an attempt to limit excessive social loafing by creating individual accountability for attendance during the in-class activities. Yet the GROOP assignment allowed individuals to make up for an absence by applying terms to get back any <italic>Kudos</italic> lost through deductions.</p>
<p>Overall, structuring the Challenge with a group incentive to engage in positive behaviors and limit undesirable behaviors will promote cooperative learning by ensuring positive interdependence while maintaining individual accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1052562912451738">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1052562912451738">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1989</xref>). The elements of the Kudos Challenge can be easily adapted by instructors to fit with the goals and objectives of a particular class. Instructors can easily convert current course components into elements of the Kudos Challenge. Cooperative learning activities that an instructor uses most often can also be converted to a competition or <italic>Kudos</italic> opportunity. It is recommended that instructors make each in-class Kudos opportunity worth a similar value, and if a competitive format is used, the differentiation between teams should not be excessive to maintain the feeling that each group could win first place in the Challenge. Furthermore, new leadership roles could be created to reflect the goals/values of an instructor and the GROOP assignment could be adapted to fit the course material.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section14-1052562912451738">
<title>Group Assignment</title>
<sec id="section15-1052562912451738">
<title>Setting the group size</title>
<p>The group size for the Kudos Challenge in this case was capped at 10 group members. Several factors played a role in deciding to create groups of this size, keeping in mind the recommendation by researchers to “set team size by pedagogical objectives” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1052562912451738">Bacon, Stewart, &amp; Silver, 1999</xref>, p. 484). First, it was an objective of the instructor to have the students experience the dynamics of a large group for the purposes of the class material. Second, although the logistics and dynamics of a large group can be challenging, organizations commonly form large groups to complete projects. For example, business managers were asked in a field study to document the number of members in each work group and the average reported group size was 10.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1052562912451738">Liden, Wayne, Jaworski, &amp; Bennett, 2003</xref>). It was my personal objective as an instructor to provide the students a realistic large group experience. Several classes throughout the same business school used single task small groups of 2 to 5 members, making this large group experience a unique and additive component to the overall education of the students. Third, although very small groups are recommended for shorter periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1052562912451738">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1999</xref>), the Kudos Challenge was designed as a long-term group that incorporates several tasks. Increasing the group size will increase the diversity of perspectives and the range of skills needed for a variety of activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1052562912451738">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, in this case, the group size selected fit well with course objectives, provided a large team experience, and fit well with the Challenge tasks. If needed, the members of a large group could easily reconfigure during a class session, such as dividing into two to three subgroups. Each instructor can customize the group size in the Kudos Challenge by considering variables, such as the optimal number of individuals for completing the assigned tasks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1052562912451738">
<title>Ensuring equal groups</title>
<p>Because the Challenge is based on an accumulation of <italic>Kudos</italic> and several of the <italic>Kudos</italic> opportunities are based on individual contributions, it is critical that each group has the same number of members. However, it is rare that an instructor will have a course in which the exact number of students desired will sign up for and then remain in the course to allow for equal groups. For example, in the present case, one class section included 29 enrolled students and the instructor wanted to limit the group size to 10. The result was three groups of nine members with two students remaining. Faced with this scenario, it is important to maintain perceptions of fairness and equity among the groups. Allowing uneven groups would result in a competitive advantage based on group size. In this case, for several tasks, it is beneficial to have a larger group (e.g., a Jeopardy game) or to have additional members to complete the work (e.g., the GROOP assignment). For other aspects of the Challenge, larger groups could be at a disadvantage. For example, the potential <italic>Kudos</italic> maximum deduction for attendance increases for larger groups. Thus, rather than exclude students completely from the Kudos Challenge or allow uneven group sizes, all students are offered a chance to be part of an “Elite Group.” The members of the Elite Group are not part of the larger team experience but instead receive automatic bonus points and an elevated status as administrators rather than participants of the Challenge. The Elite Group members are offered a unique group experience and fill administrative roles, such as judges or time keepers, while providing assistance to the instructor throughout the Kudos Challenge. Students voluntarily sign up to be part of a lottery to select Elite Group members, ensuring that those students who want to experience the Challenge as a participant are not forced to be part of the Elite Group. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1052562912451738">Appendix B</xref> includes information about the roles that Elite Group members played in this case.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1052562912451738">
<title>Determining group members</title>
<p>It is recommended that instructors avoid assigning groups during the initial stage of the class due to an increased probability of students dropping or adding the class during that timeframe. Research has suggested that changes in group membership during an intergroup competition can upset productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1052562912451738">Baer, Rh, Leenders, Oldham, &amp; Vadera, 2010</xref>). Thus, waiting until the number of students in the class stabilizes will avoid changes in group membership. Instructors should inquire about administrative rules regarding the deadlines for dropping a course. In this case, the Kudos Challenge was not implemented until halfway through the semester (Session 16 of 31).</p>
<p>Each student participating in the Kudos Challenge is assigned to a group by the instructor to simulate business practices, as most employees are not allowed to choose who will be in their work group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1052562912451738">Chapman, Meuter, Toy, &amp; Wright, 2006</xref>). Also, assigning the group members is done to ensure heterogeneity, which is seen as beneficial to group performance norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1052562912451738">Jacobs, Power, &amp; Inn, 2002</xref>). As recommended, achievement level, ethnicity, and gender are factors to consider when assigning groups.</p>
<p>In this example, after Exam 1, the scores were used as a proxy for ability. Since future exam scores would be converted into <italic>Kudos</italic>, it was important to structure the groups to have similar ability distributions. Class participation in the course was also reviewed for the same reason. Each group consisted of high, moderate, and low performers with regard to the exam scores and class participation. This mix of ability in groups has been shown to be beneficial for both top performers and low performers, as high-ability students have the opportunity to assist low-ability students, benefiting each group in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1052562912451738">Lou et al., 1996</xref>). Furthermore, students with a history of absenteeism were dispersed across the groups. Given that <italic>Kudos</italic> would be deducted for this behavior, it was important to ensure equity with this aspect of the Challenge. After the initial group formation based on ability level, modifications can be made to create groups with a similar composition based on demographic variables.</p>
<p>Once the group members are announced and the members gather together, the group members are instructed to take some time for introductions and then select a group name to be used throughout the Challenge. These steps begin the process of positive interdependence by highlighting the boundaries between groups and creating distinct group identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1052562912451738">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>). Group members are instructed to sit together for the remainder of the course.</p>
<p>Each instructor should carefully consider the elements within his/her customized Kudos Challenge and assign group members with these factors in mind. For example, if the Kudos Challenge includes awarding <italic>Kudos</italic> for presentation ability or writing skills, previous student performance on these elements should be considered when assigning group members to prevent creating a group that has a perceived unfair advantage.</p>

<title>Evidence of Effectiveness</title>
<p>In the present example, the implementation of the Challenge midway through the semester created a nonrandomized, pretest–posttest control group, quasi-experimental research design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1052562912451738">Horn, Snyder, Coverdale, Louie, &amp; Roberts, 2009</xref>). Evidence of the effectiveness for the Kudos Challenge is first demonstrated by comparing exam scores, participation, and attendance before and after the introduction of the Kudos Challenge. Student reactions to the Kudos Challenge, voluntary contributions to the course, and student evaluations for the course that included the Kudos Challenge are provided. In addition, the results from the Kudos Challenge (<italic>Kudos classes</italic>) were tested against results from classes held in a previous semester that did not take part in the Kudos Challenge (<italic>Comparison classes</italic>). The inclusion of the data from the Comparison classes provides a baseline for the course components when the Kudos Challenge was not implemented. Providing the information from the Comparison classes eliminates some alternate attributions for the improvements noted in the Kudos classes. The Comparison classes were characterized by the same instructor, the same course elements, and the same course syllabus. The defining characteristic in the Kudos classes was the addition of the Kudos Challenge and minor modifications to adapt the cooperative learning activities from the Comparison classes into <italic>Kudos</italic> activities. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1052562912451738">Appendix B</xref> includes information about the differences between the Kudos classes and the Comparison classes.</p>
<p>The Kudos classes included two sections of an Organizational Behavior course with a total of 54 students. In the Kudos classes, 87% of the students were seniors and 13% were juniors. With regard to demographics, 50% of were male and 1.9% were classified as International. The Comparison classes included 63 students split into two sections of the same Organizational Behavior course. In the Comparison classes, 90.3% of the students were seniors and 9.7% were juniors. With regard to demographics, 66.7% were male and 1.6% were International. All variables were tested to detect differences between the Kudos and the Comparison classes, yet none were significant.</p>
<sec id="section19-1052562912451738">
<title>Exam Results</title>
<p>The exam scores were analyzed to determine significant differences within the groups over time using paired sample <italic>t</italic> tests, as well as significant differences across the groups using independent sample <italic>t</italic> tests. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1052562912451738">Table 1</xref> provides a summary of the results. In the Kudos classes, the average exam score increased significantly from Exam 1 to Exam 2, then significantly decreased from Exam 2 to the comprehensive Final Exam. As expected, the pattern of results suggests an increased motivation when individual scores on Exam 2 were associated with <italic>Kudos</italic> earned for the group. In the Comparison classes, the average Exam 1 and 2 scores were not significantly different, yet the comprehensive Final scores were significantly lower than the previous exams.</p>

<p>To gain a better understanding of the differences between the Kudos classes and Comparison classes, the average exam scores from the Kudos classes were tested against the Comparison classes. Despite significantly lower scores on Exam 1 for the Kudos classes, the average Exam 2 score for Kudos classes was higher than in the Comparison classes. Furthermore, the scores for the Kudos classes on the Final Exam were significantly higher than the scores for the Comparison classes.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, the results provide support for adding the Kudos Challenge to the course. Despite the lower scores on Exam 1 in the Kudos classes, the Exam 2 scores for this group rose dramatically and were actually higher than the scores in the Comparison classes, yet there was no significant change in scores for the Comparison classes from Exam 1 to Exam 2. Furthermore, the average score on the Final Exam was significantly higher for the Kudos classes when compared with the Comparison group. The trend shows increased motivation in the Kudos classes on Exam 2 when the individual scores were associated with the group goal and higher scores on the comprehensive Final Exam for the Kudos classes signal increased knowledge retention of the material.</p>
<p>To better understand which students benefited the most from the Kudos Challenge, the students were categorized by performance level based on the scores achieved on the first exam. Following precedence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1052562912451738">Williams, Carroll, &amp; Hautau, 2005</xref>), students falling in the bottom and top quartiles were classified as Low and High Performers, respectively, with the remaining students classified as Medium Performers. This procedure was carried out for the Kudos classes and the Comparison classes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1052562912451738">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1052562912451738">2</xref> provide visual representations of the exam scores for the course by each “achievement group.” The results echo previous research that has found that cooperative learning experiences can be beneficial for students at all ability levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1052562912451738">Lou et al., 1996</xref>). In the Kudos classes, the students in each achievement group increased their scores from Exam 1 to Exam 2, yet when faced with the comprehensive Final, the exam scores did not taper off as much as those in the Comparison classes. In the Comparison classes, students in each achievement group showed a downward trend with the exam scores over time.</p>

<title>Class Participation</title>
<p>In this case, “class participation” was defined as the percentage of sessions in which an individual contributes to the class discussion. As an individual course component, the highest level of participation was considered voluntarily participating in at least 50% of the class discussions and resulted in 90 course points. The lowest level of participation was considered voluntarily participating in less than 20% of the class discussions and combined with regular attendance resulted in 30 course points. During the class discussion, each contribution from a student was tracked. This component was analyzed to test for significant differences within the groups over time using paired sample <italic>t</italic> tests, as well as significant differences across the groups using independent sample <italic>t</italic> tests. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1052562912451738">Table 2</xref> provides a summary of the results. For the Kudos classes, class participation is examined before and after the implementation of the Kudos Challenge. In the Comparison classes, a designated split was made at the same point for purposes of comparison. The results show that class participation did not significantly change over time in the Kudos classes, yet the variance for this element decreased after the implementation of the Kudos Challenge. In the Comparison classes, class participation decreased significantly over time whereas the variance of this element within the group increased. Comparing the Kudos classes with the Comparison classes with regard to class participation showed that the groups operated similarly in the first portion of the course, yet class participation was significantly higher in the Kudos classes after the implementation of the Kudos Challenge, and the variance was significantly lower for this element in the Kudos classes than in the Comparison classes.</p>

<p>A different look at the impact of the Challenge on class participation comes from assessing the number of individuals who remained virtually silent throughout the course until the Kudos Challenge was implemented. In the syllabus, the lowest level of class participation was designated as participating in less than 20% of the available class discussions. Prior to the Kudos Challenge, 14.8% of the students in the Kudos classes were at the lowest level of class participation, yet only one student finished the course at this lowest level. In the Comparison classes, almost 8% of the students were classified at the lowest level during the first portion of the course. Unfortunately, this percentage only increased to 11.1%, and seven students finished the course at the lowest level of participation, essentially failing this component of the course.</p>
<p>Although it is difficult to capture the impact of the Kudos Challenge on the level of participation among the students, I can attest that pleading attempts to encourage those who were reluctant to participate were no longer necessary in the Kudos classes as they had been in the Comparison classes. In the Kudos classes, the instructor witnessed active participants coaching those who were less confident, as well as the celebrations from the group after a less active participant successfully led a discussion or provided insight during a class discussion. These are all evidence of promotive interaction within the groups.</p>

<sec id="section22-1052562912451738">
<title>Absenteeism</title>
<p>Quantitative data were collected regarding absenteeism to examine the impact that the Kudos Challenge had on this undesirable behavior. An incident of absenteeism was considered to be any absence from a class session. Prior to the Kudos Challenge, 31 incidents of absenteeism were documented, with 0% of the sessions had perfect attendance. These incidents persisted despite a course policy that mandated 5 points be deducted from a student’s grade for each class session that was not attended. The implementation of the Kudos Challenge meant that in addition to the individual point deduction, 20 <italic>Kudos</italic> would be deducted from a group’s accumulated total for each absent group member per session. The number of incidents committed for the remainder of the course was 15. To test the significance of this difference, the data set was transformed using a base 10 logarithm transformation to overcome the violations of normality associated with absenteeism data that is truncated at zero and skewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562912451738">Gaudine &amp; Saks, 2001</xref>). Following these guidelines, the transformation was computed by taking the log of one plus the total classes missed, given that the log of zero is undefined. The results indicated that the decrease in the absenteeism rates for the first and second portions of the Kudos classes was significant, <italic>t</italic>(53) = 4.52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Directly following the implementation of the Kudos Challenge, perfect attendance was recorded for five straight sessions. Absenteeism rates did increase in the Kudos classes during the final sessions, due in part to an H1N1 outbreak at the university. Ten of the 15 incidents of absenteeism occurred during the last two sessions of the course.</p>
<p>In the Comparison classes, there were 31 absenteeism incidents during the first portion of the course and 19 incidents occurring during the second portion of the course. The difference was not significant. Looking at the differences between the Kudos classes and the Comparison classes, the groups were not significantly different with regard to the absenteeism rates during the first portion of the class, <italic>t</italic>(115) = −.20, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, nor the second portion of the class, <italic>t</italic>(113) = .56, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05. However, excluding the absenteeism incidents from the final two class sessions for both groups (to accommodate the outbreak of illness at the university) does indicate that the Kudos classes had significantly lower absenteeism rates, <italic>t</italic>(113) = 2.41, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.01, during the second portion of the course.</p>

<title>Survey Feedback</title>
<p>In this case, students were given a survey to provide feedback regarding the course. The timing of the survey was Session 24 of 31. In the Kudos classes, an additional item was included to gather feedback regarding perceptions of group members. Students were asked to rate their level of satisfaction with group members on a scale from 1 to 7 (<italic>Very dissatisfied</italic> to <italic>Very satisfied</italic>). On average, the students rated their satisfaction with group members at 6.29, with 100% rating at a 5 or more (meaning all were at least “Somewhat Satisfied”). In addition, when asked “What do you enjoy most about this class?” students in the Kudos classes responded with comments such as “The competitiveness of the Large Kudos teams,” “I like the group work, it makes things easier to remember and makes it more interesting,” and “Team competition is fun. I am very surprised at how the teams are taking everything serious, especially for a handful of extra credit.” Students did not highlight any negative aspects of the Challenge when asked to make recommendations for improving the class.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-1052562912451738">
<title>Instructor Outcomes</title>
<p>Student evaluations are often a key outcome for instructors when determining the success of an application. In this case, student evaluations of overall effectiveness of the instructor (rated on a scale from 1 to 4) increased from an average of 3.27 in the Comparison classes to 3.34 in the Kudos classes. Although this increase is not statistically significant, the trend is in the desired direction. In addition, there were several other positive outcomes. First, the students in a Kudos class presented me with a gift during the final class session, as a “Thank You” for the effort put forth during the Kudos Challenge (the first such occurrence in 5 years of teaching this course). Second, when graduating students were asked to provide names of instructors who have positively influenced their experience at the university, after the implementation of the Kudos Challenge, multiple students listed my name with the information provided in a letter from the President of the University. Finally, after several professors and administrators heard about the Kudos Challenge from students, I was presented with the “Faculty Innovations in Teaching Award” with reference to the Kudos Challenge.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section29-1052562912451738">
<title>Additional Considerations</title>
<p>Although the Kudos Challenge can be a valuable addition to student learning, the results could be limited if instructors are not cognizant of a few additional issues.</p>
<sec id="section30-1052562912451738">
<title>An Incentive to Cheat</title>
<p>Because students in the Kudos Challenge recognize that the individual exam scores of their group members will affect the group’s performance, poor performing group members have an incentive to attempt to enhance their scores by cheating during the exam and fellow group members have an incentive to oblige. To combat this issue, I did not allow group members to sit next to one another during exams. By rearranging the students, individuals were seated next to “the competition” and had an incentive to guard their exams from the wandering eyes of the enemy. Prior to creating a customized Kudos Challenge, instructors should consider how the Kudos opportunities might impact motivation to engage in academic dishonesty.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-1052562912451738">
<title>Group Processing</title>
<p>The element of group processing has been deemed beneficial to cooperative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562912451738">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2009</xref>). The Kudos Challenge should include whole group and individual feedback regarding performance, as advocated by previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1052562912451738">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1998</xref>). The longevity of the groups participating in the Kudos Challenge allows more group processing and adheres to recommendations from researchers in the field to “maximize team longevity” in order to allow the groups to develop over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1052562912451738">Bacon et al., 1999</xref>). It is recommended that instructors allow time for this processing to occur to enhance the Kudos Challenge experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-1052562912451738">
<title>Debriefing the Experience</title>
<p>The Kudos Challenge is designed to provide the students with ample opportunities to enhance their team skills and actually experience several of the processes outlined in their textbook. An important part of exercises such as this is to include a <italic>debriefing</italic>—a process by which the learner will draw from their experience to understand how to apply the information beyond a classroom setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562912451738">Dennehy, Sims, &amp; Collins, 1998</xref>). The debriefing process should take the learner from this specific application to one where they consider how these topics/concepts will operate outside the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562912451738">Dennehy et al., 1998</xref>). In this course, after announcing the winners of the Kudos Challenge competition, the session incorporates a discussion of what the group members experienced and the relevancy of the experience to their future workplace. The inclusion of the debriefing session is encouraged for those that implement the Kudos Challenge, as it will provide all the elements necessary for comprehensive learning.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section33-1052562912451738">
<title>Limitations</title>
<sec id="section34-1052562912451738">
<title>Striving to Maintain Student Privacy</title>
<p>The Kudos Challenge provides a sense of individual accountability by converting several of the individual contributions toward the course into <italic>Kudos</italic> for the group. Despite these efforts, individual accountability can be limited because of concerns for student privacy. In this example, the university policies prohibit publically revealing individual grades in an effort to abide by the guidelines of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Allowing the grades of any individual student to be identified would be considered a violation of this Act. Because of this restriction, it was not possible during the Kudos Challenge to provide the groups with the exam scores of each individual member. First seen as a limitation, revealing individual exam scores to the group could have negatively affected the results of the Challenge, by severely increasing test anxiety for individuals that already suffer from this affliction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section35-1052562912451738">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>When testing the effectiveness of the Kudos Challenge, it is critical that any group used as a comparison include all of the same key course components, the same instructor, same exams, same textbook, and same course syllabus. Allowing variations within any of these elements could introduce confounding variables that would limit the attribution of the results to the introduction of the Kudos Challenge. Although the course used within this example has been taught by the same instructor for a number of years, the continuous course development has limited the sample presented in this study. Yet, despite the limited sample size, the results revealed several significant results. In this case, the only way to bolster the sample size would be to eliminate all course development for several years and remove the Kudos Challenge for a particular set of students. Given the continued benefits of the experience for the students and instructor, this is not seen as a viable option for the course.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section36-1052562912451738">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The implementation of the Kudos Challenge was done with the objective of providing business students with a sophisticated, large group application that incorporated the elements of cooperative learning and competition. Numerous forms of evidence have been provided in this article to suggest that this technique can be effective. Not only were the Kudos classes achieving far beyond the students from a previous semester, but within the Kudos classes, performance was significantly enhanced following the introduction of the Kudos Challenge for both sections of the course. Significant improvements were found in the Kudos classes with regard to exam scores, class participation, and absenteeism. Furthermore, students in the Kudos classes volunteered to fill leadership roles and completed an amazing amount of work that went beyond the required components for the course. The results from the Challenge also continue beyond the objective evidence, as these measures cannot paint a picture of the celebrations that the group members engaged in after receiving the maximum number of <italic>Kudos</italic> on an activity, nor convey the gratifying moments that took place, such as a group rallying around an international student who was struggling with participation because of the language barrier.</p>
<p>Although it is impossible to claim that the Kudos Challenge will be successful for every instructor, the flexibility of the technique will allow for customization to a specific course. The evidence presented in this article at the very least provides evidence that adding a competitive element to a course does not ultimately have to lead to detrimental outcomes. If the guidelines provided by previous researchers regarding a cooperative learning and constructive competition are abided by, the overall experience can be beneficial for all of the parties involved. As instructors work to incorporate an experience similar to the Kudos Challenge, I would strongly recommend that the guidelines presented in previous research and reviewed in this article are closely adhered to.</p>
