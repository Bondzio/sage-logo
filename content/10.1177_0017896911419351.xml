<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The United Kingdom (UK) is experiencing high rates of overweight and obesity (O&amp;O), and rates are expected to rise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911419351">1</xref></sup> In particular, the prevalence of childhood obesity is increasing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911419351">1</xref></sup> Obesity may result in many chronic diseases which lead to increased health care costs, morbidity and mortality. In high-income countries O&amp;O rates are in general higher among adults from lower socio-economic groups,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896911419351">2</xref></sup> and members of black and minority ethnic (BME) groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896911419351">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911419351">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Strategies for the promotion of healthy childhood lifestyles that prevent O&amp;O must recognize the centrality of families. If parents do not recognize childhood O&amp;O, or do not consider it a problem, they are unlikely to attempt remedial action. A number of studies have shown that many parents in a wide variety of countries and cultures do not recognize their children’s overweight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896911419351">5</xref></sup> Indeed, parents may be more concerned about underweight than overweight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911419351">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recent data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911419351">7</xref></sup> suggest that both ethnicity and deprivation are associated with an increased risk of childhood obesity. However, evidence of such links is complex and contradictory. The Health Survey for England conducted in 2004<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911419351">8</xref></sup> found that Bangladeshis were generally less likely to be overweight or obese than the general population. Saxena et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896911419351">3</xref></sup> found that male Bangladeshi children and young adults in England had significantly reduced risks of being overweight, but this was not true for females. An East London survey of adolescents found no such reduction for male adolescents, though girls were considerably less likely to be overweight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911419351">4</xref></sup> Other evidence suggests that, in general, Bangladeshis in London have a poor diet and take less exercise than the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911419351">9</xref></sup> One reason for the mixed picture may be that the Bangladeshi community in London, like others in the UK, is ‘not homogeneous and is developing all the time’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911419351">10</xref>, p. 343</sup></p>
<p>Such a mixed picture at least discourages simplistic assumptions about monolithic BME communities and about the role of cultural and religious practices in explaining differences between BME groups and majority populations. Such assumptions may give rise to stereotyping.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911419351">11</xref></sup> Members of such communities may well show variety in their views and habits. Berry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911419351">12</xref></sup> proposed a model of acculturation which sees individual identities as ‘traditional’, ‘isolated or marginalized’, ‘assimilated’ and ‘integrated or bi-cultural’, a model which assumes a variety of attitudes, knowledge and behaviours. Health care professionals tend to over-rely on explanations of health issues among BME groups that assume cultural homogeneity. For example, Abbott and Riga<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896911419351">13</xref></sup> found that health care professionals used language and culture as a simple explanation of health care access issues experienced by the East London Bangladeshi community without acknowledging differences such as time spent in high-income countries or preferences for traditional or westernized lifestyles. These professionals were also apparently unaware that such problems were typical of all deprived groups regardless of ethnicity. Bangladeshis form the poorest ethnic minority in the UK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911419351">14</xref></sup> and are therefore likely to share problems with other socio-economically deprived groups. Indeed, it has been argued that poverty is a more powerful determinant of their health status than ethnicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911419351">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>This paper uses data from a small study in a Bangladeshi community to consider whether assumptions about culturally-determined attitudes and behaviour patterns are evidence-based, with reference to maternal views and perceptions of childhood O&amp;O.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0017896911419351" sec-type="methods">
<title>Aims and methods</title>
<p>The study was designed to explore the perceptions and beliefs of Bangladeshi mothers in East London about their children’s weight and about childhood O&amp;O. It was a mixed methods study. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were carried out with mothers of children aged between 2 and 12. Their children were measured and weighed, in order to assess body mass index (BMI; a standard measure of weight status), and to compare these data with maternal perceptions of their children’s weight status. The age range was chosen for two reasons: to include children who could be measured and weighed; and to maintain a focus on children whose lives are primarily family-focused, prior to the increasing autonomy and peer influence that comes with adolescence.</p>
<p>Potential participants were identified from the patient lists of the general practice where the researcher (SC) worked as a General Practitioner (GP), in discussion with other members of the primary health care team, and a letter was sent explaining the study. Potential participants were telephoned two weeks later by a Bengali-speaking health advocate, and a suitable interview date and time was set with those who agreed. The children were given separate appointment times to have their height and weight checked (by SC); their weight status was recorded using standard BMI scales.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911419351">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Interviews were held in a meeting room at the surgery, lasted between 30 and 60 minutes, and were audio taped. The researcher speaks Bengali and understands Sylheti (an unwritten variant of Bengali widely used in East London; Sylheti speakers understand Bengali). Field notes were also taken.</p>
<p>Interviews were conducted based on a topic guide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0017896911419351">Figure 1</xref>). Thematic analysis was carried out using the framework approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896911419351">17</xref></sup> In particular, the analysis was used to explore an assumption that is implied in any study that focuses on a particular ethnic group: the assumption that one or more aspects of ethnicity, culture and/or religion determine health-related attitudes and behaviour. Ethical approval for this study was granted by Redbridge and Waltham Forest Research Ethics Committee.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>No attempt was made to achieve a purposive sample that would reflect different identities such as those proposed by Berry;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911419351">12</xref></sup> such information is not available from patient records in general practice. However, as it happened, the participants showed a range of knowledge and skill in the English language; this is an important though limited aspect of acculturation. This enabled us to look at whether knowledge of, attitudes to and beliefs about childhood O&amp;O vary in accordance with English language skills (ELS). ELS were classified as very limited (VL); limited (L); and fluent (or fairly fluent; F). These classifications were based on mother’s own accounts of their skills. The abbreviations are used as the first part of respondent codes: VL1-4; L5-10; F11-14.</p>
<p>Three sets of data are presented here. First, we present data on the actual and perceived weight status of children. We then look in more detail at how mothers assess weight status when looking at their own and other children. Last, we report briefly their views on the causes of O&amp;O. We discuss each set of data with reference to the varying ELS of the mothers interviewed.</p>
<sec id="section10-0017896911419351">
<title>Judging O&amp;O in children</title>
<p>The 14 mothers had 28 children within the chosen age range; of these, 22 were weighed and measured and their BMIs were calculated. Five children were of normal weight, and this was assessed accurately by their four mothers. Eight children were overweight, and this was seen accurately by mothers in four cases and inaccurately (as normal) in a further four. Nine children were obese: this was assessed accurately in no cases; the children were assessed as normal in three cases and as overweight in six (five mothers). Of eight mothers with one measured child, five accurately assessed their weight status, and three assessed wrongly. Three mothers with two measured children each assessed both wrongly. Three mothers with two or more measured children made both accurate and inaccurate assessments.</p>
<p>In this very small sample, the weight status of older children was more likely to be accurately assessed than that of younger children, though there were no differences relating to the child’s gender. L5 expressed concern that her daughter (normal weight) was too thin; while VL2 was worried that her son (normal weight) was overweight. There is no apparent relationship between the accuracy of perception and mothers’ ELS.</p>
<p>Many of the interviews included discussions by mothers of how they reached judgements about the weight status of their own child/ren, and of children in general. None mentioned measuring or weighing. The most frequently-cited criteria (mothers VL3, L6, L7, L9, F13, F14) was the degree to which children were energetic, or at least able to undertake normal levels of activity. This was seen as a more important basis for judging weight status than the child’s appearance:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Would you think a chubby child is overweight?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>F14:</speaker>
<p>Not always. If they are not active then yeah . . .</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>If they are chubby and they are active?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>F14:</speaker>
<p>Then I will think they are OK.</p>
</speech>
<p>Several mothers (VL1, VL4, L5, L8, L9) indicated that thinness in a child would suggest to them reduced health:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>L5:</speaker>
<p>If you see them [thin children] you will think they do not eat anything . . . They will be thin and not healthy and they need to see the doctor.</p>
</speech>
<p>However, normal activity levels would modify such a judgement:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>L7:</speaker>
<p>If they are doing all the things, playing, studying then even if they are thin they are healthy.</p>
</speech>
<p>Just two (L7 and F12) articulated an association between slimness and health. Some of the mothers did value ‘chubbiness’ in children, and did not think that in itself it gives grounds for concern.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>VL4:</speaker>
<p>All my children were chubby when they were younger. Especially my youngest son [5, overweight, seen as normal] . . . if they are chubby when they are younger they look nice.</p>
</speech>
<p>In this small sample, therefore, those fluent in English were less likely to worry about childhood underweight than others, but they were similar to the others in using activity as the main way to assess childhood health and weight status, and in the levels of accuracy in making assessments of their own children. Mothers were aware that exercise could limit O&amp;O, and this was broadly similar across the sample, irrespective of ELS.</p>
<p>When asked what sorts of food were likely to encourage O&amp;O, all mentioned fatty or oily foods, and most mentioned sugar and sweets, fast food, crisps and fried chicken. Those with more ELS mentioned more of these foods than those with fewer, or mentioned them more confidently. Misunderstandings were more common among those with fewer ELS (e.g. VL4 was more worried about the effects on weight of meat in general than of crisps).</p>
<p>The range of views expressed by our sample in relation to diet, exercise and how they assessed their children’s weight is characteristic of the views of mothers in general, regardless of ethnicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896911419351">18</xref></sup> No data specific to this community emerged, although the value placed on chubbiness does appear to be a characteristic of low-income ethnic minority parents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911419351">19</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Strategies for the promotion of healthy lifestyles do of course need to be customized to reflect the particular needs of BME groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896911419351">20</xref></sup> Nevertheless, our data show that broad health promotion messages about diet and exercise did seem to have been conveyed to Bangladeshi mothers in this study, regardless of ELS. This finding is supported by another recent study in the same community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896911419351">21</xref></sup> Mothers did not mention local health promotion initiatives as sources of this information; they mentioned family members (including children receiving dietary advice at school), and the media – even VL3, with very limited ELS, reported that she had understood such messages on television. Both common sense and research suggest that literacy and poorer health knowledge are linked at a group level,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0017896911419351">22</xref></sup> but our data suggest that this assumption cannot be taken for granted at individual level.</p>
<p>The relationships between exercise and O&amp;O identified by the mothers were two-fold. First, they recognized that lack of exercise increases the risks of O&amp;O. Second, they used activity levels as an indicator of whether weight status was a health problem. Both these views have been identified in other research. Johnson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896911419351">23</xref></sup> found a clear recognition among all ethnic minorities of the link between exercise and health, and a lack of exercise and overweight, Bangladeshis not noticeably less so than others.</p>
<p>This small study confirms the importance of the question raised by Hawthorne et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911419351">10</xref></sup>, who suggest that the Bangladeshi community they studied was more similar to the majority population than might have been expected. Knowledge and awareness of health-promotion messages should not be assumed to be high in majority populations. An extensive research literature suggests that people in general grasp the ‘headlines’ without understanding the detail, like our respondents. One study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896911419351">24</xref></sup> found that a nationally-representative UK sample were poor at recognizing foods containing fibre, though they recognized that fat and sugar were unhealthy. Poorer populations were less likely to have a grasp of nutritional detail.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896911419351">24</xref></sup> Others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0017896911419351">25</xref></sup> found that even health professionals had a poor grasp of such detail. Furthermore, Chalmovitz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0017896911419351">26</xref></sup> found that physicians, though more accurate than parents and children, were wrong in their estimation of children’s weight status in a third of cases (tending, like parents and children, to under-estimate).</p>
<p>It is true that Johnson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896911419351">23</xref></sup> found that South Asian populations in particular were less likely to understand dietary terms such as starchy food, dietary fibre and saturated fat. However, their data are now rather old (mid-1990s), and immigrant communities change: Hawthorne et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911419351">10</xref></sup> emphasize that the Bangladeshi community they studied is not only heterogeneous, but also in a state of flux. Such inter-generational changes have important implications for health promotion: Johnson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896911419351">23</xref></sup> found higher levels of awareness among young people, many of whom are by now parents or grand-parents. Research findings from some time ago may thus be unhelpful in supporting health promotion initiatives. For example, Abbott et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0017896911419351">27</xref></sup> found that earlier evidence of strong/weak as a key category in how Bangladeshis think about food had lost its salience less than 10 years later. More generally, significant improvements in general health in second generation compared with first generation Bangladeshis have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0017896911419351">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>The message for health educators is therefore that assumptions about knowledge and understanding based on ethnicity cannot be relied upon: individual assessments of knowledge and beliefs are required.<sup>41</sup> This is particularly important because mothers are in any case likely to have less than complete trust in information about healthy eating,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0017896911419351">29</xref></sup> and/or to misjudge the degree to which their children’s diets are healthy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896911419351">18</xref></sup> Individual assessments are also required of perceived barriers to healthy diets, as these are multilayered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0017896911419351">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our study had a number of limitations. First, it was small-scale, and its findings need to be tested in larger studies. Second, though it was possible to make objective measures of height and weight, other factors such as activity levels were not measured, limiting the ability to check maternal perceptions of activity with the reality. Third, our proxy measure for acculturation was crude. Fourth, one might expect that being interviewed by one’s own GP would make mothers more inclined to give ‘right answers’. In fact, they appeared quite willing to articulate their often reluctant tolerance of their children eating junk food.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these data support the need for health care professionals working with this community to recognize just how much it has in common with other low-income groups, and how the degree of acculturation does not predict in any simple way attitudes and knowledge about childhood O&amp;O. Though differences <italic>between</italic> communities tend to be emphasized, an awareness of within-community differences may be more useful in encouraging those engaged in health promotion to find out what BME individuals know, believe and do.</p>
