The studies examined premature, low birth weight infants (n = 6) and children with heart disease (n = 1) or intestinal failure (n = 1). The strength of evidence was consistently low or very low across all lipid emulsion comparisons and outcomes. In young children, n-3FA emulsions resulted in improvement in some biochemical outcomes of intestinal failure–associated liver disease but no difference in mortality. Few studies examined patient-important outcomes, such as length of hospital and intensive care stay; need for transplantation, growth, and cognitive development; or the long-term effects and potential harms associated with these therapies. <italic>Conclusions</italic>: Currently, there is a lack of sufficient high-quality data to support the use of parenteral n-3FA lipid emulsions in children.

<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>There is increasing interest in using parenteral lipid emulsions inclusive of ω-3 fatty acids in a variety of pediatric conditions, in particular intestinal failure, critical illness, and for premature infants. This review demonstrates that few high quality pediatric clinical trials have been conducted to date to support this practice. In particular, with the exception of improving biochemical measures of liver disease in infants with intestinal failure, there is limited evidence that use of parenteral lipid emulsions inclusive of ω-3 fatty acids improves important clinical outcomes. Most importantly, this review identifies a need for clinical trials to be conducted, given the potential benefits and widespread uses despite the absence of trials. This particularly applies to intestinal failure and for premature infants, given the need for ω-3 fatty acids in development. Such studies should be combined with long term follow-up of neurocognitive outcomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Parenteral lipid emulsions inclusive of ω-3 fatty acids (n-3FAs) are of increasing interest as potential pharmaconutrition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112450300">1</xref></sup> The long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) contained in lipid emulsions are readily incorporated into cellular and tissue phospholipid membranes, where they are involved in lipid metabolism, cell signaling, production of eicosanoids, inflammation, blood vessel tone, platelet aggregation, and immune modulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112450300">1</xref></sup> Replacing dietary ω-6 fatty acids (n-6FAs) with n-3FAs, as in fish oil lipid emulsions, has potential for immune modulation by competitively reducing the circulation of proinflammatory eicosanoids and leukotrienes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112450300">2</xref></sup> The growing evidence that n-3FAs have immunomodulatory effects, acting both within the liver and systemically, is creating excitement for parenteral use for multiple indications in which inflammation is integral to pathogenesis and outcome.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this more apparent than in the use of fish oil lipid emulsions in pediatric intestinal failure–associated liver disease (IFALD). In North America, we currently have access to n-6FA-predominant, or soy-based, lipid emulsions, such as Intralipid (Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany), implicated in the pathogenesis of IFALD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112450300">3</xref></sup> Other lipid emulsions are composed of a mixture of soy-based and other lipid sources, such as safflower oil (Liposyn II; Hospira, Lake Forest, IL) or olive oil (eg, Clinoleic; Baxter, Compton, UK). Life-threatening liver disease occurs in at least 67% of babies with intestinal failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112450300">4</xref></sup> Between 17% and 35% of infants with short bowel syndrome progress to end-stage chronic liver disease necessitating transplantation; historically, many of these infants have died awaiting transplant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112450300">5</xref></sup> As pediatric IFALD has traditionally had an extremely poor prognosis, a fish oil–based lipid emulsion, Omegaven (Fresenius Kabi), has been obtained on a compassionate basis for treatment of IFALD, with dramatic results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112450300">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112450300">7</xref></sup> Given the efficacy reported, there is considerable interest in the potential use of n-3FAs in multiple other clinical situations, where inflammation can worsen disease outcome, such as critical illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112450300">8</xref></sup> However, outside the intestinal failure population, the bulk of studies on the use of parenteral n-3FA lipid emulsions have been undertaken in adults. The other lipid emulsions studied to date, such as SMOFLipid (Fresenius Kabi) and Lipoplus (B. Braun Melsungen, Melsungen, Germany), contain both n-3FAs from fish oil and soy-based n-6FAs, as well as other lipids, such as medium-chain triglycerides and monounsaturated lipid from olive oil.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112450300">9</xref></sup> Although not available in North America, all of these potential n-3FA-containing emulsions are licensed in Europe; the lipid composition of each is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112450300">Table 1</xref>. It is noteworthy that Omegaven, a 10% emulsion, was not intended to be used as a sole lipid source, as it has been on compassionate basis in North America, but rather to supplement n-3FAs. The more recently available emulsions, such as SMOFLipid, are a complete 20% emulsion.</p>

<p>Our objective was to systematically review the potential benefits and harms of n-3FA lipid emulsions in pediatric patients (0–18 years); in particular, we evaluated outcomes related to growth, liver function, fatty acid status, and health outcomes, such as mortality, when available. First, we examined all randomized controlled trials (RCTs), regardless of the indication for which patients received n-3FA parenteral nutrition (PN). Because we expected few trials on this topic, we also included prospective and retrospective cohort studies examining patients with intestinal failure, trauma, critical illness, or postoperative complications.</p>

<sec id="section3-0148607112450300" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We developed and followed an a priori research protocol. Our methods for identifying, selecting, appraising, and synthesizing the evidence are described below.</p>
<sec id="section4-0148607112450300">
<title>Identification and Selection of Studies</title>
<p>Our research librarian searched the following bibliographic databases from their inception to March 2011: Ovid’s MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Ebscohost CINAHL. We used a combination of controlled vocabulary and key words related to n-3FAs and intravenous (IV) delivery. Supplement A provides the MEDLINE search terms, which were adapted for the remaining databases.</p>
<p>We conducted 2 separate searches. In the first search, we applied an RCT filter but did not limit this search to any specific condition. In the second search, we did not apply a study design filter but included search terms related to intestinal disease, critical care, trauma, and postoperative complications. Using this strategy, we could identify trials across all conditions but also broaden our search to include cohort studies for the specific conditions listed above. In both searches, we applied an age filter to restrict the search to children (0–18 years).</p>
<p>In addition, we hand-searched the conference proceedings of the American Society of Nutrition (2008–2010); the American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2008–2010); the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (2007–2010); and the <italic>Journal of Pediatric Surgery</italic> (2008–2010). We also searched online trial registries (World Health Organization, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN, and European Trial Registry) and the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews and included studies to identify additional potentially relevant studies.</p>
<p>We included studies using predefined eligibility criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148607112450300">Table 2</xref>). Two independent reviewers screened titles, keywords, and abstracts. Full publications of studies that were identified as potentially relevant or unclear were assessed by 2 reviewers using a standardized form. Reviewers resolved disagreements by consensus or third-party adjudication.</p>

<title>Quality Assessment and Grading the Body of Evidence</title>
<p>Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of studies and resolved discrepancies through consensus. We evaluated RCTs and nonrandomized controlled trials (NRCTs) using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112450300">10</xref></sup> This tool consists of 7 domains of potential bias (sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of patients and study personnel, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and “other” sources of bias) and a categorization of the overall risk of bias. The overall assessment was based on the responses to individual domains. If one or more of the individual domains had a high risk of bias, we rated the overall score as high risk of bias. We rated the overall risk of bias as low only if all components were assessed as having a low risk of bias. The overall risk of bias was unclear for all other studies.</p>
<p>We assessed the quality of cohort studies using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112450300">11</xref></sup> The scale comprises 7 items that evaluate 3 domains of quality: sample selection, comparability of cohorts, and assessment of outcomes. Each item that is adequately addressed is awarded 1 star, except for the “comparability of cohorts” item, for which a maximum of 2 stars can be given. The overall score is calculated by tallying the stars. We considered a total score of 6–8 stars to indicate high quality, 4 or 5 stars to indicate moderate quality, and 3 or fewer stars to indicate poor quality. The source of funding was recorded for all studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112450300">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>We did not select a single outcome to be the primary outcome of interest for this review; rather, we focused on outcomes that were available, within the following categories: growth, biochemistry (including liver chemistry and fatty acid status), and health outcomes (eg, mortality and days ventilated). Two reviewers graded the strength of the body of evidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607112450300">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607112450300">14</xref></sup> for each comparison and the following key outcomes: growth, bilirubin, serum albumin, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, and resolution of jaundice. Four domains were assessed: risk of bias (rated low, moderate, or high), consistency (ie, whether the direction and magnitude of the treatment effect were consistent across studies for a given outcome; rated consistent, inconsistent, or unknown), directness (ie, whether studies assessed patient-important outcomes for the populations and comparisons in which we are interested; rated direct or indirect), and precision (rated precise or imprecise).</p>
<p>On the basis of the individual domains, we assigned an overall strength of evidence grade of high, moderate, low, or very low. To determine the overall strength of evidence score, we first considered the risk of bias domain. RCTs with a low risk of bias were initially considered to have a “high” strength of evidence, whereas RCTs with high risk of bias and well-conducted cohort studies received an initial grade of “moderate” strength of evidence. Low-quality cohort studies received an initial grade of “low” strength of evidence. The strength of evidence was then upgraded or downgraded depending on the assessments of that body of evidence on the consistency, directness, and precision domains. When the evidence did not permit estimation of an effect, we rated the strength of evidence as “very low.” When no studies were available for an outcome, we indicated “no evidence.”</p>

<sec id="section6-0148607112450300">
<title>Data Extraction and Analysis</title>
<p>One reviewer extracted data using a standardized form, and a second reviewer verified the data for accuracy and completeness. We extracted study and patient characteristics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, interventions, and outcomes. We reported outcomes only if quantitative data were reported or could be derived from graphs. Reviewers resolved discrepancies by consensus or in consultation with a third party.</p>
<p>We summarized study findings qualitatively and pooled study results in a meta-analysis using random effects models when the study designs, populations, interventions, and outcomes were sufficiently similar. We calculated weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes using the inverse variance method and relative risks for dichotomous outcomes using the Mantel-Haenszel method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607112450300">15</xref></sup> For all estimates, we computed the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We quantified statistical heterogeneity using the <italic>I</italic>-squared (<italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup>) statistic.

One study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112450300">7</xref></sup> compared Omegaven with Intralipid, whereas a second study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112450300">16</xref></sup> compared Omegaven with patients receiving either Intralipid or Liposyn. Notably, in both of these studies, patients in the n-3FA group received a reduced dose of lipid emulsion compared with the n-6FA group (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148607112450300">Table 3</xref>), which presents a potential confounder to the results. In the remaining study, patients receiving a combination of Omegaven and Clinoleic were compared with patients receiving Clinoleic alone; the dosing regimen was the same across the groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607112450300">19</xref></sup> The studies had high quality (median, 8 of a possible 8 points).</p>
<p>Bilirubin levels significantly decreased in patients treated with Omegaven compared with n-6FA lipid emulsions in a meta-analysis of 2 studies (MD, −11.88; 95% CI, −12.81 to −10.96; <italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0148607112450300">Figure 4</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112450300">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112450300">16</xref></sup> No difference was found in the rate of liver transplantation (relative risk [RR], 0.21; 95% CI, 0.04–1.13; <italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112450300">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112450300">16</xref></sup> or mortality (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.23–1.22; <italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112450300">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112450300">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607112450300">19</xref></sup> Two studies examined hypertriglyceridemia and found no events in either treatment group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112450300">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607112450300">19</xref></sup> Data on triglycerides, cholestasis reversal, time to cholestasis reversal, and days on PN could not be pooled due to high statistical heterogeneity; the results were discordant across studies.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite the availability of n-3FA lipid emulsions in Europe since the 1990s and considerable interest in their use to prevent complications associated with PN, especially in high-risk populations, few trials have been conducted in children. Much of the available data are limited to the intestinal failure or preterm infant population. This contrasts with the number of available trials in adult populations, across many disease states, but particularly the critically ill.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607112450300">23</xref></sup> Following on from successes reported in using Omegaven to treat IFALD in pediatrics, this treatment is now also being reported in adults with IFALD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148607112450300">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>This systematic review identified only 8 unique studies comparing the effectiveness and safety of n-3FA lipid emulsion with n-6FA lipid emulsions in children. Although we conducted broad, comprehensive literature searches for a variety of pediatric conditions in which inflammation can worsen disease outcome, including intestinal failure, trauma, critical illness, or postoperative complications, nearly all of the studies focused on premature, low birth weight infants (n = 6). All the studies varied considerably with regard to the dosing regimens of the lipid emulsions, duration of administration, and duration of follow-up (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148607112450300">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>In general, the studies were small, with sample sizes ranging from 28–91 (median, 46). For many of the lipid emulsion comparisons, there was no evidence available for the key outcomes we identified a priori. When one or more studies provided data on these key outcomes, the strength of evidence was consistently low, or very low, across all comparisons and outcomes. Low strength of evidence grades was driven by risk of bias of individual studies, a lack of direct evidence for the outcomes of interest, and imprecision in the estimate of the treatment effect.</p>
<p>The 5 RCTs comparing SMOFlipid or Lipoplus with Intralipid had an unclear risk of bias, due primarily to inadequate blinding of participants, study personnel, and outcome assessors. Knowledge of the group assignment may overestimate the treatment effect by affecting patient or healthcare professional behavior (eg, differential administration of other interventions) or may bias assessment of outcomes (prior expectation). Although the studies were described as double-blinded, there was often inadequate information regarding who was blinded and methods used to ensure that blinding was maintained throughout the study period. All of the RCTs were supported by funding from the manufacturer, which may pose a further potential for bias.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112450300">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Currently, the evidence examining Omegaven is limited to 3 prospective observational studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112450300">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112450300">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607112450300">19</xref></sup> Although these 3 cohort studies had high quality, the lack of randomization makes the studies vulnerable to selection bias and lack of comparability between the intervention groups, particularly as all studies used a historical control group. The studies did attempt to control for some known confounding factors (eg, age, birth weight) in the analysis of outcomes.</p>
<p>Two of these studies focused on improvement in IFALD with Omegaven treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112450300">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112450300">16</xref></sup> The etiology of cholestatic liver disease in intestinal failure is multifactorial and not well understood. Both the absence of enteral feeds and the direct components of PN may play a role, and potentially these are more important than inflammation per se.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607112450300">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148607112450300">26</xref></sup> These 2 studies used historical controls and so cannot control for the confounding effects of EN, given both potential recording bias and individual differences in enteral tolerance. It is probable that contemporary multidisciplinary care for intestinal failure will optimize the enteral feeding of high-risk infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148607112450300">27</xref></sup> Importantly, the doses of Omegaven used were also approximately half of the Intralipid doses used in the controls. At the current time, no comparison trial has been published at equivalent doses. Omegaven therapy reduces exposure to phytosterols, as it is free from this contamination. Recent animal data suggest that the contamination of Intralipid with phytosterols may be a major factor for the benefit of dose restriction of soy-based lipid in the prevention of IFALD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148607112450300">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148607112450300"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0148607112450300">29</xref></sup> Similarly, this may be a reason for the benefits observed with Omegaven treatment. Another confounding factor for the research to date is the much higher vitamin E content of Omegaven compared with Intralipid, even when given at a lower dose. It is quite possible that oxidative stress plays a role in IFALD, and as an antioxidant, vitamin E could be protective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0148607112450300">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0148607112450300">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>The studies in this review rarely reported important clinical outcomes, such as growth or duration of hospitalization. As the link between laboratory values and health outcomes has not been consistently established, surrogate outcomes provide only weak indirect evidence supporting the effectiveness of n-3FAs. This can be highlighted by considering the benefit of Omegaven for IFALD. Although limited to case series only, recent publications have reported deterioration in histological measures of liver disease and worsening fibrosis, despite improved biochemical measures in infants on this therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0148607112450300">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0148607112450300"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0148607112450300">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, the few studies and small number of patients providing evidence for each lipid comparison resulted in imprecise effect estimates. The wide confidence intervals indicate uncertainty as to the magnitude of the effects of n-3FAs on outcomes compared with standard lipid emulsions and whether benefits of n-3FAs are clinically important. Regardless, although effect size is unclear, the clinical impression of a dramatic benefit of n-3FAs in pediatric IFALD is not at all supported by the current data. Additional RCTs are required to clarify the risks and benefits of the current approaches using n-3FAs in pediatric IFALD. In the absence of a large benefit in the trials done to date, there is no ethical justification to restrict further trials; in fact, the opposite is true, as more high-quality data are required to justify current treatments (on a compassionate basis) in North America.</p>
<p>A pediatric population that may well benefit from the routine use of n-3FA lipid emulsions is the premature human, born prior to third-trimester intrauterine transfer of essential fatty acids across the placenta. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112450300">Table 1</xref>, Intralipid is an adequate source of linoleic acid (n-6) and α-linolenic acid (n-3) but is devoid of substantial AA (n-6) or any DHA (n-3). Therefore, there is a real concern that the DHA supply in Intralipid is limiting for infant development. We know that providing an optimal supply of DHA and AA by enteral supplementation in preterm infants has been of benefit to visual acuity and cognitive development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0148607112450300">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0148607112450300">36</xref></sup> Therefore, it seems intuitive that supplementing PN, the very first nutrition tolerated and often required for a prolonged duration, especially for an extremely low birth weight preterm population, makes sense. This review confirms that a potential exists for improving essential fatty acid status (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0148607112450300">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0148607112450300">3a</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0148607112450300">b</xref>) and hence clinical outcomes (specifically retinopathy of prematurity) with n-3FA lipid emulsions in premature, low birth weight infants. However, as the majority of the studies were undertaken with end points related to safety, further RCTs examining clinical outcomes are needed. This should be a priority for future multicenter trials, particularly as the burden of prematurity is increasing with advances in neonatal intensive care.</p>
<p>Given that recruitment of both IFALD patients and premature infants is difficult (coincidentally, the majority of neonatal intestinal failure occurs as a result of complications of prematurity), researchers must consider conducting multicenter trials to ensure sufficient power to detect a difference between study groups. Future studies should focus on patient-important outcomes, such as length of hospital and intensive care stay, need for transplantation, growth, and cognitive development. These outcomes will not only provide greater clinical relevance but are also less invasive than repeated laboratory testing in these vulnerable patients. There is an urgent need for studies that assess the long-term effects of lipid emulsions on neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p>
<p>Our review highlights a paucity of evidence comparing n-3FA vs n-6FA lipid emulsions in children requiring PN for a variety of indications, including trauma, critical illnesses, or postoperatively. Use of n-3FA lipid emulsions in these conditions has been studied in adult populations. A meta-analysis of 14 selected trials published in 2007, comparing IV lipid emulsions used to modulate inflammation (including n-3FAs) to standard n-6FA predominant emulsions, concluded no evidence was found for an immunological benefit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607112450300">23</xref></sup> Furthermore, insufficient evidence was found to support a benefit in length of stay or mortality. Although the studies included were extremely heterogeneous, a criticism also of our approach, failure to identify a negative impact of n-6FAs, on immunologic or clinical outcomes in a large pooled sample, is noteworthy. This is the opposite of clinical expectation or belief that is certainly driving current clinical practices. This issue alone needs to be clarified.</p>
<p>This review has several limitations, in addition to the clinical heterogeneity mentioned above. Although we conducted comprehensive searches of bibliographic databases and hand-searched conference proceedings, trial registries, and references lists, we excluded studies published in languages other than English, French, and German due to limited translation resources. This may have introduced publication bias; however, this is of less concern because few significant differences were found. In addition, we assessed the methodological quality of studies based on the methods that were reported in the publications. Some studies may have been adequately conducted, but the methods were poorly reported.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Currently, there is a lack of sufficient high-quality data to support the use of parenteral n-3FA lipid emulsions in children. The best available evidence at this time supports the use of n-3FA supplementation to improve biochemical outcomes of IFALD in young children dependent on PN. Data also suggest there may be potential benefit to preterm infants in supplementing n-3FAs, improving essential fatty acid status, although long-term health benefits remain unproven. There is very limited evidence to justify n-3FA supplementation to reduce inflammation in pediatric patients on PN, in the absence of further clinical trials. It must be emphasized that this is particularly the case as the potential harms from such therapies have also been inadequately studied to date.</p>
