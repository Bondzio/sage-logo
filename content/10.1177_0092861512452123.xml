            <p>Regulatory authorities in the US and EU recommend that pharmaceutical companies employ data monitoring committees (DMCs) to protect the safety of patients taking part in large randomized trials involving diseases with high morbidity or mortality and have provided guidance as to how such committees should be used. This article, whose authors have considerable experience in DMC membership, reviews the applicability of guidance to sponsors after 5 years and suggests that regulatory support for DMC members would be valuable. Advice is offered to members, often very experienced clinicians but inexperienced in pharmaceutical data review, as to how standard DMC data packages should be reviewed, which aspects of trial validity should be addressed, and how communication with the trial sponsor should be handled. It is suggested that DMCs could be supported by regulatory authorities in managing ethical and legal dilemmas to make DMC membership less exposed and more inviting.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>In recent years, data monitoring committees (DMCs) have increasingly been used by pharmaceutical companies to protect the safety of patients taking part in large, multicenter randomized trials involving diseases with high morbidity or mortality, not least due to regulatory guidance that this should be done. The use of independent DMCs allows the relative safety and efficacy of treatment arms to be compared at intervals during the trial, in an unblinded fashion, by experienced individuals not involved in the day-to-day running of the trial. This ensures that patients in one arm of a trial are not at a significant disadvantage while enabling the sponsor to remain blind to the unfolding treatment-specific data. The DMCs are also charged with monitoring the quality and validity of the trial because to subject patients to investigational and often toxic treatment is unethical if the trial’s original aims cannot be met.</p>
         <p>After criticism in the early 2000s that DMCs could be subject to untoward influence by commercial trial sponsors, regulatory agencies in Europe and the US issued guidance documents in 2005 and 2006,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512452123">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512452123">2</xref>
            </sup> which recommend how DMCs should be used and operated. The role of the DMC in assessing the balance of risk to benefit in a trial involving sick and dying patients on the basis of accumulating data is a tricky one, requiring careful judgment. Senior physicians who have previously been trial investigators may well be asked to be DMC members for their area of therapeutic expertise. In this situation, there is no source of advice as to which data they should monitor and how they should review them, make decisions, and interact with trial sponsors. DeMets et al<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861512452123">3</xref>
            </sup> detailed the serious responsibility and personal liability borne by DMC members, suggesting that governments and sponsors should address the issue of indemnity so that a larger bank of experienced individuals would be willing to become DMC members, but these issues have yet to be addressed. We have considerable personal experience in DMC membership, much of it in oncology, which we use here to review the effectiveness of international regulatory guidance for sponsors but also to propose new guidance for DMC members.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section2-0092861512452123">
         <title>Assessment of the Relevance of FDA and CHMP Guidance Documents for Sponsors After 5 Years</title>
         <p>While the US FDA’s Guidance for Clinical Trial Sponsors is considerably more detailed and discursive than the corresponding Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) Guideline on Data Monitoring Committees in Europe, the premises and content are very similar. The topics covered include determining when a DMC is needed, DMC composition and operation, interaction with other bodies, responsibilities and recommendations, independence from the sponsor, regulatory reporting of DMC recommendations (FDA), and statistical implications of interim analyses (CHMP). Both documents are remarkably relevant 5 years on, having been based on lengthy consultation and research. Were the guidance documents to be updated, we would suggest the following topics for discussion and review.</p>
         <p>While there has to be a first time for anyone to be a DMC member, it is especially important that the chairperson has prior experience so that he or she is familiar with operational procedures, ways of interacting with the sponsor to avoid unblinding, and means to reach consensus. It is also desirable that the chairperson is a clinical expert in the field concerned so that he or she can guide discussion and then communicate accurately and appropriately to the sponsor. For example, clinical trials in oncology have methodologies and a language of their own, which the chairperson must speak. It is also desirable for the DMC statistician to have direct experience in trials involving monitoring by a DMC for safety and efficacy, so that he or she can advise the committee on analytical technicalities.</p>
         <p>The FDA guidance document suggests that representatives of the trial sponsor and investigators may in some circumstances be present in the DMC session when unblinded data are discussed to explain to DMC members how information is collected and analyzed. We strongly suggest that this should not be the case for a blinded trial because such individuals could find it difficult to avoid communicating results to colleagues within their company. The independent statistician can clarify on aspects of data processing. We also recommend that a physician with experience in drug safety work within the pharmaceutical industry is a useful DMC member to guide colleagues through the technicalities of data collection, the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding, interpretation of safety data, and the regulatory implications of any recommendations the DMC might make. Where a DMC is constituted for an open trial, for example in phase II, one could argue that that there is no need to keep accumulating data from the sponsor. Still, it is important, in terms of independence, for the DMC to be able to hold a frank discussion of trial issues without the sponsor being present when the committee’s findings and emerging recommendations may be unfavorable for the sponsor.</p>
         <p>At the time the regulatory guidance documents were written, it was a relatively recent suggestion that an independent statistician, rather than the trial statistician, should prepare data for DMC review.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861512452123">4</xref>
            </sup> This has now become common practice and presents no practical problems. We feel that this should become a firm recommendation, again to avoid unblinding the trial statistician and exposing that individual to pressures in the corporate environment. We would also recommend that the independent statistician should be responsible for taking minutes of the open and closed meeting sessions of the DMC and for archiving committee documents; this is a model that, from our experience, works well. The guidance currently assigns this responsibility to the chairperson, but it is difficult to chair a meeting while taking minutes and can be impractical for a practicing clinician to archive records to Good Clinical Practice standards.</p>
         <p>A further issue regarding independence of the DMC relates to consideration of external data from other trials involving the same drug. The guidance suggests that if the DMC for one trial becomes aware of the results of a parallel trial, this may adversely affect the independence of its decision making. While we would agree that unfavorable efficacy results in one population should not affect decisions relating to trial continuation in another, we suggest that adverse safety findings in one trial (or from any other source) should be brought to the attention of the DMC for any other trials with that drug so that it can make a specific review for the presence or absence of a similar problem in the population for which it is responsible. Indeed, we support the concept of a single DMC covering a series of trials with the same drug so that it may accumulate experience with the safety profile of that product, although this does increase the workload.</p>
         <p>The guidance suggests that the DMC should be constituted before the trial starts, but this is often not achieved. It is particularly important in the case of trials with interim analyses and formal statistical stopping rules that the DMC has agreed that the techniques and boundaries proposed for its use before the final protocol are approved. Not to follow such stopping rules once results of the interim analysis are available could destroy the validity of the trial.</p>
         <p>In our experience, there are some misunderstandings with regard to FDA guidance documents on review of aggregate and coded data. Aggregate (pooled) data may be reviewed with the sponsor in an open session, but this should be restricted to recruitment status, geographical patterns of enrollment, and protocol violations (reflecting data quality) to reduce the risk of unblinding. The FDA points out that “even aggregate data on safety and efficacy may be informative.” <sup>2(½4.2.2, p11)</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The second point concerns whether the DMC should review coded data (data analyzed by treatment arm where the DMC is not told the code break) or completely unblinded data. The FDA clearly recommends that unblinded data should be reviewed by the DMC, and we endorse that view. We have witnessed cases in which a DMC could have assumed, incorrectly, that the coded treatment arm with a worse safety profile was the investigational drug or that the arm with worse efficacy was the placebo control. These false assumptions could affect recommendations as to trial continuation.</p>
         <p>A practical difficulty arises with the FDA’s recommendation that the DMC’s responsibility to monitor the trial continues until the planned completion of follow-up. The targeted cancer therapies that have been developed in recent years tend to be continued until disease progression, and follow-up for survival continues until death, which can be for years after the end of treatment. Since it is not practical to ask members to serve for many years, our recommendation would be that the DMC should continue to meet to review safety data while patients are still on treatment and until any planned interim analyses for efficacy. After that time and during follow-up, the DMC should be consulted by the sponsor if any change to the protocol or analysis is proposed that might affect trial validity but otherwise need not meet.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section3-0092861512452123">
         <title>Guidance for DMC Members</title>
         <p>Although sponsors are effectively obliged by regulatory recommendations to constitute a DMC for certain common types of trials, they have difficulty in identifying suitably experienced DMC members partly because they want instead to use renowned experts as investigators and partly because those individuals are too busy to dedicate enough time to reviewing data and attending meetings. Being a DMC member can be an invidious position, even if it is a paid role. Publications on the topic of DMCs contain heavy criticism of those that are considered to have allowed trials to continue with risk to patient safety, sometimes due to perceived personal gain, counterbalanced by criticism of those that are said to have recommended too soon that studies be halted for futility or efficacy when later analyses, with clean data, showed results to have changed. Although regulatory guidance makes it clear that the final responsibility for trials lies firmly with the sponsor and investigators, this sometimes seems to be forgotten.</p>
         <p>We propose that the regulatory authorities which recommend DMC use can help potential members by offering guidance and a degree of protection. Practicing clinicians, not surprisingly, often find it difficult to know how to evaluate large volumes of data for DMC interim analyses of safety or efficacy and which data to focus on. They may meet a number of dilemmas in this role that do not feature in their clinical practice. We make some suggestions to DMC members on these topics, below, which could be included in regulatory guidance.</p>
         <sec id="section4-0092861512452123">
            <title>Examination of Data by the DMC</title>
            <p>In the closed session, the DMC will review unblinded data from both the clinical database, derived from data entered into case report forms (CRFs), and a separate serious adverse event (SAE) database. Tables and listings based on the clinical database are usually 6 to 8 weeks out of date due to the time required to process the clinical data and then produce the tables and listings. The SAE database output is more current because investigators are required to report SAEs within 24 hours, and preprogrammed reports can usually be produced immediately, for example, 1 week prior to the DMC meeting. Discrepancies between the clinical and safety database outputs are, thus, inevitable. The data will not be fully “clean” (ie, monitored, checked for errors, queried, and corrected) at the time of analysis, which may result in inconsistencies between tables produced from the clinical database.</p>
            <p>
               <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092861512452123">Table 1</xref> presents a typical list of the tables that will be produced from the clinical database. This constitutes a substantial volume of data. Detailed review requires time and patience and should be done in advance of the meeting. The tables listed under “Trial Conduct” should be presented for the treatment groups combined and can be discussed in the open session with the sponsor. In the remaining tables, available only to the DMC and discussed in the closed meeting, treatment groups can be identified by labels (arm A, arm B, etc). The independent statistician will supply decodes for these labels to the DMC members when the tables are distributed.</p>

            <p>Tables showing demography and baseline characteristics provide a description of the population of patients being recruited and allow the subsequent safety data to be placed into context. They also allow an evaluation of the balance that is being achieved across the treatment groups and randomization strata. If imbalances do occur, there is little the DMC can do to correct them (that will be down to the statistical analysis once the trial is complete), but they may help explain any treatment differences seen.</p>
            <p>Efficacy tables should usually only be produced at the time of formal interim analyses for efficacy or futility. The DMCs should resist the temptation to ask for primary endpoint data at each safety review to avoid what might be seen by regulatory authorities as multiple, unplanned interim analyses. It is important that DMC members are reminded by the DMC statistician of the preplanned stopping rules set down for interim efficacy analyses because it is vital for trial validity that a recommendation for stopping the trial is only made if these criteria are met. If a boundary for efficacy has only just been crossed, it is critical to assess how clean and current the data are before making a recommendation to stop the trial. In one example, we recall a boundary set for overall duration of survival had just been crossed, but concerns about inconsistency between dates of deaths recorded in the CRFs and the automatic randomization system (IVRS) led the committee to recommend continuation of the trial to completion. A full set of demographic and safety tables should be produced in conjunction with an interim analysis for efficacy so that the risk/benefit ratio may be assessed fully.</p>
            <p>For most meetings, it will be the safety tables from the clinical database plus the output from the SAE database that provide the main focus. Adverse events will be coded and summarized using MedDRA, which is an international coding system for medical terms. Data management staff must use medical judgment to code verbatim terms recorded by investigators for adverse events and SAEs. MedDRA is not perfect, and the same medical event may be coded differently depending on the verbatim term used by the investigator. The DMC members need to be aware of this when reviewing adverse event tables and to know where similar terms representing the same symptom or disease process may be classified. Having a drug safety expert, familiar with the use of MedDRA, on the DMC can help considerably in the interpretation of these tables.</p>
            <p>It is likely that more adverse events will be seen on active treatment than on placebo control since most effective drug treatments have side effects. In the high-morbidity and -mortality disease conditions for which DMCs are constituted, skill is required to focus upon events that are potentially critical to the continuation of the trial. For example, in studies of duration of survival in patients with advanced tumors, the focus should be on fatal or life-threatening events and those that can result in serious morbidity. Generally speaking, it is not customary or desirable to produce <italic>P</italic> values for the difference between treatment arms in the incidence of specific adverse events unless there are safety issues that are associated with a prespecified hypothesis test. If multiple <italic>P</italic> values are provided for individual MedDRA codes, many significant <italic>P</italic> values will simply be false positives as a result of multiple testing, and conversely, nonsignificant <italic>P</italic> values may hide a difference that could be important clinically.</p>
            <p>The “Dose Administration” table is also of interest to ensure that side effects do not prevent the patients from receiving the planned trial treatments. In many oncology trials, the investigational drug (or placebo) is added to a standard combination treatment. If the investigational arm receives less of the standard treatment combination as a result of adverse events caused by the investigational drug, this would be a cause for concern in terms of antitumor efficacy.</p>
            <p>While tables are undoubtedly the best way to present data in a complete form, graphs can be very useful for rapid detection of differences between treatment arms. Plots displaying the most frequent adverse events with measures of relative risk and boxplots or scatterplots for laboratory data (eg, for liver function tests) can be especially useful.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512452123">5</xref>
               </sup> Any judgment as to whether an adverse event is treatment related is inevitably subjective and subject to bias, affected by the contents of investigator brochures or product leaflets describing the side effects of the drug in question. Regulatory authorities generally disregard such subjective assessments of a causal relationship when assessing the safety profile of a drug from aggregate data. The best way to determine whether a particular event is related to the investigational treatment is to compare the incidence of that event between treatment arms. The value of any tables of “treatment-related” events is, therefore, limited.</p>
            <p>Listings of clinical data used to produce tables are important to the DMC only when it is necessary to look at individual cases of special safety interest. Individual data need otherwise not be reviewed. Similarly, individual SAE reports will generally be available in the closed meetings, but it is the aggregate data that should be the main focus for review, as this gives the overview that the DMC requires to make decisions. It is not generally useful for individual SAE reports to be sent to DMC members between meetings, except in cases of special safety interest, but interim summaries of aggregate SAE data may be necessary between DMC meetings for close monitoring of crucial safety issues. There should ideally be an identified individual involved with drug safety within the sponsor company who can be contacted by the DMC, without unblinding the trial management team, when more information is needed on individual SAEs or perhaps on the occurrence of particular events in the broader clinical program.</p>

         <title>DMC Dilemmas</title>
         <p>The primary responsibilities of the DMC, described in regulatory guidance documents, are to protect patient safety and trial validity, but there are limits as to how far the DMC should get involved in the practical conduct of the trial. Sponsor staff and contract research organizations are under commercial pressure to complete trials as quickly as possible, but if many sites are involved to achieve a very rapid enrollment rate, the number of patients enrolled per center will be small, it may be difficult to control data quality, patient safety may be compromised because each investigator has little experience in using the drug, and the DMC may be unable to examine safety data within a time frame that would allow it to take measures to protect patients. In this case, the DMC may be justified in recommending that the sponsor reduces the number of trial sites.</p>
         <p>Similarly, oncology trial sponsors have found in recent years that recruitment can be rapid in certain Eastern European countries because trial participation may allow patients access to treatments that they could not otherwise afford. Although data quality may be good, subgroup analysis has shown that survival and safety results from these countries can be different to those in major markets because the patients entering the trial may be sicker at the time of diagnosis, have less access to supportive treatment, and be more willing to tolerate discomfort for the sake of treatment. If the DMC sees that enrollment in such countries is dominating, it should consider recommending a recruitment cap to maintain the trial’s external validity. It would be preferable, however, for regulatory authorities to take these actions when granting approval for the trial.</p>
         <p>Furthermore, if, having performed a blinded re-evaluation of the assumptions, such as endpoint variability or event rate, underlying the original calculation, the sponsor decides to increase the sample size when the DMC review of unblinded data suggests that there are safety concerns, the DMC may need to intervene. Conversely, if patient enrollment is so slow that the trial seems unlikely ever to reach its endpoint, the DMC may recommend that it is unethical to continue recruiting patients and subject them to trial procedures.</p>
         <p>In the current regulatory environment, with regular declaration of personal and financial interests, it seems unlikely that DMC members would be under the influence of commercial sponsors. On the contrary, in our experience, members take very seriously their responsibility to patients and to maintaining the scientific integrity of the trial. It is almost inevitable, however, that if the DMC finds an issue with trial data, its recommendations to the sponsor will cause difficulty and be contrary to commercial goals. The representatives of the sponsor with whom the DMC interacts may be heavily involved as “champions” of the project and will probably be under considerable pressure from within their own corporation to bring the product to market without delay. If the DMC makes a recommendation that a trial should be stopped, recruitment halted, or the protocol amended due to overwhelming safety concerns (eg, higher overall death rate in the investigational arm than the control arm), it should expect the sponsor to require very good justification and thorough documentation (in meeting minutes) of the results reviewed, discussions, and reasoning. A way needs to be found to describe the justification to the sponsor without breaking the trial blind in the first instance. This may involve dealing with more senior individuals within the company who are not directly involved in trial conduct. The DMC needs to be aware of the practical and regulatory implications of any recommendations it may make.</p>
         <p>If not all DMC members agree that action is required, they could schedule an early re-examination of data in, say, 3 months to check that any finding was not a false positive and to determine whether a worsening trend exists. The DMC may also find that additional analyses, supplementary to the standard data package, are necessary to inform decision making and may request these from the independent statistician. In doing this, the committee should again take care not to unblind the sponsor team by describing the nature of the analyses required. It is ideal if the independent statistician has preapproval from the sponsor for funding to provide whatever analyses the DMC requires, within its remit and within reason.</p>
         <p>According to regulatory guidance, the DMC makes recommendations to the sponsor, which the latter may or may not decide to follow. The FDA only requires that DMC recommendations relating to SAEs are reported to them in an expedited fashion but suggests that other DMC safety concerns should also be reported. The European guidance makes no such recommendation but requires minutes of DMC open and closed sessions to be supplied if an application for marketing authorization is made. When trial results are negative, however, it is unlikely that such an application will be made, and DMC minutes will remain confidential. Contracts between the sponsor and the DMC generally require that members do not divulge the results of their deliberations and specifically that they do not communicate regarding the trial to regulatory authorities unless they are required to do so. Difficulty may arise if the DMC comes to the decision that a trial should be stopped or amended in some way to protect patients but the sponsor does not agree and does not divulge the DMC’s opinion to investigators or regulators. As the FDA states, the existence of a DMC that meets regularly to review unblinded results creates a perception that the trial is sufficiently safe for patients, but this may not be the DMC’s opinion. Currently, the only option open to a DMC if it cannot agree with the sponsor is to resign, but this is clearly not constructive. If the regulators were to make it a requirement that any safety concerns of the DMC should be reported to them on an expedited basis, the responsibility for proof of lack of risk to patients would, appropriately, lie with the sponsor, and the regulators would be in a position to take action with regard to the trial, if they felt it appropriate.</p>
         <p>It may be difficult for the DMC to decide what constitutes unacceptable toxicity in a trial with an overall survival endpoint, when insufficient data have yet been gathered to assess efficacy. One possible definition is that sufficient fatal SAEs have occurred that the death rate is increased in the investigational arm relative to the control arm, despite any efficacy the drug may have. In this case, it is important to remember to take account of any differences in duration of exposure to the trial treatments in the investigational and control arms, especially when considering adverse events with a known background incidence in the population concerned, such as thromboembolic events in oncology patients. The next question would then be how much higher the death rate in the investigational arm must be to instigate action by the DMC and whether an unplanned test should be applied to check for statistical significance. The DMC should avoid requesting an unplanned interim analysis of the primary endpoint (usually duration of survival) if it can avoid it since this could adversely affect the validity of the trial for regulatory purposes. A further consideration is that while adverse events are often more common at the start of treatment, any differences in survival due to efficacy may develop later in the trial period. If the DMC makes an early recommendation to stop trial treatment due to an unacceptable rate of fatal toxicity with the investigational drug but posttreatment follow-up for survival continues, the survival curves may later converge or indeed cross if the drug is effective, and this can lead to post hoc criticism of the DMC’s decision by various parties.</p>
         <p>At the end of the drug development process, the decision as to whether a product may be licensed for marketing, based on a positive risk/benefit profile, is a subjective one by the regulators concerned. Unfortunately, the decision by the DMC as to whether a trial may continue or not has, likewise, to be made on a subjective basis but with as yet incomplete data and without the backing of a national or international authority. This is clearly a challenging position for the DMC.</p>
         <p>The DMC members could potentially be held legally liable for their recommendations when patients have suffered harm, either by the sponsor or by patient groups. We would advise potential DMC members to be sure that they have adequate professional indemnity insurance in place. The question, for which no answer is available to our knowledge, is what the level of cover should be. We have encountered a situation in which the sponsor offers to purchase indemnity insurance on behalf of DMC members, which is welcome while not affecting their independence. A preferable contractual alternative would be for sponsors to indemnify DMC members against claims by third parties and to guarantee not to make claims against DMC members themselves, except in case of negligence.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Five years on, there are only a few areas that should perhaps be updated in current international regulatory guidance to sponsors on DMCs, but additional guidance could be given to DMC members to support them in a difficult position and thus, perhaps, to swell their ranks. Members will often face difficult decisions and dilemmas, and to be aware of these in advance would be helpful, as would guidance as to how exactly they should carry out their responsibilities to safeguard patients and maintain trial integrity.</p>
         <p>The role of DMCs is quite similar to that of regulatory authorities in evaluating whether preset efficacy boundaries have been met and, subjectively, whether the risk/benefit ratio is favorable, but the DMC does this on the basis of incomplete data, with personal liability and without any recourse if the trial sponsor does not agree with its recommendations when it feels patient safety is at risk. We suggest adding strong recommendations to the regulatory guidance, firstly, that sponsors should indemnify DMC members against legal action by patients and undertake not to take action against the DMC members themselves except in case of negligence and, secondly, that the sponsor has a responsibility to inform regulators on an expedited basis if the DMC makes a safety-related recommendation. This would allow the liability and responsibility that currently lie on DMC members to revert to the sponsor and regulators, who can evaluate DMC concerns and take action if they think fit.</p>
