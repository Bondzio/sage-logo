<abstract>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: Baseball pitchers often have increased anterior glenohumeral (GH) laxity and posterior shoulder tightness due to large forces produced during the throwing motion. As such, many clinicians have hypothesized that a relationship exists between these common characteristics.</p>
<p><bold>Hypothesis</bold>: A negative relationship will exist between anterior GH laxity and the summation of GH adduction range of motion (ROM) and GH internal rotation ROM asymmetry.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design</bold>: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: Anterior GH laxity, GH rotation ROM, and GH horizontal adduction ROM were measured in 58 asymptomatic professional baseball pitchers. Differences in GH internal rotation at 90° of abduction were calculated between both shoulders. A multiple regression analysis was used to determine the strength of the relationships between anterior GH laxity (dependent variable) and GH adduction ROM and GH internal rotation ROM asymmetry (independent variables) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: A large portion of anterior GH laxity was predicted by the summation of GH adduction ROM and GH internal rotation ROM asymmetry (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = .45, <italic>P</italic> = .001). Furthermore, increased anterior GH laxity had a significant relationship with both decreased GH horizontal adduction ROM (<italic>r</italic> = .53, <italic>P</italic> = .001) and differences in GH internal rotation ROM (<italic>r</italic> = .43, <italic>P</italic> = .001).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: The results of this study suggest that decreased GH horizontal adduction and internal rotation ROM may be considered partial predictors for increased anterior GH laxity in the throwing arm of baseball players. Because of the association between these variables, clinicians may find it advantageous to address posterior shoulder tightness during the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of shoulder injuries associated with anterior GH laxity.</p>

<p>Baseball players routinely perform in excess of 100 throws per game or practice and often with little to no rest between sessions. The late cocking and acceleration phases of the throwing motion have been shown to create a tremendous amount of force on the anterior stabilizing structures of the glenohumeral (GH) joint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512437522">8</xref></sup> As such, it is no surprise that such athletes often have anterior GH laxity caused by this repetitive microtrauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512437522">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512437522">18</xref></sup> When this laxity progresses, instability may develop, leading to a variety of shoulder dysfunctions and injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512437522">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512437522">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512437522">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512437522">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Additionally, during the deceleration phase of the throwing motion, the ball has left the hand, and the posterior shoulder soft tissues, acting eccentrically, are responsible for the deceleration of the arm. However, unlike the repetitive trauma to the anterior restraints that can result in increased anterior laxity by stretching of the anterior capsule, the eccentric loads in deceleration can result in thickening and scarring of the posterior soft tissues that can result in posterior shoulder tightness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512437522">23</xref></sup> This tightness may result in decreased GH horizontal adduction and a loss of GH internal rotation range of motion (ROM),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512437522">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512437522">25</xref></sup> which has been theorized to result in various shoulder injuries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512437522">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512437522">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512437522">28</xref></sup> and scapular deviations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512437522">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512437522">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because asymptomatic baseball players may often present with both increased GH anterior laxity and posterior shoulder tightness of the dominant arm, many clinicians have hypothesized about a relationship between these characteristics. However, no data are currently available that detail whether this association truly exists. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if a relationship exists between anterior GH laxity and posterior shoulder tightness, as reflected in GH adduction ROM and GH internal rotation ROM asymmetry. We hypothesized that as posterior shoulder flexibility decreases, anterior GH laxity will increase.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0363546512437522">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>We tested 58 professional baseball pitchers (mean ± standard deviation: age, 22.6 ± 2.6 years; height, 188.7 ± 4.6 cm; mass, 88.2 ± 8.2 kg) during spring training from a single Major League Baseball organization. At the time of testing, all participants reported no recent history (past 2 years) of shoulder or elbow injury or any previous upper extremity surgery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512437522">
<title>Instrumentation</title>
<p>The LigMaster arthrometer (Sport Tech Inc, Charlottesville, Virginia) was used to measure anterior GH laxity. This device uses a modified Telos GA-II/E stress system (Austin &amp; Associates Inc, Fallston, Maryland) and specialized software to calculate a force-response curve, which provides the total amount of soft tissue compression and stiffness of the joint restraints. The software is then capable of calculating the amount of joint displacement (mm). Previous studies have shown the LigMaster to have both excellent within-session (intraclass correlation [ICC], 0.84; standard error of mean [SEM], 0.53 mm) and between-session (ICC, 0.83; SEM, 0.43 mm) reliability when measuring anterior GH laxity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512437522">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Glenohumeral ROM was measured using the Pro 3600 Digital Inclinometer (SPI-Tronic, Garden Grove, California). This device provides a real-time digital reading of all angles in a 360° circle with respect to either a horizontal or vertical reference and is accurate up to 0.1° as reported by the manufacturer. The digital inclinometer was modified with a reference line positioned along the midline of the device, which was used for proper alignment of anatomic landmarks.</p>

<sec id="section4-0363546512437522">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>All participants attended one testing session during their initial physical examination for spring training. Each athlete voluntarily participated after providing informed consent as mandated by the university’s institutional review board. Each participant had anterior GH laxity and horizontal adduction ROM measured on his throwing arm. Glenohumeral internal and external rotational ROMs were measured bilaterally. All tests and reliability measurements were performed by the primary investigator (K.L.).</p>
<p>Anterior GH laxity was measured with the throwing arm in an externally rotated position. For this measurement, each participant was seated with the shoulder in 90° of abduction and 90° of external rotation, while the elbow was in 90° of flexion and full pronation. Then, 12 daN of anterior force was applied to the posterior proximal humerus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512437522">Figure 1</xref>) at a rate of approximately 1 daN/s. Glenohumeral laxity was determined by taking the difference in displacement between the inflection point, which was calculated by the LigMaster software as the end of soft tissue compression and the initiation of humeral head translation, and the final amount of displacement recorded at 12 daN of anterior force.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512437522">6</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>Glenohumeral horizontal adduction ROM was measured with each participant in a supine position with both shoulders flush against a standard examination table. The investigator stood at the end of the examination table toward the head of the participant and positioned the test shoulder and elbow into 90° of abduction and flexion, respectively. The lateral border of the scapula was stabilized by providing a posteriorly directed force (toward the examination table) to limit scapular rotation, tilt, and abduction motions. The investigator’s other hand then grasped the proximal portion of the participant’s forearm, slightly distal to the elbow, and passively moved the humerus into horizontal adduction. At the end range of GH horizontal adduction motion, a second tester was used to record the amount of motion present. To measure GH horizontal adduction, the digital inclinometer was aligned with the ventral midline of the humerus. The angle created by the end position of the humerus with respect to 0° of horizontal adduction (perpendicular plane to the examination table as determined by the digital inclinometer) was measured as the total amount of GH horizontal adduction motion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512437522">17</xref></sup> Therefore, negative values represent an end ROM that was not able to adduct past this perpendicular plane (0° of horizontal adduction/neutral position). Conversely, positive values represent an end ROM that was able to adduct past the neutral position.</p>
<p>A priori reliability of the GH horizontal adduction ROM measurement was assessed among 24 participants. All athletes had no previous injury or surgery and participated in pretesting and posttesting sessions, which were a minimum of 24 hours apart. Our ICC (2,3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512437522">26</xref></sup> and SEM values for measuring GH horizontal adduction ROM were 0.93 and 1.6°, respectively.</p>
<p>Glenohumeral rotation ROM was measured using a digital inclinometer with the participants in a supine position and the shoulder and elbow in 90° of abduction and flexion, respectively. The investigator supported the humerus, by placing a towel under the humerus, to ensure a neutral horizontal position (humerus level with acromion process) and stabilized the scapula against the table to minimize contributory motion from the scapulothoracic joint. The forearm was held by the investigator, who passively internally rotated the humerus until termination of humeral rotation. The digital inclinometer was used to determine the angle between the axis of the ulna and a perpendicular plane to the examination table. This process was then repeated for measurement of GH external rotation ROM. From these 2 measurements, the total arc of motion (sum of maximum GH internal rotation and external rotation ROM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512437522">27</xref></sup> was calculated for each participant.</p>
<p>A priori intratester reliability of the GH rotational measurements that were assessed among 20 shoulders without any previous injury or surgery was measured using an ICC (2,3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512437522">26</xref></sup> formula. Each participant’s GH rotational motion was measured and then reassessed approximately 24 hours later. The ICC and SEM values for GH external and internal rotational ROMs were 0.95 and 3° and 0.98 and 2°, respectively.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study support our hypothesis that a negative relationship exists between anterior GH laxity and combined GH horizontal adduction and internal rotation ROM as well as between each variable independently with GH laxity. Because of the large forces placed on the shoulder during the various phases of the throwing motion, microtrauma often accumulates with this repetitive activity, leading to increased anterior GH laxity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512437522">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512437522">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512437522">15</xref></sup> and posterior shoulder tightness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512437522">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512437522">25</xref></sup> Furthermore, both excessive anterior GH laxity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512437522">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512437522">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512437522">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512437522">29</xref></sup> and posterior shoulder tightness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512437522">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512437522">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512437522">28</xref></sup> have been associated with several shoulder dysfunctions and injuries. Because both of these adaptations can accumulate during repetitive throwing, some clinicians have speculated that a relationship between the two may exist. The current study is the first to detail the strength of this relationship.</p>
<p>Previous research has shown that alterations in GH rotational ROM among throwing athletes may result from both bony and soft tissue adaptations. To differentiate between these adaptations, clinicians have compared the bilateral total arcs of motion (GH external rotation + GH internal rotation) among such athletes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512437522">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512437522">21</xref></sup> These previous investigations have shown that significant differences in the bilateral total arcs of motion indicate the presence of soft tissue adaptations. Conversely, a lack of significant differences in the bilateral total arcs of motion, despite increased external rotation and decreased internal rotation in the dominant shoulder, indicates bony adaptations. More specifically, these bony adaptations have been reported to be the result of increased humeral retroversion. Increased retroversion allows for an increased amount of GH external rotation ROM and an equal amount of decreased GH internal rotation ROM, thereby leaving the total arc of motion relatively unchanged. The participants used in this study showed a significant difference in the bilateral total arc of motions. This result suggests that while undoubtedly some of the shift in the arc of motion is caused by bony adaptations, these alterations in GH rotational ROM among our participants were partially because of soft tissue adaptations.</p>
<p>Grossman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512437522">12</xref></sup> investigated the biomechanical effects of anterior GH laxity and posterior tightness using a cadaveric model. The investigators reported that posterior shoulder tightness resulted in a posterosuperior displacement of the humeral head with respect to the glenoid, thereby increasing the risk of developing a type II superior labrum anterior-to-posterior lesion. Conversely, anterior GH laxity resulted in an inferior shift of the humeral head. On the basis of these results, the authors suggested that throwing athletes with posterior shoulder tightness may develop increased anterior GH laxity as a protective adaptation used to avoid contact between the humeral head, labrum, and rotator cuff during the late cocking phase of the throwing motion. The results of the current study support these previous findings and theories and may provide a partial justification for the strength of the relationship shown between anterior GH laxity and posterior shoulder tightness.</p>
<p>In contrast to the findings of Grossman et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512437522">12</xref></sup> Crawford and Sauers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512437522">6</xref></sup> investigated anterior and posterior GH laxity and stiffness among a group of high school baseball pitchers and found no bilateral differences in either direction. Conversely, Sethi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512437522">22</xref></sup> showed that the mean anteroposterior translation in pitchers’ dominant shoulders was significantly greater than in the nondominant arm, while Borsa et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512437522">3</xref></sup> reported that posterior translation was greater than anterior translation in both shoulders of baseball pitchers. These conflicting findings regarding laxity and stiffness in the baseball players’ shoulders add to the confusion surrounding this topic. However, it is important to note that none of these previous studies showed if a relationship existed between anterior GH laxity and posterior GH tightness.</p>
<p>The posterior displacement of the humeral head among baseball players with posterior shoulder tightness may also result in “pseudolaxity.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512437522">4</xref></sup> As the GH joint externally rotates and the humeral head shifts posteriorly,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512437522">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512437522">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512437522">13</xref></sup> there may be more room for anterior translation before attenuation of the anterior static restraints, giving the appearance of increased anterior laxity. Cadaveric studies have shown that shoulders with posterior tightness have more anterior translation than shoulders without this tightness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512437522">12</xref></sup> The results of the current study support these previous findings and provide the strength of the relationship between these characteristics. Furthermore, because increased posterior displacement of the humeral head has been shown among tight posterior shoulders during increasing shoulder external rotation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512437522">12</xref></sup> clinicians may benefit from measuring anterior GH laxity in a neutrally rotated position. This neutral position may help maintain the humeral head within the center of the glenoid prior to manual anterior translation.</p>
<p>There are several limitations of this study worth mentioning. First, bilateral measurements of laxity were not conducted. Therefore, the direct cause of laxity to the throwing arm cannot be identified. It is conceivable that part of the laxity measured was caused by the accumulation of forces created during the throwing motion. However, some of this laxity could have been congenital as well and will vary among athletes. This omission may provide some explanation of the variance in the relationships reported. Second, this study used only professional baseball pitchers because these athletes are among the most common with posterior shoulder tightness and anterior GH laxity. Therefore, we cannot confirm that similar results would be found in position players, baseball players of varying skill levels, or other overhead athletes. However, because baseball players, regardless of position or level of play, as well as other overhead athletes, such as softball, tennis, and volleyball players, use similar motions, we hypothesize that these athletes would have similar findings. Furthermore, the participants used for this study were all asymptomatic. Patients with the various injuries associated with either excessive anterior GH laxity or posterior shoulder tightness may present with different findings.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results of this study suggest that decreased GH horizontal adduction ROM and alterations in GH internal rotation ROM may be considered partial predictors for increased GH anterior laxity in the throwing arm of baseball players. Because of the association between these variables, clinicians should consider the possibility of concomitant posterior shoulder tightness during clinical examination of baseball players with anterior GH laxity. In the case of concomitant posterior shoulder tightness, the clinician may find it advantageous to address this tightness as part of the prevention and treatment of shoulder injuries associated with GH anterior laxity.</p>
