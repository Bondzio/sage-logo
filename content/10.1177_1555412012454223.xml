<p>
<italic>Mirror’s Edge</italic> (Electronic Arts Digital Illusions CE [EA DICE], 2008), a first-person action adventure/platforming video game scripted by Rhianna Pratchett, attempts to espouse an innovative model of gameplay, simulating <italic>parkour</italic>, or “free running,” while devaluing direct combat. It attempts to circumvent the more problematic and indeed pervasive typologies for female game protagonists. Such a move is notable—albeit also inevitably circumscribed—given its production by Electronic Arts, the Hollywood of the video game industry. The protagonist, Faith, marks an empowered female character that is not hypersexualized, and the decision to employ a first-person perspective (thereby subverting any gaze offered by a third-person view) supports this design objective through gameplay. But despite Faith’s welcome debut on the main stage of commercial gaming, the game raises more difficult and more significant questions through its engagement with the multifarious concept of “fluidity” or “flow,” which is integral to both the gameplay of <italic>Mirror’s Edge </italic>and the themes in it.</p>
<p>Faith is a renegade courier, or “Runner,” and the more momentum and fluidity players attain, the easier it is for them to complete their acrobatic objectives. As Faith herself says in the opening cinematic prologue: “The flow is what keeps us running, what keeps us alive” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555412012454223">EA DICE, 2008</xref>). Even though Faith’s free-running is an overtly physical—and often harrowing—act, “being in the flow” is also very much a cognitive state for both character and player. In fact, fluidity takes on immediate connotations in game studies with the appropriation of Mihaly Csíkszentmihályi’s psychological “flow theory.” At the same time, the concept of <italic>fluidity</italic> has its own highly evocative and, indeed, gendered history in the discourse of literary criticism. Feminist scholars such as Hélène Cixous and Luce Irigaray have theorized fluidity while feminist writers, such as Margaret Atwood, are said to embody it. Writers such as James Joyce have appropriated it and other writers have responded to such appropriations with metafictional flair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1555412012454223">Yuknavitch, 2003</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1555412012454223">1</xref></sup> Women writers and artists working in digital environments have found a new form of feminine fluidity in hypertext and digital textuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1555412012454223">Guyer, 1993</xref>) while others in the field critique such projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555412012454223">Greco, 2009</xref>). Clearly, literary invocations of “fluidity” have contributed to a rich and varied, if contestable, feminine tropology.</p>
<p>But is Faith’s flow essentially or inevitably feminine, or for that matter, feminist? Does the game ultimately avoid, perpetuate, or contest the gendered discourses that it evokes?<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1555412012454223">2</xref>
</sup> What can its simulations of a fictional mind in action tell us about our own? Taking <italic>Mirror’s Edge</italic> as a cue to read “flow” across disciplines and discourses (cognitive, narrative, and feminist among them), I argue that <italic>Mirror’s Edge</italic> ultimately succeeds in mobilizing a form of fluidity that draws productively on the connotative and cross-disciplinary richness of the concept, but at the same time transcends historically fraught and reductive problems of gender and essentialism.</p>
<sec id="section1-1555412012454223">
<title>Rhetorical Confluence</title>
<p>Since his earliest explorations into the “quality of subjective experience that [makes] a behavior intrinsically rewarding” nearly four decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1555412012454223">Csíkszentmihályi, 1988a</xref>, p. 7), Csíkszentmihályi has seen his “flow theory” become psychology’s “leading activity-based theory of happiness” (p. 10)—its popularity resulting both despite and because of its generality and wide applicability. In its earliest iterations, flow theory charted the positive experience associated with a sustained balance between the level of an activity’s challenge and that of a subject’s skill. It aims to identify and describe an optimal psychological state that (reciprocally) informs physiological competence and, as such, is highly relevant to the pleasures of video game play given the heightened attention games demand and the continuous feedback they provide.</p>
<p>Although Csíkszentmihályi and his colleagues did not incorporate video games explicitly in their research,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1555412012454223">3</xref>
</sup> the academic literature of game studies as well as that of its gamer community (from fan forum posts to interviews of game designers) is peppered with references to his model, and it is no surprise that the science—or art—of calibrating challenge with skill has made flow a governing design heuristic for game developers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1555412012454223">Chen, 2007</xref>). Meditations on the topic by theorists studying video games are also many and varied. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1555412012454223">Juul (2005)</xref> systematically maps Csíkszentmihályi’s model on to gameplay while noting the shortfalls and disjunctions such a mapping entails. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1555412012454223">Sweetser and Wyeth (2005)</xref> adopt his model for their own model of “GameFlow” in the service of evaluating enjoyment in gameplay. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1555412012454223">Nacke and Lindley (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1555412012454223">Nacke, Stellmach, and Lindley (2011)</xref> employ psychophysiological measurements of gamers (such as electroencephalography [EEG] experiments) to gain a better understanding of the emotional and cognitive phenomena associated with gameplay—what they call “affective ludology.” Outside of game studies, scholarship linking Csíkszentmihályi’s flow to the experience of (reading/viewing/playing) digital literature and video games appears in several disciplines, from Computer Science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1555412012454223">Cowley, Charles, Black, &amp; Hickey, 2008</xref>) to Communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1555412012454223">Hargadon &amp; Douglas, 2004</xref>). In their discussion of the “Pleasures of Immersion and Interaction,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1555412012454223">Hargadon and Douglas (2004</xref>, n.p.) suggest that our experience of flow “hovers on the continuum between immersion and engagement, drawing on the characteristics of both simultaneously.” Csíkszentmihályi’s flow may similarly straddle N. Katherine Hayles’ often cited distinction of “deep” and “hyper” attentive cognitive modes, sharing both deep attention’s “high tolerance for long focus times” on one hand and hyper attention’s “high level of stimulation” and “low tolerance for boredom” on the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555412012454223">2007</xref>, p. 187).</p>
<p>The itinerant quality of the concept, however, may in fact betray some over-generality of the terminology—if not the details of the theory itself—and the subsequent applications of it.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1555412012454223">4</xref>
</sup> Csíkszentmihályi himself decided to leverage the colloquial phrase “in the flow” after deciding that something like “autotelic experience theory” or “psychic negentropy theory” would not be catchy enough (1988a, p. 8). So, while we can equate “flow” in its nominal form to “optimal experience,” we find the same usage describing not only optimal experience but also all conscious experience, which is to say consciousness itself. Note, for instance, its prominence in both the title and the opening sentence of Kenneth Pope and Jerome Singer’s <italic>The Stream of Consciousness: Scientific Investigations into the Flow of Human Experience</italic>: “The stream of consciousness—that flow of perceptions, purposeful thoughts, fragmentary images, distant recollections, bodily sensations, emotions, plans, wishes, and impossible fantasies—is our experience of life, our own personal life, from its beginning to its end” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1555412012454223">1978</xref>, p. 1). But if the term’s metaphorical generality troubles its technical application, it also endows it with connotative richness; that is, in adjectival form, “fluidity” can describe speech, writing, thought, and even physical movement, as well as the artistic and literary representations of such fluid expression in turn (Pope and Singer’s own introduction begins with a reading of literary renderings of “stream of consciousness” by Virginia Woolf and James Joyce).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1555412012454223">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>To justify what may initially seem to be a methodological leap of faith in tethering a literary or metaphorical understanding of flow with a cognitive and psychological one, some further contextualization is in order. While I by no means intend to conflate the concept across the two domains, I would suggest that we can gain from exploring the relationship between them, which is in fact closer than we might initially allow.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1555412012454223">6</xref>
</sup> First, it is not necessary in practice to differentiate between the terms <italic>flow</italic> and <italic>fluidity</italic> (assigning the former to psychology and the latter to literary narrative, for instance) because flow is, in part, the experience of fluidity in a given activity, in both commonplace and technical understandings. That is, <italic>fluidity</italic> is a descriptor for such an experience that is widely used in psychological and sociological explanations of the concept, and is used as such in the present article. It is also not necessary, following Csíkszentmihályi’s own deployment of the term, to separate physical from psychological forms of flow: specifically, flow does not require physical movement or activity, but physical movement or activity (as in running or tennis) can be the basis for flow. After all, he includes reading novels in a long and diverse list of activities in which subjects report a state of flow; and a parallel line of inquiry in literary studies exists in the form of research on the phenomenon of “immersion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1555412012454223">Murray, 1997</xref>), “absorption” (Bernstein, 1992) or simply being “lost in a book” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555412012454223">Nell, 1988</xref>). Csíkszentmihályi also includes playing games such as chess, and the fact that the state of flow can arise from activities as different as playing sports, playing board games, and reading novels has significant implications for video games, which can draw on all three activities at once in the form of: (virtually) enacting physical objectives; solving puzzles; and processing a narrative and a fictional world (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1555412012454223">Ryan, 2001</xref> for a comprehensive study of immersion and interactivity in light of digital textuality and virtual environments).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the refusal to order flow into an internal/external dichotomy also marks a tacit refusal to adopt a strict Cartesian bias of an internal world inhabited by the mind and external one inhabited by the body. Indeed, flow is not only characterized by a harmonious working of mind and body but also the sense of an extension of those faculties into the surrounding environment: “The climber feels at one with the mountain, the clouds, the rays of the sun, and the tiny bugs moving in and out of the shadow of the fingers holding to the rock; the surgeon feels at one with the movement of the operating team, sharing the beauty and power of a harmonious transpersonal system” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1555412012454223">Csíkszentmihályi, 1988b</xref>, p. 33). The description might sound ethereal; but in fact it resonates with recent understandings in the cognitive sciences of mental functioning as inherently social, extended, and distributed. Significantly, “the flow” is extended, overtly, in <italic>Mirror’s Edge</italic>. Not only is it “what keeps us running, what keeps us alive,” but it is inextricable from the urban environment through which the Runners move: “Runners see the city in a different way. They <italic>see</italic> the flow” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555412012454223">EA DICE, 2008</xref>, <italic>my emphasis</italic>). “The flow” becomes in Faith’s description a quasi-mythical life force that Runners can collectively tap into in order to offset their occupational hazards.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in crossing between the domain of the psychological and the literary, it most certainly is necessary to make a distinction between the experience of flow and aesthetic representations of that experience. In fact, that distinction is vital to the argument that follows, which relies on the interplay between the movements enacted by the player in and through the game and the artistic rendering of the motivations and actions of their player character—or what we might abbreviate as the “how” and “what” of the system. I grant there are problems in appropriating the very notion of flow as a design goal for video games in the first instance. On one hand, considering flow in the same vein as immersion is complicated by the fact that the psychological model does not easily accommodate aesthetic appreciation and interpretation, which may not even qualify as an “activity” that allows for flow; on the other hand, several game scholars have objected to the overemphasis on immersion in gameworlds—what Katie Salen and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1555412012454223">Eric Zimmerman (2003)</xref> have referred to as the “immersive fallacy”—since players do not necessarily or primarily play video games to experience immersion in a fictional world. It is important to stress, however, that I am not invested in the application of the psychological concept of flow to video games, nor am I arguing for or against its place in game studies. Rather, I am responding to its presence, indeed, its pervasiveness, in the industry, the critical discourse, the popular discourse—and, most importantly, in the game under discussion, which itself is nuanced and multiple in its aesthetic treatment of the idea. To borrow the catchphrase of its corporate maker, when it comes to the notion of flow and <italic>Mirror’s Edge</italic>, “it’s in the game”; and, as I will argue, its presence signals the game’s attempt to unify the experience of its thematic network with that of its gameplay.</p>
<p>Of course, the notion of flow and fluidity is not only a powerful literary metaphor—it is also a gendered one. That is, while “fluidity” can mark well-crafted and pleasurable literary output in the main, it can have added significance for feminine characters or symbols, and more generally for an empowered feminist discursive mode. Much of its gendered nature is indebted to the writing of influential post-structuralist theorists such as Luce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1555412012454223">Irigaray (1985)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1555412012454223">Hélène Cixous (1986)</xref>, who sought to invigorate a mode of feminism that privileges fluidity, in excess, as an essential feminine quality—a quality at once biological and mythological. Furthermore, in doing so, they sought to undo the phallocentric bias that portrayed female sexuality (after Freud and Lacan) as lack or absence and redress the damage done by generations of patriarchal bias pervading literary practice and production. Anglo-American feminist scholars were at the same time partaking in a related project of dismantling the “literary paternity” articulated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1555412012454223">Gilbert and Gubar’s (1979)</xref> landmark text. Among a host of other wordplays meant to reach beyond the realm of analogy and into that of actuality, Gilbert and Gubar posit the pen as the ultimate phallus, the source from which all creative literature disseminates, engendering a form of creativity that transcends biology, and thus mortality (1979, pp. 3–44).</p>
<p>“Literary paternity” is bound up in the material conditions that accompany the literary establishment; the concept is inseparable from the culture and the institutions of print. In turn, some writers who recognize the imbrication of cultural practice and materiality are willing to consider the possibility that digital writing technology is somehow more suited to the female writer—that hypertext and digital writing tools are somehow inherently feminine technologies. More specifically, such artists and theorists see that the qualities (stereo)typically employed to characterize print textuality (hierarchical, solid, rational, fixed) on one hand, and those employed to characterize digital textuality (associative, intuitive, changeable, fluid) on the other, could also be mapped on to the (stereo)typical categories of male and female. The result, however, is a hyper/cyber/technofeminism that succeeds only in reversing a form of technological determinism that problematically genders the materials of cultural production in the first place. The same brand of feminism has alienated other critics who choose to embrace their own brand of (post)feminism that does not ultimately rely on some form of essentialism (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1555412012454223">L. Joyce, 1996</xref> and the <italic>writing (post)feminism</italic> collection she introduces in the <italic>electronic book review</italic>). Against Cixous, Elisabeth Sheffield writes:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Clearly Cixous has a blind spot when it comes to the female author’s reduction of woman to what Western thought has always defined as her essence. This is perhaps because Cixous performs a similar move herself in her proposal of an <italic>écriture feminine</italic>. To identify the attributes of this writing—its fluidity, its generosity or abundance, its greater proximity to the body, its “lawlessness”—as feminine and then to promote it as an answer to the question “how do women write?” is to distill womanhood into a few essential traits that fall within the domain of the traditional definition of woman as either mother or matter, or both—as in “Mother Earth.” (1998, p. 22)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Clearly, any critical move that equates media tools with already problematic gender types is misguided. At the same time, given that “flow” is not only desirable but indeed an optimal experiential state, the locus of all autotelic pleasure even, it would be difficult to blame anyone for the appropriation.</p>
<p>Perhaps, the best-known exemplar for female fluidity appears in fiction: Molly Bloom’s interior monologue in the Penelope episode of Joyce’s <italic>Ulysses</italic>. The exercise of a man writing the mind of a woman would, not surprisingly, form an epicenter for polemical discourse on the question of an indelibly male or female writing. The same question recalls Cixous’ forays into deterministic essentialism, and more specifically her idea of <italic>écriture feminine</italic>, a form of women’s writing whereby the writing body is written into the text—although to what extent this is achieved biologically or figuratively can be difficult to disentangle. Either way, Molly’s monologue has polarized critics, who position Joyce as either protofeminist or chauvinist usurper (Cixous herself effectively makes Joyce an honorary member of <italic>écriture feminine</italic>). But what these critics have in common is that, in the words of Derek Attridge, they all “seem to be fixated on one particular metaphor, a metaphor usually signaled by the word ‘flow’”—an observation, he notes, applies to descriptions of Molly’s musings regardless of whether they are by critics “female or male, feminist or patriarchal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555412012454223">Attridge, 1989</xref>, p. 543).</p>

<sec id="section2-1555412012454223">
<title>Faith’s Flow</title>
<p>While Molly’s flow may only deepen the problems inherent to framing fluidity as a gendered attribute outright, her character offers a model with which to further explore the notion of flow in an expressly aesthetic context and in relation to other characters that might be said to embody it. At first glance, the Molly Bloom of <italic>Ulysses</italic> would have very little in common with the Faith Connors of <italic>Mirror’s Edge</italic>. Molly is fleshy, eroticized, and inert; Faith is trim, desexualized, and spring-loaded.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1555412012454223">7</xref>
</sup> Faith spends her day leaping from rooftop to rooftop, clambering up pipes and sliding down cables, all the while evading members of the City Protection Force (CPF); Molly spends her day in bed. Molly is certainly not faithful, unlike both her mythological counterpart, Penelope, and her more contemporary one in <italic>Mirror’s Edge</italic>. Though faithfulness to a lover does not necessarily apply in Faith’s own case (the closest we get to a romance is the mutual fondness between her and Mercury, or “Merc,” the avuncular coordinator of the Runners), she is undoubtedly faithful to her cause: helping her sister Kate, a junior officer in the CPF, escape custody after being framed for the murder of Robert Pope, the city’s progressive mayoral candidate. Even though Faith’s profound athleticism stands in sharp contrast to Molly’s own leaps of consciousness, we can still invoke the concept of flow in both instances to describe the expression of graceful, unencumbered, uninterrupted movement. The fluid representation of movement reflects a stylistic design that inheres in both works, despite one being a novel and the other a video game. The experience of such represented movement, moreover, is crucial to the pleasure of both reader and player. But that is perhaps where the comparison yields, for Faith does more than represent fluidity: she partakes in its simulation.</p>
<p>The critical discourse on “representation” and “simulation” as a theoretical pairing has yet to coalesce and, when it does, it will ideally involve elements of cultural and critical theory along with those of computer science and systems theory in equal measure. Does representation sit on a continuum with simulation, with simulation as simply a more intense form of representation? Is everything ultimately representation, making simulation a subcategory under representation’s all-encompassing umbrella (a perspective that might reflect reactionary or dated attempts to reconcile new modes of aesthetic production in digital and virtual realms)? Or are these two definitively human phenomena categorically different? Lev Manovich has responded to this question by considering the relationship between the subject—more specifically his or her body—and the object: in the tradition of representation, the form (such as a painting or book) exists in a physical location separate from the embodied viewer. By contrast, in the tradition of simulation, “the spectator exists in a single coherent space—the physical space and the virtual space that continues it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1555412012454223">Manovich, 2001</xref>, p. 113). In line with Manovich’s support of a categorical difference, we can find lucid formulations by game studies scholars. Gonzalo Frasca locates the difference in the notion that simulations are rule-based systems that model some form of behavior, whereas representations do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1555412012454223">Frasca, 2001</xref>). Ian Bogost adds to Frasca’s distinction a consideration of the subjective understanding of the source system (that which is modeled) that is gained by the user of the simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1555412012454223">Bogost, 2006</xref>, p. 98). In addition, a further albeit not absolute distinction that arises from a categorical differentiation would be that representations—especially narrative ones—tend to be oriented toward or about the past, while simulations tend to be oriented toward or designed to project possible future scenarios. Nonetheless, as Bogost observes, just like any narrative representation of fictional worlds, “no simulations can escape some ideological context” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1555412012454223">Bogost, 2006</xref>, p. 99).</p>
<p>Video games invested in projecting coherent fictional worlds and in storytelling, then, combine representation and simulation in conveying ideological arguments. It is not only possible but rather inevitable for such games to assume an ideological position just as a novel or an expository work does. But in video games, certain aspects of the argument are revealed and learned only or predominantly through the process of gameplay, as opposed to voiced dialogue in cinematic interludes or voiceovers, or as textual information presented as, say, journals or quest logs accessed through interface menus. Such aspects serve a persuasive rhetorical function and illustrate what Bogost refers to as the game’s “procedural rhetoric” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1555412012454223">Bogost, 2007</xref>) and what Noah Wardrip-Fruin has explored under the term <italic>expressive processing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1555412012454223">Wardrip-Fruin, 2009</xref>). In <italic>Mirror’s Edge</italic>, given that Faith’s flow is situated in a coherent fictional world and circumscribed by a narrative progression, we can identify modes of ideological positioning in the game arising—interdependently—from both the experience of its fictional narrative and directly through its gameplay. Both, furthermore, are informed by Faith’s acrobatically fluid free running.<sup>8</sup>

<p>For example, as a Runner, Faith must deliver data packages in a hyper-hygienic metropolis locked down by a corrupt local government and police force, a surveillant regime exercising draconian control over all information channels. The city itself plays a vital role in the diegetic world and is in one sense the first character introduced by Faith in her opening prologue voiceover: “Once the city used to pulse with energy, dirty and dangerous, but alive and wonderful. Now, it’s something else” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555412012454223">EA DICE, 2008</xref>). In a quasi-Conradian inversion of storyworld symbols, we equate the cleanliness of the shimmering city with filthy corruption; furthermore, the city’s sole criminal element, the Runners, is not associated with any “underground” but rather inhabits its rooftops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1555412012454223">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Although the majority of the game’s plot involves events that transpire after mayoral candidate Pope’s murder, there are overt comments put forth on the nature of totalitarianism and corporate influence that set the stage for the game’s ideological critique. Not only is information tightly controlled, but privately owned security companies provide added muscle to the city’s police force in the form of the heavily armed and heavy-handed Pirandello Kruger Corporation, while the mayor himself is also the CEO of the city’s largest developer, Callaghan City Construction. Players encounter this critique in several ways, from the in-game banter we hear over our (we assume encrypted?) communications wire from Merc (such as his reference to Pope as <italic>someone who could finally make a difference in this place</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555412012454223">[EA DICE, 2008</xref>]), to the dialogue exchanges that occur during the game’s animated, graphic novel-styled cut scenes, which fill in the backstory of Faith’s induction into activism and the tragic death of her mother during “The November”—which was either a peaceful protest or a riot, depending on who you ask. Other cues are more subtle, such as the hyperbolically utopian advertising we see in elevators, subways, and malls promoting clean and safe living in the gated community of “New Eden Estates.” There are even public service posters warning parents of the profession of Runners as “the latest threat to children” replete with a list of their telltale signs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1555412012454223">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>But in line with Bogost’s comment that “procedural representation is a form of symbolic expression that uses process rather than language” (2007, p. 9), players encounter another form of persuasive rhetoric directly through the gameplay of <italic>Mirror’s Edge</italic>. That Faith is fluid in everything she does clearly reflects the thematic concerns of the game (even her name sounds fluid in comparison to the hard consonants of twin sister Kate’s). But the way in which the player experiences her fluidity—her movement—as a strategically privileged mode of play in itself is perhaps the clearest reflection of the game’s procedural rhetoric. Simply stated, we discover that if we opt for flight over fight, we advance much further much faster through the game’s levels. Direct combat is possible, either hand to hand or with the help of a commandeered CPF firearm, but it becomes apparent that such encounters more often than not lead to more officers descending on you, often with more aggression at the sight of their battered or bullet-holed colleagues. In fact, the “Test of Faith” names a special achievement in <italic>Mirror’s Edge</italic> that can be earned by playing through the entire game without harming anyone with a gun. The game also incorporates certain technical features to enhance the fluidity of the player character. For instance, there is a closer relationship between camera movement and the movement of the player character in comparison to first-person perspective games preceding it; the motion of the camera bobbing up and down will intensify its rhythm with Faith’s velocity, and will even spin around when she rolls. Thus, the player’s momentum feeds an increasingly seamless portrayal of the player character while the seamlessness reciprocally encourages the player to gain more momentum.</p>
<p>The ideological material that stems from either direct gameplay or the diegetic world is often intertwined. For example, the directives Faith receives from Merc can serve the dual role of in-game instruction and heightened dramatic effect, as in his anxious communique to her when she is being trailed by a security chopper: “That bird ain’t playing around, get your ass to the CEC News building, I’m finding you a way out” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555412012454223">EA DICE, 2008</xref>). Thus, we can observe how procedural rhetoric emerges primarily (though not exclusively) through the gameplay while the thematic critique emerges through a reading—often in the most literal sense—of the diegetic world. Granted, it is necessary to acknowledge that the game’s instructions make no secret of privileging flow, offering perhaps a more direct and less procedural indication of its pacifist predilections: “Building and keeping momentum is vital to a Runner’s survival . . . the key is to seamlessly chain individual moves together and keep your speed high” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1555412012454223">
<italic>Mirror’s Edge</italic> <italic>Manual</italic>, 2008</xref>, p. 5). There are precedents in gaming’s mainstream that appear at least a decade ago. Bogost, for example, cites the privileging of stealth over slaughter in Looking Glass Studios’ <italic>Thief</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1555412012454223">Bogost, 2006</xref>, p. 63). Nevertheless, the significance resides in the fact that this element of Faith’s world is authored into the process of gameplay and reflects a governing ideology in itself. <italic>Mirror’s Edge</italic> thus takes a signal experience of gameplay and makes it a central part of the story.</p>
<p>In dramatizing “the flow” through its narrative mechanics, moreover, the game provides an occasion to analyze not simply our overall immersive experience but also other more specific fictional enactments of cognitive processes. In line with David Herman’s comments on readers of narratives in print, whereby “analyzing fictional minds . . . entails giving an account of readers’ minds too” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555412012454223">2007</xref>, p. 245) narratives in gameworlds both represent cognition (in their fictional player and nonplayer characters) and tell us something about the minds of players. For example, in the game Runners are blessed with “Runner Vision,” in which they visualize certain doors, ramps, or pipes in red and this vision cues their path of flight. We might analyze Runner Vision in tandem with the navigational cues transmitted by Merc via wire as an enactment of distributed cognition. Or we might also consider the system of “Reaction Time” in <italic>Mirror’s Edge</italic>, the slow motion rendering of action sequences that allows for pinpoint execution of combat maneuvers at reduced speed and in tight frame—all without detriment to Faith’s momentum. While this system features prominently across combat video games (and is often referred to, quite appropriately, as <italic>bullet time</italic>), it is explicitly rationalized in <italic>Mirror’s Edge</italic> as a representation of a heightened cognitive state. As the game instructions indicate: “Faith can enter an adrenaline-charged state of high awareness, slowing down the world around her” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1555412012454223">
<italic>Mirror’s Edge Manual</italic>, 2008</xref>, p. 8). We are thus encouraged to explore the aesthetic treatment of this state in light of renewed understandings of what actually goes on inside our heads during an adrenaline rush, and more specifically why we think that we actually see our environment in slow motion during these moments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1555412012454223">Figure 2</xref>).<sup>

</fig>
<p>In any case, Faith’s “Reaction Time” reminds us that physical fluidity is not reducible to continuous speed per se; rather, it also requires an element of grace, even when taking down an enemy. Considering the ways in which cognitive-based narrative theories apply to video games would acknowledge the growing understanding that cognition itself is not a “private or passive” process but is in fact “engaged and interactive” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1555412012454223">Palmer, 2004</xref>, p. 90). In turn, such a theoretical approach would provide further justification for studying precisely the sort of thinking that goes into playing.</p>
<sec id="section3-1555412012454223">
<title>“Other” Gaming Experiences</title>
<p>Clearly, the more we get into “the flow” of <italic>Mirror’s Edge</italic>, the more we can get out of it—thematically, procedurally, and cognitively. But what does <italic>Mirror’s Edge</italic> ultimately say about Faith and feminism, amid the equally fraught process of cultural encoding that constructs her? In privileging her consummate fluidity, does the game also invariably figure a “feminine” mode of expression or, for that matter, of play? That is, does it fall into the same trap articulated by Sheffield whereby we are ultimately receiving yet another, most unwelcome set of “cultural guidelines for proper feminine expression” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1555412012454223">1998</xref>, p. 21)? Or does it in fact challenge the very essentialism that such a question presupposes? We might also recall Attridge’s observation that Molly’s monologue offers two opposing interpretive possibilities, in which, “on the one hand, the cultural stereotype of the female flow is foregrounded, literalized, demystified, and parodied; while on the other, a more potent ungendered flow operates throughout the text to erode the cultural and ideological barriers between the sexes” (1989, p. 559). Which alternative would offer a more plausible reading for Faith? The fact that <italic>Mirror’s Edge</italic> is not marketed for a female player does not preclude the need to ask such questions; in fact, it likely fogs the mirror even more. And if, as Attridge writes, “Joyce’s treatment of the notion of the flow that transcends differences is not gendered in any simple way” (1989, p. 559) in his novel, then we can at least say the same about the flow in <italic>Mirror’s Edge</italic>.</p>
<p>Much has certainly changed in the years since Brenda Laurel’s Purple Moon project stirred controversy in the late 1990s with its production of video games that directly catered for females. Based on a monumental amount of ethnographic research surveying and interviewing young girls and reviewing extant literature on gender differences and play, Laurel’s games placed emphasis on values, such as “social complexity,” found to be associated with their desired experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1555412012454223">Laurel, 1998</xref>; here, we might be tempted to read Richard Bartle’s well-known typology of gamers, which categorizes players as Achievers, Killers, Explorers, and Socializers, along gender lines).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1555412012454223">11</xref>
</sup> Suffice to say that if we use Purple Moon as a guide, we probably would not recognize a feminist video game today so easily even if we saw one.</p>
<p>Either way, in the first instance, we need to move well beyond surface considerations of what female video game protagonists look like and also think critically about what they do and how they do it. For Faith, that involves running when she can, fighting when she must, and always putting family first. But more significant is what we can learn from the process of playing—from the procedural rhetoric that we glean from the fluidity of both Faith and the game itself. A first-person video game that privileges momentum above all else clearly demonstrates an investment in scripting a gaming experience that diverges from the monolithic task of targeting. But we do a disservice if we cordon these “other” experiences by employing a reductive gendered discourse. <italic>Mirror’s Edge</italic> and its protagonist should not be regarded as feminist in any reductive or essentialist way; rather, the game is progressive in the same way that independent projects such as That Game Company (also <italic>thatgamecompany</italic> and TGC) have identified the desire for emotionally engaging and rewarding experiences in a new generation of gamers, regardless of their gender. For example, in describing one of their titles, “Journey,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1555412012454223">Santiago (2010)</xref> explains, “in video games you’re very powerful. You’re usually immediately given a weapon of destruction. ‘Journey’ is an experience that’s built to give the player a sense of being small, and feeling awe towards the environment around them. We wanted to see what would happen when we took all that power away.” Understanding <italic>Mirror’s Edge</italic> as participating in the same generic pursuit of “other” emotional experiences, then, points to a reading of Faith’s flow that avoids the most dangerous traps set by essentialism, exclusivity, and stereotype.</p>
<p>We know that contemporary critical and cultural theory has in many ways moved beyond the radical feminism marked by Irigaray and Cixous or Gilbert and Gubar; and we know that the mainstream games industry most certainly has not. Or rather, given the commercial game industry emerged after the fact, it arguably may never enter such a phase, especially if we understand the extremes of so-called <italic>second-wave feminism</italic> as historically contingent. <italic>Mirror’s Edge</italic> negotiates these two problematic poles: one, grounded in critical and cultural theory, is too radical and dated, the other, grounded in the inertia of mainstream marketing, is equally dated albeit not progressive enough. In short, the game does not attempt to distill some pure form of femininity from the expression or embodiment of fluidity—nor does it locate the quality of flow (be it biological or mythological) in some kind of essential female.</p>
<p>We find further support for such an assertion in at least two places, located both in the gameworld and beyond it. First, the fact that both male and female Runners populate the world of <italic>Mirror’s Edge</italic> complicates a reading based on a simple alignment of a privileged femininity with the free running fluidity they exude. That Faith’s own twin sister is a member of the corrupt state authority and an instrument of totalitarian control similarly prevents any oversimplified division of female protagonists and male antagonists. In addition, when we look beyond the gameworld, we are reminded that flow theory itself transcends gender polarity. In fact, in order to articulate such a universal psychological state, it must certainly remain so.</p>
<p>There is indeed something instructive, and hopeful, about a conception of flow as an optimal state that can transcend gender lines—one put forth by a game that invokes a figurative conception of flow only to decouple it from a reductive stereotype. All in all, in its engagement of flow as both a governing theme and a governing design mechanic, <italic>Mirror’s Edge</italic> marks a curious confluence of rhetorics, and thus provides an exemplary text from which to excavate not only its own critique but also a commentary on video games as cultural and aesthetic artifacts more generally.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that Csíkszentmihályi’s own use of the term is inescapably metaphorical, even literary, as this passage from the preface to his <italic>Evolving Self</italic> would suggest: “I called it ‘flow,’ because this was a metaphor several respondents gave for how it felt when their experience was most enjoyable—it was like being carried away by a current, everything moving smoothly without effort” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1555412012454223">1993</xref>, p. xiii).</p>

<p>I acknowledge the astute observations of one of the reviewers of this article in positing an alternative reading of Faith, in which her relatively austere and unrevealing appearance (even the potential orthodoxy of her name), along with the narrative’s desexualized plot, may in fact suggest the opposite of Cixous’ emphatic celebration of sexuality. The reviewer also rightfully highlights the fraught nature of positioning Faith culturally and ideologically—and the inevitability of her comparison to <italic>Tomb Raider</italic>’s Lara Croft, for better and worse the <italic>locus classicus</italic> of female game protagonists—given the game’s production by the industry’s commercial giant. In developing Faith, clearly EA’s vision is not concomitant with or reducible to Pratchett’s. While the complexities inherent in such a heavily commercial collaboration pose challenges for any kind of critical or aesthetic “reading” of the game, they should not prevent us from undertaking that task, and may be all the more reason to do so.</p>
