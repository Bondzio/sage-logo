<abstract>
<p>The role of cleaning as an effective tool in the control of hospital acquired infections has generated much interest. Moreover, the role of cleaning personnel has been identified as being a more important factor in ensuring cleanliness than cleaning product. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is present in all types of organic matter and its measurement provides an indication of microbial and non microbial soil. This audit was undertaken at a large NHS university teaching hospital using ATP measurements to assess the effectiveness of the post outbreak cleaning regime. Two wards were assessed following outbreaks of norovirus and 23% of swabs failed to reach a previously established benchmark of 100 RLU. Nurse call bells were one of the most common failures (40%). Observation of practices during the audit revealed poor compliance with the cleaning procedure and confusion over cleaning responsibilities. The cleaning procedure at the Trust has been simplified as a result. Further work is required to establish acceptable cleanliness benchmarks using this technology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hospital cleaning has generated much interest as an effective tool in the control of hospital acquired infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177412455835">Anderson et al, 2011</xref>). This is particularly important on hand-touch sites of surfaces or equipment, but the precise role of cleaning in the control of infection remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177412455835">Dancer, 1999</xref>) Nevertheless, the role of cleaning personnel has been identified as being a more important factor in ensuring cleanliness than cleaning product or cleaning procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757177412455835">Hota et al, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Cleaning audits are a commonly used method of assessing the quality of hospital cleaning programmes. These audits frequently use visual assessment as a performance indicator. Although visual inspection can reveal gross deficiencies caused by the presence of visible blood, dust, spillages etc. visual assessment can be a poor indicator of cleaning efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177412455835">Cooper et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177412455835">Moore et al, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is present in all types of organic material (bacteria, bodily fluids, food etc) and its measurement provides an indication of microbial and non-microbial contamination. Furthermore, ATP measurement has been used for years by the food industry to determine levels of organic soil. Light is emitted in direct proportion to the amount of ATP present and is measured in relative light units (RLU), the higher the reading the higher the level of ATP present and therefore organic soil. ATP monitoring therefore provides a simple, quantitative method of demonstrating cleanliness.</p>
<p>In previous studies an association has been made between RLU and aerobic colony counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177412455835">Lewis et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177412455835">Anderson et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757177412455835">Mulvey et al, 2011</xref>). Approximate benchmark levels of 100 RLU have been established with microbial growth levels of &lt;2.5 colony forming units (cfu)/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177412455835">Anderson et al, 2011</xref>). Alternatively, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177412455835">Lewis et al (2008)</xref> suggested an acceptable benchmark of 250 RLU. Both studies used differing ATP instrument/test systems and therefore are not comparable. Previous benchmarks have been set on wards during clinical activity and give an overall indication of cleanliness. Calls have been made for further work to refine the choice of benchmarks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1757177412455835">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Our trust has a complex cleaning procedure in place for use following outbreaks of infection or after patients with known infections such as meticillin resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> or <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> have been discharged. The term ‘isolation clean’ is commonly used by staff to indicate this method of cleaning. The procedure consists of a three stage process:</p>
<list id="list1-1757177412455835" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Clean with detergent and hot water or detergent wipe</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Rinse with clean water</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Disinfect with a 1% solution of sodium hypochlorite.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Cleaning responsibilities are also complex, with cleaning staff being responsible for lower bed frames, bedside tables, lockers, floors, curtains, toilets and bathrooms, and nursing staff being responsible for above bed frames, mattresses and patient equipment including ward computers and telephones. The procedure for cleaning becomes even more challenging when applied to a whole ward such as after an outbreak of Norovirus. There needs to be a great deal of communication and coordination between cleaning and nursing staff to move patients and complete the cleaning bay by bay. During the latest Norovirus ‘season’ there were 30 outbreaks of Norovirus that required complete ward closures. Although regular cleaning audits are carried out within the trust an ‘isolation clean’ of a ward had never previously been audited.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1757177412455835">
<title>Aims</title>
<p>The aim of the study was to determine the effectiveness of the current isolation cleaning regime at a large university teaching hospital using ATP testing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1757177412455835" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Following an isolation clean of two 28-bed wards after outbreaks of Norovirus, the high risk hand -touch points were sampled using Hygiena System Sure Plus (Hygiena® Int. Ltd, Watford, UK) ATP monitor. The samples taken concentrated on high risk touch sites such as bed rails, nurse call bells, computer key boards, toilet flush handles etc (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177412455835">Table 1</xref> for a full list of items tested). Each ward had sufficient empty beds to completely empty a bay of patients. This enabled the cleaning processes to be completed via a bay-by-bay rolling programme throughout the wards. The samples were taken after completion of the isolation cleaning procedures and before patients were moved back in. The samples were repeated from identical sites in each bay/pieces of equipment where possible. Swabs were taken after cleaning was completed and the surfaces had dried but before beds were made and patients moved back in.</p>

<p>A benchmark of &gt;100 RLU was set to assume unacceptable cleanliness. Observational data were also collected relating to cleaning activities. All swabs were taken by the same member of staff and swabs were kept refrigerated until required.</p>
<p>There was no attempt made to link RLU counts with microbial contamination.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1757177412455835" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Two hundred and ten swabs were taken, of which 48 (23%) had RLU &gt;100.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177412455835">Table 1</xref> provides the ATP results by individual ward.</p>
<p>Mattresses were cleaned more reliably than some equipment, and just one of 32 had RLU over 100; however this reading was very high at 3232 RLU. Commodes, toilet roll holders, toilet flush handles and toilet door handles all had low RLU scores indicating effective cleaning. Blood pressure recording equipment also had low scores with just one having an RLU &gt;50 (58). Twenty three per cent of cot sides had RLUs greater than 100. Call bells tended to be more soiled, and 40% had RLUs &gt;100. Chair arms again had a high failure rate, with 26% having RLUs &gt;100. Notably the chair arms that failed tended to have damaged wooden arms. Unsurprisingly 42% of computers had an RLU &gt;100 because of the difficulty in cleaning this equipment. However from observation it was noted that the responsibility for cleaning them was unclear.</p>
<p>The benchmark for this study was set at 100 RLU, however this figure is arguably high. Because the ward had just had an isolation clean and patients and nursing staff had not yet moved back the expectation would be that the scores should be lower than in previous studies of wards with ongoing clinical activity. Therefore, the following figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1757177412455835">Figures 1</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1757177412455835"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1757177412455835"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1757177412455835"/>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1757177412455835">5</xref>) indicate the percentage scores of differing pieces of equipment that failed at 100, 75 and 50 RLU.</p>

<p>Of particular concern was that almost 60% of nurse call bells had RLU &gt;50, considering the likelihood of this being a vector for cross-infection. The nurse call bells on both wards were noted to be of a difficult design to clean.</p>
<sec id="section6-1757177412455835">
<title>Observational results</title>
<p>There was obvious confusion relating to staff roles and responsibilities regarding isolation cleaning. Nursing staff were observed cleaning equipment inconsistently. The choice of cleaning product used was also variable, with some staff using detergent wipes and some staff using sporicidal wipes. In some bays there was no cleaning at all by the nursing staff and in no areas did nursing staff follow up cleaning with disinfection. The members of cleaning services staff were observed disinfecting equipment (beds, lockers, tables and chairs) with a 1% sodium hypochlorite solution but no cleaning had taken place preceding this. The lack of understanding of roles and responsibilities was demonstrated from one cleaning assistant who said ‘We clean everything because we are not sure the nurses have done it’. However in this context ‘clean’ meant ‘disinfect’. When a nurse on one ward was asked if the nursing staff had cleaned their equipment before the cleaning services staff started on a bay she admitted she wasn’t aware that she should have done any cleaning. The net result was that equipment was either cleaned but not disinfected or disinfected and not cleaned.</p>
<p>On one ward in particular there was poor coordination between nursing and cleaning staff. Both teams appeared to be working independently and as a result the cleaning and movement of patients was less efficient. This lack of coordination and organisation probably explains the extremely high RLU on one mattress. The mattress was visibly stained and clearly had not been cleaned despite the cleaning staff stating it had been.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this audit are disappointing as the current cleaning procedure has been policy at the trust for a considerable period of time. However, deficiencies in cleaning following outbreaks of Norovirus have been previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757177412455835">Morter et al, 2011</xref>). Norovirus is able to survive in the environment on dry inanimate surfaces from eight hours to seven days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412455835">Bentley et al, 2012</xref>) and as few as 10–100 viral particles are able to cause infection. There is a growing body of evidence implicating surface contamination as a source of cross-transmission of pathogens to patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757177412455835">Hota et al, 2009</xref>). However the question remains as to whether persistent environmental contamination is a consequence of lack of adherence to existing cleaning guidelines, failure of the techniques or inadequate products.</p>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide vapour has been suggested as an effective disinfectant against Norovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412455835">Bentley et al, 2012</xref>). However this requires an initial cleaning procedure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177412455835">Barker et al (2004)</xref> found that in relation to Norovirus the effectiveness of sodium hypochlorite against the organism was also dependent upon adequate cleaning with detergent beforehand. Cleaning is required to enable effective decontamination by disinfection and if organic matter is not removed then the disinfection agent is prevented from working (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757177412455835">Weston, 2008</xref>). ATP measures residual organic soil, however the residues may or may not pose an infection risk. Typically, approximately just 33% of ATP from hand contact sites is likely to be of microbial origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177412455835">Lewis et al, 2008</xref>). Nevertheless for a cleaning protocol to remove pathogens from a surface it must necessarily remove residual organic matter to a low level.</p>
<p>Therefore whatever method is chosen to disinfect the environment the initial cleaning procedure is very important and not one that appears to have been recognised as such by either nursing or cleaning staff in this audit. This would tend to support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757177412455835">Hota et al’s (2009)</xref> findings that environmental contamination reflects personnel rather than procedure or product failures.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177412455835">Anderson et al (2011)</xref> noted in their study that touch frequency could confound any cleaning attempts, but this audit has tested equipment immediately after cleaning and before contact with any member of staff and therefore more precisely tests the decontamination method in its ability to remove organic soil. Although this audit had better ATP scores overall than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177412455835">Anderson et al’s (2011)</xref> study that is to be expected as equipment was ‘uncontaminated’ after cleaning.</p>
<p>The trust’s cleaning protocol following an outbreak of Norovirus involves a bay-by-bay rolling cleaning programme. The current policy has a complex division of cleaning responsibilities that make considerable the logistics of completing the isolation clean. Furthermore, the trust has a simpler one-stage cleaning procedure using a combined detergent and disinfectant product for routine cleaning of toilets and sanitary ware. The differing procedures have possibly created confusion, i.e. cleaning staff not realising that a stronger 1% solution of sodium hypochlorite would need an extra two stages to be effective. The latest guidance from the Norovirus Working Party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177412455835">HPA, 2012</xref>) recommends cleaning prior to disinfection using a solution of 0.1% sodium hypochlorite for terminal disinfection. It also states that ‘ill defined boundaries for responsibilities such as cleaning above and below shoulder height should be avoided’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177412455835">HPA, 2012</xref>: 20). The regime in the trust’s current policy is currently at odds with this guidance.</p>
<p>The pieces of equipment that had consistently low RLU counts were the toilets and sanitary ware, which are cleaned by the use of a combined cleaning and disinfection agent. This would suggest that where cleaning processes are simplified and there is no ambiguity over responsibilities there is a better result.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This audit using ATP testing has uncovered deficiencies in our cleaning procedures that would have been difficult to identify by visual inspection alone. Importantly the observational aspects of this study have been key in identifying the lack of comprehension and poor compliance with cleaning policy. Confusion was obvious in relation to ‘cleaning’ and ‘disinfection’ with most staff using the terms interchangeably. Staff failed to understand the importance of basic cleaning in the decontamination process and as a result may have contributed to the recurrent outbreaks of Norovirus on some of our wards. This audit has prompted a review of our procedures to be more in line with national guidance. Our policy has been simplified and work on cleaning responsibilities is ongoing. Educational work to strengthen the relevant knowledge of clinical and cleaning staff has been initiated. Further work is required to establish an acceptable benchmark using ATP technology in this situation.</p>
