<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>KYDS emerged in the context of the escalating presentation of mental health and other problems affecting young people, and the desire of a local community to provide a service for its youth. The service has expanded since opening in 2005 and now includes, among other elements, therapy for referred clients, parent educational forums, and group programs such as a young women’s program and a program for teenagers with parents affected by mental illness. The challenges for the service include financial pressures, service expansion, and how to best complement other services in the public and private sector.</p>

<body>
<p>The provision of a range of readily accessible, high quality health services for young people is desirable in all communities. The prevalence of mental health problems in youth, combined with an apparent increase in the rate and complexity of some of these problems, has put a strain on traditional services in both the public and private sectors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212474943">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212474943">2</xref></sup> In such an environment, new services that both complement existing services and are innovative have much to offer.</p>
<p>The aim of this paper is to describe the response of one community to some of the pressing health needs of young people and their families. KYDS Youth Development Service (“KYDS”) was conceived 13 years ago and provides a variety of services. It is hoped that readers will consider the feasibility of developing such a service in their own community, and whether a similar multi-pronged service might even be developed outside the youth health field.</p>
<sec id="section3-1039856212474943">
<title>Service background</title>
<p>The Ku-ring-gai Local Government Area (Ku-ring-gai LGA or “Ku-ring-gai”) in Sydney’s north covers approximately 84 square kilometers, contains nine suburbs and has had a relatively stable population of around 100,000 for the past decade. Early in the year 2000, the Rotary Club of Lindfield (one of the LGA’s suburbs) identified a need for a youth-friendly counseling service in Ku-ring-gai. Contrary to the belief in some quarters that young people in the relatively affluent area were, or should be, less likely to encounter many of the emotional problems that beset their peers elsewhere, there was growing awareness that depression, increasing access to drugs and alcohol, and a range of other significant problems at home and at school were not uncommon in this community.</p>
<p>According to the original mission statement, Lindfield Rotary Club sought to provide in the LGA a caring and nurturing environment, where youth aged 12–18 years could access professional counseling to identify problems and receive help to try to resolve them. The service was to be called Ku-ring-gai Youth Development Service (changed to “KYDS Youth Development Service” in 2012, to acknowledge the service’s reach beyond Ku-ring-gai), and the proposal met with the support of Ku-ring-gai Council, existing health services, New South Wales (NSW) Police, Lifeline and “Youth Off The Streets”, as well as other organizations.</p>
<p>Among the requirements for the new service site were that it be located close to the railway station, not in obvious public gaze, and that it be available for the exclusive use of KYDS. A vacant building at the rear of Lindfield library that was owned by Council met these criteria and was offered to KYDS at a peppercorn rent.</p>
<p>A management committee was established, with a variety of officer bearers, general committee members, and a representative of Ku-ring-gai Council. A clinical committee, which included members with long-standing health service and academic affiliations, was also formed to supervise clinical staff. Professor David Bennett (Head, NSW Centre for the Advancement of Adolescent Health) was elected the inaugural chairman of the management committee and Professor Marie Bashir (Governor of NSW) accepted the title of KYDS Patron.</p>
<p>The service was registered with the NSW Department of Fair Trading as an Incorporated Association with an appropriate constitution, and commenced operations in 2005. Since opening, the service has expanded to now include the elements described in the sections below. The core staff group currently includes three paid staff with psychologist or general counseling qualifications who have clinical responsibilities, one of whom (the first author) also serves as KYDS Manager. At any time, there are one or more students on 6–12 month placement completing a psychology or related degree. For group activities, particularly with large groups, the assistance of health or other professionals who have previously worked with KYDS or are known to the organization is sought. All KYDS staff receive regular individual and/or group supervision from an experienced external supervisor, in addition to benefitting from support and input from the clinical committee. The clinical committee meets monthly and includes experienced health professionals, one of whom (GW) is a senior academic who is also affiliated with the Local Health District.</p>

<title>Individual therapy</title>
<sec id="section5-1039856212474943">
<title>Referral, intake and assessment</title>
<p>KYDS receives referrals from a wide variety of sources, including parents, school counselors, General Practitioners (GPs), hospital and community health services, and juvenile justice and child protection services. Young people may also self refer. The service is free. The Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS) scheme can be used for some GP-referred clients, who then receive up to 12 sessions per calendar year.</p>
<p>Intake is by telephone. The intake process allows the therapist to sensitively gather general and mental health information about the client. Consistent with the service’s “Acute Cases Screening Policy”, the intake officer will, where appropriate, enquire about episodes of self-harm, suicidal ideation and behavior, and psychotic symptoms.</p>
<p>During initial assessment, the constraints of confidentiality are explained to the client and the client’s parent or care giver. The voluntary nature of therapy is mentioned and clients are made aware of the role of a counselor and the structure and length of sessions.</p>
<p>The therapist conducts a thorough assessment, gathering relevant information from the client about the presenting problem(s), family background, and physical and mental health history, including past trauma and major life events, drug and alcohol related issues, social supports, interests, strengths, previous counseling, other involved agencies, and therapeutic goals. Following the assessment and case formulation, a management plan is developed with the client, according to their wishes and needs.</p>
<p>Although KYDS was not established as a mental health service per se, issues pertaining directly to mental health have come to account for the most common reason for referral (46% of referrals in the 12 months to July 2012, excluding those primarily for alcohol and substance abuse). Presenting problems include anxiety, depression, problems with anger, drug and alcohol issues, self-harm, suicidal ideation, family issues, bullying and other school issues, sexual assault and domestic violence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1039856212474943">
<title>Model of therapy</title>
<p>KYDS draws upon a range of evidence-based therapeutic approaches. The primary modalities are Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212474943">3</xref></sup> and Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212474943">4</xref></sup> which are tailored to the needs of each client.</p>
<p>Therapy sessions usually take place on a weekly basis for 6–12 weeks, the duration varying with the client’s individual circumstances and progress towards reaching therapeutic goals. A review is conducted with the client after six sessions and the treatment plan is then modified if necessary. A few clients require longer term therapy.</p>
<p>A number of tools are used in the assessment and to monitor progress. The most frequently used instrument is the Beck Youth Inventory (second edition),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212474943">5</xref></sup> which examines five domains: depression, anxiety, anger, disruptive behavior and self-concept. The selection and adoption of a routine outcome measure is likely in the near future.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856212474943">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>KYDS endeavors to provide a holistic service that takes into account the context of a client. Therefore, at various stages in the assessment and treatment, where appropriate and with client consent, KYDS counselors may liaise with other parties involved in the case, including parents, carers, school counselors, hospital and community health services, GPs, psychiatrists and psychologists in private practice, and the Department of Community Services.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section7-1039856212474943">
<title>Other service elements</title>
<p>In addition to providing assessment and therapy for individual referrals, the range of services delivered by KYDS since its opening has expanded to include a variety of innovative forums, workshops and other programs, as described below. Each is evaluated at the time of delivery; while including the results of these evaluations is beyond the scope of this article, the programs appear to have “hit the mark” and have consistently received a high satisfaction rating. Further, in 2010 two of the programs earned KYDS prestigious awards from the Mental Health Association of NSW: the Young Women’s Program (Mental Health Promotion Award) and Paying Attention to Self (PATS) (Best Program for Mental Illness Prevention and Early Intervention). With some of the larger group activities held in schools (which may include the involvement of therapists beyond KYDS), KYDS charges the schools a fee to cover costs.</p>
<sec id="section8-1039856212474943">
<title>Forums</title>
<sec id="section9-1039856212474943">
<title>Parent Forums</title>
<p>The Parent Forums initiative was developed on the basis of an identified need to provide parents and/or guardians with relevant knowledge and practical strategies to implement in particular areas affecting teenagers and, in the process, to foster a positive and supportive relationship with the young person. As a result, in collaboration with Ku-ring-gai Council in 2008, KYDS launched bimonthly Parent Forums, which have continued. These forums, held at council chambers, have addressed a range of topics, such as communicating with teens, resilience, body image, depression, suicide, alcohol and substance abuse, cyber-bullying, etc. Attendance varies from about 30 to over 100 parents (with an average of 50–60 parents), which is encouraging, given that the forums occur on a weeknight in school term time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1039856212474943">
<title>Youth Forum</title>
<p>Together with a range of partners, KYDS helped to develop and conduct a major Youth Forum in 2012. The concept of the forum originated in the office of Member of Parliament Matt Kean in response to two central issues plaguing the treatment of adolescents with mental health problems, namely the stigma within schools surrounding mental illness and the need to improve pathways to help for young people. The forum objectives included:</p>
<list id="list1-1039856212474943" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Engaging attendees to brainstorm and openly discuss ways in which young people can cope with mental health issues;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Helping young people to understand the importance of looking after one’s own mental health and ways to achieve this;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Gaining insights about gaps in service provision in the community and school system from young people;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Obtaining feedback on how schools and the community can work better to engage young people with mental health issues and help reduce stigma.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Over 200 students, accompanied by 23 teachers, counselors and educators from 22 schools in the Hornsby and Ku-ring-gai LGAs, attended the day-long forum. Later in the year, it was successfully replicated in regional NSW (Albury, Wagga Wagga and Griffith).</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section11-1039856212474943">
<title>Workshops</title>
<p>KYDS has developed a range of half-day workshops in response to issues raised by local schools, interagency organizations and recent literature. The aim is to provide practical strategies. Workshop topics include:</p>
<list id="list2-1039856212474943" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Resilience, e.g. factors contributing to one’s resilience and self-esteem, positive self-talk, and building inner strength;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“Managing the Higher School Certificate years”, e.g. causes of stress and responses, adaptive qualities of stress, stress management, relaxation and motivation;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mental health, e.g. overview of various mental health disorders, coping strategies, stigma;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dealing with relationships, e.g. bullying, stages of conflict, conflict resolution.</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1039856212474943">
<title>Other programs</title>
<sec id="section13-1039856212474943">
<title>Young Women’s Program</title>
<p>The Young Women’s Program commenced in 2010, as a joint initiative of KYDS and Lane Cove Council Youth Services. The impetus arose from clinical observation and a noted fourfold increase in NSW in the rate of intentional self-harm by females aged 15–24 years from 1989 to 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212474943">7</xref></sup> KYDS staff identified a number of specific issues impacting on young women’s wellbeing, and these were divided into four topics:</p>
<list id="list3-1039856212474943" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Drug and alcohol issues, such as binge drinking and risks associated with drug taking;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Body image and self-esteem, such as preoccupation with weight, sexual objectification, risky dieting, and low self-esteem;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Bullying and cyber-safety, such as cyber-bullying, social exclusion, and the impact of bullying on mental health;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sexual health and relationships, such as pressures to engage in sexual behavior, risky sexual behavior, and violence in relationships.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The key objectives of the Young Women’s Program, conducted in high schools, are to provide information and interactive activities for participants, and to equip young women with practical skills for making more positive decisions about the targeted issues. Prior to program delivery, there is correspondence with the school to ensure an optimal learning experience for students. It is essential that there is a warm and caring environment in which the participants can be open and share their thoughts, opinions and experiences. Parents are informed of the program by way of a letter from the school and are given the choice for their children to participate or not.</p>
<p>The program is facilitated by psychologists, counselors and youth workers trained by KYDS staff. Guest facilitators from the “Best Enemies” production team have been used for their expertise with the bullying and cyber-safety topic. In order to promote openness and comfort within the group context, all facilitators are female and are allocated to one group of students (approximately 15–20) for the duration of the program.</p>
<p>Since its introduction, the Young Women’s Program has been run in various formats to accommodate the needs of different schools. To date, the program has been successfully delivered to over 1000 students in public and private high schools across the Northern Sydney region.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1039856212474943">
<title>Young Men’s Program</title>
<p>The Young Men’s Program was developed in 2012 in response to interest from schools, worrying statistics about the stressors and health issues confronting teenage boys and young men, and to complement the Young Women’s Program. KYDS staff identified four areas that could be addressed:</p>
<list id="list4-1039856212474943" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Drug and alcohol issues, such as binge drinking and risks associated with drug taking;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Anger management, such as identifying triggers, dealing with anger, and conflict resolution;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Bullying, peer pressure and cyber-bullying issues, such as addressing friendship, types of bullying, impact of language, and legal implications of sexting;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Attitudes to women and pornography, and sexual health and relationships, such as issues relating to healthy relationships and risky sexual behavior.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Modeled on the Young Women’s Program, the Young Men’s Program has been delivered to date to one private and two public high schools, and has reached a total of 150 students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1039856212474943">
<title>Paying Attention to Self (PATS)</title>
<p>PATS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856212474943">8</xref></sup> was developed in 1996 by the Centre for Adolescent Health, Melbourne, in response to an identified gap in services for young people with a parent with a mental illness. The adoption of PATS by KYDS was facilitated by the input of other services, most notably Hornsby Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service. PATS is designed as a prevention and early intervention strategy for young people aged 12–18 years who have a parent with a mental illness. The program is run as a peer support group facilitated by a peer leader (a young person whose parent has a mental illness) and two health professionals.</p>
<p>The aims and objectives of the program are for participants to: share their experiences; be supported by other young people in a similar situation; reduce their risk of developing mental health difficulties; focus on mental health promotion and illness prevention; increase their knowledge of mental health and illness; improve their help-seeking behavior and coping strategies; and improve their sense of connection to peers, family and the community.</p>
<p>PATS is delivered weekly over eight weeks, with groups comprising 6–8 young people. Topics covered in the program include: understanding the parent’s illness; improving the relationship with the parent; communication and problem solving skills; dealing with the stigma associated with mental health; and strategies for coping with the parent’s condition and staying mentally healthy. These topics provide a foundation for the program, but it should be noted that participants are also involved in topic planning, and therefore the subjects covered by different groups will vary.</p>
<p>KYDS expanded the original PATS program by implementing an online discussion group, available to participants throughout the program, and establishing a PATS online Youth Advisory Committee, available to participants upon program completion. The Youth Advisory Committee provides participants with continued support and engagement with the group. All PATS graduates are encouraged to visit the PATS site, assist in new programs and attend PATS reunions.</p>

<sec id="section16-1039856212474943">
<title>Challenges</title>
<p>The KYDS journey has not been without challenges, most notably those listed below.</p>
<sec id="section17-1039856212474943">
<title>Financial viability</title>
<p>Despite being highly regarded in the community, KYDS has struggled to secure a permanent funding base, and indeed in 2011 the service faced imminent closure for this reason. Funding had become too unpredictable, with its reliance upon a large, annual fundraising dinner and donations by prominent businesses, other organizations and community figures. A generous grant and contribution towards infrastructure from Ku-ring-gai Council and the appointment in 2012 of a professional fund raiser has helped to ease the financial pressure in the medium term. Thankfully, Council continues to heavily subsidize the rent charged for the KYDS premises and looks after the service’s electricity and water charges.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1039856212474943">
<title>Expansion</title>
<p>Since opening, KYDS has expanded in a number of ways, including: an increase in the number of clients seen each year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1039856212474943">Figure 1</xref>); the range of programs; the age of clients (some of the clients and schools are now in the preadolescent group); the number of staff (from one to three clinical staff); appointment of a youth consultant to advise on program content and delivery, and help to make all aspects of KYDS “youth friendly”; the geographic reach of its services to include several neighboring Sydney LGAs (currently, 42% of referrals come from LGAs outside Ku-ring-gai), a satellite service (located at “The Shack” in Epping), and consultation to regional centers in NSW; and the size of the KYDS office (extended to include a suite of vacant offices, above the current premises, from January 2013 onwards). Maintaining the warm service culture and high service quality as KYDS moves from a small to larger organization must remain a top priority.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section19-1039856212474943">
<title>Complementarity with health services</title>
<p>KYDS operates in an environment where there are much larger public (hospital and community) and private service providers in the child and adolescent health field that are also undergoing change. Each service provider needs to have accurate, up-to-date knowledge of the systems and processes of the others. Among other reasons, the care of clients will not uncommonly be transferred from one service to another. It is also important not to duplicate services. The implementation in 2012 of a quarterly meeting between the KYDS Manager and the Director of Northern Sydney Local Health District Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services has proved beneficial in this regard.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section20-1039856212474943">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>KYDS evolved in response to the perceived need within a Sydney community that its youth would benefit from such a service. Within a short period of time since opening in 2005, and despite significant hurdles, KYDS has grown to encompass a wide range of services and award-winning programs. Notwithstanding the existence of other youth services, readers may choose to contemplate how the KYDS model may be applied in other settings.</p>
