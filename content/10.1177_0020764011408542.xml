The experimental intervention consisted of ascribing a ‘psychiatric label’ to only one set of vignettes.

The non-medical students had a similar tendency to stigmatize as medical students before psychiatric rotation (<italic>Z</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> = −0.03, <italic>p</italic> = .975). Neither gender, nor the size of student’s place of origin or average academic mark was associated with the tendency to stigmatize in our sample.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Stigmatization is a global phenomenon of social labelling, stamping a person in order to discriminate, degrade or classify them in a socially undesirable category of being harmful and dangerous. Stigma in relation to people with mental illness can be understood as a combination of problems of knowledge (ignorance), attitudes (prejudice) and behaviour (discrimination) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764011408542">Thornicroft, Brohan, Kassam, &amp; Lewis-Holmes, 2008</xref>). Stigmatization of psychiatric patients, which is widely present over the world, affects treatment and socialization of psychiatric patients and could be considered as an environmental risk factor for mental illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764011408542">van Zelst, 2009</xref>). It is this phenomenon that is responsible for the fact that a great number of people with psychiatric disorders do not even try to ask for medical help.</p>
<p>The very process of stigmatization could be considered from two points of view: personal feeling of being stigmatized, i.e. ‘self-stigma’ (feelings like anger, depression, fear, anxiety, guilt, embarrassment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764011408542">Dinos, Stevens, Serfaty, Weich, &amp; King, 2004</xref>)), or imputing a label to other person, i.e. ‘public stigma’ (stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764011408542">Corrigan &amp; Watson, 2002</xref>). The literature suggests that being stigmatized is associated with low self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764011408542">Link, Struening, Neese-Todd, Asmussen, &amp; Phelan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764011408542">Verhaeghe, Braceke, &amp; Bruynooghe 2008</xref>), one important personality dimension that reflects a person’s overall evaluation or appraisal of his or her own worth, but little is known about the self-esteem of stigmatizers. Interestingly, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764011408542">Crandall and Cohen (1994)</xref>, possible candidates for individual differences that would lead to a greater or lesser rejection of a stigmatized one include low self-esteem, alienation, authoritarianism and social-cultural ideology.</p>
<p>Although some literature suggests that public stigma is lower among younger people and individuals with higher educational levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764011408542">Angermeyer, Matschinger, &amp; Corrigan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764011408542">Arvaniti, Samakouri, Kalamara, Bochtsou, Bikos, &amp; Livaditis, 2009</xref>), strong negative emotional reactions towards people with mental illness have been found in secondary schoolchildren from different world regions (Ronzoni, Dogra, Omigbodun, Bella, &amp; Atilola, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764011408542">Rose, Thornicroft, Pinfold, &amp; Kassam, 2007</xref>) and in medical doctors and medical students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764011408542">Ogunsemi, Odusan, &amp; Olatawura 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764011408542">Schulze, 2007</xref>). The level of stigmatization by medical students is uneven regarding different disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and self-harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764011408542">Fernando, Deane, &amp; McLeod, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764011408542">Law, Rostill-Brookes, &amp; Goodman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764011408542">Simonds &amp; Thorpe, 2003</xref>) but sometimes it seems that future doctors stigmatize ‘psychiatric label’ itself. When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764011408542">Ogunsemi et al. (2008)</xref> evaluated the effect of psychiatric label attached to an apparently normal person on the attitude of final year medical students, it resulted in students wanting to maintain a significant distance from the person labelled ‘mentally ill’.</p>
<p>However, negative attitudes may be modified by the level of education and direct contact with mentally ill people, as has been shown in two studies from our region that focused on Belgrade adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764011408542">Pejović-Milovancević, Lecić-Tosevski, Tenjović, Popović-Deusić, &amp; Draganić-Gajić, 2009</xref>) and Greek students and professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764011408542">Arvaniti et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764011408542">Chung, Chen, and Liu (2001)</xref> found that Chinese medical and dental students were more accepting towards a person labelled as mentally ill when compared with social science and engineering students.</p>
<p>The present study was carried out at the School of Medicine and the School of Law, University of Belgrade, using a hypothetical vignette of an apparently healthy young person and experimentally manipulating attributions of ‘psychiatric label’. The aim of this study was (1) to record the attitudes and behaviour of medical students towards a person with a ‘psychiatric label’ before and after the psychiatric rotation, (b) to compare the attitudes and behaviour between medical and non-medical students, and (c) to investigate associations between the level of stigmatization and students’ characteristics (demography, academic achievement and self-esteem).</p>
<p>Based on the results of previous studies, we hypothesized that participants who had more knowledge about mental illness would have more positive attitudes and behaviour. Previous similar research has never been conducted in former Yugoslavia and Serbia, and there is no data to show stigmatization on the national level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0020764011408542" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The study was conducted in accordance with the provisions of The Helsinki Declaration and independent consent was obtained from the School of Medicine (Department for Physiology and Forensic Medicine) and the School of Law (Department for Tax Law), University of Belgrade.</p>
<sec id="section8-0020764011408542">
<title>Research setting</title>
<p>At the School of Medicine, University Belgrade, undergraduate education in psychiatry is based on the traditional curriculum over a 30-week course in the fourth year (a single course on clinical education), where students participate in centralized sessions for theoretical education (30 hours) alternating with smaller group sessions at clinical sites (60 hours). Students are introduced to the mental status exam and psychiatric interviewing as well as the diagnostic features, epidemiology, clinical course, treatment and neurobiology of the core psychiatric disorders. Clerkship assignments are available in inpatient units and partial hospital programmes and students mostly rotate. This means that student contact is with different patients in terms of either diagnosis or phase of the illness course. All clinical psychiatric experience is gained in the fourth year. Second year students have no school-related contact with psychiatry, while all sixth year students complete the rotation and pass the exam in psychiatry.</p>
<p>In our previous studies of attitudes towards psychiatry as a career choice, fifth year students had lower attitude scores regarding psychiatry in comparison to their younger colleagues, when averaged on their background and attitudes towards other residencies: positive attitude was evident in 15% sophomores and 16% seniors, while 25% and 47%, respectively, stated they would never consider psychiatry as a possible residency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764011408542">Marić, Stojiljković, Milekić, Milanov, Stevanovic, &amp; Jašović-Gašić, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020764011408542">Marić, Stojiljković, Milekić, Milanov, Bijelic, &amp; Jašović-Gašić, 2011</xref>). This decrease of interest was due to an increase in the number of students who showed a negative attitude towards psychiatry. However, although our data showed a decrease in affinity towards psychiatry during studies, the level of interested students is still one of the highest reported in recent literature.</p>
<p>In the past couple of years, about 4.4% of total medical school graduates applied for a residency in psychiatry (data for year 2006, Postgraduate Studies Department at School of Medicine, University of Belgrade). Finally, the ratio of psychiatrists in Serbia was about 10 per 100,000 population during the last decade.</p>
<p>Psychiatric services in Serbia have been mostly hospital centred. The Serbian National Committee for Mental Health was established in 2003 and de-stigmatization of persons with psychiatric disorders became part of the National Strategy for Development of Mental Helath Care in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764011408542">Pejović-Milovancević et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Law students do not learn specifically about psychiatry, i.e. how to recognize mental symptoms or disorders. There is no particular subject such as ‘Insanity defence’ or similar, although they do have some information on how to protect the rights of persons with psychiatric disorders. The draft of the Mental Health Law (as a part of the National Strategy for Development of Mental Health Care) is still beyond its official application.</p>
<p>Both schools comply with the conditions of the Bologna Declaration, the process to create a unique European higher education area by making academic degree and quality assurance standards more comparable and compatible throughout Europe.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0020764011408542">
<title>Participants and procedures</title>
<p>The study included students from the University of Belgrade who in 2008 entered the second and sixth year at the School of Medicine and students who in 2009 entered the fourth year at the School of Law. Testing was performed by some of the authors (NZ, BZ, LM and MM who were students at this time) within the first semester, during the regular teaching (classes) in the above-mentioned departments with the permission of teaching staff. All the students who attended the lectures during one week (survey period) were invited to participate. Participants were not familiar with the fact that psychiatrists would supervise the questionnaire. The study was designed as a randomized cluster experiment.</p>
<p>The study instrument was a three-part self-reported questionnaire. The first part included socio-demographic data (gender, date of birth, secondary school finished, population of place of residence), as well as average mark within studies. The second part was the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764011408542">Rosenberg, 1979</xref>), with 10 statements evaluated on a four-point Likert scale. The third part of the questionnaire was a vignette depicting a young, mentally healthy, but shy person, as well as 14 statements (attitudes and behaviour) addressing the acceptance of a person described by a vignette as judged by social distance (social stigmatization), to be evaluated on a four-point Likert scale. A higher social distance score indicated a stronger rejection of the given subject. The case description and the questionnaire were modified versions of those used in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764011408542">Chung et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764011408542">Ogunsemi et al., 2008</xref>). Two statements from the original questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764011408542">Ogunsemi et al., 2008</xref>) were omitted as considered culturally unsuitable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0020764011408542">
<title>Vignette</title>
<p>The text in the vignette was as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>NN is mainly considered to be a cheerful and happy person. Surrounded by close people, NN easily shows own feelings and opinions, while in the group of people NN does not know, NN turns to a tense person. NN is generally in good terms with cousins, as well as with the majority of other people. We could say that NN leads a normal life for his/her own age and that NN balance well with social life (making friends) and studying.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0020764011408542">
<title>Statements</title>
<p>Using the four-point Likert scale (1 = agree completely, 2 = agree, 3 = disagree, 4 = disagree completely), the students determined how much they were in agreement with the statements referring to the person featured in the vignette.</p>
<p>Experimental intervention in the present study was to impute a psychiatric label to the featured person by the statement ‘NN goes to a psychiatrist’ at the end of the vignette text. There were two versions of the questionnaire: with and without the psychiatric label. Each group of students (cluster) was given one version of the questionnaire so that they would not see the difference between the vignettes; the labelled vignette was distributed to 49.5% of the second year students and 47.7% of the final year students from the School of Medicine and to 49.4% of the final year students from the School of Law).</p>
<p>In our pilot study, we showed that the questionnaire was applicable to the Serbian population, the response rate was high and the internal consistency was good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020764011408542">Munjiza, Stojiljković, Milekić, Latković, Jašović-Gašić, &amp; Marić, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020764011408542">Stojiljković, Music, Munjiza, Jašović-Gašić, Totic-Poznanovic, &amp; Marić, 2009</xref>). Moreover, our data analysis yielded a two-factor structure of stigmatizing statements: stigma imputed in a distant or close relationship. Imputing stigma in the distant relationship means discrimination and underestimation of a person at the level of social conscience of an individual (items 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020764011408542">Table 1</xref>). Stigma in the close relationship refers to the contact that requires a higher level of intimacy between the subject and the object of stigmatization (items 3, 8, 10–14, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020764011408542">Table 1</xref>). The item number 6 (‘It would be uncomfortable to me to talk about my private problems to NN’) performed poorly in terms of internal consistency with other items and was thus omitted from subsequent analyses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Medical education can both aggravate and reduce social distance towards a person who goes to a psychiatrist. The results of our study show that medical students stigmatize a person with a psychiatric label more in their final year, after psychiatric rotation. The non-medical students had a similar tendency to stigmatize as the medical students before psychiatric rotation. A higher level of stigmatization was evident in relations that require a closer relationship between the student and the hypothetical person who sees a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>The data from this study are inconsistent with previously published data. We did not confirm that medical students stigmatize less that non-medical, as shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764011408542">Chung et al. (2001)</xref>, nor that final year students improve their attitudes towards the mentally ill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764011408542">Ay, Save, &amp; Fidanoglu, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Neither gender, size of student’s place of origin nor average academic mark was associated with the tendency to stigmatize in our sample. However, a negative attitude that resulted in maintaining a significant distance from the labelled person was associated with student’s self-esteem: students with lower self-esteem were more prone to input stigma into distant relationship, while those whose self-esteem was higher stigmatized in closer relationships.</p>
<p>From the literature, we know that self-esteem is an important factor for the evaluation of self-stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764011408542">Link et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764011408542">Verhaeghe et al., 2008</xref>), but little is known about the self-esteem of stigmatizers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764011408542">Crandall and Cohen (1994)</xref> evaluated personality of stigmatizer and concluded that two factors predicted rejection: (1) a cynical world view, characterized by alienation, loneliness and little faith in people and (2) conventionalism, characterized by authoritarianism and a belief in a just world. However, the authors did not find that self-esteem predicted the rejection. Our findings show that lower self-esteem, associated with the feeling of low competency and dependency on other people’s approval, was associated with rejection in relations that include the presence of others (meeting a labelled person at a party or celebration, to work with him/her, etc.).</p>
<p>Our method used a vignette of an apparently normal person labelled as ‘goes to a psychiatrist’, thus the results can be interpreted not in relation to the particular disorder and its treatment, but to psychiatry as a discipline. The findings of the present study provide support for an earlier report by our group on the attitudes of students towards psychiatry as a career at the School of Medicine, Belgrade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764011408542">Marić et al., 2009</xref>; Marić et al., in press). In the sample of 105 sophomore and 75 senior students, we found a decrease in an interest in psychiatry after students had completed the psychiatric clerkship. The observed change was not due to a decrease in the number of interested students over the course of medical education, but to an increase in the number of students who show a negative attitude towards psychiatry (typical answer: ‘I would never choose psychiatry for my future residency’), view psychiatry unfavourably, and lack confidence and respect for both psychiatrists and the field.</p>
<p>The precise origin of these unfavourable changes in students’ attitudes towards psychiatry and a patient who sees a psychiatrist is not known, but it is possible that contact with patients with mental illness at the severe end of the spectrum may contribute, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764011408542">Fernando et al. (2010)</xref>. Contact with a recovered patient could be effective in reducing stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764011408542">Thornicroft et al., 2008</xref>), but the examined students had classes that too frequently exposed them to interactions with severe and hospitalized patients and the training course was too short to observe the clinical course that led to recovery. Also, if education overestimated the factors of inheritance, but underestimated the nature and nurture interactions, epigenetic dynamics and humanistic approach that relies on individual potential more than limitations due to symptoms, pessimistic attitudes towards the effectiveness of treatment might be formed or sustained.</p>
<p>Even if appropriate educational intervention and experience are gained, the question arises about how long their effects will sustain. In a one-year follow-up study in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764011408542">Baxter, Singh, Standen, &amp; Duggan, 2001</xref>), it was shown that a positive change in medical students’ attitudes towards psychiatry, psychiatrists and mental illness after their fourth year psychiatric training was transient and decayed over the final year. Medical students experience significant distress from adjustment to the medical school environment, perceived ethical and professional dilemmas, first-time exposure to death and human suffering, personal life events and educational debt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764011408542">Dyrbye, Thomas, &amp; Shanafelt, 2005</xref>). The data obtained by several authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020764011408542">Patenaude, Niyonsenga, &amp; Fafard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020764011408542">Woloschuk, Harasym, &amp; Temple, 2004</xref>) showed a decline in empathy and an increase in cynicism during the course of medical school. The decline in empathy could be related to aspects of student distress and quality of life rather than progression through the training curriculum alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764011408542">Thomas et al., 2007</xref>). Knowledge of to what degree stigma exists in medical training is important as it leads to an understanding of why psychiatry has low recruitment and how psychiatric patients may be treated by doctors.</p>
<p>Stigma is inherent in the social structures that make up society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764011408542">Corrigan &amp; Watson, 2002</xref>). The methods of supplementary educational programmes in producing enduring change in medical students’ attitudes towards psychiatry, patients and mental illness should be associated with interventions on a global, national level. In a way, our research could be considered as a baseline assessment that facilitates the evaluation of such global interventions at the level of medical school.</p>
<sec id="section22-0020764011408542">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Finally, some limitations of the study should be mentioned. Our method did not explore whether students had previous personal (not school-related) experience with anyone who goes to a psychiatrist. Although we are aware that a certain experience can influence social distance in participants, we intentionally avoided any question that could influence students’ attitudes towards an unlabelled vignette. The generalizability of the findings here cannot be assumed due to the use of only two university schools, and further studies are needed to analyse a randomly sampled Belgrade University student population. However, only medical students have a six-year undergraduate programme and other students cannot be matched ideally. Another limitation is using an unpaired sample of medical students; this problem could be overcome by performing a longitudinal follow-up study. We nevertheless believe that these restrictions do not reduce the value and importance of our study.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section23-0020764011408542" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our study evaluated the tendency to stigmatize a hypothetical person who goes to a psychiatrist and showed that it was higher in the final year medical students in comparison to younger colleagues and students of law. Since stigmatization arises after a psychiatric rotation, this finding might be associated with experiences gained through education and could reflect attitudes and behaviour not only towards the patient, but to psychiatry as a discipline.</p>
<p>Psychiatric education can either reinforce stigmatization or reduce it. Therefore, detailed analyses of educational domains that reinforce stigma are the starting point of any anti-stigma action, in parallel with a national multisectoral programme of action to promote the social inclusion of people with mental illness.</p>
