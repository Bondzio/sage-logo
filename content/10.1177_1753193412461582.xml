<abstract>
<p>Four methods for measuring volar angulation in 5th metacarpal neck fractures were tested for validity and reliability. Mid-medullary canal measurement in the lateral view (method MC-90) has previously been proven valid in a cadaveric study, hence used as a reference to test validity of the latter three. These three yielded a significant different mean fracture angle compared with MC-90, with only minor enhancement in reliability. Therefore, none of these three methods is recommended as a better standard method than the MC-90, where reliability was found to be substantial (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.53–0.81). Two methods for measuring shortening in 5th metacarpal neck fractures were compared, and stipulation of shortening by drawing a line through the most distal point of the heads of the neighbouring 3rd and 4th metacarpals (method SH-Stip) is a simple method with excellent reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.81–0.96) for estimating shortening, requiring only radiological examination of the injured hand.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>When treating 5th metacarpal neck fractures, volar angulation of the distal fragment and shortening in the fracture are important determinates to assess indication for operative treatment. Cadaver studies have indicated the need for operative treatment of fractures with more than 30° of volar angulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412461582">Abdon et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412461582">Ali et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412461582">Birndorf et al., 1997</xref>), owing to potential extensor lag in the 5th finger, which may result in diminished hand function. However, this has so far not been demonstrated in clinical studies comparing operative and conservative treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412461582">McKerrell et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193412461582">Strub et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193412461582">Westbrook et al., 2008</xref>), and studies may be influenced by type II error or inclusion bias. Regarding the latter, there exists no definition of metacarpal neck fractures, and the methods for measuring volar angulation in the fracture differs extensively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412461582">Table 1</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, only two articles measured shortening in metacarpal neck fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193412461582">Schadel-Hopfner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193412461582">van Aaken et al., 2007</xref>), but these two studies differed fundamentally in methodology. Therefore, in order to compare studies on 5th metacarpal neck fractures, a common definition of neck fractures should be implemented, and methods for measurement of fracture angulation and shortening should be precisely described.</p>

<p>The few methodological studies testing validity (accuracy) and reliability (reproducibility) in measuring volar angulation in 5th metacarpal neck fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412461582">Braakman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412461582">Lamraski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412461582">Leung et al., 2002</xref>) conclude differently, both regarding standard view (lateral versus oblique view) and preferred method for angle measurement.</p>
<p>Even though excessive shortening is a determinate in deciding to operate or not, no studies we know of have investigated which method is best for the measurement of 5th metacarpal neck fracture shortening.</p>
<p>The aim for this study was to test the validity and reliability of different methods of measuring both volar angulation and shortening in 5th metacarpal neck fractures. We also wanted to measure the normal volar angulation and length in a large series of non-fractured 5th metacarpals. To our knowledge, this has previously only been performed twice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412461582">Abdon et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412461582">Braakman, 1996</xref>), and only in one of the studies a position device was used for a standardized lateral view in a small patient series. An estimate of the normal volar angulation is important, as most emergency departments would not consider performing routinely radiological examinations of the contra-lateral uninjured hand for all 5th metacarpal neck fractures to find the normal angulation in each individual patient.</p>

<sec id="section2-1753193412461582" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>From an ongoing, randomized controlled trial (RCT) on 5th metacarpal fractures (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT01139528), the radiological series from the first 30 consecutive patients included (May 2010–August 2011) satisfying the criteria necessary to perform the radiological investigations (position devices used, 3rd metacarpal included in antero-posterior (AP) view injured hand, obtained radiological series of contra-lateral, non-injured hand) were selected for an inter- and intra-observer radiological study. The RCT was approved by the regional ethical committee.</p>
<p>The radiological series consisted of an AP view, lateral and 30° pronated oblique view for both the injured and the non-injured contra-lateral hand for all patients. The AP view was our preferred view, as it gives a better view of the 5th metacarpal than the postero-anterior (PA) view, owing to the volarly curved arc of the metacarpals. A 30° oblique view was used, in contrast to a 45° view in some other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412461582">Braakman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412461582">Lamraski et al., 2006</xref>), as this is the standard oblique view at our department. The x-rays were standardized by the use of Plexiglas devices for lateral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412461582">Figure 1</xref>) and oblique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412461582">Figure 2</xref>) views, respectively.</p>

</fig>
<p>A medullary and a dorsal measurement method for volar angulation, were defined for each of the two views. For the two medullary methods (Medullary Canal-lateral (MC-90, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193412461582">Figure 3</xref>) and Medullary Canal-oblique (MC-30, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753193412461582">Figure 4</xref>)), the distal line was drawn from the mid-medullary point in the centre of the neck fracture, to the most distal point of the metacarpal head, and the proximal line centrally through the shaft medullary canal, irrespective of where the line hit the basis of the metacarpal. For the two dorsal cortex methods (Dorsal Cortex-lateral (DC-90, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1753193412461582">Figure 5</xref>) and Dorsal Cortex-oblique (DC-30, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1753193412461582">Figure 6</xref>)), the measurement lines were drawn at the most dorsal part of the metacarpal cortices, independently of the small tuberosities where the collateral ligaments were attached. All angle measurements were given in degrees, rounded to the nearest whole number. MC-90 corresponded to the method previously recommended for use in a cadaveric study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412461582">Lamraski et al., 2006</xref>), and was therefore chosen as the reference to test validity of the other three methods.</p>

<p>Two methods for measurement of fracture shortening were defined in the AP view. In the first method, termed Shortening Absolute value (SH-Abs), the length of the fractured 5th metacarpal was measured as a line from the most distal point of the metacarpal head, to a line drawn proximally between the two basal corners of the metacarpal, midway between the latter two. This length was subtracted from the corresponding length in the contra-lateral hand’s non-fractured 5th metacarpal to estimate the shortening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1753193412461582">Figure 7</xref>). This method was considered to be the most valid as it used the contra-lateral non-injured hand as the reference. In the second method, termed Shortening Stipulated (SH-Stip), a line was drawn through the most distal point of the heads of the neighbouring 3rd and 4th metacarpals. The shortening was defined as the distance from this line to the most distal point of the fractured 5th metacarpal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1753193412461582">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>All measurements were performed using PACS software (Syngo Imaging V35, Siemens, Germany). Four observers were chosen for the study, representing doctors working in a clinical setting with these fractures, three orthopaedic surgeons and one radiologist. Measurements were performed twice, with a minimum of one month between the evaluations. Both the patient list and the order of the methods used for measurements of volar angulation and shortening were randomized at both sessions in order to minimize memory bias.</p>
<p>Finally, measurements of volar angulation and length in normal 5th metacarpals was performed by one of the observers by the use of methods MC-90 and SH-Stip in the non-fractured 5th metacarpal of the contra-lateral hand of all patients in our journal system from May 2010– December 2011 (<italic>N</italic> = 60) where these series were performed as a part of our ongoing RCT. The position device for lateral view was used for all the patients included.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Data for volar angulation and shortening in the 30 fractures was normally distributed, and students t-test for paired data was used to compare the mean outcome with their standard deviations (SD) for the different methods.</p>
<p>Inter- and intra-observer reliability for all seven methods was estimated by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and their 95% confidence interval (95% CI). ICC is a statistical tool for analysing correlation and reliability, specifically designed for continuous data, as opposed to kappa statistics for categorical data. As for kappa statistics, the value zero implies no more agreement than would be expected by chance alone, and the value 1.00 indicates perfect agreement. Intermediate values were evaluated by guidelines described by Landis and Koch also often applied to kappa statistics, where values below zero were considered as “poor”, values 0.00–0.19 as “slight”, values 0.20–0.39 as “fair”, values 0.40–0.59 as “moderate”, values 0.60–0.79 as “substantial” and values over 0.80 as “excellent” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412461582">Landis and Koch, 1977</xref>).</p>
<p>Linear regression was performed to investigate the degree of association between shortening and volar angulation in the fractures. Statistical significance was set at 0.05.</p>

<p>The data applying method SH-Abs and MC-90 were used for the regression analysis, as these were considered as the two valid methods for measuring shortening and volar angulation. The correlation was significant (Pearson Correlation Coefficient 0.362, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, not allowing for clustering of observations).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>CT scans would yield the most valid measurements of volar angulation of 5th metacarpal neck fractures, but this is rarely accessible or affordable in a normal clinical setting. In plain radiographs, we hypothesized that the most valid method was method MC-90, which is the standard for measurements of fracture angles in long bones. It is also based on previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412461582">Lamraski et al., 2006</xref>), where the validity of different methods for estimating volar angulation of 5th metacarpal neck osteotomies mimicking fractures was investigated by two observers in a cadaveric study in 30 human hand specimens. They found that measurement lines in the medullary canal on the pronated oblique view (45°) produced a significantly higher reading of mean 10.8° (SD 11.6) of volar angulation than the study’s defined gold standard, which was based on measurement on Kirchner wires in the lateral view. In contrast, lines in the medullary canal on the lateral view (MC-90) did not give a significant different result than the gold standard, and was hence recommended for use in clinical practice. Lamraski and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412461582">2006</xref>) found excellent inter-observer reliability (ICC 0.89), and substantial to excellent (ICC 0.76°0.84) intra-observer reliability for MC-90.</p>
<p>We found substantial inter-observer reliability, and for three of four observers excellent intra-observer reliability for measurements of volar angulation in the fractures when MC-90 was used. Both inter- and intra-observer reliability were excellent when method MC-30 was applied, but this method gave a mean volar angulation of 9° more than MC-90. Method DC-90, which is also in common use (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412461582">Table 1</xref>), gave a mean volar angulation of 9° less than MC-90, and these differences highlight the potential inclusion bias when patients are included in clinical studies. Not surprisingly, both MC-30 and DC-30 were more reliable than MC-90 and DC-90. This can be explained by the partial overlap of the metacarpals in the lateral view, which makes outlining of the individual metacarpals difficult, secondarily affecting measurements of fracture angulation, both by MC-90 and DC-90. This is probably the reason why many emergency departments routinely include oblique views of 30° or 45° in the radiological series, along with the need to detect the fractures not easily seen in AP and lateral views. It has previously been stated that the lateral view is useless in measuring fracture angulation in the 5th metacarpal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412461582">Braakman, 1996</xref>), but this is in contrast to the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412461582">Lamraski and co-workers (2006)</xref>, and now of our study.</p>
<p>An investigation of the radiological series of 160 patients with fractures of the 4th and 5th metacarpals treated conservatively concluded that the PA view and the oblique pronated view (45°) was sufficient to give a treatment plan for all patients, except for proximal comminuted fractures or signs of pronounced PA dislocation where the supplement of the lateral view was recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412461582">Braakman, 1998</xref>). This may be true, as most metacarpal fractures are well treated conservatively without any attempt to reduce the fracture dislocations. In clinical studies however, the lateral view, preferably standardized with a position device, should be included in the radiological series to ensure the validity of the measurement of fracture angulation. To avoid the problem of metacarpal overlap in the lateral view, MC-30 can be used. If so, one has to bear in mind that the volar angulation in the fracture is over-estimated by approximately 10°. We prefer to recommend MC-90 as it was proven to be sufficiently reliable, with a maximum of 5° difference in mean angulation in any of the pairs of observers.</p>
<p>Leung and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412461582">2002</xref>) tested intra- and inter-observer reliability of measurement of volar angulation in 5th metacarpal neck fractures, where three observers read the radiological series of 32 consecutive patients. Solely the lateral view was used for the interpretations, and the two methods used for measurements (Central Canal Method and Dorsal Cortex Method) were equivalent to methods MC-90 and DC-90 in our study. Inter-observer reliability was an average of 0.16 (range 0.00–0.39) for MC-90, and an average of 0.19 (range 0.07–0.40) for DC-90, when weighted Kappa coefficients were used. Intra-observer reliability was an average of 0.31 for MC-90 and an average of 0.21 for DC-90. Leung and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412461582">2002</xref>) concluded that the reliability was poor for both methods, and probably responsible for some of the controversy in the literature on treatment of metacarpal neck fractures. Our results are not directly comparable to Leung and co-workers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412461582">2002</xref>), as we (as Lamraski and co-workers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412461582">2006</xref>) have used ICCs designed for continuous data instead of weighted Kappa coefficients. However, we have demonstrated a higher reliability for both MC-90 and DC-90 than did Leung and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412461582">2002</xref>), and do not consider poor reliability for measurements of volar angulation as important as the lack of consensus on choice of method for measuring volar angulation.</p>
<p>The finding of mean volar angulation in the neck area of 15° (SD 4) when method MC-90 was applied in our series of 60 non-injured contra-lateral 5th metacarpals, supports a study where the volar angulation in 24 normal 5th metacarpals was found to be 14° (SD 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412461582">Abdon et al., 1984</xref>). In this study, a Plexiglas device to standardize the radiographic lateral view was used, and the angle was measured by a medullary method. In a reference guide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412461582">Braakman, 1996</xref>), 225 “total hand” radiographs were examined to give an estimate of the normal angulation in the ulnar two metacarpals, but it was not stated whether a position device was used for the radiological series. Four angles were measured for all patients in both PA and 45° oblique views, where the subcapital-axis angle corresponds to the angles measured in our study. The mean values of 11° (SD 7) for men and 10° (SD 7) for women are not directly comparable to our results of mean 15° (SD 4), as they were measured in 45° oblique view. For practical purposes, by comparing our results with Abdon and co-workers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412461582">1984</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412461582">Braakman’s (1996)</xref>, we can conclude that the normal volar subcapital angulation in 5th metacarpals is 15°. More accurate estimates of this value are probably not necessary to perform in the future.</p>
<p>For estimation of shortening in the fracture, we hypothesized that the most valid method was the SH-Abs. However, the reliability of this method was uncertain. Furthermore, SH-Abs requires a radiological series of the contra-lateral, non-injured hand, which is easy to perform in a clinical study, but may be difficult in a clinical setting. Therefore, it was considered highly interesting to evaluate the validity of SH-Stip compared with SH-Abs, as the former is a commonly used method for estimating shortening in a fractured 5th metacarpal, previously used in one article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193412461582">Schadel-Hopfner et al., 2007</xref>). In our study, we demonstrated that SH-Stip yielded 1 mm higher readings than SH-Abs, and that the observed difference is attributed to the normal anatomy in the hand. SH-Stip was demonstrated to be excellent, almost perfectly reliable, and better than SH-Abs, probably owing to fewer measurement lines than for the latter method. On the basis of this study, we can recommend the very simple-in-use SH-Stip as a standard method for measurement of shortening in 5th metacarpal fractures, as long as one subtracts 1 mm from the measured shortening. Finally, one has to remember that SH-Stip, as well as SH-Abs and another previously proposed method for estimating shortening, where the distance between the most distal point in the 4th and 5th metacarpal bilaterally was compared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193412461582">van Aaken et al., 2007</xref>), are all affected by previous injury to the other metacarpals (neighbouring 3rd and 4th metacarpals, or contra-lateral 5th metacarpal).</p>
<p>The strengths of our study are the standardized methods for performing radiological series, and the relative high number of observers and methods for measuring volar angulation in the fracture. The attempt of finding the best method for measuring shortening has not previously been described methodologically, neither has there been reported investigations of the association between volar angulation and shortening in the fractures. Also, we present a relatively high number of patients with a standardized normal hand radiological series to give an estimate of normal volar angulation and shortening in 5th metacarpal neck fractures. The article might have been stronger if we have had even more radiological series of neck fractures included, but the number of 30 was considered adequate. Computed tomography (CT) scans of the 30 patients would have attributed to a better validity testing of the different methods for measuring volar angulation in the fractures. This was not performed, as we believed Lamraski and co-workers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412461582">2006</xref>) cadaveric model had validated the MC-90 method sufficiently. In addition, making 30 patients with 5th metacarpal neck fractures meet for CT scans solely for academic purposes was considered a very difficult task owing to the low compliance in this patient group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193412461582">Sletten et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193412461582">Westbrook et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>We have demonstrated that clinical studies on 5th metacarpal neck fractures suffer from a lack of a standardized radiological protocol. When performing future studies on metacarpal fractures, one should aim to improve methodological weaknesses seen in many previous studies. The fracture type studied should be precisely defined, and methods for measuring volar angulation and shortening in the fracture should be accurately described to minimize inclusion bias. This article supports the work of Lamraski and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412461582">2006</xref>), as we recommend the use of MC-90 when measuring volar angulation in 5th metacarpal neck fractures. We can also recommend SH-Stip when measuring shortening, both in clinical studies and in daily clinical practice. We found a linear association between volar angulation and shortening in the fractures, demonstrated in our study to be 2.4° for each millimetre of increased shortening. Finally, we have demonstrated the normal volar angulation in a non-injured 5th metacarpal to be 15° (SD 4), in coherence with the often-quoted finding of 14° (SD 2) by Abdon and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412461582">1984</xref>).</p>
