<abstract>
<p>The interest in and acceptance of service-learning has insufficiently addressed the inextricable emotional linkage to all of its functions. Utilizing Coles’ (1993) conceptualization of the intricate role of emotion in service-learning, this study explored how and why emotion and feeling are central to college students’ service-learning experiences. Multiple data sources were collected across three consecutive semesters from a total of 42 college students who participated in the same service-learning program in southeastern United States. Inductive analyses revealed wide-ranging and ever-changing breadth of emotion were experienced across and within participating college students, particularly emotional states that reflected Coles’ hazards of “arrogance, anger, and bitterness” and satisfaction of “something done, someone reached.” Regardless whether satisfying or hazardous emotion states were felt, they were mainly the result of students’ previous service experiences and/or expectations. Implications of these results for future research and the design of service-learning programs are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Service-learning has become an accepted form of pedagogy around the globe, and understanding the effects of service-learning has blossomed into a necessary and important line of inquiry among educational researchers. By the turn of the century, several reviews highlighted the expansive impact that service-learning can have on all those involved, including K-12 youth, undergraduate students, faculty, schools and universities, and local communities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053825913487885">Billig, n.d</xref>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053825913487885">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053825913487885">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053825913487885">Eyler, Giles, Stenson, &amp; Gray, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1053825913487885">Vogelgesang &amp; Astin, 2000</xref>). Clearly, the most researched constituent then and still today are the service providers, whether they are adolescents or undergraduate students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053825913487885">Carson &amp; Raguse, 2013</xref>). Outcomes are numerous and span personal outcomes such as attitude and leadership skills (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053825913487885">Gutheil, Chernesky, &amp; Sherratt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1053825913487885">Ngai, 2006</xref>); social outcomes such as civic responsibility, commitment to service, respect for diversity, and cultural competency (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053825913487885">Domangue &amp; Carson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1053825913487885">Lee, Olszweski-Kubilius, &amp; Donahue, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053825913487885">Meaney, Bohler, Kopf, Hernandez, &amp; Scott, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1053825913487885">Ngai, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1053825913487885">Schmidt, Shumow, &amp; Kacker, 2007</xref>); learning outcomes such as grades and the application of knowledge (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053825913487885">Gutheil et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1053825913487885">Scales, Roehlkepartain, Neal, Kielsmeier, &amp; Benson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1053825913487885">Schmidt et al., 2007</xref>); and career development outcomes such as job awareness and exploration (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053825913487885">Richardson, 2006</xref>). However, the literature is lacking in any real explanation of the concrete emotional connections that might allow such outcomes to be achieved. This article explores <italic>how</italic> and <italic>why</italic> emotion and emotional experience are central components of service-learning for college students.</p>

<title>Review of Literature</title>

<title>Emotion in Education</title>
<p>Despite the absence of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1053825913487885">Schutz &amp; Lanehart, 2002</xref>), emotional experience is recognized as a vital and influential aspect of educational contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1053825913487885">Schutz &amp; Pekrun, 2007</xref>). In many ways, learning and teaching are considered <italic>emotional practices</italic> that activate, color, and infuse feeling throughout inner (feeling) and outer (expression) streams of experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053825913487885">Denzin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053825913487885">Hargreaves, 1998</xref>). By definition, emotions as valenced (categorized as positive or negative) subjective states evoked by a situation, object, or event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1053825913487885">Frijda, 2008</xref>) that are embedded in nearly everything students and teachers do, think, and feel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1053825913487885">Schutz &amp; Pekrun, 2007</xref>). For example, student emotion has been shown to be a significant predictor of GPA scores above and beyond cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053825913487885">Gumora &amp; Arsenio, 2002</xref>), whereas teachers’ emotion, specifically feelings of emotional exhaustion, serves as the primary ingredient of the burnout process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053825913487885">Carson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Emotion can also be a social, interactional experience. As such, the emotions of students and teachers can elicit emotional and behavioral responses in the other. Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053825913487885">Denzin’s (2007)</xref> notion of emotional understanding, students and teachers may alter their feelings and actions based on their interpretation of and degree to which they share or absorb one another’s emotional expression. This congruent emotional transaction across individuals has been referred to as <italic>emotional contagion</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053825913487885">Hatfield, Cacioppo, &amp; Rapson, 1992</xref>). As an illustration, McCaughtry and colleagues have repeatedly shown how the consideration of students’ emotion influenced teachers’ feelings and actions in several ways, such as their curriculum decisions, pedagogical approaches, and support or resistance for school policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1053825913487885">McCaughtry, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053825913487885">2004b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053825913487885">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1053825913487885">McCaughtry, Barnard, Martin, Shen, &amp; Kulinna, 2006</xref>). On the flip side, students’ perceptions of teachers’ emotional practice, in the form of instructional quality competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053825913487885">Glaser-Zikuda &amp; Fuss, 2008</xref>), or the learning environment created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053825913487885">Frenzel, Pekrun, &amp; Goetz, 2007</xref>), is linked to students’ emotional well-being and experience at school. Clearly, the reciprocal nature of the service-learning provides fertile ground for the dynamic interchange of emotional experience.</p>

<title>Emotion in Service-Learning</title>
<p>To date, only two studies have addressed the emotional nature of service-learning. One examined the role of emotion deliberately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1053825913487885">Yob, 2000</xref>) and found that a music education service-learning experience aroused emotional responses in college students who were specific, focused, and connected to the real world. The other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053825913487885">Astin, Vogelgesang, Ikeda, &amp; Yee, 2000</xref>) set out to determine the effect of various service factors on the prediction of student outcomes. Not surprisingly, this mixed-methods, national study with more than 22,000 college undergraduates who were engaged in either service-learning or community service found that emotional support from faculty, albeit measured by what are seemingly markers of personal support (i.e., respect, honesty, interest, advice, encouragement), explained more of the effects of service on student outcomes than any other factor. In fact, emotional support from faculty had the most powerful mediating influence on students’ commitment to promoting racial understanding, academic skills (i.e., critical thinking and writing), interpersonal skills, and leadership ability. In addition, qualitative results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053825913487885">Astin et al.’s (2000)</xref> study were unexpectedly but inherently filled with emotion. They noted how faculty realized that “service experiences were generating a lot of emotional and personal growth in students” (p. 80) and that student learning outcome reflections were “strongly linked to personal, and occasionally emotional, experiences they have had at their service sites” (p. 91). Citing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053825913487885">Fried (1999)</xref>, they concluded that students learn in a multitude of ways from service, one being “emotionally” (p. 89).</p>
<p>While these initial attempts are enlightening and, in many ways, put emotional experience on the conceptual map in service-learning, they lack the clarity and substance necessary for truly understanding the role of emotion in service-learning practice. Researchers need to move beyond simply commenting about the important emotional connections in service-learning and start clearly showing <italic>how</italic> and <italic>why</italic> emotion is fundamental to service-learning practice. This study attempted to embark upon this endeavor from a critical perspective, using the landmark work of Robert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487885">Coles (1993)</xref>, <italic>The Call to Service: A Witness to Idealism</italic>, as a conceptual backdrop.</p>

<title>Emotions As “Satisfactions” and “Hazards” of Service Work</title>
<p>Drawing extensively on his personal encounters, models, and reflections of service, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487885">Coles (1993)</xref> outlined several “satisfactions” and “hazards” he believed were associated with serving others. Upon careful consideration, it is evident that to some degree, the underpinnings of each clearly portray the emotional ups and downs of those rending service. <italic>Satisfactions</italic> were conceptualized to stem from the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1053825913487885" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Something done, someone reached</italic>: the pleasure and privilege of completing benevolent service acts that enhance the lives of those involved.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Moral purpose</italic>: the service encounter is a mutual moral activity; it answers a moral call in the world while strengthening the moral beliefs and values of those volunteering (i.e., providing a sense of purpose in life).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Personal affirmation</italic>: the service enables one to rediscover the inherent gifts one has to offer the world that are usually taken for granted.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Stoic endurance</italic>: a mix between being fully committed to the work and those served, yet remaining somewhat detached (i.e., keeping in perspective what can and cannot be accomplished).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Boost to success</italic>: the service work is also self-serving, providing distinguishing experiences that aid career advancement (e.g., purposefully highlighted in job interviews).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487885">Coles (1993)</xref> suggested that satisfactions listed above will likely prevail among many service providers, but cautioned there are also plenty of second thoughts that come from service work. He labeled these thoughts as a progression of <italic>hazards</italic> that are tied to</p>
<list id="list2-1053825913487885" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Weariness and resignation</italic>: service work, over time, proves to be psychologically draining and increasingly disinteresting to providers who begin thinking of doing something else or, at the very at least, taking an extended break.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Cynicism</italic>: a gloomy doubtfulness about the world, people, and their potential that skeptically overshadows any sense of hope for the service work; results in serious questioning of whether the service work is even impactful.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Arrogance, anger, and bitterness</italic>: a growing feeling of outrage by the problems the service work is trying to resolve, sometimes enacted on others who are assisting in the work, and becomes embittered with how people in power do nothing; eventually the service provider believes they are the only ones who are doing anything.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Despair</italic>: a deepening sadness for the impermeable misfortunes of others, making it difficult to notice anything positive from the service work besides the advantages accrued to the service providers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Burnout (depression)</italic>: a general sense of utter disappointment, hopelessness, or exhaustion that arise with the arduous duties of service work; a depressive condition takes over the spirit and brings with it devastating feelings of “going through the motions” (with nothing left to give) or “terminating the work altogether.”</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The satisfactions (or motivations) and hazards (or consequences) of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487885">Coles’ (1993)</xref> approach point not only to the inherent dilemmas of those who heed the call of service but also the interactional make-up of service experience. That is, service is a reciprocal, rather than a hierarchical, relationship between helper and helped or giver and receiver, as roles constantly dissolve over time. Together, Coles’ provides a multifaceted framework for the rich and dynamic nature of emotional experience in service work.</p>

<title>Purpose of the Study</title>
<p>While emotion has been shown to be of prime importance to the processes of teaching and learning in educational contexts, it has been inadequately articulated in service-learning literature. A critical study that seeks to learn more about the kinds and significance of emotional experience in service-learning provides a valuable step toward addressing this need. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to address this shortage by utilizing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487885">Coles’ (1993)</xref> model of satisfactions and hazards to examine the emotional dimension of service-learning, particularly as to <italic>how</italic> and <italic>why</italic> emotion and feeling are central to college students’ service-learning experiences. Results provide a foundation for the design of future service-learning programs that foster meaningful and long-lasting emotional connections with college students that are ultimately transferable to new service contexts.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This study evolved across 2.5 years of planning, creating, implementing, evaluating, and investigating a service-learning program that began in the wake of hurricanes Katrina and Rita. As hundreds of thousands of Mississippi gulf coast residents relocated to temporary living conditions in Louisiana, a consortium of multidisciplinary faculty, not-for-profit organizations (e.g., YWCA, Early Head Start, etc.), and community leaders/members partnered to provide an array of appealing and educationally valuable after-school services to the impacted children and teens. As part of these efforts, Lifetime Exercise and Physical Activity Service-Learning (LE PAS), meaning “the step,” was formed in the summer of 2006 to address the myriad of physical and social needs of K-8 youth living in compact, government-funded, travel-trailers positioned merely feet apart. For 60 to 90 min, 4 days per week, kinesiology undergraduate students and university instructors successfully engaged affected youth in a network of aerobic, rhythmic, and cooperative activities and games. LE PAS maintained programs until the travel-trailer community closed in May 2008, reaching more than 140 undergraduate students, 25 K-5 children, and 10 teens. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053825913487885">Carson (2008)</xref> provides a more complete description of the service-learning context.</p>
<p>While the authors worked with undergraduate students in the service-learning courses and conducted various studies, one common aspect about student experiences became apparent across classroom discussions, observations, reflections, assessments, and informal conversations. This significant aspect, which we as practitioners and researchers could not ignore, was a fluid and dynamic range of emotional arousal and response.</p>
<sec id="section8-1053825913487885">
<title>Data Sources and Participants</title>
<p>Data for this study were compiled across three different semesters. Although the goal never changed, LE PAS was conducted with undergraduate students from different courses throughout this time period. For one semester, participating students were physical education teacher education majors enrolled in a curriculum development course. During that semester, students were involved in a research project that investigated the role of service-learning in shaping preservice physical education teachers’ cultural competency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053825913487885">Domangue &amp; Carson, 2008</xref>). Data sources included ongoing reflective journals, activity session reflection forms, observations, and interviews. For the two other semesters, the undergraduate students were kinesiology majors enrolled in a motor development course. These students were involved in a research project that sought to explore the impact that LE PAS participation had on their professional aspiration to work with youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053825913487885">Carson &amp; Domangue, 2010</xref>). Data for that study included students’ ongoing reflective journals. All students provided informed consent prior to the collection of any data and approval to conduct these studies was granted by the university’s Institutional Review Board.</p>
<p>For this summative article, data sources consisted of the students’ reflective journals and activity session reflective forms only. Across the semesters for which data were collected, there were a total of 42 students (30 women, 12 men; 32 Caucasian American, 3 African American, 1 Asian American, 4 Other) who participated in LE PAS. These students served as the study participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1053825913487885">
<title>Data Analysis and Trustworthiness</title>
<p>Data sources were analyzed using inductive analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1053825913487885">Patton, 2002</xref>). The three-step inductive analytic procedure of open, axial, and selective coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1053825913487885">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>) was performed to extrapolate the essence and condition of each emotion experience. First, the data were read closely and open-coded for general characteristics that gave the emotional experience more meaning, such as the property of prevalence. After an additional reading of the data, axial coding process allowed for the previously coded data to be grouped according to related or unrelated experiences of emotion (e.g., happiness associated with a positive teaching session, happiness linked to no behavior problems, sadness experienced when observing the children’s living conditions). Finally, these groupings were trimmed and refined over time until they organized around a central idea, or themes. Themes were then compared and contrasted, when relevant, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487885">Coles’ (1993)</xref> conceptualizations of satisfactions and hazards. The inductive analysis process was conducted first, prior to becoming familiar with or infusing Coles’ work, to minimize the influence of Coles’ propositions to the coding and categorizing of the data. Consequently, findings from this study are grounded in integrated data.</p>
<p>Five techniques, offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053825913487885">Lincoln and Guba (1985)</xref>, helped facilitate trustworthiness in the findings. Triangulation was achieved as more than one data source (i.e., reflective journals, activity session reflective forms), collected across two different semesters, yielded the results in this study. All analyses were conducted by an independent researcher who had no previous knowledge of Coles’ conceptual framework or connection to the service-learning courses to further validate the inductive process. An experienced peer debriefer was consulted throughout the analysis to challenge the categorizing and coding of the data. A researcher journal was kept and periodically checked by the peer debriefer to maintain empathic neutrality. Member checks were used to ensure all college students felt the final interpretations were accurate. Furthermore, pseudonyms were used in the reporting of the findings to maintain the anonymity of the students.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1053825913487885">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>Two thematic schemes emerged from the data sources that provide insight into the emotional accompaniment of service-learning among participants. One illuminated the widespread emotional experiences encountered by college students in the service-learning context, and another uncovered a collection of particular emotional states evoked from service-learning involvement that reflect and add meaning to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487885">Coles’ (1993)</xref> conceptualizations of satisfactions and hazards. Representative data clips for each theme are presented and discussed below.</p>
<sec id="section11-1053825913487885">
<title>Service-Learning As an Emotional Roller Coaster: Across and Within Experiences</title>
<p>Throughout each semester, it became apparent that service-learning imparted a dissimilar emotional outlook <italic>across</italic> participating college students. Many students expressed that during their involvement in LE PAS, they felt satisfying emotional reactions, whereas the same service-learning experience aroused hazardous emotions in others. For example, students’ emotional responses ranged from “I feel inspired” (Susan) and “emotionally refreshed” (Angela) to “this task felt like a burden rather than a joy to do” (Julia). These discrepant feeling statements from the same service-learning experience reiterate the self-referent, situated nature of emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053825913487885">Denzin, 2007</xref>). That is, felt emotions of a current experience are approximations of past emotion-laden experiences, all of which are dependent on the person who feels them. Consequently, the differing emotions constructed from service-learning may become part of one’s emotional biography that are drawn upon in the future, and therefore, could explain why certain students approach or avoid service opportunities later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053825913487885">Carson &amp; Domangue, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Data also revealed that a short-lived, fluctuating stream of emotional experience existed <italic>within</italic> students throughout their involvement in service-learning. Several students described the LE PAS experience as an emotional roller coaster of highs and lows, which, in many ways, echo the multiple and ever-changing internal emotional dilemmas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487885">Coles (1993)</xref> referred to as satisfactions and hazards, associated with service work. For instance, Camille reflected, “When working with some of the teens, I had many emotions running through my head. I was nervous, compassionate, and somewhat heart-broken.”</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487885">Coles (1993)</xref> posited that satisfactions served as motivations for commencing or persevering in-service work, while hazards developed over time as consequences from service work. There were students whose spectrum of emotional experience reflected this sequence. Angela expressed excitement for her service-learning involvement when learning that children’s test scores and grades improved, while truancy rates decreased, across the time period that LE PAS and other educational services were offered at the travel-trailer site. She wrote, “I was excited to see the resiliency of the kids and hope that the instructor and kids possess.” Over time, while serving in the setting throughout the semester, she began to ponder and compare her potentially privileged childhood experiences with what she was observing. She expressed, “I felt a degree of shame for all the opportunities that I have been afforded as a result of my White, upper-middle class upbringing.”</p>
<p>However, for many students, the sequence or emotional experience occurred in the opposite direction as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487885">Coles (1993)</xref> proposed, that is, from hazards to satisfactions. Hazardous notions of “cynicism” or “despair,” often tied to children’s unfathomable living conditions, were disclosed early in the service-learning experience. Samantha wrote, “When I first arrived in the community, I was really saddened by the conditions people had to live in. The one group that I feel really sad for is the young children.” Likewise, Ping stated, “It made me sad to see so many people displaced from their homes and having to make a life in a guarded community.”</p>
<p>Over time, these initial impressions of the children and the community where they live were dashed and replaced with satisfying feelings of “something done, something reached.” According to Angela, the replacement was even personally rewarding, “Though things at [the service-learning site] struck me as sad at times, I found the experience to be mentally and emotionally refreshing.” The following reflections encapsulate a similar shift in emotional response:<disp-quote>
<p>I really enjoyed being with the kids and I think that they enjoyed the fact that we were with them as well. At first, emotionally, I thought that I would feel sorry for the kids and their situation. I thought that they would be taking it hard, but when we arrived they were in high-spirits. That really made me admire them and realize how strong they were. (Erin)</p>
<p>When I first arrived on site, I was heartbroken over the sad faces I saw as I drove on the grounds. I could not help but feeling heart rendering sadness for the people living in the ridiculously small trailers. I felt helpless to change the situation. However, when I worked with the children, I regained a sense of hope and faith. These children have their entire lives ahead of them. (Kathleen)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Both sequences of emotion experience (satisfactions to hazards, or hazards to satisfactions) were significantly different from the even keel emotional encounter that Julia experienced. Julia was straightforward about her flat affect concerning the service-learning site and her involvement in LE PAS. She said,<disp-quote>
<p>This experience simply felt like a required task for class . . . Although I did not grow up as impoverished as some of these residents, I did not come from a wealthy family. While my home did not float away, I have suffered hardships in my life as well. I had to bury both of my parents within a year of each other before my twenty-first birthday. Instead of expecting someone or the government to take care of me, I had to quickly embrace adulthood and responsibility . . . While my experiences may not directly compare to these residents, I cannot force myself to feel sympathy for people who do not want to help themselves.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In many ways, Julia did not associate with any of the satisfactions or hazards proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487885">Coles (1993)</xref>. Rather, she unflinchingly distanced herself from the service-learning experience, and in doing so, became pessimistic and even arrogant toward the potential of service work and those being served. It would be a disservice for Julia’s emotional experience to be ignored or devalued, as her realizations highlight the importance of validating Coles’ conceptualization. Perhaps, there are further satisfactions and/or hazards yet to be identified that are specific to service-learning.</p>
<p>Collectively, these excerpts highlight <italic>how</italic> college students experience dynamic emotional swings while being engaged in service-learning. This finding coincides with emotion scholars who suggest that emotions are quick to occur but quick to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1053825913487885">Schutz &amp; DeCuir, 2002</xref>), and this fluidity is a structure of lived experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053825913487885">Denzin, 2007</xref>). If service-learning seemingly arouses a range of diverse, even opposite, emotions in college students that fluctuate over time, it might behoove future practitioners and researchers to explore the specific emotional connections from service-learning that spark any or all of its positive personal, social, learning, and career development outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053825913487885">Billig, n.d</xref>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053825913487885">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053825913487885">Eyler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1053825913487885">Vogelgesang &amp; Astin, 2000</xref>). A valuable first step, according to these results, would be the implementation of reflective service-learning endeavors that, at the very least, consider the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487885">Coles’ (1993)</xref> repertoire of satisfactions and hazards embodied in service work. However, as the data suggests, students’ emotional experience should be continually monitored as they are not fixed entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1053825913487885">Miller, 2012</xref>). Eventually, service-learning programs could be designed to prompt the particular satisfactions and assuage hazardous responses.</p>

<title>Service-Learning As a Collection of Hazardous and Satisfying Emotion States</title>
<p>The students expressed a bevy of specific emotion states experienced from service-learning, including anger, frustration, sympathy, inspiration, happiness, sadness, gratitude, excitement, shame, admiration, anxiety, and compassion. These emotion states seemed inherent to many of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487885">Coles’ (1993)</xref> hazards and satisfactions, but mainly the hazards of “arrogance, anger, and bitterness” and the satisfactions of “something done, someone reached,” and in doing so, point to reasons <italic>why</italic> certain emotions are experienced in service-learning. In many ways, the emotion explanations for each main hazard and satisfaction revealed below could extend Coles’ conceptualization of hazards and satisfactions.</p>

<title>Hazardous Emotion States Tied to “Arrogance, Anger, and Bitterness.”</title>
<p>The emotion states tied to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487885">Coles’ (1993)</xref> hazards of “arrogance, anger, and bitterness” appeared to arise from three general explanations: (a) previous experiences that are part of the students’ emotional biographies, (b) unmet <italic>or</italic> exceeded expectations of the service-learning site or experience, or (c) a combination of both previous experience and expectations (a and b).</p>
<sec id="section14-1053825913487885">
<title>Brought about by previous experiences that are part of students’ emotional biographies</title>
<p>One student, Tina, articulated the internal battle she encountered when assuming that her upbringing was better than the community she was serving, because she perceived the community as “different.” She wrote,<disp-quote>
<p>While it infuriated me to see children wandering around on their own and see a great-grandmother allow her great-grandchild to act in a way that I thought was inappropriate, I should not be so upset until I understand the full context in which these things happen.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Her reflection begins in a state of anger and frustration, but then transforms into a state of flexibility in her understanding of the community and the way she experienced the community. As noted in the first theme, this transformation recapitulates the oscillation of emotional states that becomes part of an individual as an ongoing stream of experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053825913487885">Denzin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1053825913487885">Schutz &amp; DeCuir, 2002</xref>). However, it also highlights the continuity (and perhaps even circularity) of emotional experience encased within the boundaries of prior experience and conceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053825913487885">Denzin, 2007</xref>). In the current scenario, the cultural script this student had already imposed on a community that was not her own shaped her affective responses to a child who acted in a way that she “thought was inappropriate.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1053825913487885">
<title>Brought about by unmet expectations of the service-learning site or experience</title>
<p>Feelings of anger and frustration were not just observed by way of community-dependent situations cropping up onsite but also by way of situations specific to the service-learning program itself. For example, Dexter wrote,<disp-quote>
<p>I was really angry the whole time we were here today. First, we had to go find elementary students to play with because no children were waiting for us. The second thing that made me mad was that Justin didn’t lead the older students in anything. All he did was play a pickup game of basketball with three older guys. It really aggravates me when the main person griping and complaining about why we should be involved in LE PAS doesn’t do anything when he goes out there.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Dexter’s reflections are important because they reaffirm the social composition of emotional experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053825913487885">Denzin, 2007</xref>). Service-learning is a social experience, and therefore by characterization becomes an emotional experience. In this case, Dexter connected his ideologies concerning Justin’s previous comments about serving to his interpretation of Justin as a perceived bystander in this specific experience, which became integral to the production of his own perspective and feelings. The social interplay of emotional practice has been reported previously between teachers and students in the broader educational arena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053825913487885">Frenzel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053825913487885">Glaser-Zikuda &amp; Fuss, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1053825913487885">McCaughtry, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053825913487885">2004b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053825913487885">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1053825913487885">McCaughtry et al., 2006</xref>), and is now extended with data between college students in the specific field of service-learning. Further study should validate this connection.</p>

<title>Brought about by a combination of expectations and previous experience</title>
<p>Equally, service-learning, by design, typically serves larger communities or neighborhoods that are new or unfamiliar to participating college students. LE PAS was no different. LE PAS was situated in a temporary housing site for the most economically poor after the hurricanes of 2005, and thus, allowed participants to observe and be privy to aspects of a very unique and unfamiliar setting. Unpleasant emotions arose as a result of students’ degree of unfamiliarly, particularly when it conflicted with their own expectations of a living community. For example, Kevin reflected,<disp-quote>
<p>I observed something that really bothered me. Three young adult males were walking around the area with pit bulls. They began letting the dogs fight between each other. The men just let these dogs fight right in front of me. This bothered me because I am a big dog lover and this type of behavior is not only against the law, but completely cruel. I wanted to do something so bad, but I knew that I was way out of place to. So, I bit my tongue and went into the learning center. This absolutely infuriated me, and I seriously thought about leaving. I just went and sat by the playground to wait for the kids. The reason I stayed is because yesterday was such a good day. The kids had so much fun that I did not want to punish them for someone else.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While discomforting situations can occur in any community, we contend that because Kevin perceived himself as an outsider due to limited knowledge and experience, deep feelings of anger were provoked. A clear implication from this finding is that students should be given ample time to get acquainted with the reality of a service-learning site, encouraged to critically examine their individual expectations and experiences, and challenge themselves to question how and why such expectations were derived. The role of critical reflection in LE PAS was expanded upon by Domangue and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053825913487885">Carson (2008)</xref>.</p>

<p>Across the semesters, the number of experiences that the students described as joyful or happy drastically outweighed the experiences that elicited distress or depressed emotions. Interestingly, in all instances, sources of joy and happiness were linked to students’ feeling of success while working with the children, particularly with regard to the anticipation that their particular service would positively impact the children’s lives.</p>
<p>Sarah wrote, “It was an enjoyable experience because I saw the enthusiasm some of the children had for physical activity.” On a separate occasion, she reflected,<disp-quote>
<p>Wow! Today was amazing. I was little scared at first, because I wasn’t sure of my activities and how they would go over with the children, but I was silly for thinking that . . . The students wanted to keep playing it. That is how much fun they had doing that activity.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Tina wrote, “I really enjoyed playing with the children and I think I could have run around with them all day long playing on that playground.” While reflecting on her entire service-learning experience, Anna discussed the delight she experienced teaching the students about the importance of being physically active. She stated,<disp-quote>
<p>There is a certain joy that it brings you. Knowing that you influenced someone’s life and their future decisions. Seeing them succeed because of what you have taught them, whether it be school-related or life-related, is a reward that not everyone can receive.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The sense of accomplishment these students achieved from their involvement in service-learning could be explained, as was done with certain distress emotions, by the degree to which their preconceived expectations were met. In contrast to distress emotions, excitement emotions appear to be elicited when expectations are not just attained, but surpassed. Again, this distinction brings to light the need for students and instructors alike to be given ample opportunities to share and set sensible expectations for a service-learning experience.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It has been known for some time that emotions are embedded in the thoughts, feelings, and actions of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053825913487885">Byrne, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053825913487885">Dorman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053825913487885">Gumora &amp; Arsenio, 2002</xref>). However, the understanding of emotion in service-learning has been a largely underdeveloped area of study. The unique contribution of this study, as opposed to previous emotion literature in education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1053825913487885">Meyer &amp; Turner, 2002</xref>) and service-learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053825913487885">Astin et al., 2000</xref>), is that it purposefully set out to explore the emotional dimension in service-learning. In particular, this study used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487885">Coles’ (1993)</xref> conceptualization of satisfactions and hazards to understand <italic>how</italic> and <italic>why</italic> emotion and feeling are integral to students’ service-learning experience.</p>
<p>To address the <italic>how</italic> aim, findings confirmed that service-learning radiates streams of emotional experience in college students that are distinct, malleable, and varied across students and time. Throughout the service-learning experience, some students’ emotional experience shifted from satisfactions to hazards, the direction purported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487885">Coles (1993)</xref>, others shifted from hazards to satisfactions, whereas a few did not shift at all. Regardless of the sequence experienced, it is worth noting that a wide range of felt emotion was prevalent among service-learning participants, and not just community service volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487885">Coles, 1993</xref>). Indeed, the act of serving is an emotional endeavor that transcends all forms of rendered service.</p>
<p>To address the <italic>why</italic> aim, the wide array of emotion states apparent to students’ service-learning experience seem to mostly reflect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487885">Coles’ (1993)</xref> satisfaction of “something done, someone reached” and hazards of “arrogance, anger, and bitterness.” Regardless of whether satisfying or hazardous emotion states were felt, they, in some way, seemed to stem from students’ initial expectations related to either previous life or service-learning experiences, or the service-learning site itself. While the purpose of this study was not to look specifically at sociocultural aspects of emotions, we recognize the significant role that cultural norms and expectations contribute to the formation of individuals’ emotional biographies. In this way, the interconnectedness (production, coproduction, and reproduction) of one’s previous and future emotional experience and expectations was evident in the service-learning context as, “what is felt now is shaped by what will be felt, and what will be felt is shaped by what was felt” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053825913487885">Denzin, 2007</xref>, p. 79).</p>
<p>Practitioners and researchers could utilize these results in several ways that have been suggested by findings from previous service-learning studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053825913487885">Domangue &amp; Carson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053825913487885">Meaney et al., 2008</xref>). First, since the role of emotion is real and palpable in service-learning, future practitioners and researchers need to recognize this by encouraging students to express and revisit their emotional experiences in service-learning. Second, the prior expectations and related experiences of college students should be targeted early and often via service-learning orientations onsite and instilling habitual, open reflective discussions that brings emotion to students’ consciousness throughout the course. Such strategies could aid in curbing the onset of hazardous emotional experience before they become actualized, or assist in shifting hazardous emotional experiences to satisfying emotion experiences later in the service-learning program. Third, one question that remains is whether emotion aroused from service-learning will actually transfer into future sustainable outcomes with regard to service and learning. Service-learning programs that infuse satisfying emotions in its participants (i.e., college students, instructors, and children, etc.), while allowing lessons to be learned from the experience of hazardous emotional states, may increase the likelihood that transfer will occur to new service and educational contexts.</p>
<p>A logical, subsequent step for researchers might be an action research study that specifically examines how undergraduate students affectively experience all aspects of a service-learning project, while looking closely at the transformative, reciprocal relationship between those serving and those served (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487885">Coles, 1993</xref>). Questions that might be addressed from this type of research include the following: (a) What roles do the emotional experiences of those served play in constructing the emotional experiences of those serving, and vice versa? (b) What can university instructors do to facilitate satisfying emotional experiences for both students and those being served?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1053825913487885">2</xref></sup> Throughout the semester, students, university instructors, and those being served could be asked to openly journal or blog about their feelings and how their feelings are connected to their service-learning experience. At the end of the semester, students could map out how their emotions were connected to previous experiences in service-based settings, stereotypes about certain groups, interest in the project and expectations for it, specific emotion-inducing events, and aspects that are out of their control. Results would reiterate the important, dynamic role of emotion already shown in education studies between K-12 students and teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053825913487885">Frenzel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053825913487885">Glaser-Zikuda &amp; Fuss, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1053825913487885">McCaughtry, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053825913487885">2004b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053825913487885">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1053825913487885">McCaughtry et al., 2006</xref>), but this time in university service-learning settings.</p>
