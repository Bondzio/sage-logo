<sec id="sec1-1462474511401514"><title>Mona Pauline Lynch, <italic>Sunbelt Justice: Arizona and the Transformation of American Punishment</italic>, Stanford Law Books: Stanford, CA, 2009; 267 pp.: 0804762856, $24.95 (pbk)</title>
<p>Arizona is a rabid Chihuahua to America’s carceral Cerberus. A sparsely populated arid expanse with just one megalopolis, Phoenix, the state confines only a fraction of the US prison population, roughly 2.5 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1462474511401514">Pew, 2010</xref>: 7). But what it lacks in size, it makes up for in severity. With unyielding sentencing statutes, deliberately debasing conditions of confinement – including tent cities and two supermaxes – and an imprisonment rate higher than any state outside the South (565 per 100,000), Arizona typifies the USA’s ‘devolving standards of decency’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1462474511401514">West and Sabol, 2009</xref>, 11; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1462474511401514">Haney, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>As in other Sunbelt states, with the sometimes exception of California, Arizona’s harsh style of criminal justice dovetails with a penurious approach to social governance. Although the state spends lavishly on punishment – 9.5 percent of the state budget – it ranks near the bottom of the generosity scale in education, health care, and poverty alleviation (Lynch, p. 171; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1462474511401514">Pew, 2009</xref>: 41; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1462474511401514">UHF, 2009</xref>). Since the presidential bid of Barry Goldwater, Arizona has also served as a testing ground for pugilistic, racially charged conservatism. Given its prolonged resistance to the Martin Luther King holiday, its embrace of racial profiling in immigration policy, and its recent statewide ban on ethnic studies pedagogy, Arizona, although it only became a state in 1912, seems determined to cement its honorary membership status in the former Confederacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1462474511401514">Campo-Flores, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1462474511401514">Gross, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1462474511401514">Strauss, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Mona Lynch’s important, well-researched, and lucidly argued new book, <italic>Sunbelt Justice</italic>, explains how this state has ‘initiated and exaggerated’ punitive trends (p. 214). Although her focus on a single idiosyncratic state limits her ability to chart ‘the transformation of American punishment’ writ large, her book nonetheless advances the debate in key ways. First, it shifts the research spotlight to the South and Southwest, where retributive mass imprisonment has reached its zenith. Second, as a close sociopolitical history, it diagrams a full array of causative variables, showing how population growth, media sensationalism, partisan realignment, and political culture all contributed to hardening and inflating Arizona’s penal system. Finally, by highlighting both architects and enablers, Lynch suggests that breakneck prison growth was more a consequence of political posturing than popular mobilization, and that change emanated from the top rather than the bottom. Overall, she convincingly argues for Arizona’s importance as a ‘trailblazer’ in the country’s late-20th century ‘severity revolution’ (Lynch, p. 146; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1462474511401514">Simon, 2007</xref>: 39).</p>
<p>Lynch traces the origins of Arizona’s Spartan penality to an enduring political culture forged during the long territorial period. Enacting the worldview of southern Democrats and white pioneers, generations of conservative Arizona politicians have reinforced racial hierarchies, constricted government expenditures, resisted outside meddling, and campaigned on the values of ‘individualism and self-reliance’ (p. 24). To punish crime, Arizona built institutions that were ‘cheap and mean’ (p. 213). The domain’s first prison went up in Yuma, which Mark Twain called ‘the hottest corner of perdition’; a juvenile lockup became known as the ‘desert Devil’s Island’ (p. 29); and the state’s flagship prison at Florence stressed physical discipline and hard labor (Lynch, p. 29; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1462474511401514">Twain, 1913</xref>: 129). Although Arizona established a bureaucratized Department of Corrections in 1968 and flirted, under a handful of modernizing directors, with deregimentation and community corrections, Lynch concludes that the state was ‘hardly touched by [rehabilitative] penal norms’ (p. 49). Perusing the bleak historical record in Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah – not to mention the eastern arc of the Sunbelt – she questions whether these norms ever achieved the national dominance that the conventional historiography suggests.</p>
<p>In the post-civil rights era, Lynch shows, Arizona came to reinforce half of its institutional maxim – ‘mean’ – while abruptly discarding the other – ‘cheap’. In the 1970s, lawmakers overhauled ‘the criminal code in a way that generated a huge increase in prison admissions’ and simultaneously curtailed ‘back-end release mechanisms’ (p. 114). Over the next two decades, they enacted even tougher laws – mandatory 25-year sentences for third felony convictions and automatic adult penalties for certain juvenile offenses, for example – thus fueling explosive prison growth. Between 1970 and 2000, the state’s incarceration rate sextupled, while the total inmate population climbed from 1460 to 26,510 (pp. 231–232). Experts warned, time after time, that sentencing enhancements and release restrictions would exacerbate crowding and break the bank, but politicians, cheered by the state’s leading newspapers, increasingly turned from ‘practical, collaborative lawmaking to symbolic, partisan-based legislating’ (p. 113). When Democratic Governor Bruce Babbitt proposed moderating the penal code in response to the soaring felon count, his opponents balked: ‘We need more people in prison, not less’, insisted leading Republican Jim Skelly (p. 118).</p>
<p>From the 1980 s, as New Right politicians successfully drove professional penologists out of prison management, conditions behind bars hardened as well – though, as Lynch notes, this constituted less a punitive turn than a return to Arizona’s retributive roots. Law libraries, education programs, and early release centers closed down, while field labor and paramilitary regimentation made a comeback. Arizona began charging inmates for electricity and medical visits, donated recreation equipment to local schools, trained attack dogs to perform cell extractions, and erected a windowless supermax that served as an architectural prototype for California’s Pelican Bay. Prisoners and their advocates sought redress in federal court, but Arizona resisted in the name of states’ rights and ultimately helped roll back the prisoners’ rights revolution; in 1995, Arizona’s US Senator Jon Kyl helped draft the federal Prisoner Litigation Reform Act, which effectively reimposed the judiciary’s hands-off doctrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1462474511401514">Schlanger, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Lynch notes that in Arizona, unlike in many other states, prison growth has not widened racial disparities between whites and blacks. Yet she might have paid more attention to the treatment of two larger demographics in the state: Indians and Latinos. The proportion of prison cells occupied by both groups has increased dramatically over the last 30 years, suggesting that in Arizona the racial genealogy of mass imprisonment stretches back not to slavery but to conquest and ethnic cleansing. The history of the frontier – or, more accurately, the history of Anglo settlement and native dispossession – may have nurtured a political culture of ‘individualism and self-reliance’, but it also seems to have cultivated a Manichean vision of social citizenship, with a succession of politicians legitimating themselves by fortifying the divide between good and evil, civilization and savagery, law-abiding and criminal. If this local ethic of division and inequality helped propel the war on crime, it now stokes a war on immigrants.</p>
<p>Even as prison growth in Arizona and the rest of the country seems to be petering out, partly as a result of recessionary budget deficits, a surge in immigration detention is shaping up as an aftershock of mass imprisonment. A torchbearer in both caustic crime fighting and anti-immigrant zealotry, Arizona can help clarify both the punitive synergies between South and West and the policy turn from law and order to border fortification. Arizona’s politics of punishment may not be as paradigmatic as those in California or Texas, but Lynch’s careful analysis of its prisons and society contributes vitally to the larger picture. She reminds us that although the penitentiary may have germinated in the Northeast, it metastasized in the Sunbelt; that history marches forward but also turns back; and that the nation’s legacy of violence and stratification remains unburied in the present.</p>
