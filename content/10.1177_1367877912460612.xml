<p>This article analyzes the impact of western funding projects on the place of women in the mediated Palestinian public sphere. Drawing upon archival evidence, it shows that – in an effort to avoid overt discussion of Israeli occupation – joint projects between foreign funders and outlets such as the Ma’an Network focused on issues of gender ‘conflict’. The article argues that these projects simultaneously played the disturbing role of reaffirming western resistance to the expression of Palestinian experience under occupation while nonetheless playing the laudable role of creating new opportunities for female media figures.</p>

<p>In 2003, the Washington D.C.-based non-governmental organization (NGO) Search for Common Ground (SFCG) established a partnership with a small group of independent television broadcasters in the West Bank portion of the Palestinian territories. Combining these stations under the name of the Ma’an (Together) Network, SFCG aimed to bring its unique brand of media-oriented conflict resolution to what is perhaps the world’s most politically contested space. However, despite successes in crafting peace-oriented media in war-torn places such as Burundi and Macedonia, SFCG quickly learned that the Palestinian–Israeli conflict presented problems for which even they were ill prepared.</p>
<p>Alongside the complications of media production in the midst of Israeli occupation, there was also the extraordinary scrutiny aimed at media money earmarked for the Palestinian territories from the US government, SFCG’s primary financial benefactor. Agreements between Ma’an and western donors had to be prefaced with a variety of official documents, most of which would not have applied elsewhere. These ranged from the Executive Order (13224) On Terrorist Financing, to a warning against funding the Palestinian Authority echoing a 1999 US Foreign Operations Bill that banned American support for Palestinian governmental broadcasting due to its portrayals of America and Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367877912460612">Rennack et al., 2009</xref>: 12). Subject to continued scrutiny from the United States and beyond, Ma’an needed to be extremely careful in its representations of violence, nationalism and, above all, Israel. This concern is exemplified by a 2008 incident in which Ma’an was forced to re-cut a scene from a US Department of State-supported soap opera due to the presence of a common piece of background scenery. The item, a traditional tapestry in the shape of historic Palestine, was said to be unacceptable due to its implicit denial of Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367877912460612">Sienkiewicz, forthcoming</xref>).</p>
<p>As a result, SFCG quickly changed its approach to working with the Ma’an Network. Describing the organization’s early collaborations with Ma’an, SFCG president John Marks stated in a personal interview, without a hint of irony, that Ma’an addressed ‘every conflict in Palestinian life, except for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict’. This is, of course, a significant omission, perhaps akin to addressing every element of climate change, except for rising temperatures. But, as Marks noted, there are certainly other points of contention in Palestinian society. Accordingly, SFCG and Ma’an shifted their attention away from the politically contentious realms of occupation and peace negotiation, instead emphasizing female empowerment in the rapidly expanding mediated Palestinian public sphere.</p>
<p>Occurring throughout the first decade of the 2000s, this shift in western funding goals coincided with an unmistakable rise in the prominence of female media figures throughout the Middle East, in no small part due to the rise of satellite television (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367877912460612">Sakr, 2002</xref>: 15). In this article I argue that American intervention in the Palestinian territories, though disturbing in its willful avoidance of key conflicts in Palestinian life, nonetheless played a significant role in this process of bringing more women into decision-making roles in domestic Palestinian media. In doing so, I draw upon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367877912460612">Marwan Kraidy’s (2005)</xref> notion of ‘critical transculturalism’, arguing that although interactions between America and institutions such as Ma’an do exist within traditional, imbalanced power structures, they must nonetheless be conceptualized as ‘mutually constitutive’ relationships in which local forces help shape the meanings of global exchanges despite undeniable inequalities of political and economic strength. I show that the specific brand of female empowerment that Ma’an ultimately came to embrace was in part shaped by a western and arguably neoliberal approach to feminism. Yet, at the same time, this move towards promoting female access to the public sphere nonetheless was enacted by Palestinian producers who localized foreign demands in order to achieve pre-existing aims of improved egalitarianism.</p>
<p>I begin my argument by reviewing the history of women in the Palestinian public sphere, noting the consistent role that the interplay of local movements and international interventions played in shaping both local feminisms and female access to popular discourse. I then draw upon early documentation from the collaboration between Ma’an and western governments and NGOs, outlining the indirect ways in which the issue of female political and discursive rights was inserted into the foundational elements of the organization in lieu of a focus on occupation. I then take up two specific case studies, outlining the careers of prominent figures whose careers were aided specifically by the intervention of American and European initiatives to improve opportunities for women in the Palestinian public sphere. In conclusion, I contextualize the role of western intervention alongside more proximate factors that have promoted increased female presence in the public sphere and critically examine the extent to which such outside efforts represent imperial or Orientalist approaches the Middle East.</p>

<title>Global by circumstance: women, media and the Palestinian public sphere</title>
<p>Writing in the late 1970s under Israeli-imposed house arrest, the pioneering journalist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367877912460612">Raymonda Tawil (1980)</xref> powerfully outlined the myriad obstacles she faced as a Palestinian woman attempting to enter the public sphere. Despite enjoying a position of relative economic strength, Tawil nonetheless contended with a history of national displacement, the violence and political disenfranchisement of Israeli occupation and a patriarchal Palestinian milieu that promoted ‘a traditionalist, oppressive environment that restricts individual liberties’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367877912460612">Tawil, 1980</xref>: 9). Her struggle forcefully illustrates the ways in which circumstances have required Palestinian efforts at female empowerment to simultaneously grapple with both local and international institutions. All at once, she was forced to combat the forces of an outside occupier, gain the respect of the global organizations such as the <italic>New York Times</italic> and contend with her husband’s repeated efforts to get her to ‘sit still and keep quiet’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367877912460612">Tawil, 1980</xref>: 124). Her life embodied the ways in which Palestinian feminists must contend with even more than the ‘double vice’ between state and familial groups, within which many Middle Eastern women are caught (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367877912460612">Joseph and Slyomovics, 2000</xref>). In addition to that conundrum, Palestinian women face not only Israeli occupation, but also the generally accepted, if perhaps unproductive, assumption that foreign powers such as the United States must play a role in bringing peace to the region. In this section I detail the history of female access to media and the public sphere, aiming to establish the complex international history in which efforts such as the collaboration between Ma’an and the West have intervened.</p>
<p>Though often articulated in scholarship as two distinct questions, the place of the Palestinian women’s movement and the struggle for gender equality in the realm of media possess deeply intertwined histories. The rise of Palestinian nationalism in the 1930s coincided with the popularization of broadcast media in the region, allowing for an instructive comparison between women’s places on and off the airwaves. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367877912460612">Peteet (1991)</xref> argues, the day of 15 April 1933 served as a moment of symbolic break though as Madame ‘Awni ‘Abd al Hadi and M. Mogannam seized space at the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem to express concerns regarding the British Mandate Authority and rising Jewish immigration to the region. In ‘temporarily feminizing’ the traditionally male venue, these women overcame local prejudices for the purpose of gaining a voice both in the local and international political spheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367877912460612">Peteet, 1991</xref>: 50). Shortly thereafter, in 1936, the British colonial government established the Palestine Broadcasting Services (PBS), creating the first-ever Palestinian mass media outlet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367877912460612">Somiry-Batrawi, 2001</xref>: n.p.). Despite the male-dominated nature of the medium, the station’s Arabic director, Ibrahim Tuqan, made a concerted effort to include women’s voices, giving airtime to the intellectual Asma Tubi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367877912460612">Āshūr et al., 2008</xref>: 504) and establishing his poet wife, Fadwa Tuqan, as the first nationally famous Palestinian woman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367877912460612">Joffe, 2003</xref>). PBS also produced programming geared specifically to women, including programs entitled <italic>Talk to Women</italic> and <italic>The Modern Arab Home</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367877912460612">Fleischmann, 2003</xref>: 177). It must be noted, however, that female access to the public sphere during the period was dependent in nearly all cases on male sponsorship. Speaking about her weekly program on PBS during the late 1930s, the Jerusalem-born Sa’ida Jarallah attests that her public presence provoked ‘scandal’ and was contingent upon the permission of male family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367877912460612">Fleischmann, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>There is little visible evidence of women’s media presence between the years 1948 and 1967, during which Jordan and Egypt controlled the West Bank and Gaza Strip, respectively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367877912460612">Dajani (1994</xref>: 36) argues that the women’s political movement was set back by the loss of land and continuity that came with the establishment of Israel and the <italic>Nakba</italic>, while Somiry-Batrawi contends the crisis caused a reactionary movement, in which females taking a public role became ‘socially unacceptable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367877912460612">2001</xref>: n.p.) However, the demands of this period did play a crucial role in connecting Palestinian female empowerment to international institutions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367877912460612">Peteet (1991</xref>: 62) argues that by advocating to UNESCO and other international organizations for improved conditions in refugee camps and other domestic concerns, women such as Issam Abdul al Hadi ‘were learning the ropes’ of public, political engagement. This funneling of strong female voices towards international organizations began a pattern in which global aid organizations were linked with Palestinian women’s rights alongside local institutions.</p>
<p>By the end of the Six Day War on 10 June 1967, Israel had seized control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367877912460612">Peteet (1991)</xref> argues that it was during the early stages of the Israeli occupation that women moved beyond their role in maintaining domestic structures, taking a more direct part in both political and military resistance. This was particularly the case in the refugee camps of Lebanon, where women volunteered for ‘military experience [that] awakened women to their potential equality to men’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367877912460612">1991</xref>: 151). The post-1967 era was also the period in which media, the women’s movement and Palestinian national struggle would explicitly converge.</p>
<p>Palestinian Women’s Committees were created, providing a political body through which women could mobilize and establish a counter-public sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367877912460612">Dajani, 1994</xref>: 33). At the same time, Palestinian print media in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, though heavily censored, began to flourish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367877912460612">Nossek and Rinnawi, 2003</xref>: 184). By the late 1960s the Palestinian Liberation Organization had established a regional radio presence, using Cairo and Baghdad as locations so as to avoid Israeli restrictions. Public, often violent, figures such as Umm Jihad and Leila Khaled ensured that women were featured in the public sphere, while producers such as Sulafa Jadallah emerged as important figures in the establishment of the national media system. Educated at the Higher Cinema School in Cairo, Jadallah was a founder of the Palestine Film Unit (PFU) and cinematographer for the documentaries <italic>No to the Peaceful Solution</italic> (1968) and <italic>They Do Not Exist</italic> (1974). Although Jadallah’s work was overtly geared towards nationalist Palestinian ambitions, her role must also be understood as global in nature, as the PFU’s films were aimed squarely at changing international perceptions on the situation in Israel and Palestine.</p>
<p>A major shift in both Palestinian media and feminism occurred with the outbreak of the first <italic>intifada</italic> in 1987. The uprising, a grassroots campaign of boycotts, demonstrations and violent protestations against Israeli military presence, made the Palestinian territories areas of both great international newsworthiness and considerable danger. Media from around the world flocked to the region, hungry for stories to tell but unsure to how to safely navigate the terrain. They solved this problem by hiring Palestinian ‘fixers’ – on-the-ground producers who could lead foreigners to the story and return them home in one piece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367877912460612">Kuttab, 1993</xref>: 140). These fixers became accustomed to global media practices and technologies through their interactions with the foreign press. This coincided with a rise in respect for women in the Palestinian social and economic order, with women such as Rula Al-Halwani, who eventually became a CNN correspondent, and Buthanina Khoury, later a Reuters reporter, getting their respective starts as fixers during the first <italic>intifada</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367877912460612">Somiry-Batrawi, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the <italic>intifada</italic> brought with it the first international non-profit money earmarked for media in the West Bank. The most prominent early example was the British-funded Al-Quds Educational Television project, which would later become part of the non-profit Ma’an Network. Al-Quds TV, managed by the journalist Daoud Kuttab, was created entirely with foreign funding for the express purpose of producing content geared towards women and children. Accordingly, Kuttab made a concerted effort to include a woman producer in Al-Quds’ first project, a documentary series that provided Palestinian perspectives on life during the <italic>intifada</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367877912460612">Kuttab, 1993</xref>: 142). This emphasis on women’s interest would become a hallmark of western media interventions in the region.</p>
<p>The Oslo Accords of 1993 afforded the Palestinian Authority the first-ever Palestinian sovereignty over Palestinian land, albeit only a small portion of it. This control, while limited, gave Palestinians the right to broadcast for the first time in history and fostered an era of contestation with regard to what would ultimately constitute the Palestinian media regime. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367877912460612">Jamal (2004</xref>: 12), the Palestinian women’s movement lobbied the major political and religious powers to ‘realize a more democratic understanding of self-determination’ in which reason was privileged above traditional determinants of power, including religion, wealth and, of course, gender. Although ultimately overshadowed by male elites, the women’s movement nonetheless made gains that impacted opportunities for women in all sectors of Palestinian society and were particularly important in the field of media.</p>
<p>The period following the Oslo Accords, as well as the horrors of the second <italic>intifada</italic> and the Israeli response to it, further increased the levels of foreign money being poured into the Palestinian Authority. As part of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367877912460612">Brynen (2000)</xref> describes as the process of ‘paying for peace’, western nations such as the US, Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands began making serious investments in Palestinian media during a period of major shifts in both the Arab and Palestinian mediaspheres. Alongside the growth of western-funded projects, the Palestinian Broadcasting Authority began devoting greater resources to television. Even more apparent was the emergence of regional satellite television that began to change fundamentally the ways in which Arab publics, including the public of the Palestinian territories, both received information and related to the possibility of women in the public sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367877912460612">Kirat 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367877912460612">Sakr, 2002</xref>). Increasingly, women were entering Palestinian homes on-screen as part of the news media, most often in the role of anchor or correspondent. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367877912460612">Somiry-Batrawi (2004)</xref> notes, Palestinian women received numerous international awards for their on-the-ground reports during the battles. However, this female presence was markedly more prevalent in front of the camera than it was behind it, and local Palestinian stations lagged behind regional stations considerably on both counts. It is in this extremely complex environment that the Ma’an Network forged its relationship with the western world and, I argue, played a significant role in bolstering the place of women in the Palestinian public sphere while veering away from other important local concerns.</p>

<sec id="section2-1367877912460612">
<title>A foe as friend – western policy, the Ma’an network and female empowerment</title>
<p>As detailed in this article’s introduction, the relationship between the Ma’an Network and western NGOs such as SFCG was limited by US political necessities. Despite SFCG’s sincere desire to affect positive, peaceful change in the region, their reliance on US Department of State funding to enact major projects with Ma’an served as a significant restraint. Although the US’s official policy supports the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367877912460612">Aruri (2003)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367877912460612">Chomsky (1999)</xref> and others have argued that American actions have been consistently slanted towards Israeli interests, even at times when international law appears to support Palestinian claims. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367877912460612">Beinin (2003</xref>: 125) argues, this tendency only increased during the post 9/11 period, as the US War on Terror provided Israel with a mandate to act with a ‘free hand’ in repressing Palestinian resistance. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367877912460612">Bishara (2006</xref>: 25), this policy had a particularly disturbing impact on the work of Palestinian media workers, as the Israeli military appeared to begin equating Palestinian media with hostile combatants and acting accordingly. It was during this same timeframe that SFCG began working with Ma’an, which goes some way to explaining why the one issue that any conflict organization would want to address in the region – the Occupation – was absent from most Ma’an–SFCG collaborations.</p>
<p>It is understandable that, for many critics, such a display of western dominance against the local reality of Palestinian life would serve to taint any other activity produced by such a relationship. Despite promoting equality and opportunity in their press materials, SFCG nonetheless appears to be playing a part in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367877912460612">Said (1992</xref>: 39) describes as the ‘blocking operation by which the Palestinian cannot be heard from (or represent himself)’. This perspective is crucial and must serve as a backdrop to any further analysis. However, to ignore the entirety of the Ma’an project as a result would not only be an act of scholarly blindness, but also a disservice to the Palestinian men and women who chose to take this opportunity, despite its existence in a structure of western dominance, and use it in order to effect positive local change. I offer this analysis of SFCG’s collaboration with Ma’an as an effort to acknowledge the ways in which those disempowered by economic, political and military structures nonetheless are able to utilize global interactions, if only in limited ways, in order to improve upon unjust local circumstances.</p>
<p>The Ma’an Network was at its inception not specifically oriented towards women’s issues or any other specific social concerns. It began as a union of ‘storefront’ UHF television stations aimed at extremely localized audiences and selling ads during a daily broadcast schedule predominantly composed of pirated programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1367877912460612">Tawil-Souri, 2007</xref>: 15). The board of directors, consisting of station owners from across the West Bank, was entirely male and notoriously disjointed. However, the Network took on a distinctly different shape in 2003 when SFCG began investing money originating from the US Department of State. Bethlehem was established as the Network’s headquarters and a considerably more top-down structure was enacted in order to meet the considerable organizational demands required of Palestinian organizations aiming to acquire American funds. According to former Chief Financial Officer Wisam Kutom, this shift allowed the organization to begin to enact policies impossible in a previous era. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367877912460612">Kutom (2009)</xref> remarked in a personal interview, ‘from day one we [at Ma’an] wanted to encourage female producers but it was difficult to do this without institutional support’. Ma’an’s member stations originally comprised almost entirely locally owned family operations in which responsibilities tended to be passed among male relatives and close friends. Although the financial opportunities created by SFCG certainly did not provide true independence for Ma’an, they did provide a neutral office space unaffiliated with any particular existing business or family structure.</p>
<p>Ma’an was careful not to brand itself as an overtly women’s rights oriented organization, eschewing explicit discussion of gender quotas among producers or journalists. However, the documented training activities provided by a variety of western institutions in the early days of Ma’an show not only a distinct over-representation of women’s issues, but also a subtle emphasis on training female media producers to contend with unique local challenges. For example, Ma’an’s first training program with SFCG, held in 2003, focused almost exclusively on the role of women in Palestinian society, despite ostensibly being geared towards training in ‘common ground’ conflict resolution media. Two of the three ‘simulations’ led by American journalists during the session focused on this subject area. One, a simulated talk show on ‘women’s issues’, came with the objective ‘to show that there are groups of successful woman [sic] who pay a heavy prize [sic] for being successful’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367877912460612">National Endowment for Democracy, 2003</xref>: 23). Another exercise simulated a discussion of ‘the situation of women in Palestine’, focusing on ‘the rights of women in society’, ‘Accomplishment[s …] in [the field of women’s rights]’ and the ‘evolution of the women [sic] rights throughout the decades’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367877912460612">2003</xref>: 26).</p>
<p>This pattern continued in a strikingly similar fashion in a 2004 training session run by the National Endowment for Democracy, an NGO that, like SFCG, operates primarily with funds allocated from the US government. The session was entitled ‘Conflict Reporting Training of Palestinian Journalists’ – a name that would seem to suggest to any reasonable observer a discussion of the role of journalists covering occupation, resistance and intermittent violence. Instead, the three sections of the training focused on ‘access of women to higher education’, ‘early marriage’ and ‘women’s right to work’. Once more, an American institution had chosen to avoid the question of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, focusing instead on gender equality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367877912460612">National Endowment for Democracy, 2004</xref>: 22). The event did, however, provide unique training opportunities for female journalists, one of whom was recorded as having learned the hard way to observe gender etiquette in local reporting after making the mistake of offering to shake the hand of Muslim cleric. This contextually immodest gesture resulted in a situation in which ‘the Judge got stressed and that had a negative influence on the interview’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367877912460612">2004</xref>: 31). This tendency towards a focus on gender ‘conflict’ was repeated throughout Ma’an’s training sessions.</p>
<p>This emphasis was also engrained in Ma’an’s hiring and promotion policies, as the Network exploited its new, western-financed place in the local mediasphere in order to combat the imbalance of gender in journalistic, editorial and managerial positions. Again, Ma’an and its all-male executive team chose not to openly emphasize the question of gender, beyond listing ‘discrimination against women’ and the ‘complex; challenging working environment of women’, as impediments to Network success in their official strategy plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367877912460612">Ma’an Network, 2005</xref>: 51). However, I argue that by using their western funding partners as a ‘cover’, the Network was able to reach its own goals of greater gender equity while keeping together a loose alliance of member stations, the bulk of which were family-owned, decidedly patriarchal businesses.</p>
<p>One way in which this unusual coalescing of western and local interests came together was as a result of the emphasis on the ‘professionalization’ of Ma’an’s editorial and journalistic staff. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367877912460612">Miller (2007</xref>: 352) argues, the professionalization of journalists is a common goal for ‘third-sector’ international NGO media outlets which have the troubling tendency to view western media standards as timeless and universal. SFCG is a paradigmatic example of such a ‘third-sector’ organization; the emphasis that Ma’an placed on, for example, hiring media workers with college degrees, can certainly be read as evidence of good-natured but naively paternal interference on the part of a powerful western institution. However, Ma’an’s full embrace of the importance of college degrees has a greater significance. For a long time, the West Bank’s media workforce trailed significantly behind college graduates in terms of female inclusion. Perhaps surprisingly, Bethlehem University, the primary source for Ma’an’s recruiting, features a roughly 75 percent female student body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367877912460612">Lund University, 2010</xref>). Meanwhile, the production staff at Ma’an’s member stations before its involvement with SFCG, was well over 75 percent in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367877912460612">Kutom, 2009</xref>). Ma’an, by emphasizing the ‘external’ demand of professionalization, created a situation in which stations and departments had little choice but to hire more women, as the overwhelming majority of degree-holders in the area were female. Thus, a potentially controversial sea-change in institutional hiring policy was mitigated by Ma’an’s ability to appeal to the so-called ‘higher’ standards of its western benefactor. The true goal, however, was decidedly local. As the case studies below will detail, controversy certainly did erupt as Ma’an began to empower more women; yet it was able to weather this storm by pointing to the need to appeal to SFCG’s demands.</p>
<p>A second policy change at Ma’an demonstrates the complex ways in which western demands and local agency can interact, muddling accusations of pure foreign imperialism. A major difficulty for women entering the media workforce in the Palestinian territories is that of work schedules. Simply put, it can be harmful to a woman’s reputation to work nights, and family members commonly object to such work arrangements in an effort to protect their female relatives’ image in the community. Media work, however, is a 24-hour business and new hires are, by rule, given the least desirable, overnight shifts. This creates a significant obstacle to integrating women into an industry that has historically been overwhelmingly male. Ma’an overcame this difficulty by making the decision to schedule women in day shifts upon request, suddenly sending a number of men with greater seniority back to the inconvenient night shifts associated with professional inexperience. Needless to say, this move sparked considerable controversy and displeasure. However, Ma’an executives referred to the outside demands of its funders, making the case that such changes needed to be instituted so as to meet large-scale organizational needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367877912460612">Kutom, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>These changes on the part of Ma’an, while ostensibly made in the service of a western organization (SFCG and, by proxy, the US Department of State) nonetheless resist interpretation as an act of pure foreign domination. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367877912460612">Kraidy (2005</xref>: 156) argues, even interactions between the western and majority worlds that are ‘structured in dominance’ tend to result in dynamic hybridities. Such exchanges are often ‘mutually constitutive’, with even the dominated party inevitably impacting not only the final outcome, but also the process by which it is achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367877912460612">2005</xref>: 154). In the case of Ma’an’s policies aimed at greater female inclusion, certainly a great number of the directives came from the West in either implicit or explicit forms. It was clear to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367877912460612">Kutom (2009)</xref>, for example, that SFCG looked favorably on the presence of women in managerial positions. Furthermore, the gender focus of the training sessions described above can be understood as an American need to discuss absolutely anything but Israeli occupation when dealing with Palestinian media workers. However, the desire to achieve a greater gender balance at Ma’an was not a purely externally imposed demand, nor was it achieved through exclusively western means. Nowhere in SFCG’s interactions with Ma’an is there any evidence of an awareness of concerns regarding, for example, female night shifts. Instead, Ma’an’s decision-makers used the financial and political cover provided by their US donors in order to craft a local solution to a local problem. In doing so, they not only exercised their own agency but also revised the understanding by which their western supporters would conceptualize the concerns of female media workers in Palestine.</p>

<title>Cases in point: the careers of Amira Hanania and Nahed Abu Tu’emeh</title>
<p>In this section, I detail two careers that were aided by the relationship between Ma’an and its western funders. In both cases, I draw upon materials from personal interviews and first-hand observation conducted during a 16-month research stay in the West Bank ending in the summer of 2010. In doing so, I aim to highlight the ways in which the interaction between Ma’an and its western funders succeeded in opening up possibilities for female access to the mediated public sphere, while also limiting the range of topics that would be discussed. It is not my claim that the professional paths described below are the only ones available to women; there of course are many others. However, they serve to detail the ways in which exceptional individual efforts combine with complex geopolitical interactions in order to simultaneously expand some elements of the public sphere while limiting others.</p>
<p>Both Nahed Abu Tu’emeh’s and Amira Hanania’s respective career paths have encountered the gendered obstacles described above in the history of Palestinian women’s access to the public sphere. Abu Tu’emeh came from a small town in the Gaza Strip where she describes her journalistic ambitions as being a source of family shame. She would go on, however, to obtain the position of Programming Manager at Ma’an, becoming the first-ever woman to attain such a position at a nationally oriented Palestinian broadcaster. For Hanania, a career that began mired in sexist preconceptions eventually gave way to her becoming the first woman to produce and host a political affairs program for the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation. Both Abu Tu’emeh and Hanania, through great personal effort and institutional support, succeeded in exploiting the space opened by Ma’an’s relationship and the West in order to challenge local status quos. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367877912460612">Mayer’s (2009</xref>: 15) call to invoke specific analysis of media labor in order to ‘ground’ broad descriptive theories of culture, I employ these specific career histories in order to create firm data points upon which to evaluate the potential impact of western media interventions in Palestinian media.</p>
<p>Abu Tu’emeh’s career embodies the connection between the Palestinian women’s movement, western intervention and female success in the realm of Palestinian television. Upon graduating from Al-Azhar University in Gaza City with a degree in journalism, Abu Tu’emeh found herself unable to find work in her field of choice. Both her family and community resisted her career plans, particularly in the period just before the second <italic>intifada</italic>, during which political elites actively reasserted traditional gender roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1367877912460612">Salomon, 2010</xref>: 21). However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367877912460612">Jamal (2004</xref>: 130) notes, during the Oslo process the Palestinian women’s movement had carved out a small but important set of resources intended just for such cases. Were it not for the women’s movement’s foresight, Abu Tu’emeh likely would have never gained the experience that prepared her to take advantage of the new opportunities that would later come from western media projects like Ma’an.</p>
<p>Learning of Abu Tu’emeh’s unemployment, the Women’s Caucus of the Palestine Liberation Committee (PLC) gave her a job interviewing a series of women about sensitive issues ranging from fair employment practices to early marriage. Despite ostensible governmental support, Abu Tu’emeh nonetheless experienced the very sorts of patriarchal interference that prompted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1367877912460612">Sabbagh (1998)</xref> and others to bemoan the backsliding in terms of women’s rights that took place following the <italic>intifadas</italic>. Upon hearing about her work, local religious leaders began to visit her family, imploring her brothers to keep Abu Tu’emeh under control. ‘As a woman from a small community, where most people were lowly educated, it wasn’t proper for me to be investigating taboos or to be putting myself out so publicly’, she recalls, echoing sentiments of some of the earliest pioneers of Palestinian feminism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367877912460612">Abu Tu’emeh, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Abu Tu’emeh secured a job at <italic>Al-Ayyam</italic> newspaper based on her achievements working for the Women’s Caucus, becoming their Gaza office’s only female reporter. Every woman who had worked there previously had quit, perhaps as a result of the ‘mocking and swearing’ culture that Abu Tu’emeh reports having experienced. To make matters worse, Abu Tu’emeh found herself being assigned primarily to night shifts and suddenly becoming the subject of unflattering and entirely unfair rumors. Her career, it appeared, would reach a premature end due to these circumstances.</p>
<p>However, Abu Tu’emeh soon found work in the more flexible world of western-funded, non-profit media, where her college degree was an essential asset and scheduling practices were geared specifically to overcome obstacles to gender inclusion. Moving to the West Bank, she became the head of programming at Al-Quds Educational Television, an affiliate of the Ma’an Network and recipient of British funding. Within a few years Abu Tu’emeh was named head of programming for the entire Ma’an Network, a decision that resulted in considerable turmoil. According to Abu Tu’emeh, one station manager refused to work under a woman and quit in protest. Ma’an’s management, speaking in accord with the ideas of its international funding partners, refused to bow to this internal pressure and stood by Abu Tu’emeh. This decisive action proved that Ma’an, though male-dominated at its highest levels, would not stand for the macho, men-only attitude that plagues media outlets across the globe. Abu Tu’emeh became one of the most highly regarded women in Palestinian television, making decisions over how hundreds of thousands of dollars of funding, mostly American and European in origin, should be spent each year. Perhaps just as importantly, she launched the careers of many female media figures, including my second case study, Amira Hanania.</p>
<p>Although Amira Hanania is still very young, her career has moved across the whole of the Palestinian media industry. Hanania’s television career began at Bethlehem TV, at the time when it operated as a local, for-profit station outside of the realm of the Ma’an Network. At the beginning of her time at the station, she was the only woman working above the position of secretary and faced a brand of sexual harassment that recalls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367877912460612">Raymonda Tawil’s (1980)</xref> struggle decades earlier. Most strikingly, she was sent to report a series of ‘false stories’ about local businesses with whom the station’s management wished to establish advertising agreements. ‘They would send me to go talk to the owner but there would be no story. The owner would flirt with me and I was supposed to smile and be pretty. I felt humiliated, exploited’, she remembers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367877912460612">Hanania, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, impressed by her work and, crucially, her sociology degree from Bethlehem University, the Ma’an Network hired Hanania to work at its headquarters, bringing her into the world of non-profit, internationally funded television for the first time. Hanania was immediately given serious assignments and took part in the training sessions described above, many of which sent not-so-subtle messages that equality of women’s work was to be central to Ma’an’s work, both on- and off-screen. She attests that it was during this period that she was first able to truly direct male crew members, a possibility that had been slowly increasing among international satellite networks for years, but remained much more difficult in the world of domestic Palestinian production. Hanania was put in position to directly question not only male colleagues but also public figures, putting into practice the very activities described in the gender-oriented ‘conflict training’ that was so central to Ma’an’s early activities with western sponsors.</p>
<p>Hanania’s first opportunity to work as a show-runner was granted by Nahed Abu Tu’emeh at Al-Quds Educational TV (AQTV), an affiliate of the Ma’an Network that has proven to be a crucial training ground for women wishing to climb in the ranks of Palestinian television. This move must be seen as perhaps the most crucial moment in Hanania’s career, as it took her behind the scenes and into a position in which no one could accuse her of getting by on her physical appearance. Taking advantage of Ma’an and AQTV’s mission to support women’s efforts in media, Hanania was able to gain experience in the nuts and bolts of production, and work under Abu Tu’emeh in a rare situation that avoided the patriarchal infrastructure that so thoroughly dominates media throughout the Arab world.</p>
<p>Today Hanania hosts and serves as show-runner for the highly regarded political affairs program, <italic>Action Circle</italic> on Palestine TV, the satellite outlet for the government’s Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation. For the first time ever, there is now a woman who questions and critiques the male-dominated world of Palestinian politics, sitting face to face with an exclusively male group of guests and asserting strong positions. Furthermore, she is the only woman who travels with Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas’s international press corps and her work has been singled out by Abbas for public praise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367877912460612">Ma’an News Agency, 2009</xref>). Her groundbreaking career came full circle to the US Department of State in 2010, when she was asked to conduct the first-ever joint Israeli–Palestinian interview with a major American political figure and she sat down with Udi Segal of Israel’s Channel 2 for an hour-long discussion with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p>

<title>Conclusion: for worse and for better</title>
<p>Only the most hostile of critics could argue that western media assistance has not, in certain ways, advanced the cause of specific women in Palestinian media. This is not to discount the impact of co-contributing factors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367877912460612">Mellor (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367877912460612">Mernissi (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367877912460612">Sakr (2002)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367877912460612">Kirat (2005)</xref> and others have detailed the ways in which the growth of satellite television has radically changed audience expectations throughout the Arab world. Although most of these discussions focus on on-screen personnel as opposed to decision-makers, there is no question that such changes have advanced the place of women in the Palestinian mediasphere. At the same time, since 2007, the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation has made significant, if inconsistent, moves in the direction of liberalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1367877912460612">Sienkiewicz, 2012</xref>). These shifts help explain why Hanania was eventually able to transition to the government’s satellite station with relative ease. However, were it not for the training and experience she received working at Ma’an, she would not have been qualified to take on the immense responsibility of hosting <italic>Action Circle</italic>. Western, largely American, institutions have taken unique and forceful steps to create new spaces for female expression.</p>
<p>And yet it is necessary to return to the discussion with which this article began. Yes, western organizations have offered training, money and access to the public sphere to woman such as Hanania and Abu Tu’emeh. But they have done so, in part, in order to avoid engaging with the impact of Israeli occupation on Palestinian women, children and men alike. Perhaps more importantly, this effort avoids discussing the role that the western world, and the US in particular, has played in preserving this intolerable status quo. Furthermore, the sort of women who have been able to climb the ladder of success in the world of Palestinian media are perhaps those who best mirror commercial western virtues and who emphasize personal achievement. This phenomenon represents a wider trend in media assistance and gender rights programs across the globe. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367877912460612">Islah Jad (2007)</xref> argues, in the years following America’s post-9/11 campaign to ‘democratize’ the Middle East, Arab women’s rights advocacy has been ‘brought into the larger, global women’s movement’, often eschewing specific local concerns for a one-size-fits-all, quantifiable approach to gender equality. This dynamic has imperiled the careful balance between female liberation and resistance to Israeli occupation that Raymonda Tawil embodied and that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367877912460612">Haj (1992)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367877912460612">Peteet (1991)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367877912460612">Abdo (1999)</xref> all argue has long stood at the center of Palestinian feminism. In a striking illustration of this, the ‘curriculum sheets’ provided by SFCG to Ma’an producers such as Abu Tu’emeh list 10 pages of problems in Palestinian society that conflict resolution media should address. Upon inspection, however, it is clear the list could apply to nearly every place in the world. The occupation is never mentioned, nor is its impact on schooling, medical care or other concerns. Women’s rights play a key role in the curriculum with ‘Discrimination Against Women’, following the problems of ‘[Disregard for] Intellectual Property’ and ‘Brain Drain’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367877912460612">Ma’an Network, 2005</xref>: n.p.). Such a list resonates with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367877912460612">Harvey’s (2006</xref>: 510) assertion that western NGOs tend to closely relate human rights to economic matters, favoring the neoliberal fostering of individual opportunities over engagement with deep and complicated social concerns.</p>
<p>Along similar lines, Hanania’s approach to television production quite clearly bears the marks of the dominant structures in which she operates. She has accepted the red lines regarding Israel and occupation laid down by western funders to the point where she was chosen to represent her nation in an informative but evidently tightly controlled interview with Secretary of State Clinton. She has also taken on a sense of patriarchal conformity that has long been a hallmark of Palestinian governmental broadcasting. In a shocking turn, the first two years of Hanania’s <italic>Action Circle</italic> failed to feature a single female guest as a host of male military leaders, academics and political analysts sat engaged in contentious debate with her. Asked about this oddity, she protests, perhaps not without irony, that female commentators tend not to be taken seriously by her network. The careful balance that once existed in her reporting between advancing women’s issues and articulating more general Palestinian needs has been at least temporarily subsumed into mainstream discursive structures that remain dominated by both western political interests and patriarchal Palestinian elites.</p>
<p>None of which is to say, however, that either Amira Hanania or Nahed Abu Tu’emeh is a mere pawn in an imperial ruse. Their stories are crucial reminders of the importance of the integrated, hybrid thinking endorsed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367877912460612">Marwan Kraidy (2005)</xref> in the study of global media and cultural practices. Hanania and Abu Tu’emeh face myriad externally imposed obstacles: western ideological demands, patriarchal Palestinian expectations, Israeli walls, Israeli checkpoints and sometimes Israeli tanks. These factors shape who these individuals are and shape the media they make. But these women and their affiliated institutions also find points of resistance and, through their actions, help to reconstitute the ways in which the Palestinian woman and media producer is conceived both locally and globally. Abu Tu’emeh, a first-generation college graduate from Gaza, very much reconfigures the perceptions of both local television producers and international organizations. Amira Hanania, by reaching well above her station in the traditional power order, has forced people home and abroad to reconsider who can ask which questions of whom in Palestinian society.</p>
<p>She has also passed along the gift of professional control that she was given by Abu Tu’emeh when she became a show-runner at Al-Quds Educational TV. Given the opportunity to hire her first lead producer for <italic>Action Circle</italic>, Hanania chose a 24-year-old woman, Sana Khadour, a very unlikely selection for a hard-hitting political program on Palestinian governmental television. This emerging pattern follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367877912460612">Byerly and Ross’s (2006</xref>: 215) call for the ‘critical mass’ of female media workers ‘in <italic>decision-making positions</italic>’ that will ultimately bring about real change in the gender biases of the mediasphere. In this case at least, the change began with western organizations opening up opportunities to qualified women.</p>
<p>Hanania has also made a small but crucial step in gaining access to the international political system. It says something very strong to both Palestinians and Americans when Hanania sits across from figures such as Hillary Clinton in a professional context. Yes, these interactions are shaped through the vested interests of a western community that has done little to prove it can be trusted to be fair when it comes to Israel and Palestine. But there nonetheless remains the need to study, understand and respect the agency that exists at the local level of such imbalanced global interactions.</p>
