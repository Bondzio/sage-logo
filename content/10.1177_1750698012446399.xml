<p>This international conference on ‘Memory, Mediation, Remediation’ was hosted by the Department of English and Film Studies of Wilfrid Laurier University (WLU) as part of the university’s centennial celebrations. Organized by Dr Russell Kilbourn and Dr Eleanor Ty, this conference was an opportunity both to extend an interrogation of memory beyond its representation in literary and filmic texts and to question the degree to which either individual or social memory gets constituted, legitimized and ‘naturalized’ through narrative or visual media forms. This conference provided a venue for the exploration of literature and cinema as themselves veritable modes of memory. Scholars from around the world gathered, in the words of the prospectus, to extend the exploration of received modes and theories of the representation of memory to a consideration of 21st-century globalized values and ideas. Interrogating ideas such as ‘collective’, ‘social’ and ‘cultural’ memory, they asked what it means to think of ‘culture’ itself as a global memory system. How does such a system act as both source of and storehouse for a society’s most cherished values, ideals and ideologies? The conference served as an appropriate venue to bring together scholars from many disciplines and explore questions about how we represent and make use of memory in both collective and individual senses.</p>
<p>As the first department in Canada to combine the study of English and Film, WLU offered a perfect venue for this interdisciplinary venture. The interdisciplinary aspect of the conference came through strongly in papers that explored the relevance of literature, film and music to memory studies; some papers extended topics to include their sociological or cognitive psychological significance. Beyond bringing together diverse academic fields, the interdisciplinary aspect was manifest through the integration of artistic representations of memory, including several film screenings and a theatre performance. A short film series by Canadian filmmakers Seth Feldman, Don Sinclair and Renate Wickens formed part of a collective work: <italic>Reflections of the Unimaginable: A Multi-Media Rendering of Three Cities Hosting the Holocaust</italic>, which played in the Robert Langen Art Gallery throughout the first two days of the conference. The exhibit was followed by an engaging discussion with the filmmakers, and was complemented on the second day with a feature length screening of Bruce Elder’s film <italic>What Troubles the Peace at Brandenburg?</italic> at the Original Princess Cinema in Uptown Waterloo. Representations of memory were then brought to the stage with a performance of the play <italic>Eating with Lola</italic> written and performed by Toronto playwright/performer Catherine Hernandez. This artistic dimension not only encouraged direct engagement with film and theatre as modes of cultural memory, but also provided alternative forums in which to approach conventionally academic discussions.</p>
<p>Three keynote speakers contributed to the conference, serving as daily focal points to draw the various threads of the conference together. Inquiries into the importance and role of memory studies were highlighted on the first day with Sarah Henstra’s (Ryerson University, Canada) keynote address on ‘Remembrance as Resistance’, and the role of female mourning and pacifism in women’s First World War non-fiction. Henstra highlighted the ‘gendered tension between mourning and public life’ and the inherently conservative nature of much memorial discourse, asking what a ‘successful’ mourning or remembrance might look like. Focusing specifically on how woman writers dealt with the appropriation of their memorial writing, Henstra looked to the role of emotion in such writings and illustrated how conservative rhetoric was made to serve an anti-war cause. The relation of memory studies to ethics and an active engagement with the world was reaffirmed in panels on ‘Performing the Archive: Witnessing Trauma’ and ‘Writing Native North Americans into History’. Panels moved from more conventional memory studies topics such as trauma, genocide and commemoration to an analysis of the representations of postcolonial and diasporic collective memory. Memory, recollection, nostalgia and loss were recurring topics on the various panels and extended into depictions of memory in popular culture in general.</p>
<p>On the second day, keynote speaker Marlene Kadar (York University, Canada) broke down disciplinary boundaries as she drew from personal life experience in her presentation entitled ‘Following Hermine: Resisting Remembering’, thereby adding a practical, and practicable, dimension to memory studies. Various panels at the conference, such as ‘Mediating Memory, Documenting Identity’ and ‘Recuperation Through the Visual and Other Strategies’ added to Kadar’s discussion of memory, while reminding conference attendees of memory’s role as a shared experience of humanity, beyond its theoretical implications. Sabine Sielke’s (University of Bonn, Germany) paper on the ‘Joy in Repetition’ or the Significance of Seriality in the Process of Memory and Forgetting emphasized the interdisciplinary aspect of the conference. Taking up ‘neuro-aesthetics’ and the role of cognitive science in how we experience art, Dr Sielke argued that seriality has an impact on our conception of temporality and recursion and introduced the notion that, in actuality, ‘We remember forward’. Such topics broadened the conference’s import beyond that of the relationship to literature and film, into politics, pedagogy and psychology.</p>
<p>Well-known memory theorist Alison Landsberg (George Mason University, USA), whose notion of ‘prosthetic memory’ has been highly influential in the field of memory studies, also presented her keynote in which she situated film as a site for an affective politics and for inciting social change. Her lecture, entitled ‘Memory and the Historical Film: Theorizing Affective Engagements’, argued that since an affective response increases the personal stake in historical events, the ‘prosthetic memories’ offered in film have the potential for affective engagements. Cinema, then, becomes an ‘experiential site’, not necessarily in the fostering of identification (as in classic spectatorship theory), but rather affect as a modus of provoking and stirring into action. Landsberg’s talk generated much debate and thoughtful – affected – stances on the possible roles cinema plays in relation to memory of historical tragedies.</p>
<p>The theme of how literature and film help mediate our relationship to remembered atrocities recurred throughout the conference. Two panels looked at ‘War and Trauma in Film’ and included discussion of films as diverse as those of Tran Anh Hung and Quentin Tarantino. Panels such as ‘Trauma &amp; Genocide’ further developed an interrogation of the roles of memorials, commemoration and representation in remembrance. Reflecting on the genocides of the Roma people by the Nazis, the Serbian genocide of Muslims in Bosnia and the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia, panelists asked: Given that ‘commemoration is the root of historical awareness’ for most western cultures, what are the implications of either collective or specific choices not to remember? Discussions ranged from the ethics of both remembering and forgetting, to filmic and literary techniques used to perform, and thus communicate, characters’ trauma. The conference offered a unique space to explore how memories become contested spaces, both in remembering and re-enacting.</p>
<p>Despite the wide range of topics that ‘Memory, Mediation and Remediation’ covered and the inevitable creation of panels containing papers that are hard to relate to one another, the conference managed to find a unifying thread in exploring the way that memory is publicly and culturally represented. Even with an inevitable focus on trauma and the darker aspects of memory and commemoration, the atmosphere of the conference remained upbeat, which resulted not only in open and collegial discussions of individuals’ work, but fostered collaboration between graduate students and experienced scholars as they investigated the politics and ethics of memory and its representation.</p>
