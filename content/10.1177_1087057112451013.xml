<p>ATCC now offers genetically diverse tumor cell panels for drug discovery, pathway analysis, and functional genomics. These new tools combine well-characterized adherent cell lines that were selected for their genomic mutations as found in the Sanger COSMIC database. Each tissue-specific tumor cell panel is composed of different cell lines that have been grouped by tissue of tumor origin. In developing the panels, ATCC evaluated 20 different genes associated with tumorigenesis, including TP53, CDKN2A, BRAF, and KRAS. Descriptive information for each cell line has been annotated with details regarding known mutations in these selected oncogenes or receptors. There are 10 tissue-specific tumor cell panels in the collection, including panels for breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, and pancreatic cancer. ATCC will continue to augment the available information on the tumor cell panel cell lines from other databases and will perform further characterization on the panels.</p>

<p>According to Navitar, its new dual-view imaging system allows users to simultaneously view a single subject and capture an image at multiple fields of view (FOVs). The new module offers, with just one setup, a single objective lens presented to two separate imaging channels. The channels can be fixed, zoom, or a combination of both. Two separate light sources and wavelengths can be used, allowing inspection of multiple types of materials. The use of different adapter tubes on each optical path provides a wider FOV than a traditional single-view system, without the hassles of changing workstations or lighting setups.</p>
<p>The dual-view system has a minimum potential optical magnification range of 0.09× to 6.13×, which corresponds to FOVs as large as 120 mm diagonal on a 2/3″ format sensor down to a 0.65 mm diagonal on a 1/4″ sensor. Maximum optical magnification using the dual-view system can range from 20× to 583× using a 50× objective.</p>

<title>DP73 14-Bit Microscope Camera</title>
<p>The new Olympus DP73 digital microscope camera offers the highest combination of bit depth (14-bit) and pixel resolution (17.28 MB), for ultra-high resolution and exceptional color reproduction, even in very light or dark image areas. A powerful 3-CCD mode enhances normal pixel-shifting optical technology so the camera delivers ultra-high-quality brightfield and widefield fluorescence images without the interpolation artifacts typical of other Bayer mask cameras.</p>
<p>The DP73 offers a huge 17.28-megapixel image, with unprecedented resolving capability and color fidelity. Even more importantly, the camera’s 3-CCD mode provides a new way of performing pixel-shifted imaging with a Bayer mask camera. Like similar cameras, it increases pixel resolution by physically moving the CCD sensor horizontally and vertically within each pixel to capture and overlay subpixel information; but unlike comparable cameras, the DP73’s 3-CCD mode multiplies the RGB color information within each pixel, dramatically increasing resolution.</p>
<p>DP73 users also can avoid the photo-bleaching artifacts that sometimes happen under fluorescence illumination. Without changing brightness levels or losing gray-scale levels, the camera corrects for color bleaching or fading while eliminating cross-hatching and similar artifacts that occur with other pixel-shifting cameras. Images can be captured across a sensitivity range from ISO 100 to ISO 1600, so that even dimly fluorescing subjects look crisp and clear.</p>
<p>For users whose work involves samples with important detail in the darkest or lightest tonal ranges of color, the DP73 offers an optional WiDER feature, which provides an extended, extra-wide dynamic range capability so that dark, light, and mid tone regions all are imaged crisply without sacrificing detail in other tonal regions. WiDER optimizes the entire image in real time without over- or underexposing samples, making it ideal for publishing and working with complex fluorescence applications such as fluorescence in situ hybridization or multiprobe imaging.</p>

<title>Olympus FluoView FV1000 Laser Scanning Confocal and Multiphoton Microscope Research Imaging System</title>
<p>Three enhancements to the Olympus FluoView FV1000 system include a gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) detector, updated ASW v.3.1 software and a new multipoint mapping/scanning and piezo focus system. The GaAsP detector is designed for users who must visualize very weakly fluorescing specimens, highly photosensitive samples or very thick specimens requiring the highest sensitivity. It offers higher signal-to-noise performance and more than double the quantum efficiency of standard photo-multiplier tubes (PMTs). It couples two standard PMTs and two additional GaAsP channels when the highest sensitivity is required. The cooled GaAsP detector also has a protection circuit.</p>
<p>Updated ASW v.3.1 software helps users acquire large Z-stacks of image data and view them easily. Data sets of more than 150 gigabytes can be acquired in a single Z-stack and image files can be accessed directly from the hard disk. An enhanced graphical user interface allows users to acquire well beyond Nyquist rate and open images directly within the software. The direct-access feature is designed to work with the FV1000’s automated stage.</p>
<p>For fast measurements at multiple points or tissue depths, the high-speed piezo-Z focus scanning mechanism provides the speed necessary for fast data acquisition over multiple Z-axis locations.</p>
