<abstract>
<p>Shortages of water could become a major obstacle to public health and development. Currently, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimate that 1.1 billion people lack access to a water supply and 2.6 billion people lack adequate sanitation. The global health burden associated with these conditions is staggering, with an estimated 1.6 million deaths every year from diseases associated with lack of access to safe drinking water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene. In this paper we review the impact of water shortages on health and human development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The world is facing a critical shortage of fresh water over the next two decades, according to a report from the World Commission on Water.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913910391040">1</xref></sup> The report predicts that the use of water will increase by 40% in the next 20 years due to growing demands from agriculture, industry and urban areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913910391040">1</xref></sup> With climate change the situation will get worse; hotter, drier summers will reduce water availability and will lead to an increase in water demand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913910391040">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Today, 1.1 billion people have inadequate access to water and 2.6 billion live without access to basic sanitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913910391040">2</xref></sup> A lack of water to meet daily needs has serious health consequences.

<p>The health burdens attributable to lack of water and sanitation are significant. Yet more people endure the largely preventable effects of water scarcity and poor sanitation than are affected by war, terrorism and weapons of mass destruction combined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913910391040">3</xref></sup> These effects are caused by exposure to pathogenic microbes through various routes, which can be summarized in six categories (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757913910391040">Table 1</xref>). This large number of categories is an indication of the extent to which water-, sanitation- and hygiene-related diseases can affect populations.</p>

<p>Diseases related to unsafe water, poor sanitation and lack of hygiene are some of the most common causes of illness and death among the poor of developing countries. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 1.6 million deaths each year can be attributed specifically to these health determinants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913910391040">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nearly 60% of mortality is linked to infectious diseases, mainly diarrhea, schistosomiasis, trachoma and intestinal helminths.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913910391040">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757913910391040">5</xref></sup> Moreover, other diseases with less mortality, like malaria, filariasis, onchocerciasis, dengue and Japanese encephalitis, are becoming more difficult to manage because of the growing resistance of pathogens to drugs and insects to insecticides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913910391040">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Health burden for children</title>
<p>Each year 1.5–2 million children still die from water- and sanitation-related diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757913910391040">6</xref></sup> and many more are debilitated by illness, pain and discomfort. Although insufficient and unsafe water supplies and sanitation affect people of all ages, children’s health and well-being is particularly compromised. Approximately 84% of the global burden of diarrhoeal disease is experienced by children under five and 74% of the health burden from intestinal helminths affects children between five and 14.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757913910391040">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Diarrhoea and intestinal parasites contribute much to malnutrition in children, by causing decreased food intake, impaired nutrient absorption, direct nutrient losses and by challenging their immune systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757913910391040">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757913910391040"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757913910391040">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, poor water supply can affect growth in other ways. When a water supply is situated some distance away, this can contribute to heavy workloads for older children, causing them to burn calories that they depend on for adequate nutrition. Carrying overly heavy containers can even contribute to deformities in bone growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757913910391040">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757913910391040">11</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1757913910391040">
<title>Impacts for mental and social development</title>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated strong connections between infection with diarrhoeal pathogens in the first two years of life and malnutrition and cognitive functioning when children are between six and nine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757913910391040">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757913910391040">13</xref></sup> Children who have suffered from early malnutrition have lower IQ levels and school achievement, and more behavioural problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757913910391040">13</xref></sup> Moreover, other research has found higher levels of anxiety and inattention in these children when compared to others from the same poor neighbourhoods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757913910391040">14</xref></sup> It is hypothesized that higher cortisol levels in these children may be linked to poor cognitive performance and to their decreased functional immunity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757913910391040">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Poor provision of water can limit opportunities for older children too, in part by limiting the availability of their free time. Many children, most often girls, spend hours each day collecting water, which can interfere with school attendance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757913910391040">10</xref></sup> Girls’ attendance can also be affected by the quality of sanitation facilities in school, especially once they have started to menstruate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757913910391040">15</xref></sup> Many urban and rural schools have inadequate and poorly maintained facilities, and in some cases none.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757913910391040">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757913910391040">15</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1757913910391040">
<title>Impact on women</title>
<p>A disproportionate share of the labour and health burden of household water and sanitation inadequacies falls on women. It is typically women who collect water from public standpipes, often queuing for long periods and often having to get up very early or go late at night.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757913910391040">10</xref></sup> Time spent in search of water forces women to forgo opportunities to engage in small business endeavours, such as growing and selling vegetables or weaving mats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757913910391040">16</xref></sup> A lack of water may prevent people from practising proper hygiene habits, such as washing their hands before eating or after using a latrine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757913910391040">16</xref></sup> Water scarcity may also limit the ability to grow and water vegetables, thus depriving individuals of essential nutrients needed to fight diseases.</p>
<p>Women are also particularly susceptible to many environmental hazards when pregnant, since the reproductive system is particularly sensitive to adverse environmental conditions. The diseases linked to inadequate water and sanitation provision (and their role in malnutrition) contribute to many of the serious health problems faced by mothers and thus also to their capacity to cope with difficulties during pregnancy, childbirth and the post-partum period, to produce a strong healthy baby and to breastfeed and care for it.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757913910391040">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757913910391040">17</xref></sup> These diseases also have a role in the very high maternal mortality rates evident in most low- and middle-income nations, although the absence or very poor quality of health services for childbearing women is the main cause.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757913910391040">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757913910391040">18</xref></sup></p>

<title>Reducing health-related costs</title>
<p>Improvement in sanitation, hygiene and water contributes to improved health, generates savings for households and national health budgets, and increases poor households’ economies through decreasing costs and loss of time. A recent cost–benefit analysis by WHO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757913910391040">20</xref></sup> showed that access in water and sanitation would bring substantial economic gains from both health and other benefits: each $1 invested would yield an economic return of between $3 and $34, depending on region. The benefits would include an average global reduction of diarrhoeal episodes of around 10%. If the goal for water and sanitation access were met, the health-related costs avoided would reach $7.3 billion per year, and the annual global value of adult working days gained as a result of less illness would be almost $750 million.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Water for human use is coming under increasing pressure from population growth, development and potentially climate change. The contribution of water supply and sanitation to overall public health must be recognized in public and health policies, and reflected in budgetary allocations between curative and preventive health services. The role of investments in water and sanitation in reducing the physical and financial loads on the health sector must be acknowledged in public health policies. With that in mind, the health sector must become a vigorous advocate for adequate investments in water and sanitation.</p>
