<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>This is a very good time to reflect on the activities of the last 12 months and I think we can be forgiven for feeling quietly content with the way in which MSJ continues to evolve. We have been inundated with papers with a further 23% increase in submissions on 2011 and will have received well in excess of 900 papers by the end of 2012. More importantly, the papers are of greater quality and diversity and more topical. This has resulted in more editorials which bring out some of the issues in our more challenging submissions. Inevitably it has also resulted in a continuing rise in our rejection rate and a greater number of papers triaged by the editors without going to peer review (now approaching 33%).</p>
<p>It has been very encouraging to see how popular (with high numbers of downloads) the topical reviews have become and how readily those approached have been to produce the now familiar, succinct and up to date reviews. We have a healthy bank of reviews for the coming year but always welcome suggestions for new topics. The controversies continue to spark debate, although some of our contributors find the format quite challenging as they put aside their own views and espouse a particular and sometimes quite extreme stance. Michael Hutchinson provides over-arching comment which is wise and balanced but not without an edge. Recently we have made the controversies open access to encourage even greater uptake.</p>
<p>We have introduced two new features in order to accommodate contributions which don’t fall within the normal remit of the journal but which nonetheless bring new ideas and stimulate discussion and debate. This is particularly the case for Personal Viewpoints but also applies to New Perspectives which has in the last few months described recently launched initiatives in two important areas - clinical outcome measures and progressive MS.</p>
<p>One of the most important roles for MSJ is to be engaged with the entire MS research community. This is greatly enhanced by our evolving relationship with the TRIMS – we are pleased to have close working relationships with ECTRIMS and ACTRIMS, have awarded prizes at the last two PACTRIMS meetings in Singapore and China and are in active discussion with LACTRIMS. We are proud to publish abstracts for all four TRIMS, and also to help support the work of MSIF.</p>
<p>The secret of the success of MSJ is the incredibly engaged and supportive editorial board, to whom we are very grateful. We had a lively and very well attended editorial board meeting in Lyon where even greater engagement was discussed. We will continue to refresh our board as some of our more long-standing members step down and we incorporate others from our community often with expertise in new and increasingly relevant areas of activity. We have had a number of new members this year and plan further changes in 2013.</p>
<p>As we move into 2013 we are keeping an eye on our Impact Factor. We will be increasing to 14 issues in order to improve time to publication (though now all research papers are appearing online within six weeks of acceptance). We continue to rely heavily on our reviewers (over 400 in all). The quantity and quality of exciting and important research continues to grow and we need to find ever-more imaginative ways of communicating it to the MS research community in a timely and accessible fashion.</p>
<p>We would like to wish you all a healthy, prosperous and productive 2013.</p>
