<p>In this issue of <italic>Perspectives on Leading-following</italic>, guest author Dr. Debra Bournes describes the <italic>nursing research challenge</italic> initiative that she created and led while she was Director of Nursing—New Knowledge and Innovation at a large academic health science center. This unique initiative can serve as an exemplar of nursing-theory guided leading-following. Informed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318413477208">Parse’s (2008)</xref> humanbecoming leading-following model, the nursing research challenge was created to encourage and support staff nurses to engage in nursing research in the practice setting. Nurses at all levels were involved as both leaders and followers in a shared vision of generating a research culture aimed at the pursuit of excellence in patient-centered care and quality of work-life. Using Parse’s leading-following model as the theoretical perspective, Bournes describes how the nursing research challenge was operationalized and its impact on nurses and patient care in the multi-site teaching hospital where it was implemented. This innovative initiative will be of interest to nurse leaders and followers in diverse practice settings and would be well worth emulating as a way of creating a robust nursing research culture.</p>
