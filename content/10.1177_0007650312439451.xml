<p>Researchers often fail to honor luminaries in their fields of inquiry, at least while they are still alive. What follows is one such tribute, to Dr. Thomas M. Jones, the Boeing Company endowed professor in business management at the University of Washington’s Foster School of Business. <italic>Business &amp; Society</italic> represents an appropriate outlet for this tribute, given that Tom was the first editor of the journal when the International Association for Business and Society (IABS) assumed editorial control of the Sage Publications journal in 1993.</p>

<speaker>Paul Godfrey:</speaker>
<p>In December of 2010, a group of researchers gathered in Salt Lake City, Utah, for a biennial stakeholder conference. Brad Agle and I organized this edition of the conference. Tom Jones and Jeff Harrison hosted the first such conference back in 2007 in Seattle. Jeff Harrison hosted the second iteration of the conference in Richmond in 2009. I received my PhD at the University of Washington [UW]—as did Brad—and the impact of Tom’s work on my research has been an early imprint, a profound orientation toward business scholarship, and an ongoing delight. Tom’s professional contribution, for me at least, comes second; Tom’s good humor, kindly manner, and welcoming personality have left a deep and significant imprint on who I am as a person.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to Tom, Brad and I told all the participants to think of what Tom has contributed to their career and thinking, both professionally and personally. The group gathered at my home and, loaded with recording equipment, we proceeded to offer our tributes to Tom. In the spirit of the <italic>Congressional Record</italic>, we’ve given each participant the opportunity to edit their comments for the public record. We also, very much in the spirit of the <italic>Congressional Record</italic>, allowed former students and current colleagues who could not attend the conference to include their tributes to Tom.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Brad Agle:</speaker>
<p>As Paul and I were preparing the Salt Lake City stakeholder conference we agreed that <bold>honoring</bold> Tom would be a great idea. As you will read in my later comments, I have a great deal of respect, admiration, and affection for Tom. One of the reasons I respect Tom so much is because of the profound effect he had on me early in my career. For example, to the best of my memory, he did not share the opinion of many business and society scholars I encountered early in my studies who believed that business and society scholarship was not welcome in the primary journals of the Academy of Management: <italic>Academy of Management Review</italic> (AMR) and <italic>Academy of Management Journal</italic> (AMJ). He taught me that the journals would accept business and society topics as long as the work was of high quality. While I didn’t have any confidence in my ability to ever publish in such esteemed journals, I believed that it was possible and that dedicated scholars should strive to make an impact through such publishing.</p>
<p>While articles published in other journals and books are absolutely important, a large segment of <bold>the</bold> most influential scholarship is found in the top journals. In fact, a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0007650312439451">Gomez-Mejia, Treviño, and Mixon (2009)</xref> found that the best predictor of individuals receiving endowed chairs in management was publications in AMR and AMJ. Thus, I decided to do a little research to discover who have been the most influential scholars among active members in the SIM division (where business and society scholarship is central in the Academy) through publication in AMR and AMJ. I gathered all of the AMR and AMJ publications for every individual who was listed on any of the SIM programs (regular or PDW) for 2008, 2009, or 2010. This research resulted in hundreds of authors and thousands of articles. I then shortened the list by identifying only those individuals with at least five articles. From these I sought to determine which articles would be classified primarily into the SIM division. As you might imagine, such determination is difficult. However, one thing became fairly clear: Tom Jones, with nine articles, all of which I believe would be classified first into the SIM division, leads the pack. While there are several prominent scholars who had several SIM-related articles, as well as other articles in AMR and AMJ, my analysis suggests that no one else has more than five or six articles whose primary classification would be SIM. Because it is difficult to determine which division an article would primarily be sorted into and because of the various divisional changes, additions, and so on in the Academy over the years, this analysis could certainly be disputed. However, I believe that a look at the data makes it very clear that Tom has been a significant leader in the field of business and society.</p>
<p>Without further editorializing from us, here are the tributes to our colleague, mentor, and friend <bold>Tom</bold> Jones.</p>

<title>Tributes From Speakers at the Conference</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Paul Godfrey:</speaker>
<p>I’ve thought about this tribute for months, so I’ll go ahead and start off to maybe set the tone. Brad and I talked about doing this last January; I wanted to do this for a long time because Tom made a huge impact on me as a doctoral student at the University of Washington, and his work has impacted my thinking and writing ever since. Tom’s paper on stakeholder theory with Charles Hill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0007650312439451">Hill &amp; Jones, 1992</xref>) and his work with my doctoral student colleague Lori Ryan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0007650312439451">Jones &amp; Ryan, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0007650312439451">1998</xref>) both influenced howI thought about finding connections between business and society and strategy. The most seminal piece for me, however, was “An Agent Morality View of Business Policy” with Dennis Quinn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0007650312439451">Quinn &amp; Jones, 1995</xref>). This piece <bold>articulates</bold> how managers and their firms must engage in ethical behavior over the long term in order to create a strong and credible reputation of trust.</p>
<p>Tom’s most significant impact on me has nothing to do with Tom’s professional life, however. One morning I was walking to school as I always did along 17th avenue NE in Seattle. I got about half way to school and all of the sudden this—I believe he used to own a red pick-up truck—so all of the sudden this red pick-up truck pulls over to the side of the road and the driver unrolls the <bold>window</bold>. Of course you’re trained to never take candy from a stranger, but Tom says, “Would you like a ride?” For me that was really one of those great moments; here’s somebody that could be grading my work, who I’ve met with and talked about research, and he just offered me a ride to school. It was really just a great little thing and you probably wouldn’t remember that at all. . . .</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Tom:</speaker>
<p>Well, I do remember I had to move the sheep and other livestock with that truck.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Paul:</speaker>
<p>I do remember being told to watch my step and watch where I sat and I had to wash my jeans later, but I want you to know Tom, every other morning of my doctoral career I was hoping you would come by and give me a ride again. That was really just a neat thing. There’s a different kind of relationship here than a student and teacher one, so I really appreciated that.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Brad Agle:</speaker>
<p>I started the doctoral program at the University of Washington about as ignorant as a doctoral student can be in terms of what he’s getting into or what it’s all about. When I started the program there was a generation gap between the doctoral students before me and me. I believe there had been four years between doctoral student classes as Tom was busy fighting internal battles at the University of Washington. I’m confident that there wouldn’t have been a program for us to be in if you hadn’t fought those battles. So I remember my first semester there was a great learning experience. Tom was really providing service because there were a number of doctoral students who had been there for a while and needed to finish (some we referred to as emeritus students). So you did a doctoral seminar to basically help them to finish up their dissertations or to move along in their dissertations. As a first semester student I remember that being very helpful to me. At that time I certainly didn’t have any appreciation for the sacrifice you were making, but I certainly learned a lot by being able to see these students at the end of their program.</p>
<p>The other thing that really impressed me at the time was that you were sitting in on our philosophy of science and research methods PhD seminar with assistant professor Marilyn Gist. I remember thinking wow . . . here’s this senior professor . . . of course at this point I wouldn’t think you were <bold>all</bold> that old but back then you seemed to me to be a very seasoned professor . . . who has had a successful career but yet is still willing to be with a bunch of doctoral students and an assistant professor to continue learning. As I have gone through my career I have remembered that example—there is never a time when you shouldn’t be humble enough to say, “yeah, I can still learn more and I can still grow.” So that was a great example. And then over the years you have been a great mentor and an example of how to be a professional in this career. Seeing you at conferences and watching the way you’ve done research and the way you’ve worked with colleagues has been a great example to follow.</p>
<p>One of the things I look back on now with a modicum of embarrassment is my first reaction to Tom’s original scholarship. I remember the first time I read your working paper on moral intensity (<bold>Jones</bold>, 1991). I was in my second year in the doctoral program, and I don’t know if you remember this or not, but my feedback to you was something like, “You know what Tom, this is kind of common sense,” and I wasn’t all that impressed. As I have progressed through the years I have come to really appreciate what you did in that paper and what I have seen in your other work. Your theorizing is so beautiful because by the time one is finished reading the paper one comes to think of the concepts in the paper as almost common sense because you’ve done such a superb job of defining exactly what things mean and exactly what their relationships are with one another—and you’ve done it so amazingly convincingly. As I read lots and lots of literature, as many of you do, we don’t find that a lot. And that lack of clarity is not very helpful in moving a field forward as yours does so well. Thank you, Tom. You’ve been a tremendous positive influence in my career and in my life.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Tom:</speaker>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sandra Waddock:</speaker>
<p>Well, I’ve known Tom as a colleague and friend over many years, and looking <bold>around</bold> am probably the second-most senior person here, so take what I say with that in mind. Tom Jones has influenced my life in two important ways. One is I that watched when he served as editor of <italic>Business &amp; Society</italic>, perhaps the field’s leading journal, back in the early days of its transition away from Roosevelt College to the International Association of Business in Society (IABS), where it is currently housed. What Tom taught was the difficulty of separating his personal ethics and sense of responsibility to colleagues in his work as editor of the journal. What he said was that he did not like being editor—and indeed gave up the editorship rather quickly—because being editor meant that he had to be more critical of his colleagues than he was comfortable being. That made a huge impression on me because it said a lot about his character and, I think, the nature of our field, which fundamentally in my view at least is about doing good research that enhances society’s and business’s roles in societies. It also speaks to the nature of the review process that our current academic system has created, and how little supportive of peoples’ best efforts it sometimes is. Tom, I believe, recognized that early on, and it influenced his decisions as editor, his decision about whether to remain as editor, and his way of approaching both the field and the people—the scholars—within it.</p>
<p>The second way Tom influenced me was in his thoughtful approach to research. For example, I believe it was at an IABS meeting or perhaps SIM (Social Issues in Management division of the Academy of Management) session where he argued strongly for improving the quality of empirical <bold>work</bold> in business in society as a way of helping to move the field forward. In particular, he noted that one technique for improving study of corporate responsibility would be to use a technique called data envelopment analysis (DEA). At the time, I had never heard of that approach, but Sam Graves and I were doing a lot of work using the then-KLD (now MSCI ESG) database, so I went home with that idea in my head. As it happened, we had another colleague at the time, Catherine Lerme Bendheim, who knew a lot about DEA, and methodologically was leagues ahead of most of us. So the three of us got together using Tom’s insight and actually produced a paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0007650312439451">Bendheim, Waddock, &amp; Graves, 1998</xref>) that is one of my more cited papers, though to my knowledge it’s still the only paper in the field to use DEA, perhaps because of the complexity of the approach and technological and methodological sophistication that is needed. Of course, Tom’s ideas have been influential in other ways, as his work on stakeholder theory and ethics attests, but whatever he has done, Tom has proved a gracious, generous, and thoughtful colleague to all of his friends and students, and for that I will be forever grateful.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Tom Jones:</speaker>
<p>Can I tell a story about Sandra? We talked a lot about research at the academy; there would be some paper or some idea out there and she would corner me or I would corner her and we would talk about this brilliant research idea and go “Oh yeah, yeah, yeah” and then we’d go to the <bold>SIM</bold> happy hour and whatever ideas we had were never heard from again! Too many glasses of wine; I’m sure some were brilliant, anyways . . . good ideas; at least they seemed good before the happy hour.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Andy Wicks:</speaker>
<p>I can’t think of anybody that has contributed more to our field than Tom, and I would like to build on something that Brad said. We are a field with a lot of really big ideas and great intentions, but there are very few people who can take those very big ideas and bring them down onto the ground and show how they work and how they are connected to the rest of what we know about business. Nobody has done a better job with bringing that level of clarity, precision, and practicality than Tom. And what’s impressed me is that he has done it with such incredible <bold>clarity</bold> but also that he has done it at such a high level of quality and productivity for so long. He has an incredible record, and his ideas will continue to shape the field for a long time to come.</p>
<p>I have personally benefitted immensely from Tom’s work and having Tom as a colleague, mentor, <bold>and</bold> friend. Many of you knowI came to the University of Washington out of a graduate program in Religious Studies and I had no idea what I was doing at first. I was completely unqualified for the job. And yet somehow I made tenure at UW, something that would never have happened without Tom. The time that he spent with me, helping me understand what I need to do to be successful at UW and to learn how to do great research in management, was invaluable. His effort, his patience, and his concern for me meant the world and made all the difference. And as I look in the room I see all of these people that Tom has influenced and who are devoted to him. And so it’s not just his own papers, but the work that all of us have done that really reflects Tom’s contributions. He is an incredible exemplar for our field. This is a man who lived through so much and persevered. For those of you that are younger won’t know this, but several years before I arrived there was a business in society department at the University of Washington and there were 10 or 11 people in the department?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Tom:</speaker>
<p>16 at one time.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Andy:</speaker>
<p>16. A new dean came to the University of Washington and it was her agenda to pretty much wipe it off the face of the planet. Tom was the only person who survived her purge and he stayed and persevered, despite what the dean, and many of his colleagues who either tolerated or collaborated in her dismantling of the department, did to Tom’s department. And yet he found a way to stay, continue his career, and make a difference at the University of Washington. That’s the kind of guy that Tom is.</p>
<p>And finally, personally, Tom has been far more than a mentor, thought leader, and great colleague. He has been a great friend to me throughout my career and to many in the field. One of the hardest things about leaving UW was leaving Tom. I know Shawn is going to talk about this when he has the floor, but here’s a guy when one of the students got seriously sick who doesn’t hesitate to drop <bold>everything</bold> and get in the car to drive 11 hours down to San Francisco to go see him—despite having a bad back and enduring the discomfort of that long car ride. It’s just remarkable. He really showed his devotion to Shawn and to how much of himself he has put into this field and the people in this room.</p>
<p>We were fortunate enough to have Tom come visit at Darden for a few months last year. It was wonderful because it brought back a lot of memories and a great chance to reconnect but at the same time seeing him go again was really hard. So Tom I thank you so much for all you have done for me, for all those whose lives you have touched for the better. I can’t think of anybody who has <bold>done</bold> more for our field. You deserve all our thanks and congratulations.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lori Ryan:</speaker>
<p>I want to go back in history to the first year of my PhD program, 1990-1991—it’s scary how long ago that was—and two of the lessons that I learned that year from Tom. One was when I took his MBA ethics class. At the University of Washington, we have a decimal grading system, and he gave me a 3.7. I went rushing into his office and said, “What have I done?” I was horrified that I had gotten a 3.7. He looked at me and said, “Don’t you know that grades don’t matter anymore? You’re a PhD student. You don’t have to think about grades. You need to think about something bigger than grades.” It was funny because I was still focused on, “Oh, my gosh, I should have least gotten a 3.9—what did I do?” It was a great learning experience. After a lifetime of focusing on my grade point average, it was a pivotal moment, because I realized that my education had finally moved beyond grades. Another lesson that year was that Tom had no manuscripts left in his file cabinet. They were either published or out under review. If an article didn’t place here, it placed there. He just didn’t have stale stuff.</p>
<p>Our bonding moment came on the heels of Tom’s moral intensity article, which was a pivotal point both in his career and in the moral decision-making field. It was then that he asked me if I wanted to write an article together. And, being the brazen, postcorporate doctoral student that I was, I said, “You know, we need to talk about something first. . . . ” Our politics were not aligned, which would have made it difficult to write anything normative. So we decided that the safest place for us to work together was moral psychology. We then developed two moral approbation articles together, and it worked out great from my point of view because they had that nugget of moral <bold>content</bold> but no normative commentary that conflicted with either of our political positions. Our moral approbation construct was also the platform for me to publish two more articles on the subject, including a measurement piece. Working together taught me an enormous amount about construct and model development and about publishing in moral psychology. Thank you, Tom.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Jeff Harrison:</speaker>
<p>When I read a paper written by Tom, I think, “Hey, why didn’t I think of that?” He makes things seem so simple, not that they are simple, but that his logic is so tight and his <bold>explanations</bold> so clear that they make perfect sense. Tom has made so many great contributions to the business and society literature that it is hard to select any one contribution as being the most important. He continues to be a very important scholar, and I very much enjoy his work and cite it often.</p>
<p>On a personal level, Tom has always made me feel important and welcome. Early in our <bold>relationship</bold>, after a particularly pleasant interaction with him, I remember thinking, “Wow, he actually knows who I am.” Feeling accepted by a scholar of his magnitude was important to me as I began writing in the business and society area because I was trained as a strategist and almost all of my work was on corporate strategy topics. Thank you, Tom, for your great work and for your friendship.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Megan Hess:</speaker>
<p>What Lori was saying doesn’t surprise me at all. Not to say that Tom is stubborn, <bold>but</bold> what I think you mean to say is that he is incredibly brave with his ideas. What I suspect, and I’m sure all of you will agree with me, is that your best work is still to come. I’m thinking of the happiness paper, for instance. We all can’t wait to see what comes next.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Tom:</speaker>
<p>It’s written, I just hope it get’s published, thank you.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Rob Phillips:</speaker>
<p>One of the hardest things Tom has mastered, and I’m echoing what Andy said . . . is <bold>just</bold> sustaining good scholarship. The easiest thing in the world when you get to a senior stage is just to write whatever you feel like that morning. But whenever I look through your corpus it’s all super strong; there’s not a weak point in it and that’s hard, and so well done on that. But beyond that . . . I’ve always been fond of you and we’ve always hit it off. But my judgment is sketchy; I have some shady friends. When I look around, other people who I respect really think highly of you and so it’s like an intuition check for me that other people also think very highly of you. I used to say that you were the single most underappreciated scholar in the area of stakeholder theory. I don’t think that’s true anymore; I think the world has caught up to you finally, and it may be what is going on here in this room is some evidence of that. Thanks.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lauren Purnell:</speaker>
<p>I distinctly remember the winter afternoon during my first year as a doctoral <bold>student</bold>, when Ed Freeman announced that Tom Jones would be visiting Darden to write with him and to coteach a doctoral seminar on “stakeholder theory and pragmatism.” Immediately I felt some nervous excitement because the name “Tom Jones” is so highly revered around Darden, not only for his great ideas but also for his groundbreaking success in repeatedly publishing his ideas in the top journals. This may sound over-the-top, but as a newcomer who had not yet attended a single conference or academy, my first meeting Tom in the halls of Darden I think I felt a bit star struck, like when you meet a celebrity and think wow . . . he’s a real dude.</p>
<p>Looking back, I could not have met a better dude at such an early moment in my career. Tom’s warmth and gentle style (teamed with Judy’s hospitality and sense of community) immediately <bold>dissipated</bold> the distance my star-struck imagination created. I felt my ideas welcomed, yet challenged, and my arguments taking new directions. There are many qualities to admire in Tom, but the one that I hold in highest regard is the tenacity with which he carved out a space for himself, and by extension for all of us in this room, to develop ideas and publish them at the highest echelons of the field. Thank you for being such an inspiration and for including me in this evening.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Shawn Berman:</speaker>
<p>It’s hard for me to imagine where my career would be without Tom Jones. But <bold>one</bold> of the most meaningful things to me about Tom has nothing to do with academics but has more to do Tom Jones the person. Right after 9/11 I had a stroke, when I was in Northern California working at Santa Clara University. When Tom heard about this, he and Andy Wicks jumped in a car (since they couldn’t fly) and drove from Seattle to come visit me in the hospital. That says more about who Tom Jones is as a person than any of his AMRs. Tom Jones exemplifies to me what it means to be a scholar and someone who is concerned with the well-being of his larger institution, but he is also someone who is a loyal friend. I feel privileged to have had Tom as a mentor and friend for these past 15 years.</p>
<p>In all honesty, when I went to the University of Washington as a PhD student in Finance in the <bold>Fall</bold> of 1993, I’d never heard of the Tom Jones who teaches at the University of Washington. However, during my time at UW, I quickly figured out that pursuing a degree in finance wasn’t going to help me study my real interest, the interplay between business and society. During my second quarter, I had a conversation with Melissa Schilling about my interests, and she said the words that changed my life: “You know, there’s a guy here named Tom Jones. You should go talk to him.” Tom eventually agreed to become my dissertation advisor. During this time the Toronto Stakeholder Conferences were happening and Tom had just written the 1995 AMR on Instrumental Stakeholder Theory. I used this article to frame the hypotheses in my dissertation, which examined the link between CEO compensation and stakeholder performance. So, it’s thanks to Tom that I became involved with stakeholder theory and found my intellectual home.</p>
<p>For me, Tom’s most influential article is the 1995 article on instrumental stakeholder theory. Not only because of its connection to my dissertation but also because that article forces us to think about what firm performance broadly means across the array of stakeholders who interact with the firm. The hardest challenge there is thinking about new dependent variables for firm performance that move beyond measures of profit and shareholder performance. I’m sure thinking about what a <bold>measure</bold> of aggregate stakeholder performance looks like and how it’s measured will keep me busy for the rest of my career.</p>
<p>I feel very fortunate to have worked as closely with Tom as I have, and I thank him for all he’s <bold>meant</bold> to stakeholder theory and the field of business and society. But, most of all, I thank him for being a great friend and a real “dude.”</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Tom:</speaker>
<p>Thank you sir.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Jared Harris:</speaker>
<p>I was really hoping to go before Shawn Berman spoke, because I knew that anyone who spoke after Shawn would share things that might seem sort of small and trivial, given the close personal connection between Tom and Shawn. So I guess I will fill that role, and I suppose maybe that’s fitting; my involvement with Tom has been more distal than some of the experiences that have been shared tonight. He wasn’t my advisor, and I’ve never taught at the same institution as Tom. I would of course echo what’s already been said—I admire all of his papers and his large body of impressive, field-changing scholarship. Beyond that I don’t have anything to add to what everyone has already eloquently conveyed about Tom not only being a “real dude” but being a “real dude” with some amazing intellectual prowess. Tom’s academic record speaks for itself.</p>
<p>So instead I thought I would share some of my initial impressions of Tom—which, by the way, have turned out to be right on the mark. When I entered this field as a student of Norm Bowie’s, I began to find my way and meet others interested in the same kinds of issues. Some of those people were well known in the field, and many others were peers or emergent scholars. Tom was certainly one of the “big names,” but the thing that struck me was the way Tom really exemplified (in addition to all of the great things that everyone else has talked about tonight) a certain humility and diligence, what it meant to serve the field and to build the field. Obviously all of us are to <bold>some</bold> degree focused on the parts of our career that are portable—our own publications, the things we need to do to qualify for tenure and promotion, etc. We’ve got to establish ourselves and we’ve got to chalk up our own record and all that entails. But from the moment that I met Tom it became evident that he was concerned with much bigger things. He always seemed to be interested in the greater progress of the field, and how we’re all coming along on answering the big questions. It has always seemed to me that with Tom, that’s the starting point. That was my initial impression, I was very struck by it, and as I’ve gotten to know Tom better over the years, that impression has certainly been borne out.</p>
<p>Yet despite his stature in the field, and his motivation to make a difference in the field, Tom has a real groundedness to him that makes him tremendously approachable. As a brand new scholar I was also initially struck by how easy it was to have a conversation with him; he was interested in <bold>what</bold> I was doing, he remembered me, and all of that made me want to follow in his footsteps and make a difference in the field too. Here is this amazing scholar that takes an interest in everybody and brings everyone along with him. That’s Tom.</p>

<p>Thank you. My experiences with Tom have been more recent than some of the others’. My most meaningful engagement with Tom occurred about six months ago when he was a visitor at Darden. Rob Phillips and I were working on a paper that refines agency theory, and Rob said we had a really unique opportunity to bounce these ideas around with a master who would <bold>know</bold> if they have validity.</p>
<p>We made plans to meet in Charlottesville, and I prepared for that meeting by reading (or rereading) <bold>much</bold> of Tom’s work. This gave me a sense of where Tom might come from in our discussion and enabled me to frame a small number of very pointed questions for him. I was particularly struck by Tom’s 1995 AMR piece with Dennis Quinn. They explain how markets themselves require and enforce moral rules about honoring agreements and avoiding lying. They also talk about the underlying principles of markets, like respecting autonomy. These points are insightful and, I think, still underrecognized in our theorizing.</p>
<p>What I really got on the day we met was that it wasn’t just Tom that we met with, it was Tom and all of the people Tom has worked with over the years. He brought their ideas, too. Tom’s current research partner at the time was Adrian. Adrian is a doctoral student at Darden, and Tom had <bold>invited</bold> her to join us for our meeting. I am learning that inclusion—the openness with which Tom considers others, like doctoral students from other universities—is standard operating procedure for Tom. It turned out to be a very productive meeting for Rob and me. The four of us bounced around a lot of ideas and scenarios—the way you do at an open, productive research meeting. At the end of the day, Rob and I left Charlottesville with invaluable ideas for how to refine our theory.</p>
<p>Based on everything else that I am learning about Tom tonight, he has a lot to be proud of—but, man, there was just no ego at all in that meeting we had in Charlottesville. It was just the four of us thoughtfully bouncing ideas around, and that’s what this is all about. This is what makes research so much fun. My sense is that Tom really is in it for the stimulation. While some of you guys have <bold>hinted</bold> that he could be coasting right now if he wanted to, my sense is that he is completely jazzed to be in the conversation and that we are all still benefiting from his energy and his attitude. I know I am. So thanks Tom.</p>

<p>In a relatively short period of time, Tom has had an immense influence on my life as a scholar and (more importantly) as a person. Last year, when Tom was visiting Darden, Doug Bosse, Rob Phillips and Tom asked me to join them for lunch to discuss a paper. What I experienced was an environment for sharing ideas free from doctrine or ego. Almost as if the idea was the hero and not the people working with it. It was incredible to see, and it partially changed my view on scholarship and collaboration. Another time he and I talked about the seeds of an idea for a paper. Six months later Tom left me a message: “There’s this conference going on; let’s pull <bold>that</bold> paper together and present it there.” I spent the better part of a day looking through my notes to remind myself of what we discussed. But he had never stopped thinking about it.</p>
<p>A person with Tom’s stature in this field has no reason to collaborate on a project with me—a doctoral student from another university. But throughout the writing and working through of ideas, Tom has consistently treated me as his peer. My experience with him has redefined what I think about collaboration in scholarship. I used to think that it was the fair exchange of equivalent value between two or more people, but it might be better conceived of not as a trade, but as a gift. For Tom, collaboration is the giving of one’s knowledge to another without any expectation of <bold>recourse</bold> or compensation.</p>
<p>He is the embodiment of Harold Bloom’s idea of the strong poet. He resists the temptation to be influenced by the predilections of the establishment view, even when it means the odd battle. And <bold>because</bold> of what he has done in this field, those of us starting out have a lot to look forward to.</p>
<p><bold>Jennifer Griffin</bold> (September 2011, although she was at the conference): As I reflect on Tom Jones’ incredible body of work a category 3 hurricane is blasting up the Eastern seaboard. The hurricane is likely to make landfall in the next day or two. With strong winds, steady rain, and moving <bold>slowly</bold> across a wide swath of the Mid-Atlantic it looks as if the hurricane is going to be a record breaker in a number of categories.</p>
<p>I can’t help but think of the parallels between Tom’s work and the impending hurricane. Let me set <bold>the</bold> stage for you. First, Tom’s work is a tour de force. He packs a powerful voice into a wide body of literature. With over 1,000 citations for two articles and more than 5,000 citations across his opus of work spanning two decades he has been very consistently one of the great scholars within the Business and Society field. With multiple doctoral students, he has created quite a steady production of words that rain down on us all rather frequently. His scholarly thoughts, published exclusively in top-tier academic journals to pack a powerful and pervasive punch, reflect the patient, steady blast of a hurricane.</p>
<p>Second, it’s not a body of work to be taken lightly. Weighty topics such as trust, optimal trust, ethical decision making, convergent stakeholder theory, agency theory, and agent morality are made accessible with his thorough, concise writing. Tom takes on the tough subjects. He wrestles them to the ground for us. In his deliberate and deliberative way, he creates a level path for us scholars going forward. Operationalizing and fine-tuning the constructs, he creates a deeper understanding with a vision for the future. That vision is very much imbued with the core <bold>foundations</bold> of ethics, morality, and sound decision making. He writes to scholars and managers about managing and managerial decision making. He provides the candle/lighthouse beacon that continues to burn even when the electricity is off.</p>
<p>Third, providing a steady light in unsteady times, he leads us safely to various harbors to wait out the <bold>storm</bold>. The harbors are open but only for the courageous, those scholars courageous enough to make explicit underlying assumptions. Tom challenges us relentlessly to provide the best possible analysis. He tests boundary conditions and forces us to think about integration/hybridization (e.g., convergent stakeholder theory) as well as optimal levels (e.g., optimal levels of trust). The harbors are not always placid. That is, multiple skills, multiple methods, and multiple theories may be needed to explain phenomena. Smooth sailing is far from a guarantee. Yet it does mean tightly argued ideas that are internally consistent and withstands the test of all weathers.</p>
<p>Fourth, sweeping indiscriminately across cities and towns of all sizes, affecting state and countries irrespective of synthetic human jurisdictions, the hurricane knows no formal boundaries. <bold>Originating</bold> in tropics, moving through the Caribbean islands, the Eastern seaboard of America with long reach repercussion reaching into Canada. Similarly, Tom does not contain his thoughts to just the business of business. He recognizes that the intersection of multiple literatures (ethics, business policy, stakeholder, corporate social responsibility, agency theory) working with a wide variety of coauthors, taken in sum, strengthens, extends, and deepens the sum total of his impacts. Yet, at the eye of the storm is calm, a perpetual calm: Moral considerations trump all else when a conflict among interests are present.</p>
<p>And finally, what about the destruction the hurricane has wrought, you ask. Well, indeed, it was a record breaker. It is estimated to be one of the most costly hurricanes since records were kept. Its impact was felt most strongly in ways that were completely unexpected. The flood waters in <bold>upstate</bold> Vermont (thousands of miles from where the storm made landfall) were the most devastating. Roads were washed out. Entire villages were isolated. Neighbors were cut off from their next-door neighbors. Yet a curious thing happened. Communities came together. They celebrated their good fortune with community-wide dinners. The food, libations were likely included too, and laughter proved a real balm for the survivors of the hurricane. Supplies were flown in rather than being driven across highways. That is, a third way, or a new way of thinking about community and communities of like-minded people intent on surviving was emerging. Such as it is with Tom and (re)reading his body of work: Scholars come together, share ideas, bravely exchange philosophies, test assumption, and push the limits of management research. We all walk away that much better, thanks to Tom Jones.</p>

<speaker>Tom Jones:</speaker>
<p>I just want to say thanks. This is overwhelming and excessively generous. I mean it’s been. . . . I must say I was very surprised and totally unaware. I appreciate it and it was nice of you to say some kind words. I have enjoyed my relationships with all of you—some long term, some short term—and I hope they go on for another several years. People ask me when I am going to retire . . . my dean comes around and asks me . . . and now let’s talk about retirement! But the short answer is that when I run out of ideas I’ll probably pack it in. But some of the highest points in my life have been in my associations with people in this room and sadly one of the lowest points in my life, absolute rock bottom, Andy remembers that, when Shawn was very, very ill right after 9/11, but I’m going to choose to remember the high moments and many of those include Shawn so once again thanks for the surprise and the very kind words.</p>
<p>In my mild state of shock, I forgot to mention a major factor in what success I have had—the help I have received from my wife, Judy—part-time editor, full-time systems manager, and, most <bold>importantly</bold>, overtime inspiration and Muse.</p>

<title>Tributes From Others Not Attending the Conference</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Ed Freeman:</speaker>
<p>Tom spent the Spring of 2010 with us at Darden. The contribution that he made to our <bold>doctoral</bold> program, indeed our entire ethics program at Darden, mirrored his scholarly career. Tom has dared to ask questions that none of us have been able to ask of mainstream management thinkers. He has not been content to be an outsider lobbying in “ethics or stakeholder grenades.” Rather, his career has sought to refashion the very fabric of management theory, and his substantial publication record speaks for itself. Tom encouraged our students to do the same, and he gave them courage as well as expertise.</p>
<p>Personally, Tom has meant a great deal to me over the years. I have benefitted greatly from referee reports that could only have been written by him and conversations with him about a host of issues from scholarly ones to professional and personal ones. More recently, as we have begun to write some things together I have learned even more about what a wonderful colleague he is and how his contributions to our field range far and wide. I’m lucky to have him as a colleague and friend.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Thomas Donaldson:</speaker>
<p>Any professor whose name calls to mind a notoriously debauched English aristocratic philanderer (Tom Jones), had better be pretty good in order to make his reputation. Thomas M. Jones, Professor, has done more than make his reputation. He has fixed a standard in the ground that will stand for decades. It’s hard to think of any contemporary who has contributed more to the knowledge and teaching of business and society than Tom.</p>
<p>What has marked his remarkable success is intelligent ecumenism. Unlike so many who are rooted in the tools and techniques acquired during their PhD studies, Tom’s intellectual curiosity let him in ecumenical directions, especially into the realms of ethical theory and psychology. His work with Lori Ryan, Dennis Quinn, and Andy Wick gives witness to what integrated theory building can do (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0007650312439451">Jones &amp; Ryan, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0007650312439451">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0007650312439451">Quinn &amp; Jones, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0007650312439451">Wicks, Berman, &amp; Jones, 1999</xref>). Some of his articles have to be counted among the most influential in our contemporary period of scholarship. His “Ethical Decision Making by Individuals in Organizations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0007650312439451">Jones, 1991</xref>) influenced countless management scholars and did so by integrating concepts that had pedigrees in theoretical ethics with ones in empirical management science. His “Instrumental Stakeholder Theory” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0007650312439451">Jones, 1995</xref>) articulated for the first time a comprehensive rationale for ethics integrated with corporate financial success. And his more recent “Ethical Theory and Stakeholder-Related Decisions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0007650312439451">Jones, Felps, &amp; Bigley, 2007</xref>) has shown how convergent strands in major ethical theories can be used to mark off distinct types of corporate cultures.</p>
<p>I have counted Tom as a good friend for decades. Sometimes the friendship has cost Tom a lot. When I agreed to serve as an Action Editor at the <italic>Academy of Management Review</italic>, I was given the chance to pick five new members of the editorial board whom I could rely upon. To my surprise, Tom—who has published more articles in AMR than anyone I know—said “yes” to my invitation. I was thrilled. Over the course of four years of reading hundreds of manuscripts and about a thousand reviews, I came to understand the difference between mere skill and good scholarly judgment. Tom saw what others didn’t; Tom saw what I didn’t see; Tom got to the nub of the matter quickly. I soon learned to apply a simple algorithm, that is, the “Jones Algorithm.” <italic>Anybody’s judgment = Jones’s judgment/5.</italic> It is a formula that has served me well.</p>

<p>I first knew of Tom Jones as Shawn Berman’s dissertation advisor in the mid-90s (Shawn and I were doctoral students at the same time, though at UW [University of Washington] and UCLA, respectively). We read Tom’s “Stakeholder-Agency Theory” (coauthored with Charles Hill; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0007650312439451">Hill &amp; Jones, 1992</xref>), his “Instrumental Stakeholder Theory: A Synthesis of Ethics and Economics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0007650312439451">Jones, 1995</xref>), and his “Convergent Stakeholder Theory” (coauthored with Andy Wicks; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0007650312439451">Jones &amp; Wicks, 1999</xref>), and each of them helped—much by guiding our understanding of both the limitations and potential of stakeholder theory—to motivate Shawn’s and my first publication together (“Ethics and Incentives: An Evaluation and Development of Stakeholder Theory in the Health Care Industry,” coauthored with Andy Wicks—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0007650312439451">Elms, Berman, &amp; Wicks, 2002</xref>). At the same time, Shawn, Tom, Andy, and Suresh Kotha were working on “Does Stakeholder Orientation Matter? The Relationship Between Stakeholder Management Models and Firm Financial Performance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650312439451">Berman, Wicks, Kotha, &amp; Jones, 1999</xref>), and I was impressed that UW faculty (Tom, Andy, and Suresh) were coauthoring with students (Shawn), as that sort of thing rarely happened at UCLA. But I feel like I really knew how deep Tom and Andy’s commitment to Shawn was when Shawn had his stroke in 2001. Tom and Andy were among the first in our community to know, and they also knew who all of Shawn’s closest friends in that community were—and wrote to us immediately. They were also among the first to get to Shawn (Rob Phillips, who was living in California, was already there). The rest of us came too, and Tom and his wife, Judy, were in contact with us throughout Shawn’s recovery.</p>
<p>Tom’s commitment to Shawn and the rest of us has continued over the last 10 years. Even for a chapter published as recently as this year (“Bounding the World’s Miseries: Corporate Responsibility and Freeman’s Stakeholder Theory,” by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0007650312439451">Elms, Johnson-Cramer, &amp; Berman, 2011</xref>), Tom provided some of the most generous feedback we received while writing it (the chapter includes a specific response to one of his key questions.) We have continued to rely on his work—in particular the two AMRs above, but also more recently on his early “Corporate Control and the Limits to Managerial Power” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0007650312439451">Jones, 1985</xref>)—which, with its presentation of a “bounded autonomy model” of the large corporation, shaped our thinking (20 plus years later) about the relationship between managerial discretion and stakeholders (in “Strategy, Stakeholders, and Managerial Discretion,” by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0007650312439451">Phillips, Berman, Elms, &amp; Johnson-Cramer, 2010</xref>, and also “Stakeholder Orientation, Managerial Discretion, and Nexus Rents,” by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0007650312439451">Philips et al., 2011</xref>). His “Ethical Theory and Stakeholder-Related Decisions: The Role of Stakeholder Culture” (coauthored with Will Felps and G. Bigley, demonstrating his continued commitment to doctoral students; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0007650312439451">Jones, Felps, &amp; Bigley, 2007</xref>) additionally contributed to our understanding of stakeholder orientation. Clearly, then, Tom’s thinking has contributed deeply and broadly to our work—and I know as well to the work of many others, who like us, were lucky enough to have Tom sharing it and his support.</p>

<speaker>Tara Ceranic:</speaker>
<p>I officially met Tom Jones (not to be confused with the singing, aging, Welsh heartthrob) at my first IABS conference in 2002 in Victoria, BC. I was interested in the PhD program at the University of Washington and had yet to apply, but was presenting a discussion session. The night before I presented Tom told me that he was coming to my session and I panicked. I woke up a 5 a.m. to practice. I feared that he would think I was not cut out for a doctoral program, that I had no idea what I was talking about, and that I would never get into UW. However, to my delight, Tom was supportive, not at all scary, offered me fantastic suggestions, and made my first conference presentation something I will always look back on fondly. Luckily, I did get into the program and that conference interaction with Tom was not a fluke. Throughout my time at UW Tom was a huge support in my research, serving as a cochair on my dissertation and helping me navigate the doctoral program.</p>
<p>Tom could always be counted on to lighten the mood with his (oh so dry) humor. The first quarter I was his research assistant I asked him what he wanted me to work on and, with absolute sincerity he said, “my office could use recarpeting.” That’s what makes Tom so fantastic. He is a brilliant researcher <italic>and</italic> he is a funny guy. He understands how to craft an article that will be cited by everyone under the sun, yet he also knows when to not take things too seriously, and I think that is one of the most important things I learned from working with him. You don’t get much more famous in an area than Tom is in Business &amp; Society, but you would never know that from talking to him. He was always willing to work with students and gave amazing feedback on course papers no matter how horrible or amateurish they were.</p>
<p>To this day whenever I am writing a paper I think back to something Tom said during our first conversation. I was lamenting the amount of information out there and he told me that sometimes when you are researching a topic you have to just stop looking for more and <italic>finish</italic>. It seems so simple, but if anyone knows how much is out there, it’s Tom, and clearly he knows how to get things done. This straightforward and sage advice has served me well and is a testament to Tom because, without that approach, he wouldn’t be the prolific scholar or straight-shooting guy that he is. I am very lucky to have had Tom on my committee and in my corner and probably would have recarpeted his office if that was what he really wanted.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Michael Johnson-Cramer:</speaker>
<p>One article that hasn’t been mentioned much here is Tom’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0007650312439451">Jones, 1995</xref>) article on instrumental stakeholder theory. It probably didn’t come up because, for folks interested in stakeholders, it’s taken for granted that this article was influential. Aside from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0007650312439451">Freeman (1984)</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0007650312439451">Donaldson and Preston (1995)</xref>, there aren’t many more important or more cited. In fact—and here, I am sure those guys would agree—if you’re trying to do stakeholder research from the social science perspective, Tom’s article is the starting point.</p>
<p>But my admiration extends beyond the content. Academic writing has never come easy for me. I get wrapped up in ideas and have a hard time setting things down coherently (much less editing them). When I was a doctoral student, I used to sit with a photocopy of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0007650312439451">Jones (1995)</xref> on my desk. To me, it is one of the most elegantly written pieces in our field. Structurally, each section advances us one step closer to the thesis. Concepts are used in very precise ways. The propositions are real-world predictions about what we would expect to find if the theory held true. In short, the article works.</p>
<p>I remember sitting there, as a doctoral student, imagining how my own theory might develop with such a clear sense of structure and order. When I got stuck writing, I would reread a paragraph or a section, reverse engineer it, think about what he was trying to do. It made a huge difference—not that my own writing imitated Tom’s but that the idea of such clarity and elegance inspired me to try to do likewise. Many years later, when I learned that Tom was an engineer by training, it began to make sense why and how he writes like this. I’m glad he does.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I had the opportunity to interview Tom as part of the SIM Doctoral Consortium. He might not remember, but we had an hour-long conversation in advance of that session; I got to spend an hour on the phone with Tom Jones, discussing the history of the field, the research process, the major works in stakeholder theory, everything. I don’t know what the students got out of the interview session that followed—I’m never really sure, honestly—but for me, it was a milestone in my ongoing education. Thanks, Tom, for so many of those milestones.</p>

<speaker>Edwin Epstein:</speaker>
<p>Let me reflect on Tom Jones the person I know and for whom I have greatest respect and affection. From the time he was a graduate student at Berkeley in the then Political, Social, and Legal Environment of Business (now Business and Public Policy) in the early- and mid-1970s, Tom was always his own man intellectually. He was never reluctant to challenge his teachers, peers, and the received wisdom of the times as reflected in the scant literature of the period. He was always probing, pushing the concepts of the day as our frameworks about CSR and the complex interactions between business organizations and other societal entities continued (fortunately) to evolve.</p>
<p>He held no brief for shoddy thinking no matter how esteemed the source and to this day, although considerably mellowed from his Berkeley sojourn, suffers fools (as he perceives them) poorly. Tom is never mean spirited—he is really a softy once you strip away a sometime-crusty veneer—and takes great pleasure in helping colleagues, particularly students and young faculty, who come into his sphere of influence. He has been a creative, productive, and influential scholar, particularly in the areas of stakeholder theory, corporate governance, and business ethics. All the while, he has contributed to the field generically known as Business Society as an editor; a leader in SIM and IABS, and a moral force.</p>
<p>Tom is on the top of my list of individuals possessing impeccable personal and intellectual integrity. He is quite modest and doesn’t toot his own horn. I suspect that admirable characteristic, has at times, prevented him from receiving all the honors and accolades he deserves. Suffice it to say of former students and current colleagues I have had in my nearly fifty-year academic career, Tom is one of very few who I hold in highest regard and affection.</p>
<p>Two other thoughts about Tom. Among his favorite and most relaxed moments are when he and Judy (his delightful wife) are in a sailboat along the Washington coast or on a Michigan lake where he was raised. Also, he and Judy are a truly devoted couple who have been supportive of each other in both good and difficult moments. My wife Sandra and I really enjoy being with them on those all too infrequent occasions when we come together.</p>
</speech>

<speaker>Will Felps:</speaker>
<p>Tom seduced me into a love of ethics. Or more accurately, Tom gave me permission to be normative. Here’s how that happened. Every other year, Tom teaches a survey course for doctoral students on business ethics, called something like MGMT 594. I took this required course.</p>
<p>594 was discussion based and wasn’t too ideologically loaded. Instead, it was a systematic analysis of the role of regulation and ethics in the creation of value. Libertarians and liberals alike dug into the mechanisms whereby classic moral norms facilitate (and occasionally impede) value creation. If Tom had preached at us that management science is broken if it doesn’t incorporate the normative dimension, I would have been turned off. Instead, he just created the environment where a person could come to their own conclusions. Since 594, we’ve worked together on four theoretical papers, three of which are still working papers. Tom is a great coauthor, mixing logic, insight, bravery, and a great sense of humor.</p>
<p>This brings us to the content of Tom’s work. The thing that stands out is its absurd coherence. If you read every article he has written, they all fit together! Specifically, Tom’s articles represent one of the best available answers to the question: Why be moral in business?</p>
<p>Some of his answers are based on moral sentiments, for example, moral intensity and salience. Others are based on the logical limitations of managerial egoism, agency theory, and market mechanisms for ensuring desirable outcomes. Still others are based on strategic advantages that come with having a reputation for being other regarding. These are different reasons why people in organizations should be good, that is, why we should be honest, fair, compassionate, and honor our commitments. While Tom’s reasoning is sophisticated, I believe that his articles lead inexorably to a very simple idea: Be moral! More than anyone else, his work reminds me of Peter Singer’s, that persistent and thoughtful advocate for improving the welfare of people and animals. Tom’s work, like Singer’s, gently takes you by the hand and leads you to believe that you could and should be a better person.</p>
<p>Tom gives you permission to be normative.</p>
