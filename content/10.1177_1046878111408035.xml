<abstract>
<p>This study examines computerized simulations of employee impressions of a manager in specific manager-employee interactions. Prior research has shown that employee impressions play a significant role in work outcomes including job performance, job performance appraisals, acceptance of change, and relationship quality to mention a few. This project examines the validity of affect control theory through application of software INTERACT, the tool that operationalizes theory principles to predict impressions and other social interaction outcomes. The key ingredients to the theory are fundamental sentiments, quantified in EPA (evaluation, potency, activity) profile dimensions on semantic differential scales ranging from −4.3 to +4.3. The theory holds that people intuitively rely on sentiments that prevail among a cultural group and extend across time. It is proposed that these sentiments maintain meaning and order in the lives of employees at work and for people in general in social life. The research compares computer-simulated predictions with experimental results for comparable manager-employee interactions. The hypothesis is supported with highly significant results.</p>

<p>In work situations managers and employees often intuitively behave so as to create specific appearances as part of self-presentation, also known as “face-saving” behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1046878111408035">Earley, 1997</xref>). A manager may wish to be viewed as competent or kind or tough in an effort to motivate high levels of employee job performance. Employees may seek to impress a supervisor to influence the outcome of his or her job performance rating. Researchers have defined impression management as behaviors to protect self-image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1046878111408035">Schlenker, 1980</xref>) and behaviors that alter or maintain a person’s image in the eyes of another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1046878111408035">Villanova &amp; Bernardin, 1989</xref>). Studies show that various dimensions of this phenomenon include motives of impression management, strategies, and behavior tactics to achieve certain appearances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1046878111408035">Bolino, Kaemar, Turnley, &amp; Gilstrap, 2008</xref>) and outcomes from impression management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1046878111408035">Wayne &amp; Liden, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Definitions of motives for impression management include the desire to enhance self-esteem, to assert power, and to convey an image of professionalism or conformity to organizational values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1046878111408035">Bolino, et al., 2008</xref>). Motives generalize to efforts to minimize or maximize a good or a bad image. Strategies frequently examined by researchers consist of five categories: self-promotion (emphasize achievement), ingratiation (flatter targets), exemplification (display dedication through extra effort), intimidation (display power with potential for harm), and supplication (show limitations to suggest deprivation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1046878111408035">Jones &amp; Pittman, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>Related to impression management behaviors, a manager’s tactics may be successful or fail to increase employee commitment to job tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1046878111408035">Yukl &amp; Trcey, 1992</xref>). Unsuccessful tactics were classed as “hard sell” in contrast to more successful “soft sell” approaches. For example, research shows that applying pressure through demands, threats, and intimidation has not been successful. Attempts to persuade by showing strong support from others in a “coalition” also failed as a tactic. Also, attempts to establish the legitimacy of a decision and to assert the manager’s authority to make the decision generally are not successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1046878111408035">Yukl &amp; Tracey, 1992</xref>). Successful tactics included rational persuasion through logical arguments and facts and inspiring by enthusiastically connecting business goals to employee values. Also, consultation behaviors, seeking employee input to a plan or goal, have been successful.</p>
<p>Many outcomes of impression management have been examined. They include impressions of job performance ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1046878111408035">Wayne &amp; Liden, 1995</xref>), influence on employee resistance to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1046878111408035">Furst &amp; Cable, 2008</xref>), and the effect on supervisor-subordinate relationship quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1046878111408035">Wayne &amp; Ferris, 1990</xref>). Outcomes of impressions formed in job interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1046878111408035">Baron, 1986</xref>) and emotion labor in service jobs are also topics in this line of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1046878111408035">Ashforth &amp; Humphrey, 1993</xref>). These dimensions are shown in the process flowchart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1046878111408035">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>In considering the impression management process resulting from manager behaviors, a missing element emerges: the likely impressions formed by a target employee. Given specific manager behavior, is it possible for that manager to anticipate likely employee impressions resulting from this behavior? In work settings, this question can be critical to the success of the manager and the organization. This research considers the affective meanings of interactions between a manager and an employee. If managers understand likely impressions that employees will form following specific manager behavior, managers could adjust their behavior to realize higher probabilities of motivating employees to contribute to organizational success.</p>
<p>To understand likely impressions following manager-employee interactions requires information on affective meanings. For example, behaviors of persons in organizations carry connotative, or affective, meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1046878111408035">Baron, 1993</xref>). For example, the term “conflict” often carries an implied meaning of anger and the term “consultation” often suggests respect. Affect control theory (ACT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1046878111408035">Heise, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1046878111408035">2007</xref>) focuses on affect and defines it as a concept consisting of emotions, sentiments, impressions, and motivations. Researchers have shown affect and cognition to be two parts of a single concept, sentiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1046878111408035">Osgood, May, &amp; Miron, 1975</xref>). Within ACT, <italic>fundamental sentiments</italic> are a cornerstone of the theory and represent shared meanings within a culture across time.</p>
<p>ACT contrasts affect with cognition: Affect represents a general feeling and cognition is associated with specific thoughts. Information processing is simplified when based on affective feelings and complex when based on cognition. ACT has used affective meanings to derive general principles of information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1046878111408035">Heise, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1046878111408035">Smith-Lovin, 1987</xref>). Impression formation equations have been empirically developed to predict outcomes of social interactions including likely impressions created. Software INTERACT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1046878111408035">Heise, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1046878111408035">2003</xref>) represents the operationalization of theory principles and serves as a tool to conduct simulations and support understanding of social interactions.</p>
<p>A few studies have investigated ACT in work settings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1046878111408035">Schneider, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1046878111408035">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1046878111408035">Schröeder &amp; Scholl, 2009</xref>). Consistent with ACT principles on the affective underpinnings of behavior, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1046878111408035">Schröder and Scholl (2009)</xref> demonstrated that leader behavior, in part, is motivated by efforts to confirm the <italic>fundamental sentiments</italic> of social roles. Through behavior intentions, participants in the experiment confirmed <italic>fundamental sentiments</italic> of the two concepts, “a leader” and “an employee.”</p>
<p>The objective of the present research is to predict employee impressions of managers in a variety of manager-employee interactions. For example, when leaders prepare mission statements to motivate employees to achieve organizational success, what are employee impressions of the leader? Critical to this impression are employee sentiments of the leader and of the leader’s behavior. Do they see the leader as a wise and honorable individual to follow or as a tyrant motivated by self-interest? This research proposes that <italic>fundamental sentiments</italic> influence employee impressions of a manager.</p>

<title>Impressions and ACT</title>
<p>ACT proposes a consistency model that emphasizes shared understanding of the meanings of concepts within cultural contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1046878111408035">Heise, 2010</xref>). Fundamental affective meaning represents a core underlying aspect of the theory and is defined as “persistent, culturally-grounded affective meaning of an entity that serves as a reference for individual experience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1046878111408035">Heise, 2002</xref> p. 14). <italic>Transient impressions</italic> comprise a core outcome measure and are defined as “momentary affective meanings resulting from events” in social settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1046878111408035">Heise, 2002</xref>). The theory proposes that an intuitive mental comparison process represents the behavior <italic>control</italic> aspect within ACT. Transient feelings from an interaction are intuitively and rapidly compared with fundamental meanings of the respective concepts.</p>
<p>Following are examples of the role of fundamental meaning. The concept “a mother” is evaluated to be “good” in cultures around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1046878111408035">Osgood, May, &amp; Miron, 1975</xref>). Likely behavior for an interaction between “a mother” and “a child” is for the mother “to protect” the child. “Protecting behavior” confirms the fundamental meaning of the concept “a mother” and the <italic>transient impression</italic> created from such behavior maintains the fundamental meaning of “a mother.” This demonstrates the affect control principle: “people tend to seek events that confirm <italic>fundamental sentiments”</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1046878111408035">Heise, 2002</xref>). That is, people tend to intuitively behave in a manner to align transient feelings with fundamental meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1046878111408035">MacKinnon, 1994</xref>). In terms of mothers and children, ACT predicts “a mother” is likely to behave in favorable ways to “a child” to maintain her image as a “good” identity. An interaction such as “the mother hurts the child” is inconsistent with the fundamental meaning of “a mother” and creates an unfavorable impression of a mother. Such an interaction would register an intuitive sense of discrepancy between <italic>fundamental sentiments</italic> and the <italic>transient impressions</italic> of “a mother.” Subsequent spontaneous and favorable behavior by the mother (such as hugging the child and explaining disciplinary action) is necessary to correct the image left by an event harmful to a child. Alternatively, an observer could make a cognitive revision in response to the impression formed if corrective behavior by the “mother” actor does not occur. For example, a viewer could redefine “a mother” who harms a child indiscriminately as “a psychopath.”</p>
<p>ACT proposes a dynamic mental process characterized by people exerting effort to minimize differences between <italic>fundamental sentiments</italic> and <italic>transient impressions</italic>. Deflection is the concept within the theory defined as the quantitative difference between <italic>fundamental sentiments</italic> and <italic>transient impressions</italic>. This difference represents the sense of discrepancy that occurs when “a mother hurts the child.” Small deflections indicate consistency between sentiments and impressions and predict likely events (a mother cares for the child). Large deflections indicate inconsistency and predict unlikely events. Theory elements comprise a cybernetic control model (see detailed explanation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1046878111408035">Schneider &amp; Heise, 1995</xref>), that is, one involving behavior feedback loops. <italic>Fundamental sentiments</italic> serve as referent standards to compare with <italic>transient impressions</italic> formed as social interactions unfold. The impressions serve as perceptual signals to motivate spontaneous behavior to either maintain or restore consistency between fundamental meaning and impressions formed in social interactions.</p>
<p>In applying the model to the present research, a manager’s behavior serves as input to an employee’s mental comparison process. Employee sentiments of a manager and of manager behaviors serve as references. Spontaneous behavior is proposed to be an outcome of rapid and ongoing intuitive comparisons between sentiments and impressions as depicted in the control model. ACT research has shown support for theory hypotheses in general social settings and has received praise from sociologists. Researchers have referred to ACT as a methodologically sound and rigorous program of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1046878111408035">Fararo, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1046878111408035">Kemper, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Early research in sentiments as normative meanings predicted between 60% and 86% of impressions of “the man” in general social interactions with other specified identities and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1046878111408035">Gollob, 1968</xref>). The research used quantitative definitions of evaluation to measure normative (fundamental) meanings and short-term impressions. College students rated identity and behavior concepts on semantic differential scales with values from extremely bad (−4) to extremely good (+4). One group of students rated concepts such as “a man,” “to help,” and “a doctor.” The goal of these ratings was to capture fundamental meanings referred to as “out-of-context” meanings. A second group rated the same concepts within interactions as “in-context” meanings, such as “the man helps the doctor.” The in-context meanings were regressed on the out-of-context meanings resulting in impression formation equations. Thus, out-of-context meanings were proposed to predict meanings of identities and behaviors embedded within social interactions. An early formula was developed for in-context meanings of evaluation (good/bad) of an actor (A) in a social interaction. The in-context meaning was defined by “out-of-context” meanings shown below. Elements of the simple sentences were: actor (A), behavior (B), and object (O; target person of behavior) as follows: Ae’ = −.26 + .39Ae + .48Be + .25BeOe, where Ae’ represented the <italic>in-context</italic> impression of evaluation (“goodness”) of an actor; Ae represented <italic>out-of-context</italic> normative evaluation of an actor; Be represented <italic>out-of-context</italic> normative evaluation of a behavior; and Oe represented <italic>out-of-context</italic> normative evaluation of an object person.</p>
<p>ACT grew from these early studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1046878111408035">Heise, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1046878111408035">Heise &amp; Smith-Lovin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1046878111408035">Smith-Lovin, 1987</xref>). The <italic>out-of-context</italic> definitions were deemed as reasonably stable across time within a culture. Behavior patterns are expected to endure when consistency is maintained between <italic>fundamental sentiments</italic> and <italic>transient impressions</italic>. However, restorative behavior is also a cornerstone within ACT and as a response to “fix” inconsistencies (large deflections) between sentiments and impressions.</p>
<p>ACT developed expanded definitions of concept meanings beyond the <italic>evaluation</italic> dimension to include dimensions for <italic>potency</italic> and <italic>activity</italic>. A pan cultural study had shown that three dimensions (<italic>evaluation, potency</italic>, and <italic>activity</italic>) accounted for stable attitudes toward concepts in more than two dozen societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1046878111408035">Osgood, May, &amp; Miron, 1975</xref>). For example, in most cultures, researchers found the normative sentiments about the concept “a mother” were that the identity was quite good (evaluation, E), somewhat powerful (potency, P), and somewhat active (activity, A). The ACT model presents these three dimensions as the <italic>EPA profile</italic> of a concept in quantitative form. In the formula shown above, EPA profile dimensions are part of impression formation equations.</p>
<p>Research in various cultures (e.g. Canada, Japan, and the United States) has refined the impression formation equations in ACT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1046878111408035">Heise, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1046878111408035">MacKinnon, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1046878111408035">Smith-Lovin, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1046878111408035">Smith, Matsuno, &amp; Umino, 1994</xref>). Research shows that major features of equations are general across cultures, and <italic>fundamental sentiments</italic> (EPA profile format) have culture-specific and stable meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1046878111408035">Smith-Lovin, 1987</xref>). <italic>Fundamental sentiments</italic> have predicted a range of 56% to 85% of <italic>transient impressions</italic> in general social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1046878111408035">Smith-Lovin, 1987</xref>). Formulae predict impressions of the three interaction elements (actor, behavior, and object person) in terms of the EPA dimensions. Nine impression formation equations predict <italic>transient impressions</italic> of concepts referred to as: Ae’, Ap’, Aa’, Be’, Bp’, Ba’, Oe’, Op’, and Oa’. The prediction ingredients as components of <italic>fundamental sentiments</italic> are displayed below:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>EPA profile dimensions: Interaction elements and EPA profile dimensions</italic>:</p>
<p><bold>Evaluation</bold>: good, nice – bad, awful <bold>actor</bold> (Ae, Ap, Aa)</p>
<p><bold>Potency</bold>: big, powerful – little, powerless <bold>behavior</bold> (Be, Bp, Ba)</p>
<p><bold>Activity</bold>: fast, young, noisy – slow, old, quiet <bold>object</bold> (Oe, Op, Oa)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Refined formulae are more complex compared with earlier equations due, in part, to the added dimensions of <italic>potency</italic> and <italic>activity</italic>. For example, Ae’ is the predicted <italic>transient impression</italic> of an actor based on fundamental sentiments of a specific actor (Ae, Ap, and Aa), engaged in a specific behavior (Be, Bp, and Ba), directed to a specific object person (Oe, Op, and Oa). A formula developed for Ae’, the <italic>transient impression</italic> (<italic>in-context</italic> meaning) for actor evaluation follows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1046878111408035">Smith-Lovin, 1987</xref>):</p>

<title>Methods Overview</title>
<p>The current research consists of a 3 × 5 factorial design with three evaluation levels of <italic>fundamental sentiments</italic> of a manager and five manager behaviors. The three evaluation levels are based on evidence that actual management styles may vary from highly sensitive and intelligent to highly tyrannical and oppressive. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1046878111408035">Epitropaki and Martin (2004)</xref> demonstrated varying styles when they confirmed the factor structure of implicit leader theories. These theories are defined as employee assumptions about traits and abilities that characterize an ideal leader. They found a six-factor structure consisting of four prototypical factors for leadership (ideal leader traits) and two antiprototypical factors. The prototype factors were sensitivity, intelligence, dedication, and dynamism. Antiprototypes were tyranny and masculinity. Within the factor structure, tyranny was highly negatively correlated with sensitivity (<italic>r</italic> = .61, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Others have addressed consequences to employees of tyrannical manager styles. These include low self-esteem, low job performance, and alienation from work (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1046878111408035">Ashforth, 1994</xref>). Despite variations in actual styles, a recent measurement study rating concepts in ACT found the normative evaluation of “a manager” was “good” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1046878111408035">Heise &amp; Francis, 2004</xref>). This result was consistent with past measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1046878111408035">Smith-Lovin, 1987</xref>). This means the role of “a manager” is generally felt to be “good” in the United States, although manager styles vary in actual work settings. Employees within an organization in different business units represent subgroups and may form <italic>fundamental sentiments</italic> at variance with the larger society. Evidence of this phenomenon has been examined by ACT researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1046878111408035">Smith-Lovin &amp; Douglas, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>A pilot test of sentiments for the concept “a manager” among 60 university students showed that more than 77% evaluated “a manager” as “good” to some extent, consistent with results from the two measurement studies. To test the hypothesis, the pilot study confirmed the need to prime participants for subgroup sentiments of “a manager” at three levels of evaluation: “a good manager,” “a neutral manager,” and “a bad manager.”</p>
<p>The study design required testing a range of five manager behaviors. Research shows manager-employee interactions at work result in favorable and unfavorable experiences to employee self-presentation, referred to as “face” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1046878111408035">Redding and Ng, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1046878111408035">Bond &amp; Venus, 1981</xref>). This project relies on organizational face theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1046878111408035">Earley, 1997</xref>) to develop a logical framework of five manager behaviors toward an employee. Organizational face theory combines definitions of “face” from the ancient Chinese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1046878111408035">Hu, 1944</xref>) and from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1046878111408035">Goffman (1959)</xref> as the Western standard in “face” research. These two sources result in a two-dimensional definition of “face” (moral character and social status) each with two signs, favorable and unfavorable:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The evaluation (good or bad) of self based on internal and external judgments concerning a person’s adherence to moral rules of conduct [moral character] and position within a given social structure [social status] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1046878111408035">Earley, 1997</xref>, p. 43).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For this research, “neutral” is added to good and bad within the organizational face theory definition. The five levels of manager behaviors tested are: threatening and supportive behavior to employee “<italic>moral character</italic>” face, threatening and supportive behavior to employee <italic>social status</italic> face, and neutral manager behavior. This behavior framework facilitated the test of ACT’s ability to predict employee <italic>transient impressions</italic> of a manager.</p>
<p>Gender issues continue to prevail in management research, for example, on leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1046878111408035">Anderson, Lievens, van Dam, &amp; Born, 2006</xref>), on perceptions of female versus male managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1046878111408035">Goldbert &amp; Riordan, 2008</xref>), and on gender relative to power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1046878111408035">Molm, 1986</xref>). ACT research has shown variance between results for males and females for certain concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1046878111408035">Smith-Lovin, 1987</xref>). Thus, gender is an analysis variable in the present study.</p>

<title>Independent Variable: Three Employee Fundamental Sentiments of Manager</title>
<p>To develop contrasting sentiments of “a manager,” <italic>sentiment</italic> ratings of modifiers from a recent measurement study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1046878111408035">Heise &amp; Francis, 2004</xref>) were employed to distinguish the three levels of manager. EPA profile ratings for “a manager” by male raters (1.45, 1.39, and 1.93) and by female raters (1.48, 1.49, and 1.97) were used as the basis. Adjective modifiers in INTERACT differentiate elements in a simulated interaction. The modifier function in INTERACT allows combination of a modifier with an identity to adjust the meaning of an identity. For example, the EPA profiles for the two concepts “considerate” (2.95, 2.42, and .98) and “manager” (1.48, 1.39, and 1.93) based on male ratings were combined. The result was “a considerate manager”: (2.10, 2.22, and 1.86). The evaluation and potency values are higher and activity is similar to an unmodified “manager” (see the detailed tutorial for modifiers at the ACT website, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1046878111408035">Heise, 2003</xref>). The goal of modification was to develop successively lower evaluation (E) and potency (P) values to define manipulations for the “good,” “neutral,” and “bad” managers.</p>
<p>The modification function allows one adjective and identity combination at each step. Various modifiers within INTERACT were systematically tested. This resulted in definitions as follows: “a good manager” was “a considerate, competent, honest manager” with an EPA profile by male raters of 2.86, 2.46, and .83. The verbal translation is extremely good (2.86), quite powerful (2.46), and slightly active (.83). The same procedure was used to modify EPA profiles for “a neutral manager” and “a bad manager.” The result was a definition for a “neutral manager” as “a middle-aged, cooperative, and dependable manager” interpreted as follows: slightly good (1.06), quite powerful (1.63), and slightly active (1.25). Results for the “bad manager” were “a quarrelsome, unreliable, and unambitious manager” interpreted as quite bad (−1.50), slightly powerless (−1.00), and slightly inactive (−.65). The modified EPA profiles served as employee <italic>fundamental sentiments</italic> to conduct computer simulations. The same procedure was used to modify EPA profiles of “a manager” to conduct simulations based on female ratings.</p>

<sec id="section5-1046878111408035">
<title>Independent Variable: Five Manager Behaviors to Employee</title>
<p>The project involves two manager behaviors to target each face form applied to an employee and a fifth behavior to add neutral manager behavior. For a favorable outcome relative to a moral character face, we might use the scenario “the manager praises employee integrity.” However, INTERACT is based on simple sentences in ABO format (actor, behavior, and object) and thus, accepts three input terms, “manager,” “praise,” and “employee” to simulate this scenario. The five simulated manager (actor) behaviors to the employee were the following (parenthetical terms excluded in simulations): two behaviors to address moral character—to praise (e.g., integrity) and to accuse (e.g., of theft); two behaviors to address social status—to compliment (e.g., job performance) and to criticize (e.g., job performance); and a neutral behavior—to draw near (e.g., to observe software installation).</p>
<p>Simulation input factors consist of identity, behavior, and modifier language terms. Language terms and respective quantitative ratings are embedded within INTERACT. A translation feature in the software converts input language terms to quantitative meanings. The software calculates impressions via impression formation equations and translates quantitative results back to language terms for output reports (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1046878111408035">Heise, 1991</xref> for details).</p>
<p>A resource for simulations in the present study was a recent measurement study. A high percentage of participants in the experiment for the present study were drawn from students at the same large Midwestern university campus as the measurement study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1046878111408035">Heise and Francis, 2004</xref>). Most participants in the present study and the measurement study were enrolled in the same general management course. The measurement study was comprehensive in the number of concepts rated and included identities (e.g., “a manager” and “an employee”), behaviors (e.g., “to criticize” and “to compliment”), and modifiers (e.g. “considerate,” “average,” and “quarrelsome”). It was conducted 1 year prior to the present study. Results of the measurement study constitute an updated dictionary defined by EPA profiles. The semantic differential scales ranged from −4.3 for the negative anchors to +4.3 for the positive anchors. The scale for each dimension of the EPA profile was anchored by descriptive terms. Anchors for the evaluation dimension were “bad, awful” and “good, nice.” Anchors for the potency dimension were “powerless, little” and “powerful, big” whereas anchors for the activity dimension were “slow, quiet, inactive” and “fast, noisy, active.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1046878111408035">
<title>Computer Simulation Procedure</title>
<p>Several steps set up social interactions in INTERACT. For each scenario three entries were made: the actor (e.g. “a good manager”) in EPA profile format; a behavior (e.g., “to compliment”) and the object person (employee, EPA of 1.95, 1.83, and 1.94). After each scenario was entered, the software accessed <italic>fundamental sentiments</italic> for the verbal behavior terms in quantitative EPA profiles. Entering each simple sentence initiated calculations to make theory predictions. The software generated a report for each scenario, 15 predictions based on male ratings and 15 based on female ratings. Output reports displayed likely employee <italic>transient impressions</italic> of managers in each interaction.</p>

<title>Theory Predictions of Transient Impressions of a Manager</title>
<p>Output of employee impressions for the 30 simulations is displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1046878111408035">Table 1</xref>. For example, likely <italic>transient impressions</italic> of a “good manager accusing” the employee based on ratings by males, was an EPA profile translated as neutral for evaluation (.17), quite powerful (1.51), and slightly active (.88). This contrasts with the prediction for the “bad manager accusing” translated as slightly bad (−1.38), neutral in potency (−.42), and neutral in activity (−.14). The “good manager praising” was predicted to create an impression of extremely good (2.92), extremely powerful (2.55), and somewhat active (.79), and the “bad manager praising” is predicted to appear neutral for the three EPA dimensions.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Undergraduate business and psychology students at a large Midwestern U.S. university voluntarily participated in exchange for credit toward a course research requirement. The 409 participants included 237 men, 49% were 20 years old or less, and 49% were between 21 and 25. White Americans (85%) dominated the study. Minorities included Asian Americans, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans. Most students were employed part-time (61.6%).</p>

<sec id="section10-1046878111408035">
<title>Lab Procedure: Mock Work Setting</title>
<p>The study was presented as a project to support development of management training courses to improve interpersonal communications at work. Participants were motivated by the idea that their participation could contribute to improved communications between managers and employees at work. Participants responded to three paper-and-pencil surveys: a preexperiment survey, the experiment survey, and a postexperiment survey. The preexperiment surveys consisted of demographic information (age, gender, ethnic background, and employment status) and EPA profile ratings for “a manager.” Participants were then placed in a mock work setting by asking them to imagine that they were employees of a large bookseller.</p>
<sec id="section11-1046878111408035">
<title>Experiment role and tasks</title>
<p>The imagined role involved oversight of four book order process clerks. The participants were instructed to assume the role of Terry Norman, “a good and honest team leader.” The task was to read and respond to a packet of memos with background information on recent interactions located on the cover page. They were to process 10 interoffice memos received by “Terry Norman.” They were to answer questions on information they would likely share with imagined team members. A sample memo provided a practice task. Response options were below each memo and were replicated on the survey form for clarity. Memo packets were identical, except for independent variable manipulations. Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental cells. Stimuli were embedded in cover page information and in the memos. Participants processed memos privately at classroom desks. After the experiment survey, postexperiment surveys were completed and included manipulation checks and EPA ratings (evaluation, potency, and activity) of the imagined manager, “Pat O’Neil.” Time to complete the three surveys averaged about 50 minutes. The number of participants in each experimental condition ranged from 24 to 35. Manipulations checks indicated successful awareness and reasonableness of interactions.</p>

<title>Independent Variable: Three Employee Fundamental Sentiments of a Manager</title>
<p>The first independent variable was the three levels of <italic>fundamental sentiments</italic> employees held about the manager, “good,” “neutral,” and “bad.” One adjective that had been used in the computer simulations was used, along with an indication of high, average, or low “status and skills.” For example, the phrase “your considerate manager Pat, seen as having high status and skills” was used to represent a “good” manager. Stimuli appeared in items one and four of the cover page information. Detailed stimuli are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1046878111408035">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<title>Independent Variable: Five Manager Behaviors to Employee</title>
<p>Five manager behaviors toward the employee corresponded to the computer-simulated manager behaviors. For example, Pat’s threat to employee Terry’s “good and honest” character was operationalized by conveying Pat’s accusation that Terry had stolen book inventory. The stimuli appeared in Item 4 on the information cover page and in Memo 2. For example, unfavorable manager behavior about employee job performance was, “Your manager Pat criticized you for not finding invoice errors.” The five manager behaviors were tested in a pilot study with 60 students from the university. Results indicted significant differences between <italic>transient impressions</italic> of managers engaged in the five behaviors.</p>

However, the same pattern did not occur in the lab results. Most differences between the genders in the lab occurred in the “bad” manager scenarios with nine differences. Females rated the three EPA dimensions differently from males for the praise and accuse scenarios in the “bad” manager interactions and tended to give managers higher ratings in goodness, potency, and activity.</p>

<title>Compare Theory Predictions with Experiment Results</title>
<p>Four analysis variables were created, two for the male data and two for female data to test ACT’s ability to predict <italic>transient sentiments</italic> of the manager. The two variables consisted of values for the three EPA dimensions × 15 scenarios, first variable: 45 items for simulated predictions and second variable: 45 lab results corresponding to simulation results. Predicted <italic>transient impressions</italic> were compared based on male raters to the lab results for male participants. Variable 1 for male and female data consisted of predictions in the order shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1046878111408035">Table 1</xref>: first, 15 evaluation (E) values followed by 15 potency (P) values, and finally 15 activity (A) values. The first evaluation prediction for males was .17 for the “good” manager accuse scenario, the last evaluation prediction was for the “bad” manager praise scenario at −26. The first potency item for males (number 16 in the data set) was 1.51 for the “good” manager accuse scenario. The 45th item in the data set was for the “bad” manager activity dimension in the praise scenario at .15. The female data for predicted dimensions were constructed in the same manner as for males. Variable 2 for male data consisted of lab results for values corresponding to the simulation values in the order shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1046878111408035">Table 4</xref>: 15 evaluation (E) values, 15 potency values (P), and 15 activity (A) values. To test the hypothesis with male data, Variable 1 (INTERACT predictions) was compared with Variable 2 (lab results) with Pearson correlations and ordinary least square (OLS) regression analyses.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1046878111408035">Table 6</xref> displays the analysis results.

These results show that the predictive ability of ACT is noteworthy relative to impressions and support the study hypothesis. For lab male participants, predictions explained 64% of the variance in participants’ ratings of impressions of a manager in employee-manager interactions. For female data, the predictions explained less of the variance at 39%. However, the results are interesting given that simulations were based on simple sentences of actor, behavior, and object and lacked contextual details such as “theft of inventory” or “job performance” relative to accusations, criticisms, and compliments.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>These results provide clear evidence that computer-based simulations using INTERACT produce robust predictions of impressions of actors in social interactions. It could be highly useful both in work situations and in teaching business students about interactions at work. Given the important role of <italic>fundamental sentiments</italic> in impression formations, executives might conduct employee surveys to measure fundamental attitudes of supervisors and managers in organizations. For example, results indicate that impressions of supportive behavior by managers perceived to be “bad” were lowered by unfavorable sentiments. Such managers were met with some degree of indifference by male participants in the lab. Uncovering such fundamental sentiments might shed light on chronic job performance problems in work units.</p>
<p>The results show theory predictions may be applied to work setting situations with confidence for a variety of purposes. They could be used to train managers about employee intuitive feelings, to guide them in interactions with employees, and to support them in cultivating high-quality relationships with employees. Advanced understanding of employee likely impressions in situations could be helpful to predict acceptance of changes to work practices, to set work goals, to receive job performance appraisal results, and to request input for work unit problems. Testing alternative ways to communicate changes to employees could identify messages with the strongest likelihood of acceptance. Predictions could apply to other hierarchical levels, such as interactions between coworkers and among higher level managers. These results have implications for practicing managers and business students. The findings highlight the effects of varying employee sentiments of managers and varying manager behavior to employees. In addition, differences between the genders are highlighted. Impressions formed by women are more difficult for the theory to predict. Female raters tended to rate managers more favorably at times compared with males in comparable scenarios. Females might have greater respect for the job title than males. Future research could explore this topic and investigate impression formation among roles in various managerial levels.</p>
<p>This study had several limitations. Participant responses may not have represented the results of actual manager-employee interactions at work. However, the simulated work memos and the employee identity were developed to mimic a job situation that could occur for undergraduate juniors and seniors. A second limitation was the operationalization of a manager’s face behavior to employees for the five behavior scenarios. For example, social status was operationalized on a narrow definition associated with job competence. This may be inappropriately narrow, missing the broader explanatory power of social status. Despite these limitations, the study demonstrated the predictive ability of the theory using software INTERACT.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1046878111408035">Rothlisberger and Dickson (1939)</xref> provided a precursor for ACT principles in the notion of “the logic of sentiments.” It was defined as a component of the informal organization and “the values residing in the interhuman relations of the different groups within a plant” (p. 567) and was contrasted to the “logic of efficiency,” a component of the formal organization. ACT expands on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1046878111408035">Goffman’s (1959)</xref> work in that the expressive order is related “to more than face or situational identity . . . an individual behaves not just to maintain the meaning of self, but to maintain understandings generally.” This is demonstrated as follows: “Humans are meaning maintainers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1046878111408035">Heise, 2002</xref>, p. 16). Thus, we can see that <italic>fundamental sentiments</italic> of identities, such as a manager, and of behaviors, such as accusing versus complementing are strong factors in impression formation. These sentiments are intuitive aspects of the manager-employee relationship and serve to maintain values and meaning in employees’ work lives.</p>
