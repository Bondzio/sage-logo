<p>The title of this book is ambiguous—deliberately so, I believe. “Changing inequality” could be declarative, with the author describing how and why it is changing. Or “changing inequality” could be imperative, a call to arms—inequality is too great, and let’s do something about it. Although it is clear that Rebecca Blank would like to see the reduction of inequality in America, the book is primarily an account of the rise in income inequality in this country since 1979. Only in the final chapter does she address the issue of how to reverse the trend. Her pessimistic (but likely correct) conclusion is that a significant reduction in U.S. income inequality is not on the horizon. Even substantial changes in economic behavior, she concludes, would narrow income inequality only a little.</p>
<p><italic>Changing Inequality</italic> is a meaty book written in clear language by an academic (former Dean of the Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan) who is currently Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Her objective is to investigate how the distribution of income among nonelderly Americans has been affected by changes in labor force behavior (e.g., who works, and how much), family structure, hourly wages, and unearned income. Based on her analysis of 1979–2007 pretax income data from the Current Population Surveys, Blank concludes that this recent period of U.S. history has been characterized by rising income inequality amidst rising incomes.</p>
<p>Some sociologists may be surprised by the finding that incomes have grown since 1979. While it is well-known that incomes have risen rapidly for those at the top, the CPS data also show that incomes have increased for the majority of other Americans as well. Blank’s analysis of these data shows that, in constant dollars, there are in fact far fewer Americans in the lower income categories in 2007 than there were in 1979 (the only exception being the lowest category of $5,000 or less). Adjusted for family size, the annual income for the median person in the CPS data increased by more than $7,000 from 1979 to 2007. As Blank notes, this growth in income per person may explain the relatively muted public response to rising inequality, as the growth in inequality occurred around a rising median.</p>
<p>The growth in median income was caused entirely by growth in annual earnings. Annual earnings grew because more family members worked, not because of rising hourly wages (indeed, hourly wages barely increased for men). Women in particular increased their labor force participation over this period, and that increase accounts for most of the income growth for Americans since 1979.</p>
<p>The growth in <italic>income inequality</italic> was caused primarily by growth in earnings inequality (about 74 percent, according to Blank’s simulations) and secondarily by changes in family composition and size (about 15 percent). The latter contributed to the growth in income inequality over this period because of a shift toward smaller families and away from married-couple families. The larger component of the growth in income inequality—growth in earnings inequality—has generated a large and technical literature in economics that Blank does not attempt to engage in detail. Instead of using complex regression models to tease out causal effects, she relies heavily on graphs and on simulations that a wider readership can follow. Her major contribution to the model-based literature on the growth in U.S. income inequality is to demonstrate, through simulations, the most likely demographic and income sources of the growth. Her analysis suggests, for example, that the rise in the labor force participation of women, particularly among women married to higher-income men, has contributed to the rise in earnings inequality.</p>
<p>The findings in <italic>Changing Inequality</italic> will challenge many of the preconceptions of economists and sociologists alike. For example, to determine the degree of income inequality that would obtain in a povertyless America, Blank calculates the Gini coefficient for family income assuming that all poor families were brought up to the official poverty line. The results are startling: the Gini declines only from .43 to .41, suggesting that the high level of income inequality in the United States is not attributable to the presence of poor Americans (as based on the official poverty line). Even if poverty were eliminated in today’s America, income inequality would still greatly exceed its level from just three decades ago.</p>
<p>This is social science at its best—timely, clear-eyed, straightforward, and provocative. I consider a good academic book to be one that adds to my understanding. An excellent book adds something to my understanding that challenges me to rethink or reconceptualize an issue. (A bad book neither adds nor challenges.) By these criteria, this is an excellent book.</p>
