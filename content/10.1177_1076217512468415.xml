<p>At a recent Board meeting of the National Association for Gifted Children (NAGC), the president, Paula Olszewski-Kubilius, gathered information from Board members and invited guests to identify national priorities for the organization. During the brainstorming and discussion sessions, I was struck by the similarities that we face in gifted education when trying to provide services to gifted and talented students. I thought I would share five of these challenges in this column with some possible solutions in the next <italic>Gifted Child Today</italic> (GCT) issue.</p>
<sec id="section1-1076217512468415">
<title>Challenge 1: Assessment and Accountability</title>
<p>Assessment and accountability was identified as one of the top challenges facing gifted education. Assessments are currently being developed to measure the national common core state standards in math and language arts. Ultimately, these new assessments will be used in state accountability systems to determine the effectiveness of teachers, schools, school districts, and states. Although new assessments are supposed to measure higher level thinking skills, for the most part, the content is still organized by grade level. The effect of this tracked system is the design of curriculum geared to on-level performance. The pressure on teachers to stay “on track” or “in their lane” is intense—particularly when their jobs are based on the performance of their students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1076217512468415">
<title>Challenge 2: Administrator Support</title>
<p>Administrators are focused on accountability as well so their attention is directed primarily toward those students who are not performing on grade level. Advanced students are not a priority. In fact, 32% of teachers say that advanced students are a low priority in their schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217512468415">Farkas &amp; Duffett, 2008</xref>). Observations and brief “walk throughs” do not include indicators from gifted education. For the most part, they are concerned with basic uniformly delivered instruction that is aligned to the school district’s common curriculum and benchmark testing. They want their schools to make progress according to the state accountability systems, which often do not include gifted students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1076217512468415">
<title>Challenge 3: Collaboration With Other Educators</title>
<p>As Dr. Olszewski-Kubilius mentioned in her address at the 2011 NAGC convention, gifted educators are frequently not at the table when decisions are being made that affect gifted and talented students. This omission is at all levels of education—national, state, local—and within all contexts—agencies, schools, universities. Effects are deleterious to services. Gifted students are not considered when federal and state rules and regulations, teacher and curriculum standards, assessments, and programs are being designed. Other educators do not even appear to be aware of the rich history of gifted education that includes innovation and creativity—part of the 21st-century skills.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1076217512468415">
<title>Challenge 4: Professional Development</title>
<p>Given the lack of understanding of gifted education, professional development is key. However, as reported by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217512468415">NAGC and the National Council of Directors of Programs for the Gifted (2009)</xref>, 65% of teachers reported that teacher preparation programs did not equip them to teach academically advanced students, 58% of teachers had had no professional development over the past few years that focused on teaching academically advanced students, and only five states require all teachers to receive preservice training in gifted and talented education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1076217512468415">
<title>Challenge 5: Family and Parent Education</title>
<p>Families and parents are paramount in supporting their children and in influencing educational systems. Yet, families, particularly those from low-income backgrounds, are not informed about the importance of gifted education and developing talents. Although school districts have workshops for parents, these frequently do not encourage the family’s active involvement in their child’s program nor do they teach them the important skills of advocacy.</p>
<p>These five challenges were among a variety of other themes that the NAGC Board identified as educational trends and issues. I would like to hear from you regarding these challenges and ways to solve them. I’ll revisit them in the next issue and offer some ways that educators are addressing these challenges and some possible solutions.</p>
