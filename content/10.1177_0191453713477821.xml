Not all revolutionary states in the aftermath of 1848, however, realized their democratic aspirations, for the forces that ignite revolution may not lead to the consolidation of a stable post-revolutionary state, let alone to a successful democratic transition. The path toward democratization after 1848 was a very long process, proceeding with little or no intervention from foreign powers. By contrast, democratization after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 was relatively fast and smooth, benefiting from the stewardship of the European Union. These historical precedents offer lessons that can add to our understanding of the Arab uprisings and their aftermaths, and may offer guidance that can strengthen prospects for successful transitions to democracy.</p><p>Mindful of these past revolutionary contagions, this article addresses the following questions. What accounts for the different paths taken by Arab countries that have experienced uprisings? What are the conditions necessary for the consolidation of post-revolutionary order? Will the revolutionary states of the Middle East and Africa (MENA) usher in a new era of democracy or will they witness the return of Bonapartism in the guise of Islam or military dictatorships? What is the role of external forces (as they interact with internal actors) in the Arab democratization process? To help answer these questions, it is helpful to distinguish three revolutionary stages: the stage that culminates in the toppling of the old regime; the consolidation stage in which a hegemonic group sustains its political legitimacy amid transition; and the democratization stage which sees the gradual entrenchment of a separation of powers, the rule of law and the enforcement of human rights.</p><p>Following an analysis of each of these stages, this article defends three basic premises. First, the same conditions and forces favorable to revolution may serve to impede efforts at post-revolutionary consolidation. Second, one can assess prospects for consolidation based on the capacity of prospective hegemonic parties to achieve several interrelated objectives: developing a shared worldview among disparate segments of the population, delivering social and economic goods, and establishing order. Third, while democratization is a home-grown process, it may require particular forms of limited intervention to offset anti-democratic forces. The goal of this article is to provide an analytical framework that informs the ongoing debates over democratic transitions while suggesting where and how external engagement may influence the transition process.</p><sec id="section1-0191453713477821"><title>I Pre-revolutionary stage: What accounts for the different paths taken by different countries after the Arab Spring?</title><p>Despite similar conditions leading to popular uprisings (with notable factors including economic crisis, high youth unemployment, social distress, the absence of meaningful political reforms, the weakening of state institutions, division or disloyalty within the military, a capacity for social mobilization, and great powers’ disengagement from or support for the rebellion), the paths undertaken by these revolutionary societies were different. Some uprisings rapidly toppled dictatorial regimes, while others faced more protracted resistance.</p><p>From a Gramscian perspective, the more cohesive and integrated the civil society, and the more fragile or delegitimized the state, the greater the likelihood of revolutionary success (at least during the first stage of the revolution). Under those circumstances, a revolutionary movement can appear to emerge with remarkable speed to overthrow a long-standing regime, quickly build a post-revolution consensus and emerge as a hegemonic force. Yet if civil society’s cohesion enables the fast toppling of a regime in the early stage, factors leading to consolidation differ.</p><p>The success of a post-revolutionary stage (consolidation) can be associated with two basic categories. One pertains to homogeneity or diversity (in terms, for example, of national identity, tribe, or religious sect) across particular historical and geographical circumstances. Homogeneity facilitates, and diversity impedes, efforts by revolutionary movements to create a unifying collective ideology. Moreover, when a regime in a divided society represents one particular tribe or sect, as, for example, in Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and the Assads’ Syria, revolution can also be impeded by the concentration of coercive power in the hands of a favored group. The other category consists of the capacity of such movements to draw on civil society’s human and economic capital: i.e. the level of education and job skills, together with the country’s capacity for sustained economic growth and economic equity. In considering the status of revolutionary societies in terms of those categories, it becomes apparent why conditions that may favor the outbreak of revolution and its initial success may work against a post-revolutionary consolidation of power.</p><p>To consider how particular conditions have different consequences across the stages of a revolution, the following briefly considers three different types of Arab regimes: homogeneous initiators (the states that trigger revolutionary contagions), divided authoritarian states (those that follow the initiators and that experience prolonged violence), and divided wealthy monarchical regimes (which may be able to avoid, or at least forestall, revolution).</p><sec id="section2-0191453713477821"><title>Type 1: Homogeneous initiators</title><p>The initiating countries of a revolutionary contagion are likely to be those where the state is weakening, civil society is still frail but stirring, and the population is ethnically or religiously homogeneous. Such were the conditions of France in 1848, of Russia in 1917, and of the MENA’s revolutionary pioneers, Tunisia and Egypt, in the Arab Spring. In all of these cases, the homogeneity of those opposed to the regime enabled them to articulate a collective worldview that could be widely embraced by the population. Thus, the relative homogeneity of Egypt and Tunisia helped enable the unified mass mobilization against the fragile regimes of Ben Ali and Mubarak. In these cases, the state became a shell, allowing what Gramsci called ‘a war of movement’ (a fast and sweeping toppling of the authoritarian elite). Yet consolidation has not come as easily, since these countries lack either the human or economic capital to implement effective transitions to consolidation.</p><p>As they have moved to the consolidation stage, however, there are evident differences between the two cases. On one hand, in Tunisia, human capital is more developed than in Egypt, offering greater opportunities for post-revolutionary economic growth and, in that dimension at least, a better prospect for consolidating the revolution. On the other hand, because the military apparatus was far more developed and organized in Egypt than in Tunisia, the Egyptian hegemonic movement – so long as it is supported by the military – may be better able to withstand post-revolutionary challenges. In short, while similar conditions led to popular readiness to revolt and to the rapid collapse of the dictatorial regimes, the consolidation stage brings different concerns to the fore, leading to different strategies, and potentially different prospects, for revolutionary consolidation.</p></sec><sec id="section3-0191453713477821"><title>Type 2: Divided authoritarian states</title><p>Divided authoritarian states (such as Libya, Syria and Yemen) were slower to launch their uprisings, and they encountered greater resistance. The uprising in Libya lasted 8 months, and the battle could have been lost without the intervention of NATO. There were 11 months of fierce protests in Yemen leading to the transfer of power from President Saleh – a process that was accelerated due to the pressure applied by the Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC). At the time of writing, the Syrian uprising is in its 20th month, undermining long-term prospects for post-revolutionary consolidation.</p><p>These civil societies are fragmented along sectarian or tribal lines, which often overlap with economic divides. Prolongation of revolutionary uprisings may cause them to degenerate further into sectarian power struggles or movements driven by ethnic or religious minorities. Iraq (following the US-led invasion), Yemen and Syria show trends toward these tragic paths. Those divisions impede efforts to develop the kind of cohesive post-revolutionary worldview that can secure the consolidation phase.</p><p>Economic advantages, however, offer these transitional states greater potential to succeed. While Syria benefits from comparatively higher human capital than Libya, Libya’s overall wealth, generated by its oil-based economy, may provide it with a greater advantage at the consolidation stage. Moreover, Syria’s pre-revolutionary advantages (more highly developed state institutions and late but steady economic development) have been radically altered by the length and severity of the internal conflict – which has exacerbated societal divisions to the point where one can envision the collapse of the state.</p><p>It should be added that deeply divided countries such as Mauritania, Sudan, Lebanon and Algeria did not join the revolutionary contagion at all, in part because of their long histories of civil war. Lingering memories of those conflicts, and corresponding fears of their resumption, may afford some protection even to very weak ruling regimes. On the other hand, conflict-induced lethargy may well prove to be temporary, and such states may yet become the late bloomers of the Arab revolutionary contagion.</p></sec><sec id="section4-0191453713477821"><title>Type 3: Divided wealthy monarchical regimes</title><p>Since wealthy Gulf countries remain somewhat divided by disparate tribal loyalties, one may wonder if there will be uprisings in these societies. Civil society hardly exists in these states, as old tribal loyalties combine with monarchical control over politics and large segments of the economy. While the Arab hereditary monarchies have proven more stable than regimes basing their legitimacy on ideology (e.g. Pan-Arab nationalism, socialism, etc.), they are not necessarily immune from regime change. Most of the Gulf monarchical regimes have low human capital (and an unevenly educated citizenry) along with vast economic resources. There is less likelihood of sustained upheavals in this category of states, as paternalist financial arrangements enable leaders to appease or coopt challengers (as has occurred in most Gulf Cooperation Countries). In the long run, however, these states have an opportunity to apply oil revenues toward strengthening human capital (through education, adoption of innovative technologies, etc.), while designing reforms to implement a gradual top-down transformation.</p><p>To draw again on historical analogies, these countries can be compared with 19th-century Britain, when the British elite warded off revolutionary contagion from the continent in 1848 by gradually adopting democratic reforms. Yet England was endowed with a more vibrant civil society than that of the Gulf states; and for now Gulf monarchs are buying stability with generous welfare programs and by coopting disenchanted groups. In <italic>Democracy in America</italic>, Alexis de Tocqueville deplored revolution that yielded to the tyranny of the majority, but at the same time blamed the French monarchists for failing to avoid the revolution, which, in his view, they could have accomplished by undertaking substantive political reforms. Drawing on Tocqueville’s insight, one may hope that, in the case of Saudi Arabia and some other Gulf states, the Arab Spring will reinforce meaningful reform as the most viable long-term alternative to revolution. In that case, their enormous financial resources can allow progressive change through peaceful means. The question remains whether these countries are ready to take up these challenges.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section5-0191453713477821"><title>II Consolidation stage: Bonapartism or human rights?</title><p>From Aristotle to Marx and Gramsci, the process of consolidation and democratic transition has long been subject to extensive analysis. It is worth identifying some key points that emerge from that vast literature. When authoritarian regimes are toppled, new contenders for hegemonic power face the challenge of uniting splintered groups and distributing socio-economic goods more equitably. Consolidation often requires a close partnership with those supporting stability (the army and the police) and economic recovery (e.g. lenders and investors). The more intractable are political, class, or sectarian divisions, the greater the likelihood of a Bonapartist <italic>coup d’état</italic>, such as the 1952 officer coup in Egypt, which brought Nasser to power, or the return of authoritarianism. Among many historical examples, it is worth remembering that 19th-century transitional Germany was guided with a Bonapartist fist under Bismarck, and that the Bolshevik revolution under Lenin quashed the Menshevik experiment at a time when civil society was still polarized and Nicolas II’s White army still a threat, or, to invoke Gramscian terms, when civil society was still ‘gelatinous’.</p><p>The process of consolidation demands a balancing act between the need for significant rights-based changes and the simultaneous need to prevent social collapse – a challenge that is particularly daunting if there is no hegemonic group with the capacity to rule effectively. Whether revolutions are from above or from below, the consolidation process has to avoid entirely uprooting old institutions; the challenge is analogous to pruning diseased branches without killing the tree in the process. Every successful revolution faces this dilemma: keeping the old bureaucracy (civil and economic) and military intact will likely cripple needed change, but removing it wholesale would likely lead to social collapse. Progressive revolutionary movements face profound uncertainties as they seek to forge this practical synthesis between human rights progress and social order.</p><p>The need to integrate order and human rights imposes basic standards upon post-revolutionary states. For example, now that Tunisia and Egypt have taken the critical first step of holding national elections based on universal suffrage, having set aside some of the most extreme ideological prescriptions of AL Qtub and Hassan Al-Bannah, can their Muslim Brotherhood (MB) supporters assume a pragmatic posture responsive to the democratic aspirations of the revolution?</p><p>Continuing to focus on these two countries, one can identify three conditions necessary for effective consolidation of power consistent with a sustainable democratic transition: building a political consensus, improving human and economic capital, and securing society from chaos while promoting progress. First, they will need to build a broad consensus without either abandoning completely their ideological core (thereby legitimizing Salafist claims to be the true representatives of Islam) or alienating secular Egyptians and the Copt minority. This question is far from resolved, as the Muslim Brotherhood has to sort out questions concerning Shariah law and the future of the multiparty system.</p><p>There are issues where human rights choices have practical consequences for stability. The inflammatory labeling of women as a mere ‘complement’ of men in the Tunisian draft constitution sparked social unrest in Tunisia. The Egyptian draft constitution, with its notorious Article 36, secured some sort of equality for women only insofar as it is consistent with Shariah law. The same language appears in the constitutions of Iraq and Kuwait, but Shariah law is not compatible with democracy, with the central tenets of universal human rights, or particularly with the rights of women. The multiparty system, too, remains in doubt. On 27 November 2012, Morsi issued a constitutional decree granting him sweeping powers, including the power to reject any judicial interference with the adoption of the draft constitution. Tahrir Square filled with protesters.</p><p>Second, the Muslim Brotherhood in Tunisia and Egypt will need to deliver social and economic goods, reverse the economic setbacks resulting from the uprisings and address the intractable economic weakness that served as the uprisings’ fuel. Over time, failure on this front will reverse any initial successes at consolidation, and create a legitimacy crisis for the party in power. Tunisia has a population of nearly 10 million, with 30% youth unemployment and deepening poverty at 2.6% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0191453713477821">United Nations Development Programme, 2011</xref>). The Egyptian situation is even worse, with one quarter of its 80 million people living in poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0191453713477821">Abdel-Razek, 2011</xref>), and youth unemployment at 25% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0191453713477821">World Bank, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Beyond the immediate economic challenges, there is a widespread sense among the Muslim Brotherhood and Salafists that the free-market capitalist approach pursued by Ben Ali and Mubarak had increased socio-economic inequity, and, further, that the social tensions associated with ‘neo-liberal’ economics had provided a pretext for political repression in both countries. However, the Muslim Brotherhood must now wrestle with a global economic order that associates redistributive policies (including government subsidies for vital commodities like bread and gasoline) with insolvency and capital flight.</p><p>Regional economic powerhouses, such as the Saudis and Qataris, have stepped in to support the Islamist strand of the Arab uprisings, not just in Egypt, but more recently in Libya, Tunisia and Syria as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0191453713477821">Associated Press, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0191453713477821"><italic>Gulf News</italic>, 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0191453713477821">2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0191453713477821">Seibert, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0191453713477821">Toumi, 2012</xref>). This could embolden Islamists/Salafists to claim that they can manage domestic economic and political affairs. However, it is plausible that these vital gifts come with ideological strings attached, another reason for some pessimism regarding democratization and human rights progress in the region.</p><p>Third, can the Muslim Brotherhood in Tunisia and Egypt secure society from the brink of social collapse, a condition that is latent in all revolutionary societies in transition? Morsi and the military elite seem to have developed a modus vivandi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0191453713477821">Murphy, 2012</xref>), and in Tunisia the state of emergency reflects the transitional nature of post-revolutionary moments, As the leader of the Ennahda movement, Gannoushi, put it: ‘Tunisia is going through a transitional stage from an autocratic system to a democratic system, and this is what makes us fear a slide to chaos’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0191453713477821">Al-Turki, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Postponing or suspending formal democracy in periods of consolidation is common in post-revolutionary states. This was evidenced by the emergency Acts of the Committee of Public Safety during the French Revolution and the implementation of a ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ during the Bolshevik and Chinese revolutions. Kamal Atartürk, often invoked as a model leader for the countries of the Arab Spring, consolidated national power by suspending formal democracy in order to ban <italic>madrassas</italic>, separate religion from the state and promote women’s rights. Like Lenin before him, he employed ‘anti-democratic’ means to advance a human rights platform. In both the Soviet Union and Turkey, of course, particular (and limited) visions of human rights became the rationale for a chronic suppression of democracy. Whether and when such means are justified is a subject of endless debate. It should not be controversial, however, to insist that such means cannot be justified when the political platform is not genuinely consistent with the protection of universal human rights regardless of gender, race, religion, or ethnicity.</p></sec><sec id="section6-0191453713477821"><title>III Democratic transition</title><p>It is worth reiterating that the transition from consolidation to democracy is not inevitable. If the post-revolutionary political platform is not compatible in substance with human rights norms, the suspension of democracy or the use of emergency policies can be sustained indefinitely. So far, the Ikhawanin (Muslim Brothers) have adhered to some aspects of formal democracy, but as long as their so-called human rights agenda remains indebted to Shariah law – and is therefore out of step with from international human rights norms – human rights discourse is distorted and, in effect, hijacked by illiberal forces. The extent to which women and minorities will be granted rights under the post-revolutionary hegemony of the Muslim Brotherhood remains unknown.</p><p>The Brothers solicited women’s support and Morsi’s wife, Naglaa Ali Mahmoud, one of the leading Islamist women, helped in this endeavor, but she and other female Islamist activists must always operate within Islamist guidelines. Women have often been marginalized after the turmoil of an uprising; this has been true in past revolutionary contagions, and is occurring now in Tunis, Libya and Egypt. Many secular women were at the forefront of the Arab uprisings; their continued inclusion can be a major factor in shifting the political balance toward greater democracy and human rights. In this regard, August Bebel rightly argued in the late 19th century that the degree of civilization attained by a nation is measured by the position of its women. Likewise, the Copt minority has been under severe attacks from the onset of the Egyptian uprisings, making the case for separation between religion and state even more important. It seems that so far the Muslim Brotherhood via the Egyptian Freedom and Justice Party, as well as or the Tunisian Ennahda party, are forging alliance's with forces of stability and external economic donors (western or Gulf donors) in order to consolidate its power. Lack of economic development could lead to a slippery slope, as Saudi and Qatari funding potentially enhances the power of the Salafists. Appropriate concerns over a radical Islamist contagion in the region need to be faced with foresight.</p><p>In short, periods of consolidation are extremely volatile and often present opportunities for military coups and the return of proxies of the old regime. Progress toward democracy requires not only consolidation of authority by a post-revolutionary hegemon, but the establishment of a legitimate order that promotes human rights – including women and minority groups as active political participants. That is a formidable task when civil society is not cohesive and when human and economic capital are relatively scarce.</p><p>In these situations and in conjunction with existing domestic efforts, the active engagement of international actors, who are attuned to the complexities of post-revolutionary power struggle, may give the advantage to progressive forces. Two historical cases of revolutionary contagion are worth our consideration: 1848, when no external actors intervened in favor of democratic transition; and 1989, when eastern European democratic transitions were greatly facilitated by the EU. What follows is a brief look at those two cases, culminating in the suggestion that in the current case, a well-designed, limited, non-coercive intervention may significantly enhance chances for successful democratic transitions.</p><sec id="section7-0191453713477821"><title>1. The path of non-intervention (the lessons of 1848)</title><p>In 1848, the absence of outside support did not ultimately defeat efforts for enduring human rights success. In that sense, the lesson of 1848 is that non-interventionism could be a valid position. In the still unfolding revolutions in the Arab world, one could imagine several scenarios that would reward non-interventionism by external (allegedly) progressive forces. For instance, secular liberal Arab political parties may rebound from their initial setbacks, learn to organize effectively and start rising in the polls as governing Islamist regimes fail to deliver the economic goods. After all, an extraordinary demographic change is occurring from the Maghreb to the Arabian Gulf, the most notable feature of which is a youth bulge associated with the world’s highest level of youth unemployment (surpassing even sub-Saharan Africa).</p><p>While many have focused on the threat to stability posed by vast numbers of unemployed young men, there has been less focus on the potential impact of the combination of female unemployment and a dramatic increase in the number of educated women (in most MENA countries). These politically aware female protagonists were at the forefront of the Arab uprisings, and even if they and their secular male counterparts were insufficiently organized (compared with the Islamists) to win elections, they are building a form of social capital that can have a growing impact on the struggle to ensure a democratic transition. The Muslim Brotherhood has worked hard to tap the women’s vote in Tunisia and Egypt. It is plausible, however, that educated women, rejecting laws and policies that narrow their opportunities, will ultimately reshape civil society toward the advance of human rights.</p><p>One can imagine moderate elements in the Islamist political spectrum prevailing, leading to a pro-democratic coalition in which moderate religious and secular forces combine against extremism. This scenario will seem plausible to the extent that one interprets the Arab uprisings as a rejection of authoritarian rule, be it by secular dictators or by ayatollahs, so that the political space ends up being filled largely by secular and religious moderates. In this scenario, moderates will succeed in negotiating successfully with the military (or a reformed version of it) and the private sector – two key foundations of stability. From this perspective, history points toward the arrival of political maturity for these countries.</p><p>There is, however, another path, in which the center fails to hold, as secular youths drift toward leftist or anarchist extremism, and as young moderate Islamists yield to Salafism. This scenario points toward deepening chaos, war and limitless turmoil for the region and the world. The picture gains plausibility to the extent that post-revolutionary Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Syria and other states experience deepening poverty and ineffectual governance.</p></sec><sec id="section8-0191453713477821"><title>2. A non-coercive interventionist path (the lessons of 1989)</title><p>The democratic consolidation of a great part of the former communist bloc, so clearly benefiting from western assistance and integration into the European Union, adds to the case for post-2011 interventionism in the Arab Middle East. In contrast to eastern Europeans in 1989, however, Arabs of 2011 are unlikely to regard western intervention as largely benign, given the legacy of European imperialism and the role of the United States in the region since 1945. As a result, a strong US involvement could generate unintended consequences, even contributing to the resurgence of authoritarianism and extremism. Given this dilemma, external actors sympathetic to the Arab Spring would best pursue a middle course, one of building partnerships without imposing solutions.</p><p>Heavy-handed intervention is unlikely in any event. The US involvement in Iraq, yielding enormous bloodshed and an unclear outcome, suggests that Arab democrats should not place their hopes on a hegemonic US to police the region. Of course, given the long American record of supporting friendly dictators in the Middle East, from King Abdul-Aziz of Saudi Arabia in the 1930s to Hosni Mubarak (until his weakening grip on power inspired the Obama Administration to embrace the protestors of Tahrir Square), today’s Arab revolutionaries may reasonably regard expressions of US support as a mixed blessing at best. Moreover, for both the United States and the EU, the meltdown of 2008 and the unfolding European debt crisis simply mean that the kinds of resources bestowed on eastern Europe after 1989 (particularly on the reunification of Germany) will not be available for the foreseeable future. This is not encouraging news for Arabs who pin their hopes on meaningful help from outside the region. If the NATO-led intervention against Qaddafi raised hopes of an active western role, the unimpeded carnage in Syria is proving the depth of western reluctance to use force a second time.</p><p>The greater danger is that the US and the EU will focus on the immediate economic crisis while turning their backs on yearnings for democracy and human rights. This would be unfortunate. Just as the post-1989 consolidation of a democratic Europe made a vital contribution to European stability and peace, a similar benefit may be derived from the democratization of Arab states in the southern Mediterranean.</p><p>Conversely, if Tunisia, Egypt and Libya fail, Europe will face a de-stabilizing influx of illegal immigrants, compounded by the unpredictable dangers of instability or civil war in North Africa. From this perspective, realpolitik and human rights concerns fuse in support of a European effort to consolidate the new Mediterranean revolutions. Following in the footsteps of the Coal and Steel Community and the Treaty of Rome, which became the foundations of European union (however strained that union may be today), one can consider reviving efforts such as the 1995 European Mediterranean Partnership (aka the Barcelona Process) or Nicolas Sarkozy’s 2007 proposal for a ‘Mediterranean Union’; these projects can animate similar proposals for development.</p><p>Even if the West (the US or the EU) has become distracted from its long-term interests in the region, democracy may find surprising new allies within the region itself. In particular, one may envision a newly assertive Turkey taking on the role of shepherding transition and consolidation throughout the MENA region. Likewise, significant influence may come from the wealthy monarchies along the Gulf, who intend to use economic power to advance their interests while resolving conflicts and restoring stability in the region. In one instance, that of the Saudis in Bahrain, that interest in stability (in this case, inspired by fear of Iranian expansionism) precluded a democratic transition. In other cases, however (i.e., Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Syria), some of these monarchies seem to have concluded that representative governments in the post-revolution Arab states serve their conception of regional interests. At least in the short run, optimism in this regard must be tempered by the case of Saudi Arabia, given its long-standing promotion of an extreme version of Islam in the region and beyond (including the world’s most repressive policy toward women’s rights). However, at least two of the Gulf states (Qatar and the United Arab Emirates) have emerged as leading proponents of intervention by the international community in support of the democratic revolutions sweeping the region, including support for military intervention against the dictators of Libya and now Syria.</p><p>Given the uncertainties of external support, coupled with the doubtful domestic strength of pro-democracy forces in the Arab Middle East, a decisive factor may well be the extent to which progressive forces in the region can form an effective transnational organization, reaching both within and beyond the region to mobilize needed forms of support. We have not yet seen, for example, the creation of a non-governmental organization with a title like the ‘Middle Eastern Congress for Democracy and Human Rights’. Yet it is not hard to envision the networking of regional democratic activists ultimately coalescing into such an entity. Such a group might be analogous to the organization formed by the European left in 1864 – which, one may note, has been seen by many historians as an outgrowth of the revolutions of 1848. The International Workingmen's Association of 1864 served as a forum to coordinate planning and action. One can imagine the development of a similar organization in the Arab world, one that convenes meetings of human rights representatives from each country, perhaps even coordinating policy (e.g. peaceful demonstrations, boycotts and so on), and formulating common principles in a Declaration of Human Rights in the Middle East (supplanting the flawed 1990 Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam). If such an organization were to form, it would at least provide a secular alternative (and response) to the transnational organizing of the Muslim Brotherhood and more extremist Islamic organizations.</p><p>In conclusion and more immediately: will a moderate Islamist party (the current hegemonic contender after the elections in Tunisia and Egypt) succeed in building a consensus that unites religious and secular groups? If so, they will need to develop a broad vision based on universal principles of rights, ultimately encoded in their constitutions. At the same time, these aspiring hegemons will need to deliver the political, social and economic goods, fostering a greater sense of social equity and inclusiveness without alienating either the business community or the military.</p><p>None of this will succeed if economic development fails to keep pace with rapidly expanding populations. Such development will require the continuing financial support of wealthy Arab states and the sustained engagement of the wider developed world, for which a stable and democratic Middle East is crucial to prosperity and peace.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-0191453713477821"><p>A version of this article was presented at the Reset-Dialogues İstanbul Seminars 2012 (‘The Promises of Democracy in Troubled Times’) that took place at İstanbul Bilgi University from 19–24 May 2012.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Note</title><p>I have benefited from many interesting conversations with Claus Offe on the Arab Spring. The three regime types I describe here were initially described during a coauthored conference paper (‘Arab Seasons: Conditions, Social Actors and Prospects of Democratization’) at the Reset-Dialogues İstanbul Seminars 2012 (‘The Promises of Democracy in Troubled Times’) that took place at İstanbul Bilgi University on 19–24 May 2012. While continuing to draw upon Claus Offe’s typology, I have since partially revised the terms and the meaning of each type to fit better the argument developed in this article. I would also like to thank for their comments and editing David Goldfischer, Carl Pletch and Robert Pyne. Also, I want to thank my research assistants Keith Gehring, Raslan Ibrahim and Leah Shaswood for their diligent assistance.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-0191453713477821"><citation citation-type="web"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abdel-Razek</surname><given-names>Sherine</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2011</year>) <article-title>‘Living in Poverty’</article-title>, <source>Al-Ahram</source> (<issue>9 February</issue>), <comment>accessible @</comment>: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2012/1084/ec1.htm">http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2012/1084/ec1.htm</ext-link></citation></ref><ref id="bibr2-0191453713477821"><citation citation-type="web"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Al-Turki</surname><given-names>Nadia</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2012</year>) <article-title>‘Interview: Ennahda Movement’s Rachid Ghannouchi’</article-title>, <comment>accessible @</comment>: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.asharq-e.com/news.asp?section=3&amp;id=31581">http://www.asharq-e.com/news.asp?section=3&amp;id=31581</ext-link></citation></ref><ref id="bibr3-0191453713477821"><citation citation-type="web"><collab collab-type="author">Associated Press</collab> (<year>2012</year>) <article-title>‘Qatar Grants Egypt $2 Billion Loan’</article-title>, <source>Boston.com</source> (<issue>11 August</issue>), <comment>accessible @</comment>: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/africa/articles/2012/08/11/qatar_grants_egypt_2_billion_dollar_loan/">http://www.boston.com/news/world/africa/articles/2012/08/11/qatar_grants_egypt_2_billion_dollar_loan/</ext-link></citation></ref><ref id="bibr4-0191453713477821"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bebel</surname><given-names>August</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>1910[1879]</year>) <source>Woman and Socialism</source>, trans. <person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Stern</surname><given-names>M.
