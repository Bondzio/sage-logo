<p><bold>Purpose.</bold> Modeling studies that evaluate statin treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) use different methods to model the effect of statins. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of using different modeling methods on the optimal decision found in such studies. <bold>Methods.</bold> We used a previously developed and validated Monte Carlo–Markov model based on the Rotterdam study (RISC model). The RISC model simulates coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, cardiovascular death, and death due to other causes. Transition probabilities were based on 5-year risks predicted by Cox regression equations, including (among others) total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol as covariates. In a cost-effectiveness analysis of implementing the ATP-III guidelines, we evaluated the impact of using 3 different modeling methods of statin effectiveness: 1) through lipid level modification: statins lower total cholesterol and increase HDL cholesterol, which through the covariates in the Cox regression equations leads to a lower incidence of CHD and stroke events; 2) fixed risk reduction of CVD events: statins decrease the odds of CHD and stroke with an associated odds ratio that is assumed to be the same for each individual; 3) risk reduction of CVD events proportional to individual change in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol: the relative risk reduction with statin therapy on the incidence of CHD and stroke was assumed to be proportional to the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol levels for each individual. The probability that the ATP-III strategy was cost-effective, compared to usual care as observed in the Rotterdam study, was calculated for each of the 3 modeling methods for varying willingness-to-pay thresholds. <bold>Results.</bold> Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the ATP-III strategy compared with the reference strategy were €56,642/quality-adjusted life year (QALY), €21,369/QALY, and €22,131/QALY for modeling methods 1, 2, and 3, respectively. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of €50,000/QALY, the probability that the ATP-III strategy was cost-effective was about 40% for modeling method 1 and more than 90% for both methods 2 and 3. Differences in results between the modeling methods were sensitive to both the time horizon modeled and age distribution of the target population. <bold>Conclusions.</bold> Modeling the effect of statins on CVD through the modification of lipid levels produced different results and associated uncertainty than modeling it directly through a risk reduction of events. This was partly attributable to the modeled effect of cholesterol on the incidence of stroke.</p>

<p>As the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is still increasing globally, the primary prevention of CVD is more important than ever. Most Western populations are aging, and given limited health care resources, research in CVD prevention should evaluate not only effectiveness but also cost-effectiveness. Randomized clinical trials in this area are scarce, and a number of recent articles have used simulation models to analyze the cost-effectiveness of preventive interventions for CVD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X12439754">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X12439754"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X12439754"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X12439754"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X12439754"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X12439754"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X12439754"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12439754"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X12439754"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X12439754"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X12439754">11</xref></sup> Frequently, the intervention in these studies consisted of statin treatment for asymptomatic individuals, often based on the third report of the expert panel on detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood cholesterol in adults (ATP-III).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X12439754">12</xref></sup></p>

<p>As the ATP-III guidelines are frequently studied with decision models, it provides a suitable decision analytic example to illustrate the use of different modeling methods of statin effectiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X12439754">12</xref></sup> The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of using different methods of modeling statin treatment effectiveness on the lifetime effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of implementing the ATP-III guidelines.</p>
<sec id="section1-0272989X12439754" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>To evaluate the impact of using different methods of modeling treatment effectiveness of a statin, we used the previously developed Rotterdam Ischemic Heart Disease &amp; Stroke Computer Simulation Model (RISC model). The model will be briefly outlined, after which 3 different modeling methods of statin effectiveness will be described and applied to the RISC model. Finally, the decision problem used to evaluate the different modeling methods will be outlined.</p>
<sec id="section2-0272989X12439754">
<title>RISC Model</title>
<p>The RISC model is a Monte Carlo state transition model (schematically presented in Figure 6 of the Appendix online) with 6 states: 1) the CVD death state, 2) the non-CVD death state, 3) the coronary heart disease (CHD) state, 4) the stroke state, 5) the CHD and stroke state, and 6) the well state (being alive without CHD or stroke). The model simulates incident CVD events in individuals based on risk factor–dependent transition probabilities, using Cox regression equations. Individual risk factor profiles were modeled and tracked over time. The model was built in TreeAge (version 2009, TreeAge Software Inc., Williamstown, MA). Detailed information about the model is given in an earlier publication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272989X12439754">22</xref></sup> and the Appendix online.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0272989X12439754">
<title>Rotterdam Study</title>
<p>In the RISC model, the risk factor profiles and transition probability functions were based on data from the Rotterdam study population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272989X12439754">23</xref></sup> This population consisted of 7983 respondents from a random sample of adults aged 55 years and older who were recruited between 1990 and 1993 and residing in Ommoord, the Netherlands. Of these 7983 respondents, 6871 individuals both visited the research center and signed an informed consent form. Individuals were followed from 1990 to 2000, and follow-up consisted of 3 physical examinations with lifestyle interviews and surveillance of hospital admissions, death registries, and other available medical sources, ensuring accurate follow-up of death and clinical manifestations of CVD.</p>
<p>In 3501 individuals, all important characteristics to predict CVD were completely known. The RISC model was based on data from these 3501 individuals. The risk factors considered for the transition probability functions were age, sex, smoking status, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, plasma glucose level, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, plasma cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level, plasma creatinine level, family history of CVD, ankle-brachial systolic blood pressure index, manifestations of intermittent claudication, angina pectoris, atrial fibrillation or transient ischemic attacks, and prevalent CVD. Details about the assessment of these risk indicators are described in earlier publications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272989X12439754">23</xref></sup> We define a CVD event as any of the following events: a fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention, fatal or nonfatal ischemic or unspecified stroke, or death due to heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, or other arterial disease.</p>

<title>Modeling Statin Effectiveness</title>
<p>In this study, 3 methods of modeling statin effectiveness applied to the RISC model were evaluated:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Through lipid level modification: clinical trials have shown that statins increase HDL cholesterol and decrease both total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272989X12439754">24</xref></sup> In the RISC model, both total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol are included in the Cox regression equations describing the hazards of a (fatal or nonfatal) CHD event (myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, or CABG), the 6-month case fatality rate after a stroke event, and other cardiovascular mortality (CVD-related mortality not due to a fatal CHD or stroke event within 6 months). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272989X12439754">Table 1</xref> provides an overview of the hazard rate ratios for both total and HDL cholesterol underlying the transition probabilities for these 3 events. In accordance with earlier research,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272989X12439754">25</xref></sup> the total incidence of stroke is unchanged by total and HDL cholesterol; only the fraction of fatal events is reduced. This method of modeling statin effectiveness assumes that the statin-induced reduction in total cholesterol and increase in HDL cholesterol cause a decrease in the hazard rates for cardiovascular-related events via the Cox regression equations and lower the annual probabilities of having such events in the model compared with not taking statins. Based on the most recent meta-analysis by Brugts and others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272989X12439754">24</xref></sup> we assumed an average 15.7% reduction in total cholesterol from baseline when using statins and a 3.1% increase in HDL cholesterol.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fixed risk reduction of CVD events: based on the same meta-analysis, clinical trials have shown an average reduction in the incidence of a first fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (odds ratio [OR] = 0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.61–0.81) and first fatal or nonfatal stroke event (OR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.71–0.93).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272989X12439754">24</xref></sup> Directly applying these odds ratios to the annual odds of a first fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal or nonfatal stroke lowers the incidence of having such events in the model compared with not taking statins. We assumed that the case fatality rate following a CHD or stroke event remained unchanged.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Risk reduction of CVD events proportional to individual change in LDL cholesterol: the third modeling method assumes that the statin-induced reduction in LDL cholesterol is an indicator of the risk reduction that can be expected from statin therapy. Given an individual’s baseline LDL cholesterol, the expected absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol (mmol/L) was calculated, based on the same meta-analysis as used in methods 1 and 2, which demonstrated an average relative reduction in LDL cholesterol of 23.7%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272989X12439754">24</xref></sup> Based on another source, the risk reduction in the incidence of a first fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction was estimated to be 0.23 per mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction and 0.17 for a first fatal or nonfatal stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272989X12439754">26</xref></sup> Multiplying each individual’s baseline LDL cholesterol level (mmol/L) with the relative reduction in LDL and with the risk reduction per mmol/L LDL reduction, we obtained each individual’s estimated risk reduction under statin therapy. Applying these individual risk reductions to the annual probabilities of a first nonfatal myocardial infarction and first fatal or nonfatal stroke lowers the incidence of having such an event in the model compared with not taking statins. This method differs from method 1 because it does not affect the β coefficients in the state transition probabilities but affects the probabilities of incident myocardial infarction and stroke similarly as method 2. It does differ from method 2, as the risk reduction is not fixed for each individual but depends on the individual’s baseline LDL cholesterol level.</p></list-item>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>For each of the 3501 individuals, the 10-year Framingham risk score, based on the original work from 1998, was calculated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272989X12439754">27</xref></sup> Important baseline variables were calculated, stratified by 3 risk categories: low (10-year Framingham risk &lt;10%), intermediate (10%-20%), and high (&gt;20%). Individuals with a history of CVD or diabetes at baseline were considered to be at high risk. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) (i.e., additional costs divided by QALYs gained) were calculated for the ATP-III strategy and reference strategy for all 3 modeling methods separately. To take time preference into account, future costs and effectiveness were discounted at the currently recommended US discount rate of 3% for both costs and effectiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272989X12439754">29</xref></sup> Strategies were first ordered according to increasing cost. A strategy was considered dominated if another strategy was both more effective and less costly. A strategy was considered extended dominated if another strategy achieved more effectiveness at a lower ICER. After eliminating dominated and extended dominated strategies, the ICERs were calculated as the difference in mean lifetime costs divided by the difference in mean QALYs for each strategy compared to the next best nondominated strategy.</p>
<p>A 3-level simulation was performed. The first loop consisted of 1000 parameter drawings, including the joint distributions of the β coefficients from the Cox proportional hazards equations, representing parameter (second-order) uncertainty. The second loop consisted of a fixed subset of 200 randomly drawn individuals from the 3501 individuals, each with their own risk profile, representing heterogeneity. Average values of the baseline characteristics for these 200 individuals were not significantly different from those of the 3501 individuals. The third and final loop consisted of 100 random walks (stochastic uncertainty), which was necessary because multiple tracker variables were used in the model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272989X12439754">30</xref></sup> For each of the 3 modeling methods, we calculated the probability that the ATP-III strategy was cost-effective, for a range of willingness-to-pay thresholds, generating acceptability curves.</p>
<p>To get more insight into possible differences between the modeling methods with regard to the ICERs, we determined intermediate outcomes such as the age of death, the percentage of all deaths due to CVD and non-CVD causes, and the percentage of individuals with incident CHD, stroke, and total incident CVD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0272989X12439754">
<title>Sensitivity Analysis</title>
<p>As the first method directly affects both the hazards of CVD events and other CVD mortality, and includes an interaction with age and HDL cholesterol in one of the transition probabilties, the potential differences in outcomes between the 3 methods are anticipated to be sentitive to the time horizon modeled as well as the age range of the population simulated. In a sensitivity analysis, we checked whether the results would be different when using a follow-up of 5, 10, 15, and 20 years. In another sensitivity analysis, we stratified the analysis by age groups. We ran the (lifetime) simulation with individuals who belonged to the first, second, third, and fourth age quartiles, respectively. We calculated the ICER of implementing ATP-III versus the reference strategy, and the probability that the ATP-III stratey was cost-effective, for each of the modeling methods in each subgroup and a willingness-to-pay threshold of €50,000.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we evaluated the consequences of using different modeling methods of statin treatment effectiveness on the cost-effectiveness of implementing the ATP-III guidelines for the primary prevention of CVD. We found that different modeling assumptions about the effect of statin therapy affected the results such that the optimal decision would change. For willingness-to-pay thresholds of €30,000/QALY to €60,000/QALY, modeling methods 2 and 3 would lead to the conclusion that the ATP-III guidelines are cost-effective, whereas using method 1 would lead to the conclusion that the ATP-III guidelines are not cost-effective.</p>
<p>These results were not obvious a priori, as the 3 methods influence different events compared to another. Modeling method 1 leads to a lower probability of CHD, the 6-month case fatality rate after a stroke (a conditional probability), and other cardiovascular mortality. Methods 2 and 3 lower the incidence of CHD and stroke as well but do not affect the latter 2 probabilities. An indirect effect was present on the incidence of stroke with model 1: because the hazard rate ratio of incident stroke is unchanged with statins with method 1, and as a result of competing risks in the model, an increase in the incidence of stroke was observed with this method compared to the reference strategy. As strokes are an important determinant of CVD, these differences between the modeling methods partly explain the QALY and cost disadvantage for method 1 compared to methods 2 and 3.</p>
<p>Two important sensitivity analyses showed how age and the decision time frame influenced our findings. For individuals aged 77 years and older, a statin-induced increase in HDL cholesterol would lead to an increase in the hazard of stroke mortality due to the interaction with age (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272989X12439754">Table 1</xref>). This can partly explain the steep increase in the ICER of the ATP-III with this method, observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0272989X12439754">Figure 2</xref>. The steeper decline in ICER of the ATP-III with method 1 when follow-up is extended from 5 to 10 years can be explained by the fact that a substantial part of the effect of statin treatment with this method is obtained through the reduction in other CVD mortality. The probability of CVD mortality is higher after a nonfatal CVD event, and nonfatal CVD events accumulate with a longer follow-up.</p>
<p>Are these findings generalizable to other models than the RISC model, and would a similar difference between method 1 versus methods 2 and 3 have been found? Several investigators have modeled the treatment effect of a statin similar to method 1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X12439754">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12439754">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272989X12439754">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272989X12439754"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272989X12439754"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X12439754"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X12439754">18</xref></sup> These models are, just like the RISC model, based on risk factor–dependent transition probabilities with total and HDL cholesterol as lipid-based risk factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272989X12439754">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272989X12439754"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X12439754"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X12439754">18</xref></sup> The treatment effect of statins was, similar to method 1, modeled through these risk factors and accompanying regression coefficients. While the magnitude of the β coefficients of total and HDL cholesterol may differ from those in the RISC model, it is highly likely that similar associations between cholesterol risk factors and CHD and stroke events would have been found. More specifically, other data support the lack of an association between total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and incident stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272989X12439754">25</xref></sup> but did find a trend for HDL cholesterol on fatal stroke. Thus, any simulation model based on risk factor–dependent transition probabilities based on observational data, which would incorporate stroke events, would likely be subject to the same phenomenon as observed with modeling method 1 in the RISC model. It would be interesting to see if models using a method similar to method 1 would report worse cost-effectiveness ratios of statin interventions than models using a method similar to method 2 or 3. However, the articles we looked into were too heterogeneous with regard to the exact statin-based intervention to make a meaningful comparison.</p>
<p>With regard to the possible mechanisms underlying the treatment effect of statins, other authors have suggested that statins have a cardioprotective effect beyond the improved lipid levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272989X12439754">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272989X12439754">32</xref></sup> This would suggest a preference for methods 2 and 3, which directly model the relation between statin therapy and outcomes and capture the (potential) effects on events beyond lipid lowering. However, the validity of a model only partly depends on the structural modeling of the treatment effect. Being a simplifying abstraction of reality, a model will be valid with regard to some (but not necessarily all) mechanisms or relationships as observed in real life. Assumptions made to assure that particular mechanisms are characterized can cause the model to be less valid with regard to other possible mechanisms. For example, if the decision problem requires that the modeled reduction in incident CHD and stroke corresponds to the same reduction as observed in trials, the resulting reduction in fatal total CVD events produced by this model is unlikely to match the observed reduction in fatal total CVD events in the same trials if no further adjustments or assumptions are introduced. This makes the modeling of complex interrelationships more of an art than an exact science. For each particular decision problem, it is important to determine which assumptions each approach is sensitive to, determine the appropriateness of these assumptions, and judge the relevance of the model sensitivity to them in the context of the decision problem studied. Rather than determining the validity of the 3 methods against some arbitrary chosen “gold standard,” we demonstrated how the different methods currently used in practice can affect the results and alter the conclusions of a decision analysis.</p>
<p>Our study bears some limitations. The state transition probabilities in the RISC model did not include LDL cholesterol as a covariate. Similarly, the original Framingham risk score and the European SCORE function do not include LDL cholesterol as well. Instead, they include HDL and total cholesterol, as does the RISC model. Although we demonstrate large differences in results, our study does not provide information on which modeling method is optimal. The complex interplay between various aspects of Markov decision models, including competing risks and extrapolation to lifetime events, makes it practically impossible to say beforehand which method would be preferable in terms of model validity. The only proper way to find out is to perform a thorough validation analysis, both internal and external, before a simulation model is used to evaluate a decision problem.</p>
<p>In our analysis, we evaluated the ATP-III treatment scenario. Although our results could be different for other statin treatment scenarios, such as pure risk-based treatment interventions, it is likely that such scenarios are subject to the same effects of modeling treatment effectiveness. Although we explicitly looked into the effect of statins, other interventions targeting risk factors or intermediate outcomes in primary prevention of CVD such as smoking cessation, weight loss, and blood pressure are likely to be subject to the same phenomenon. Smoking status, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and weight-related risk factors such as body mass index or waist-to-hip ratio are included as covariates in the RISC model. An intervention on these risk factors can be assumed to work through the modification of these covariates, similar to method 1, or directly on event incidence rates as in methods 2 and 3. With this in mind, our results further stress the importance of thorough consideration of the assumptions underlying a simulation model and performing extensive model validation. In conclusion, this study points out that the choice of modeling method of the effectiveness of statin treatment in simulation studies can influence the optimal decision and the uncertainty associated with it.</p>
