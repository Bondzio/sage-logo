<p><italic>From the</italic> British Journalism Review <italic>of 10 years ago (vol. 14, issue no 2, 2003)</italic></p>
<p>‘… the U.S. administration … has decided that its attitude to war correspondents is the same as that set out by President Bush when declaring war on terrorists: “You're either with us or you're against us.” Those journalists prepared to get on side – and that means 100 per cent on side – will become “embeds” and receive every assistance. Those who try to follow an objective, independent path, the so-called “unilateral,” will be shunned. And those who report from the enemy side will risk being shot. If you don't like all this, they won't give a damn. Welcome to the new and highly dangerous world of the war correspondent …’</p>
<disp-quote><p><italic>– Phillip Knightley on reporting the war in Iraq</italic></p></disp-quote>
<p>‘Continual warnings of “barmy EU ethics” … which have surreptitiously impinged upon British life, have been the mainstay of EU reporting in much of the British press. Indeed, were every portentous prediction to have come to fruition … we would see grocers carried off to jail for selling non-straight cucumbers and overly-bent bananas … Ordering fish and chips would have to be done in Latin because of the confusion caused to foreigners by the use of English … Clearly none of the above myths … have come to pass as reality in the UK.’</p>
<disp-quote><p><italic>– the late Jim Dougal, then Head of the European Commission Representation in the UK</italic></p></disp-quote>
<p>‘… when the public interest finds itself, even marginally, at variance or in conflict with the workings of the marketplace, the public interest test must be judged not as co-equal, but as being of paramount importance. For in the end, the achievement of “plurality and diversity” … must be a core ambition of <italic>any</italic> plural democracy.’</p>
<disp-quote><p><italic>– Lord (David) Puttnam, then chairman of the Joint Scrutiny Committee on the Communications Bill</italic></p></disp-quote>
<p>‘Politicians may believe that journalists are there to serve their purpose. In fact, it is politicians, overwhelmingly, who serve the purpose of journalists and can be discarded if that purpose is not served. Journalists are able to destroy the careers of politicians’ – and they have the scalps to prove it.</p>
<disp-quote><p><italic>– Gerald Kaufman, then chair of the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport select committee</italic></p></disp-quote>
