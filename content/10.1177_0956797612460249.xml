<abstract>
<p>Personality disorders (PDs) may be better understood in terms of dimensions of general personality functioning rather than as discrete categorical conditions. Personality-trait descriptions of PDs are robust across methods and settings, and PD assessments based on trait measures show good construct validity. The study reported here extends research showing that basic traits (e.g., impulsiveness, warmth, straightforwardness, modesty, and deliberation) can re-create the epidemiological characteristics associated with PDs. Specifically, we used normative changes in absolute trait levels to simulate age-related differences in the prevalence of psychopathy in a forensic setting. Results demonstrated that trait information predicts the rate of decline for psychopathy over the life span; discriminates the decline of psychopathy from that of a similar disorder, antisocial PD; and accurately predicts the differential decline of subfactors of psychopathy. These findings suggest that basic traits provide a parsimonious account of PD prevalence across the life span.</p>

<body>
<p>In the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, fourth edition (<italic>DSM–IV</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612460249">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>), personality disorders (PDs) are assumed to represent qualitatively distinct clinical syndromes. This conceptualization is frequently criticized, however, and growing evidence suggests that PDs represent arbitrary distinctions along dimensions of general personality functioning rather than discrete categorical conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612460249">Clark, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797612460249">Livesley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0956797612460249">Widiger, Simonsen, Krueger, Livesley, &amp; Verheul, 2005</xref>). From this perspective, many of the problems typically associated with PD categories (e.g., excessive diagnostic co-occurrence, inadequate coverage, arbitrary and unstable boundaries with normal psychological functioning) are the result of imposing a categorical system on dimensional phenomena.</p>
<p>A variety of studies have proposed alternative dimensional models to help understand or to replace the PD categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0956797612460249">Widiger &amp; Simonsen, 2005</xref>). The most widely used dimensional model, however, is the Big Five model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612460249">Clark, 2007</xref>). This model includes five broad personality domains—neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness—each of which is measured by six lower-order facet traits. The Big Five were derived from the analyses of personality-trait questionnaires, as well as from lexical analyses. The lexical hypothesis, the idea that important differences between individuals will have been noticed and encoded in language across the course of human interactions, ensures that important, universal aspects of personality are represented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612460249">Ashton &amp; Lee, 2001</xref>). Because lexical analyses of the Big Five were guided by an attempt to organize the trait terms of the English language rather than by an effort to predict certain criteria or pathologies, the five-factor model is particularly useful as a theoretical framework for understanding PDs. That is, one begins with simple traits that were developed independently of PD criteria and contain little representation of explicitly disordered behavior. In the personality-disorder literature, the most common instantiation of the Big Five is the five-factor model (FFM); this model is typically measured using the NEO Inventories, which include six lower-order facet traits for each of the FFM domain traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797612460249">McCrae &amp; Costa, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Using Normal Traits to Model Abnormal Personality</title>
<p>Research supports the idea that PDs are maladaptive configurations of basic traits from the FFM and can be validly assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612460249">Costa &amp; Widiger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612460249">Lynam &amp; Widiger, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797612460249">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0956797612460249">Widiger &amp; Trull, 2007</xref>). This includes research on psychopathy, which has long been recognized as a PD even though it is not an official <italic>DSM</italic> diagnosis. In fact, in the current proposal for personality disorders in <italic>DSM–5</italic>, the six personality disorders to be retained would be diagnosed in large part on the basis of 25 maladaptive traits contained within a five-factor model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797612460249">Krueger et al., 2011</xref>). Four of these five trait domains are said to align with four of the five domains of the FFM: <italic>DSM–5</italic> emotional dysregulation aligns with FFM neuroticism, <italic>DSM–5</italic> detachment aligns with low FFM extraversion, <italic>DSM–5</italic> disinhibition aligns with low FFM conscientiousness, and <italic>DSM–5</italic> antagonism aligns with low FFM agreeableness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797612460249">Krueger et al. (2011)</xref> suggested that <italic>DSM–5</italic> psychoticism (or peculiarity) does not align with FFM openness, but there is some disagreement with respect to this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0956797612460249">Widiger, 2011</xref>). In any case, what is important to emphasize is that the <italic>DSM–5</italic> proposal does suggest that personality disorders are optimally understood as maladaptive variants of the traits in the FFM, at least with respect to four of the five domains.</p>
<p>There are a number of benefits to this conceptualization. One such benefit is being able to apply what is known about general personality structure to an understanding of personality disorder. One of the major limitations of the existing personality-disorder nomenclature is an absence of construct validity support, including data on its longitudinal stability. In a special issue of the <italic>Journal of Personality Disorders</italic> devoted to the question of the temporal stability of personality disorders, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0956797612460249">Skodol et al. (2005)</xref> acknowledged, “dimensional models of PD have types of clinical validity that categories do not, most notably, greater temporal stability” (p. 499).</p>
<p>Previous research has indicated how an understanding of PDs can help address problematic findings and issues with respect to this nomenclature. For example, it has been shown that the FFM’s understanding of the PDs accounts for one of their most troublesome facts: excessive diagnostic comorbidity. Although high comorbidity between PDs presents a challenge to the validity of a categorical approach, it is easily accommodated by a dimensional approach that explains these co-occurrences as a manifestation of overlapping traits. From this view, convergence between trait profiles should predict higher comorbidity, and divergence between trait profiles should predict lower comorbidity. Research has demonstrated that the actual comorbidities among all PDs can be predicted on the basis of FFM-facet overlap alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612460249">Lynam &amp; Widiger, 2001</xref>), and meta-analytic evidence shows that the observed comorbidities between psychopathy and the 10 <italic>DSM–IV</italic> PDs are extremely similar (<italic>r</italic> = .92) to the pattern of correlations between the FFM psychopathy prototype and the other 10 FFM PD prototypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797612460249">Lynam &amp; Derefinko, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, basic traits can explain gender differences in PD diagnoses. Some of the <italic>DSM–IV</italic> PDs (dependent, histrionic, borderline) are diagnosed more often in women, whereas others (antisocial, narcissistic, schizoid) are diagnosed more often in men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797612460249">Lynam &amp; Widiger, 2007</xref>). Because gender differences in the levels of FFM traits are well known, it is possible to use this information—along with FFM descriptions of PDs—to compare observed sex differences in the PDs with sex differences that would be expected on the basis of a general model of personality. A recent study applying this technique to the 10 <italic>DSM–IV</italic> PDs found high agreement between FFM-predicted sex differences and empirically observed sex differences in the PDs (<italic>r</italic> = .72; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797612460249">Lynam &amp; Widiger, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>Recently, research has begun to examine the relation of traits to PDs across the life span. For example, changes in broad PD-symptom clusters across the first 4 years of college can be predicted from traits measured by the Interpersonal Adjective Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0956797612460249">Wright, Pincus, &amp; Lenzenweger, 2011</xref>), and borderline PD is related to instability of neuroticism and conscientiousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797612460249">Hopwood et al., 2009</xref>). Our project uses the exemplar of psychopathy to demonstrate that basic traits can also account for the relation between PD and age. Psychopathy is a personality disorder characterized by traits such as callousness, manipulativeness, egocentricity, impulsivity, and a need for stimulation, as well as a history of early, pervasive antisocial behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612460249">Cleckley, 1941</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612460249">Hare, 2003</xref>). It is related to criminality and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612460249">Gretton, Hare, &amp; Catchpole, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797612460249">Skeem &amp; Mulvey, 2001</xref>) and is a significant predictor of general and violent recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612460249">Hemphill, Hare, &amp; Wong, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The Psychopathy Checklist (PCL) and its revision (PCL-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612460249">Hare, 2003</xref>) are the most common measures of psychopathy used in samples of incarcerated offenders. Two factors have been identified in the PCL-R. Factor 1 represents the interpersonal and affective components of psychopathy (e.g., grandiosity, lying, lack of remorse or guilt), whereas Factor 2 represents the social deviance components of psychopathy (e.g., early behavior problems, juvenile delinquency, impulsivity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612460249">Hare, 2003</xref>). Our hypothesis is that information about how FFM traits are related to age can be used to make testable predictions about how PDs are related to age, and that these predictions can then be evaluated against extant data. Three types of information are necessary to carry out such a test: (a) the relations between the FFM traits and age, (b) the relations between the FFM traits and the PD in question, and (c) the relation between the PD and age.</p>
<p>The first piece of information is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797612460249">McCrae, Martin, and Costa (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797612460249">McCrae, Costa, and Martin (2005)</xref>, who examined normative differences in absolute FFM trait levels over the entire adult life span. McCrae and colleagues found that neuroticism decreases with age, whereas both agreeableness and conscientiousness increase with age. In addition, excitement-seeking and fantasy facets decrease with age, whereas warmth increases with age. The second and third pieces of information are available for psychopathy. Psychopathy is one of the best-researched PDs and the most frequently studied in relation to traits from general models of personality functioning; its FFM profile is well charted. In a study of 889 male prison inmates between the ages of 16 and 69, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612460249">Harpur and Hare (1994)</xref> found that the prevalence of psychopathy (as measured using the PCL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797612460249">Hare, 1980</xref>) and antisocial PD (APD; as measured using a semistructured interview) both decline steadily with age, although these declines were more marked for APD.</p>
<p>It is important to note that psychopathy allows for a fairly nuanced test. Unlike other PDs, psychopathy has a good comparison condition for the analysis of discriminant validity, APD, which also has a well-charted FFM profile and data available on its prevalence as a function of age. Although APD and psychopathy were originally meant to refer to the same constructs, their operationalizations have diverged across successive versions of the <italic>DSM</italic> as criteria for APD have become more behaviorally based. At this point, APD appears to have a lower diagnostic threshold than psychopathy and is characterized more by social-deviance aspects of psychopathy (i.e., Factor 2 traits), such as impulsivity, delinquency, and irresponsibility, than by affective and interpersonal aspects of psychopathy (i.e., Factor 1 traits), such as glib charm, arrogant self-appraisal, lack of empathy, and shallow affect. Psychopathy also has subfactors for which data on prevalence across the life span are available, making another powerful test possible. Our investigation used what is known about age-related differences in FFM traits to predict <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612460249">Harpur and Hare’s (1994)</xref> observed life-span differences in the prevalence of psychopathy and APD. Further, we tested whether the differential declines across mean Factor 1 (interpersonal-affective) and Factor 2 (social deviance) scores were due to differential declines in the specific traits associated with each factor. This research extends the argument that PDs can be understood as maladaptive variants of normal personality traits—more specifically, that basic traits can re-create the epidemiologic findings for psychopathy.</p>

<title>Participants and procedure</title>
<p>Participants were 1,152 individuals across two samples (an adult sample and an adolescent sample) originally recruited in cross-sectional studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797612460249">McCrae, Costa, et al. (2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797612460249">McCrae, Martin, et al., 2005</xref>); full details of recruitment are given by these authors, although a brief description of each sample is provided below. All participants received a personality questionnaire by mail.</p>
<p>Participants in the adult sample were 652 individuals ranging in age from 21 to 91. Age and sex were stratified in this sample, with early-adult groups overrepresented because evidence suggests that age-related personality changes are most marked during early adulthood. Participants responded to the NEO Personality Inventory-3 (NEO-PI-3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797612460249">McCrae &amp; Costa, 2010</xref>), and protocols were screened for validity using the criteria specified in the manual for validity checks (which ask respondents if they have answered honestly and in the right spaces), random responding (assessed by strings of identical responses; e.g., more than six consecutive <italic>strongly disagree</italic> responses), and missing items. Further analyses were conducted on the 635 respondents (356 women, 279 men) who had valid protocols.</p>
<p>Adult participants resided in 29 states, although most (63.0%) were from Pennsylvania. The sample was predominantly White (92.6%); of the remaining participants, 1.6% were Asian or Pacific Islander, 1.3% were Hispanic, 1.1% were Black, and the rest were of another ethnicity or did not report their ethnicity. High academic achievers were overrepresented in the sample, such that 75.6% of participants had more than a high school education and 26.8% had more than a baccalaureate degree. Adult participants were also relatively affluent, such that only 8.8% reported annual household incomes less than $20,000 and 19.3% reported annual household incomes greater than $100,000. English was the first language of all but 4 participants.</p>
<p>Participants in the adolescent sample were 500 participants (242 males and 258 females) aged 14 to 20 and tested by methods similar to those used to test participants in the adult sample. Adolescent participants were primarily White (84.6%), and high academic achievers were overrepresented in the sample.</p>
<p>In the combined sample of adolescents and adults, a total of 1,135 participants (521 male, 614 female) were divided into 11 groups on the basis of their age (14 to 15 years old: <italic>n</italic> = 94; 16 to 17 years old: <italic>n</italic> = 110; 18 years old: <italic>n</italic> = 100; 19 years old: <italic>n</italic> = 98; 20 years old: <italic>n</italic> = 98; 21 to 25 years old: <italic>n</italic> = 119; 26 to 30 years old: <italic>n</italic> = 99; 31 to 40 years old: <italic>n</italic> = 59; 41 to 50 years old: <italic>n</italic> = 155; 51 to 60 years old: <italic>n</italic> = 100; 61 or more years old: <italic>n</italic> = 103).</p>

<p>The NEO-PI-3 is a slightly modified version of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612460249">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992</xref>) designed to be more understandable to adolescents and adults with low reading levels. The NEO-PI-3 is a 240-item questionnaire that assesses 30 specific traits (or facets), six for each of the five basic personality dimensions: neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Items are answered using 5-point Likert scales from <italic>strongly disagree</italic> (0) to <italic>strongly agree</italic> (4).

<title>FFM PD scores</title>
<p>Using FFM trait information, PD scores were derived for each participant. To ensure that results were not due to the methods used to generate the FFM-based scores, multiple approaches to determining the relevant FFM traits were used. We generated total FFM-psychopathy scores using three different approaches: (a) expert ratings of prototypical psychopathy using the facets of the FFM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0956797612460249">Miller, Lynam, Widiger, &amp; Leukefeld, 2001</xref>), (b) a translation of each PCL-R psychopathy item (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612460249">Hare, 2003</xref>) into equivalent FFM facets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0956797612460249">Widiger &amp; Lynam, 1998</xref>), and (c) observed correlations derived by averaging weighted effect sizes (Pearson correlations) across four previous studies employing the NEO and a PCL-based measure of psychopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612460249">Decuyper, De Fruyt, &amp; Buschman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612460249">Harpur, Hart, &amp; Hare, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612460249">Jackson &amp; Richards, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797612460249">Vachon, Lynam, Loeber, &amp; Stouthamer-Loeber, 2012</xref>). FFM-based Factor 1 and Factor 2 scores for each participant were determined using only the criteria-translation approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612460249">Derefinko &amp; Lynam, 2006</xref>). No expert-consensus profile for Factor 1 and Factor 2 has been developed, and only one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612460249">Gaughan, Miller, Pryor, &amp; Lynam, 2009</xref>) has reported correlations between psychopathy factors and FFM facets. For APD, the relevant facets were identified using the same three types of approaches used for psychopathy: expert ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612460249">Lynam &amp; Widiger, 2001</xref>), criteria translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612460249">Costa &amp; Widiger, 2002</xref>), and correlations between FFM and APD measures taken from a previous meta-analysis of 16 studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956797612460249">Samuel &amp; Widiger, 2008</xref>) and combined with results from two recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612460249">Decuyper et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612460249">Gudonis, Miller, Miller, &amp; Lynam, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>For each profiling method (i.e., expert consensus, criteria translation, and empirical relations) and each disorder (i.e., psychopathy, APD, Factor 1, and Factor 2) scores on the FFM facets identified as constituting the disorder were summed to produce a FFM <italic>disorder count</italic>. Values for facets showing a negative relation to the disorder were reversed before summing. Thus, we obtained three psychopathy scores, three APD scores, one Factor 1 score, and one Factor 2 score for each participant.</p>

<title>Equivalence of FFM approaches</title>
<p>Disorder counts for psychopathy and APD from each FFM approach were compared with one another for equivalence. The three approaches were highly correlated with one another for psychopathy (<italic>r</italic>s = .73 to .98) and APD (<italic>r</italic>s = .81 to .97). Rates of age-related decline were also very similar across FFM psychopathy scores (βs = −0.33 to −0.45). Because results from all three FFM profiling approaches were comparable, results from only the criterion-translation approach were used (results from the other approaches are available from the first author). There were two reasons for choosing the criteria-translation approach: First, it is the only approach that has been used for Factor 1 and Factor 2, and second, it has the most fidelity to the PCL and APD criteria.</p>

<title>Age-related predictions and sex as a moderator</title>
<p>The FFM-based scores for psychopathy, APD, Factor 1, and Factor 2 were examined as a function of age and sex using multiple regression. Linear and curvilinear trends for age were examined using hierarchical regression analyses. FFM scores were also regressed onto an Age × Sex interaction term (at Step 2, after sex and age were entered at Step 1) to investigate whether sex moderated the relation between age and disorder count. Of four hierarchical regression analyses used to investigate linear and curvilinear trends for age, all yielded a significant linear trend in Step 1—psychopathy: β = −0.816, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.060, <italic>t</italic>(1) = −13.54, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; APD: β = −0.802, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.048, <italic>t</italic>(1) = −16.66, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; Factor 1: β = −0.074, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.023, <italic>t</italic>(1) = −3.24, <italic>p</italic> = .001; Factor 2: β = −0.742, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.047, <italic>t</italic>(1) = −15.77, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. With regard to curvilinear trends, three hierarchical regression analyses yielded a significant quadratic trend in Step 2 (<italic>t</italic>s &gt; 3.33, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .01), and none a significant cubic trend in Step 3. Compared with the predictive contribution of the linear trends (mean <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = .14), however, the predictive contribution of the significant quadratic terms was low (mean Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &lt; .01), and these terms failed to reach significance once the alpha was corrected for multiple comparisons. Furthermore, of four hierarchical regression analyses used to investigate whether sex moderated the relationship between age and disorder count, none were statistically significant.</p>

<title>Prevalence rates for psychopathy and APD</title>
<p>To compare FFM scores for psychopathy and APD with observed prevalence rates for these disorders across the life span, cutoff values were used to dichotomize the FFM psychopathy and FFM APD scores into presence/absence variables. If FFM-based measures were intended for diagnostic purposes, cutoff scores would be selected to optimize sensitivity and specificity with respect to known groups with and without the PDs, and it is probable that very few cases would be identified in this volunteer sample. However, in this study, our intention was to determine whether age changes in trait configurations parallel age changes in diagnostic status. We therefore chose cutoff values that produced prevalence rates for the youngest group (aged 16–20) that matched the observed prevalence rates in prison samples of the same age for psychopathy (approximately 35%) and APD (approximately 65%), allowing for a comparison of slopes across age not differentially affected by floor effects. To compare the age-related decline of predicted and observed prevalence rates for each disorder, unstandardized slopes of prevalence rates regressed on age were compared using <italic>t</italic> tests.</p>
<p>FFM-predicted rates of prevalence for psychopathy and APD across age are displayed with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612460249">Harpur and Hare’s (1994)</xref> observed rates of prevalence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612460249">Figure 1</xref>. The unstandardized slope for FFM-psychopathy prevalence rates (β = −0.0077) was significantly steeper than the unstandardized slope for observed psychopathy-prevalence rates (β = −0.0044), <italic>t</italic>(1977) = 93.07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. In contrast, the unstandardized slope for FFM APD-prevalence rates (β = −0.0128) was significantly less steep than the unstandardized slope for the observed APD-prevalence rates (β = −0.0134), <italic>t</italic>(1977) = 16.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. In terms of the magnitude of these effects, however, the difference in slopes was quite small. Specifically, the prevalence-rate decrease per decade was 7.7% for FFM psychopathy versus 4.3% for observed psychopathy and 12.8% for FFM APD versus 13.4% for observed APD.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study is the first to suggest that age-related differences in the prevalence of PDs can be predicted on the basis of basic trait information. The results of this study reveal that personality-trait information not only predicts the rate of decline for psychopathy over the life span, but also discriminates the decline of psychopathy from that of APD and accurately predicts the differential decline of psychopathy subfactors. Furthermore, trait predictions were not moderated by sex and were invariant across profiling approaches. Although the predicted rates of decline for psychopathy were somewhat steeper than observed rates of psychopathy determined using the PCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612460249">Harpur &amp; Hare, 1994</xref>), this difference was expected, given that the PCL assessment included a thorough file review. That is, much of the historical data contained in a prisoner’s file (e.g., criminal record, statements from victims, police reports) is “sticky,” in that it continues to inflate a PCL score long after the prisoner’s crimes have been committed. Given the nature of PCL assessment, one would therefore expect PCL scores to decline somewhat less rapidly across age. The results of our study provide evidence for this hypothesis, in that they show extremely small differences between predicted and observed APD, small differences between predicted and observed F1 and F2, and a moderate difference between predicted and observed psychopathy.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to our investigation, and several areas for future research are worth noting. First, the life-span trends developed here are based on a series of connected cohorts; thus, age-related trends may be attributable to age-cohort differences rather than to true developmental trends. This is not a serious concern, however, because the goal of our investigation was not to attribute age-related trends to natural developmental processes but rather to provide evidence that age-related differences in disorders are mirrored by age-related differences in the basic traits that characterize these disorders. Second, the sample overrepresents young, intelligent Caucasians of above-average socioeconomic status, and only selected sections of the United States were represented. However, using normative trait changes in young, intelligent, and affluent noncriminal Caucasians to predict age-related differences in the psychopathic features of a prison population only provides a more stringent test of our hypotheses. Third, the study is limited in that it used traits to predict age-related changes in the prevalence of APD, a disorder that has subsequently been redefined; future research should examine the prevalence of APD as defined by the text revision of the <italic>DSM–IV</italic> (or the <italic>DSM</italic>–5) across the life span and test whether trait predictions approximate age-related differences in these observed rates.</p>
<p>Previous research has suggested that underlying traits are responsible for the stability of PDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797612460249">Warner et al., 2004</xref>), that PDs are comorbid to the extent that they represent overlapping constellations of traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612460249">Lynam &amp; Widiger, 2001</xref>), and that sex differences in PD prevalence can be predicted from a trait perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797612460249">Lynam &amp; Widiger, 2007</xref>). This study used normative changes in the absolute levels of basic traits to re-create age-related differences in the prevalence of PDs, adding to a literature suggesting that basic traits provide a parsimonious account of the epidemiologic facts surrounding PDs.</p>
