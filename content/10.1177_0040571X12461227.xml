<p>This brief essay offers an analysis of the history, current status and possible future directions of the emerging field of ecotheology based on an ecotheology colloquium meeting in San Francisco in November 2011. The essay ends with the hope that Christian animism – the vision of a shared and verdant Earth saturated with divine presence – can religiously charge transformative responses to the crisis of unsustainable living today.</p>

<body>
<p>At the suggestion of Whitney Bauman, Ernst Conradie and Heather Eaton, I was recently invited to join an ad hoc group of theologians meeting in San Francisco for the American Academy of Religion Ecotheology Colloquium on 16–17 November 2011. I am grateful to Whitney et al. for their hard work and commitment in making this colloquium a reality. Our charge at this meeting was to map the contours of the evolving field of ecotheology and suggest new areas of development. In that vein, I then met with a subgroup of the larger group, consisting of Heather, Simon Appolloni, Norman Wirzba and John Grim. As a response to the group’s charge our subgroup drew a large graphic of the ecotheological discipline; we called it the ‘river poster’, using an earth-and-river-and-sky landscape aesthetic to articulate visually the basic sources, themes and new directions of the nascent discipline of ecotheology.</p>
<p>Our group, in sum, analysed the ecotheological field as functioning according to the baseline scientific realities of deep geological time and anthropogenic climate change, on the one hand, and with reference to basic religious studies disciplines such as liberation theology, postcolonial biblical studies and community-based pastoral theology, on the other. The problem of religion and science focused much of our discussion around the question, ‘What is the mission of ecotheology in an objectively apocalyptic situation in which the planet is teetering on the edge of disaster, where “unstoppable tipping points” are transforming the natural world into a “totally different planet”?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040571X12461227">1</xref></sup> The spectre of global warming – the trapping in Earth’s atmosphere of greenhouse gases such as CO<sub>2</sub> from car and power plant emissions – has been well documented, for example, by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040571X12461227">2</xref></sup> While Earth’s temperature rose by one degree Fahrenheit last century, the panel’s current predictions are that global temperatures are now rising by three to ten degrees this century, resulting in the widespread melting of Artic sea ice, mountain glaciers and perhaps even the Greenland landmass itself. This mass melting could then raise sea levels, astonishingly, by one-to-two feet or more, causing flood plain countries, such as Bangladesh, to suffer chronic flooding and low-lying island chains, such as the Maldives, to eventually slip under water.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040571X12461227">3</xref></sup> Our group discussed that while science can analyse record climate change since the industrial revolution (for example, that eleven of the last twelve years rank among the twelve warmest years of global temperature since 1850), science cannot provide the necessary moral foundation for answering the existential questions as to what difference does it make whether our children or grandchildren survive the killer weather human beings’ collective carbon dumping is destined to cause and why we should care about future generations at all. Science cannot answer these questions; only a transcendental value-system centred on higher goods, such as ecotheology, can provide the answers. While many scientists themselves are motivated by moral and even religious concerns, science as such is not a moral or religious enterprise. Science cannot say – as the religions of Abraham claim – that the natural world is God’s creation, intricately designed for the sustenance and joy of all beings, and therefore humans are called upon to restrain their appetites in order to love and care for their planet home. In particular, science cannot assert, as ecotheology can, that the Earth is sacred and therefore deserving of our protection. The claim of ecotheology is that without such an all-encompassing, hyper-moral claim the prospects for saving the planet are slim indeed. Thus, our group articulated the mission of ecotheology accordingly: to reshape human beings’ attitudes of indifference to the natural world by recovering the core biblical conviction that God’s creation is sacred land – holy ground – deserving of our love and protection.</p>
<p>At the convergence, then, of climate science and Earth-centred theology, one of the more promising new directions of ecotheology, in my judgement, is the emergence of ‘new animism’ as a potent resource for land-based Christian theology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040571X12461227">4</xref></sup> The intersection of Christian studies and new animism flows directly from the emphasis on sacred land as the primary ground tone of ecotheology. Recent work in first peoples anthropology and comparative religious studies highlights how indigenous peoples celebrated, and continue to celebrate, relations with other-than-human communities of beings that are alive with spirit, voice, emotion, desire and personhood. The ascription of personhood to all things locates humans in a wider fraternity of relationships that includes ‘bear persons’ and ‘rock persons’ along with ‘human persons’. The animist reimagining of the world as a family of spirit-filled beings is both a rebuttal of the classical Western antagonism between living mind and dead matter and an empowering vision of new models of relationship between human beings and the wider community of non-human beings.</p>
<p>I conclude, then, with four questions about the future of ecotheology vis-à-vis new animism studies.
<list id="list1-0040571X12461227" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Is the term ‘animism’ an appropriate description of how first peoples have experienced and continue to experience the world as a community of living relationships? The term has its origin in nineteenth-century evolutionary studies of religion and carries pejorative baggage as a colonial description of the out-moded folkways of ‘primitive’ peoples. In the light of its prejudicial origins, is animism an apt term for analysing early forms of human–nature intersubjectivity that are relevant to today?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Animism specifies how spirit (so the Latin term <italic>anima</italic>) imbues all things, making everything alive and, in some formulations, sacred. This model of pan-spirit-ism is resonant with, and distinct from, the conviction of Western, book-based religions, such as Christianity, that divine Spirit interanimates all of creation. Can, then, animism and Christian faith be so reconceived that both modes of expression are on productive speaking terms with one another?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Animism appears biblically rooted. Continuing on the theme of S/spirit, the Holy Spirit in the biblical witness consistently appears as a fleshy, avian life-form – a dove – who is God’s birthing and nurturing presence in creation. The mother Spirit Bird in the opening creation song of Genesis, like a giant hen sitting on her cosmic nest egg, broods over the planet and brings all things into life and fruition. In turn, this same hovering Spirit Bird, as a dove that alights on Jesus as he comes up through the waters of baptism, appears in all four of the Gospels to signal God’s approval of Jesus’ public work. This winged, feathered God actualizes an Earth-based communion in which all beings are filled with divine presence, Heaven and Earth are unified, and God and the animal world are one (Gen. 1.1–2; Matt. 3.13–17; Mark 1.9–11; Luke 3.21–22; John 1.29–34). We know God as human in Jesus, but is God also animal in the Spirit?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040571X12461227">5</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Today the human community is careering toward ecological degradation on a massive global scale through its inability, <italic>inter alia</italic>, to develop alternative forms of energy usage. The dependence of developed societies on non-renewable fossil fuels is the primary driver of the global climate changes and massive species extinctions that now characterize planetary existence. Animism reimagines human beings’ fundamental relations with the more-than-human-world in kinship rather than exploitative terms. Can this world-view redirect human communities away from dysfunctional economic policies and toward a renewable energy future?</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>I hope to meet again soon with my ecotheology colleagues to discuss new directions for our fledgling discipline. In particular, I am interested in asking whether Christianity, reconceived in biblical-animist terms, can rekindle new modes of human–nature interactivity that consist of interspecies respect, even love, between spirit-filled co-participants in a unified life-web? Can Christian animism re-enchant the world as a common living space where all beings are bound together in a shared passion for their mutual health and well-being?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040571X12461227">6</xref></sup></p>
