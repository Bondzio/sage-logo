<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Competency mapping is a comprehensive and integrated human resource management system and plays a very significant role for training and development. The study explains the methodology of assessing training needs with the help of competency mapping.</p>
<p>A competency dictionary using the role-based methodology has been prepared by the company in which the technical and behavioural competencies required by the middle-level managers are described. The competencies have been explained placing emphasis on the variation in roles in the role set and the hierarchy. This study has special reference to the identification of training needs of middle-level managers. The levels of behaviours for each behavioural competency based on the competency dictionary are compared with the desired levels of behaviour. The actual level of behaviour exhibited by the middle-level managers in their current work situation is identified, the gaps between the actual level of behaviour exhibited and the desired level of behaviour is analyzed using data from the relevant role holders. The training method which suits the present working environment of the middle-level managers is suggested which helps in bridging the training gaps.</p>

<title>Competency and Its Importance in Organizations</title>
<p>Competencies are the behavioural attributes in individuals required to perform a role effectively. Boyatzis (1982) defines competency as the underlying characteristic of a person which may represent Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes (KSAs) required to perform a role effectively (Rowe, 1995). Spencer and Spencer (1993) define competency as an underlying characteristic of an individual that is causally related to criterion referenced effective and/or superior performance in a given job or situation. An underlying characteristic of an individual is referred to as a deep and enduring part of an individual’s personality, which is manifested as relevant behaviour in different contexts. ‘Criterion referenced’ means that the underlying characteristic must predict expected behaviour in a particular context and must be able to be differentiated as superior or poor performance (Spencer and Spencer, 2003). Thus it can be asserted that manifestations of individual behaviour must have contextual relevance and must be able to be differentiated as of appropriate nature pertaining to the expected standards. The identified competencies can then form inputs for all the HR subsystems like recruitment, selection, job evaluation, training and performance management.</p>
<p>Parry (1998) in the Project Management Development framework, defines competency as a cluster of related knowledge, attitudes, skills and personal characteristics that affects a major component of one’s job which correlates with the performance on the job, which can be measured against well-accepted standards and can be improved via training and development. The competencies are of the nature of human, functional, behavioural, managerial, threshold and meta competencies. These different types of competencies are unique to an organizational context and specifically very unique to the context of job or a role. These competencies capture the variations in different roles accommodating the expectations each of the roles has from the stakeholders of the job with specific emphasis on the relevant context.</p>
<p>Competency mapping helps in determining the gaps between the actual and the desired levels of performance of an individual and is highly beneficial in assisting employees to contribute significantly to their jobs by presenting a clear picture of what gaps exist between the required and actual competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0258042X13484834">Brophy and Kiely, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Competency-based Training</title>
<p>All the HR functions revolve around the performance criteria and the performance of individuals is gauged against each of these criteria to make decisions regarding different HR functions like training, career development, compensation, etc. There are a number of ways by which performance management is carried out in organizations of which the three popular approaches are the job-focused approach, the person-focused approach and the role-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0258042X13484834">Holmes and Joyce, 1993</xref>). The job-focused approach works on identifying key tasks of a job and considers the jobholder separate from the job. It is assumed that the individual has to fit into the job characteristics. The person-focused approach believes that an individual is essential to transform a job into reality and considers an individual’s performance in terms of one’s personality, values, motivation, etc., important for a job. Here competencies of a general nature are in consideration and these are distinct from the task-specific competencies related to the job-focused approach. For instance, let us consider the ability to input data into a computer with respect to that of transforming data from one form into another. The first one is a micro competency having reference only to a specific sphere whereas the second one is a macro competency having a broader perspective and a larger transferability and application. It has been emphasized that these macro competencies are dynamic and are instrumental in enabling individuals to perform their specific tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0258042X13484834">Mansfield, 1999</xref>). The role-based approach is an extension of the person-based approach which encapsulates the context of the job. The context here refers to the situation at hand and the mutual expectations of the related role set members. The very virtue of emphasizing on the context makes this approach a more useful approach compared to the other two approaches. The role-based approach to performance management is an effective measure for which competency frameworks can serve as important means to design training needs which provide important measures of behavioural outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0258042X13484834">Boyatsis, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0258042X13484834">Burgoyne, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0258042X13484834">Caird, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0258042X13484834">Eyre and Smallman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0258042X13484834">McKenna, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Competency-based approaches have been very effective in serving as a growing link between organizations’ business strategy and human resource strategy (Boam and Sparrow, 1992; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0258042X13484834">Bowman and Wilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0258042X13484834">Hefferman and Flood, 2000</xref>). Brophy and Klely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0258042X13484834">2002</xref>) contend that competency-based approaches are considered at the heart of all approaches since they provide a framework that can develop tools and techniques designed to improve performance in a change-oriented organizational context.</p>
<p>Organizational competencies are unique and generally should not be capable of being duplicated. Sustenance of competitive advantage is possible only through the firm’s ability to accumulate and maintain unique resources effectively and efficiently relative to its competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0258042X13484834">Mahoney and Pandian, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0258042X13484834">Prahalad and Hamel, 1990</xref>). They should not have close substitutes to offer durable economic benefits to the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0258042X13484834">Barney, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0258042X13484834">Dierickx and Cool, 1989</xref>). Researchers assert that this can be achieved only by building these capabilities in the workforce through effective HR practices. Hence an investment in organization-specific human capital through adequate HR measures is economically warranted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0258042X13484834">Jovanovic, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0258042X13484834">MacDuffie and Kochan, 1991</xref>). Benefits of firm-specific capabilities accrue over and above the firm’s investment to build and retain them by their distinct advantages and productive capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0258042X13484834">Wright and Snell, 1991</xref>) like selection and socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0258042X13484834">Wanous, 1992</xref>), staffing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0258042X13484834">Olian and Rynes, 1984</xref>), developmental performance appraisal and firm-specific training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0258042X13484834">Becker, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0258042X13484834">Latham and Wexley, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0258042X13484834">MacDuffie and Kochan, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Among the various efforts to develop firm-specific capabilities, training and development activities are central to the reality of anything that can be realistically termed human resource management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0258042X13484834">Keep, 1991</xref>). It is stressed that an organization cannot commit to develop itself unless training and development is firmly based in the strategic management paradigm based on three important assumptions: training to be seen as an investment opportunity, a mechanism for distributing resources for strategic planning and a means to bind the interests of the individuals and the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0258042X13484834">Taylor, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Training is the most important function that directly contributes to the development of human resources. If human resources have to be developed, the organization should incorporate effective training that would create conditions in which people would acquire new knowledge and skills and develop healthy patterns of behaviour and styles. The training imparted should be such that it starts from changing attitudes, passes through improvement in knowledge and ends with the development of skills among the trainees. ‘Training consists largely of well-organized opportunities for participants to acquire, necessary understanding and skills. The whole training process is separated under pre-training, training and post-training phase’ (Lynton and Pareek, 1967).</p>
<p>Pre-training refers to the training needs assessment phase. It is the most critical activity and the base for the whole training and development process. It is the means to find out who needs training, what kind of training is needed, when and where training is needed and so on. ‘Training need is the gap between what is going on now and what should go on. It is the gap between the present level of performance and the standard level of performance of the job’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0258042X13484834">Singh and Pirera, 1990</xref>). The needs identification process assists trainers in making sure that they have matched a training programme to a training problem.</p>

</fig>
<p>Whenever the systematic training model is bound with the crafted strategy, the core competence of the organization is sustained. The success of any training strategy resides in the systematic approach adopted by organizations in assessing training needs. Training Needs Analysis (TNA) is an important strategic process by which an organization determines how to develop and maintain its core competence. Boydell (1976) proposed that TNA should be based on organizational objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0258042X13484834">Palmer, 2006</xref>) and it is necessary to go in for a systematic methodology with relevant focus on the strategic drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0258042X13484834">Bee and Bee, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In the traditional model of training, emphasis is placed on the mechanistic approach of adult learning which identifies training needs based on task analysis, which has an inherent drawback of its inability to identify the broader skills necessary to perform the job effectively. In the proactive model of TNA, training strategy is designed to be a part of organizational strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0258042X13484834">Anderson, 1994</xref>). In the recent years, the emphasis is on competency-based training which ensures the integration of individual capabilities and organizational core competencies. Such a framework, being a very effective tool, binds HRD with organizational strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0258042X13484834">Le Deist and Winterton, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Competency frameworks are highly beneficial in that they assist employees to contribute significantly to their development by presenting a clear picture of what gaps exist between the required and actual competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0258042X13484834">Brophy and Kiely, 2002</xref>). In this regard, a number of studies have emphasized the three-step model of TNA, namely the Organizational, Job and Person (OJP) Analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0258042X13484834">Goldstein et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0258042X13484834">Leigh et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0258042X13484834">McGhee and Thayer, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0258042X13484834">Rummler and Brache, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0258042X13484834">Taylor, O’Driscoll and Binning, 1998</xref>). The OJP model considers an integration of the analysis at all these levels which would be supported adequately by the competency framework designed for the organization (Eerde, 2008). Rummler and Brache (1995) argue that while 80 per cent of the performance improvement methodologies may be sorted out by system and process improvements, the rest of the 20 per cent is attributed to the competency area and an effective TNA addresses training by highlighting the competency factors affecting the performance of individuals.</p>

<title>Objectives of the Study</title>
<p>The research uses the competency methodology in identifying the training needs of middle-level managers. The study helps in identifying the gaps between the actual level of behaviour and the desired level of behaviour of the middle-level managers and discusses the training methods which would suit their present working environment for bridging those gaps. It also helps in forming the individual mapping for middle-level managers which would help the organization in determining succession planning and charting out career paths for the executives.</p>
<p>The main objectives of the study are:
<list id="list1-0258042X13484834" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>To identify training needs for middle-level managers with reference to competencies identified.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To identify the training methods for the gaps identified and charting out an ideal methodology to identify the training needs in an organization.</p></list-item>

<sec id="section5-0258042X13484834" sec-type="methods">
<title>Research Methodology and Instrumentation</title>
<p>The research adopted collection of data using both primary and secondary sources. Primary data was collected using a detailed questionnaire administered to the middle-level managers and by using various unstructured interviews with the respondents and the HR staff of the company. The secondary data was collected from the competency dictionary of the company, the training needs assessment documents and training calendar of the company. Sampling methodology adopted was stratified proportionate sampling across job grades of 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the organization.</p>
<p>The questionnaire presented items eliciting information regarding the respondents’ impression towards training and its contribution to the organization, their ranking of attributes related to the trainer in the order of importance and training methods considered by them as appropriate means for training. In addition to this information, the questionnaire seeks respondents to mention the most appropriate condition at the current work situation, which has among those the various levels of the 24 competencies listed for the middle-level managers. Among those different levels of competencies listed, the most ideal one is identified as per the competency dictionary of the organization. In this way, when the respondent mentions the actual level of his/her contribution at work, there can be a comparison with the desired one, which can provide information about the training needs of the individuals across different grades. A consolidation of various needs in the various competencies, which when integrated, would design training sessions using appropriate learning methods.</p>
<p>The unstructured interview with the managers identified finer elements aiding schedule of training sessions, feedback of past training assessment methods and the qualifications of the trainer. Interaction with HR managers aided in clarifying the experiences of conducting previous assessment sessions and provided inputs to better the forthcoming sessions.</p>

<p>The study undertook to identify the training needs of managers at each of the 4 grades (Grades 4, 5, 6 and 7). Among the options provided under each of the categories of competencies desired, one of them was the desired/expected competency at a particular grade (as per the competency document of the organization).</p>
<p>Examples of few competencies with their levels of behaviour are as follows:</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0258042X13484834">
<title>Flexibility</title>
<p>Level 1: Prefers to work with the resources available and applies standard strategies.</p>
<p>Level 2: Adjusts behaviour and work methods in response to management priorities, multiple demands, changing conditions and unexpected obstacles.</p>
<p>Level 3: Adapts himself to any changes in the organization.</p>
<p>Level 4: Remains open to new ideas and implements new strategies as required by the situation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0258042X13484834">
<title>Change Management</title>
<p>Level 1: Is comfortable with the current level of working and resorts to maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>Level 2: Adapts himself to certain minor changes in the work environment.</p>
<p>Level 3: Acts as a catalyst and champion of change and develops a favourable attitude towards it.</p>
<p>Level 4: Creates an environment that encourages, recognizes and develops favourable attitude of others towards change.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, respondents selected the most appropriate behaviour depicting their contribution at work from among the different levels of each of the 24 competencies identified in the competency dictionary. For instance, let us consider ‘Strategic Planning’, which is defined under four levels. Level 4 represents the most desired level of behaviour expected from the middle-level managers which expect them to formulate strategic policies and plans which leads to competitive advantage. Forty eight per cent of the Grade 4 managers exhibited Level 3 behaviours which means that they develop plans and objectives in line with long goals of the organization, whereas 24 per cent and 4 per cent of them exhibited Level 2 and Level 1 behaviours, namely ‘plan for effective strategies in line with the short term goals of the organization’ and ‘react to the situations as they occur in the organization’.</p>
<p>The same methodology was followed for the other 23 competencies identified and the nature of discrepancies was identified. Apart from analyzing the levels of behaviour for every competency, the training method which suits the working environment was suggested for bridging the training gaps. For ease of conduct of the sessions and the design of the programme, relevant competencies were identified and clubbed with appropriate ones and appropriate training methods were identified so as to meaningfully contribute to the process.</p>
<p>The study also facilitated the design of a good training assessment model using the competency methodology presented, which can be used as an effective model in organizations.</p>

<sec id="section8-0258042X13484834">
<title>Analysis and Recommendations</title>
<p>For finding the training needs for competencies, the related levels of behaviour of different competencies (as listed in questionnaire in Appendix 1) were taken together and a common training need and training methods were suggested for those competencies. Given below is the combination of different levels of behaviours of different competencies:
<list id="list2-0258042X13484834" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The desired levels of behaviour of flexibility and change management were combined together.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The desired level of behaviour of organizational awareness was combined with the desired level of behaviour of problem-solving.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The desired levels of behaviours of competencies like communication and negotiation skills were combined together.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The related levels of behaviours of supervision, developing skills, decision-making skills and mentoring and coaching were combined together so that a common training programme could be imparted which could lead to the desired level of behaviours of these competencies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The desired level of behaviours of customer service and information-seeking were combined together so that managers who do not follow these behaviours could be imparted training.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In addition to finding the training needs for different competencies, the training methods like on the job training, group discussions and brainstorming sessions, in-basket exercises and simulation games were given much preference for bridging the gaps and achieving the desired level of behaviour.</p>
<p>For a training programme, trainer and training methods were considered very important and for a trainer, knowledge of the subject and communication skills were given priority. Various job-related professional activities like management development programmes and workshops conducted inside or outside the organization were considered very important.</p>
<p>The recommendations were given on the basis of different levels of competencies being combined in the findings. The training methods were recommended based on the needs of every competency in terms of KSAs.</p>
<list id="list3-0258042X13484834" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>For achieving the desired level of behaviour of flexibility and change management, management games, role-plays and simulation exercises to be conducted as they help in moulding the behaviour and attitude towards change. Brainstorming sessions and group exercises would also help in achieving the desired level of behaviour of both the competencies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For achieving the desired level of behaviour of organizational awareness and problem-solving, knowledge regarding the effective use of the processes and principles for resource allocation, acquisition and management and giving little authority for decision-making and problem-solving helps in achieving the desired level of behaviour of organizational awareness. Once the long-term problems are understood, facilitating with analytical tools and imparting skill-training for their proper usage helps in following standardization which represents the desired level of behaviour of problem-solving.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Role-plays and situation-based exercises help in achieving the desired level of behaviour for communication and negotiation skills, as both the parties apart from listening to each other and thinking for their own benefit, also encourage open communication and exchange of ideas, which leads to mutual benefit.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fine-tuning the whole system of communication helps in enhancing relationship-building skills as it helps not only in building good trustworthy relationships but also in making the communication convenient between the employees regarding their work or personal matters.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Role-plays and simulation exercises help in achieving the desired level of behaviour of customer service. They also help in becoming proactive and knowing the underlying issues and giving appropriate feedback.

<title>Competency-based Training Needs Assessment Model</title>
<p>Based on the above study, the following is a model suggested to assess training needs using the competency mapping methodology. The study suggests the adoption of the Organizational-Job-Person (OJP) analysis in assessing training needs.</p>
<sec id="section10-0258042X13484834">
<title>Organizational Analysis</title>
<p>Training as a sub-function of the organization has to essentially draw its inputs from the organization and deliver results to the organization. If the deliverables of the function have to be significant, a thorough analysis has to be made to understand the strategic perspectives of the organization, its priorities and its key result areas. This analysis would present a variety of training needs required at organizational, group and individual levels. The sources of organizational analysis can be mission and vision, goals and objectives of the organization, manpower plan, skill pool present in the organization, technological changes, reflections of the organizational climate, new strategic initiatives, employee surveys and stakeholder feedback. In addition to acquiring information about the organizational requirements, determination of training climate, internal and external constraints is essential and a thorough resource analysis should be conducted as it helps in analyzing the human, physical and financial resources available in the organization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0258042X13484834">
<title>Job Analysis</title>
<p>Job analysis identifies the important tasks and responsibilities required for performing a job. In addition to identification of performance standards for a job, it also determines what kind of conditions the employee will have to work in, and whether these conditions would be able to accommodate a person. Job descriptions, job specifications, performance standards, job observation and work sampling can pass on a number of insights about job analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0258042X13484834">
<title>Person Analysis</title>
<p>Person analysis is an essential component in training need analysis, which identifies performance levels of individuals across components of knowledge, skills and attitudes to perform well in the job. In this regard, competency framework helps in identifying various KSAs in terms of behavioural manifestations, which need to be exhibited in a specific role in a given context. The technical and behavioural competencies identified from the competency dictionary and the actual levels of behaviours exhibited by the employees in their current work situation can be compared to chart out a clear picture of training needs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0258042X13484834">
<title>Criticality/Priority Analysis</title>
<p>The next step after the OJP analysis is the prioritization of training needs on the basis of their importance, frequency and urgency in the job along with factors like cost, time and extent of training. The training needs for particular competencies should be based on the importance given to each competency for a particular job or role which would lead to the achievement of organizational goals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0258042X13484834">
<title>Requirement Analysis</title>
<p>This step mainly deals with who, when, where and what of training. The trainees and trainers have to be selected with a clear mention of training schedules with the duration, location and the dates of training requirements, thus describing the basic elements that must be in place for the assessment procedure to be carried out properly. The training programme has to be meticulously designed, keeping in mind learning methods like motivation, active involvement, individual approach, sequence and structure, feedback and transfer to be incorporated in the same. The whole process thus results in the fulfilment of training objectives like ‘who needs training’, ‘what type of training is needed’ and ‘by whom’. Improving the gaps identified leads to individual’s development, thus increasing organizational productivity.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0258042X13484834" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The experience at the organization in assessing the training needs has been articulated, which can be considered as an effective model for analyzing training needs. Assessment of training needs through competency mapping helps in identifying the key competencies required for a particular job or role and it identifies the training gap between the actual level of behaviour exhibited on the job and the desired level of behaviour expected by the organization from an individual. Thus competency mapping serves as a common language in integrating all the HR functions like recruitment, training and development, and performance appraisal.</p>
