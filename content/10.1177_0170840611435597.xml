<abstract>
<p>This paper argues that learning in cross-race interactions is critical for work teams to realize performance benefits from racial diversity but that diversity is a liability when society’s negative stereotypes about racial minorities’ competence inhibit such interactions. We analyze two years of data from 496 retail bank branches to investigate racial asymmetries in the dynamics of team learning and their impact on the link between diversity and bottom-line performance. As expected, minorities’ negative assessments of their team’s learning environment precipitate a negative relationship between diversity and performance, irrespective of White teammates’ assessments; only when both groups view the team’s learning environment as supportive—implying that the team has successfully countered the negative effects of societal stereotypes on cross-race learning—is the relationship positive. We conclude that acknowledging the impact of societal asymmetries between racial groups, especially in regard to learning, can reorient research about the link between identity-group-based diversity and performance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The link between a team’s demographic diversity and its performance is neither simple nor direct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0170840611435597">Kochan et al., 2003</xref>; for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0170840611435597">Jackson &amp; Joshi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0170840611435597">van Knippenberg &amp; Schippers, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0170840611435597">Williams &amp; O’Reilly, 1998</xref>). Research shows both that demographically diverse teams can outperform homogeneous ones by bringing a broader array of knowledge and experience to the work at hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0170840611435597">Cox, Lobel, &amp; McLeod, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0170840611435597">Watson, Kumar, &amp; Michaelsen, 1993</xref>), and that they can underperform vis-à-vis homogeneous teams by experiencing conflicts and communication problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0170840611435597">O’Reilly, Caldwell, &amp; Barnett, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0170840611435597">Pelled, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0170840611435597">Zenger &amp; Lawrence, 1989</xref>). These contradictory findings have prompted researchers to ask a question that better reflects the contingent nature of the diversity–performance link: Under what conditions does demographic diversity in a team enhance or detract from its performance? In this paper we focus on racial diversity—a demographic dimension laden with stereotypes and arguably one of the most polarizing divides in society today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0170840611435597">Collins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0170840611435597">Omi &amp; Winant, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0170840611435597">Tomaskovic-Devey, et al. 2006</xref>)—and show how its effects are conditional on the way such stereotypes play out in teams.</p>
<p>We propose that whether a team’s racial diversity becomes an asset or a liability depends on the interplay of two potentially incompatible factors: learning among team members and negative society-wide stereotypes about racial minority groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0170840611435597">1</xref></sup> Our argument holds that learning behaviors, defined as interpersonally risky interactions that expand the range of options a team considers when seeking to improve its performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0170840611435597">Edmondson, 1999</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0170840611435597">Huber, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0170840611435597">Nemeth, 1986</xref>), are key to leveraging racial diversity, but that racial stereotypes can create racial asymmetries in team members’ comfort with learning. Racial minority team members may encounter and, importantly, fear encountering prejudicial stereotypes about their competence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0170840611435597">Ragins, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0170840611435597">Steele, Spencer, &amp; Aronson, 2002</xref>) and for this reason avoid the risk of engaging in learning behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0170840611435597">Cohen, Steele, &amp; Ross, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840611435597">Harber, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0170840611435597">Swann, Polzer, Seyle, &amp; Ko, 2004</xref>, p. 22; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0170840611435597">Xin, 1997</xref>), whereas Whites may or may not engage in learning behaviors, but they are unlikely to interpret their experiences in this regard as having to do with race. While these racial dynamics are likely to be the norm, teams can counter them, and thus racially diverse teams vary in the extent to which racial stereotypes in the wider society inhibit learning behaviors. We suggest that racial patterns in members’ assessments of how much the team encourages them to share their insights and ideas—the team’s learning environment—are a key factor determining whether higher levels of racial diversity enhance or detract from team performance.</p> <p>We are not the first to have assessed the moderating effects of team conditions on the diversity–performance link, but we differ from previous approaches. We focus exclusively on teams’ racial diversity and use research findings about race relations to inform our predictions, whereas others pursuing a moderator strategy have tended to focus on multiple demographic dimensions, either combining them into a single diversity index (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0170840611435597">Chatman &amp; Flynn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0170840611435597">Chatman, Polzer, Barsade, &amp; Neale, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0170840611435597">Polzer, Milton, &amp; Swann, 2002</xref>) or examining how multiple differences interact, as in research on ‘faultlines’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0170840611435597">Lau &amp; Murnighan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0170840611435597">van Knippenberg &amp; Schippers, 2007</xref>). These approaches typically rely on general theories about difference, a generality that enables researchers to address multiple dimensions of diversity simultaneously, unencumbered by consideration of any particular group’s history or status position in society. Yet the influence of these histories and status positions is worthy of attention in its own right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0170840611435597">DiTomaso, Post, &amp; Parks-Yancy, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611435597">DiTomaso, Post, Smith, Farris, &amp; Cordero, 2007b</xref>), and by focusing exclusively on race—a visible, individually and culturally salient, social category (or ‘master status’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0170840611435597">Hughes, 1945</xref>)—we can home in on how these social-status features may play out in diverse teams. In so doing, we respond to recent calls for workforce diversity research to attend to ‘issues of power and status differences among groups in society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0170840611435597">DiTomaso et al., 2007a</xref>, p. 475).</p>
<p>Research on relational demography has attended to power and status differences by examining asymmetrical effects for Whites and minorities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0170840611435597">Tsui, Egan, &amp; O’Reilly, 1992</xref>), but it focuses on individuals, not teams, as the unit of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0170840611435597">Harrison &amp; Klein, 2007</xref>, p. 1200). Specifically, relational demography research examines how asymmetries between Whites and minorities shape <italic>individuals’ experiences</italic> of their racial group membership, which in turn moderates the effect of an <italic>individual’s racial difference from others</italic> on <italic>individual</italic> outcomes, such as work-related attitudes and behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840611435597">Chattopadhyay, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840611435597">Stewart &amp; Garcia-Prieto, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0170840611435597">Tsui et al., 1992</xref>; for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0170840611435597">Riordan, 2000</xref>). In contrast, we examine how asymmetries between Whites and minorities shape <italic>team dynamics</italic>, which in turn moderate the effect of a <italic>team’s racial diversity</italic> on <italic>team</italic> outcomes, particularly, team performance.</p>
<p>This study investigates how racial symmetries and asymmetries in members’ assessments of the team’s learning environment influence the relationship between racial diversity and team performance, using two years of quantitative data on racial composition, employee attitudes, and team performance in 496 retail bank branches. This dataset is rare in providing the opportunity to examine the impact of racial diversity on bottom-line performance in the field.</p>

<title>Race Relations in Organizations</title>
<p>Our study highlights how race is associated with certain power-status positions in the wider society that affect interactions at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840611435597">Alderfer &amp; Smith, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840611435597">Alderfer &amp; Thomas, 1988</xref>). Few disagree that, in the United States, Whites as a group have higher status and hold more formal organizational and political power than do racial minorities, i.e., people of African, Asian, Native American, and Hispanic descent (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840611435597">Brief, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0170840611435597">Omi &amp; Winant, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0170840611435597">Smith 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0170840611435597">Tomaskovic-Devey et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, much of what is imputed to race is in fact produced by the status that society ascribes to different racial groups (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0170840611435597">Ragins 1997</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0170840611435597">Ridgeway, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0170840611435597">Ridgeway, Boyle, Kuipers, &amp; Robinson, 1998</xref>).</p> <p>Race as a status characteristic is culturally associated with expectations about ability and competence and gives rise to discrimination. Research indicates that racial minorities—especially Blacks and Hispanics—are believed to be less competent, intelligent, and hard-working than their White counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840611435597">Bobo &amp; Kluegel, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0170840611435597">Fox, 2004</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0170840611435597">Gonzales, Blanton, &amp; Williams, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0170840611435597">Ragins, 1997</xref>), whereas Whites are stereotyped as intelligent, successful, and educated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0170840611435597">Blair, 2001</xref>). Both Blacks and Hispanics perceive and experience more race-based discrimination at work relative to Whites (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840611435597">Avery, McKay, &amp; Wilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0170840611435597">Pager &amp; Quillian, 2005</xref>) and trail Whites in earnings and educational attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0170840611435597">US Census Bureau, 2007</xref>). Even Asian Americans, positively stereotyped as hardworking and loyal employees, are seen as less prototypically American than Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0170840611435597">Devos &amp; Banaji, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0170840611435597">Dovidio, Gluszek, John, Ditlmann, &amp; Lagunes, 2010</xref>) and face negative stereotypes of being emotionally reserved and unassertive, and thus lacking leadership skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840611435597">Hyun, 2005</xref>). Asians who speak accented English are rated lower on status-related traits such as competence, education, and intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0170840611435597">Lindemann, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0170840611435597">2005</xref>) and, like their Hispanic counterparts, feel more like outsiders and perceive greater discrimination than do Whites who speak accented English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0170840611435597">Dovidio et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, similar to other racial minorities, Asians in the US often live in poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840611435597">Cheng, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0170840611435597">Kim, 2007</xref>), perceive and experience discrimination in housing, schools, employment, and social relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0170840611435597">Bell, Harrison, &amp; McLaughlin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0170840611435597">Chen, Edwards, Young, &amp; Greenberger, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0170840611435597">Grossman &amp; Liang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0170840611435597">Kim, 2007</xref>), and are subject to hate crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0170840611435597">Kang, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0170840611435597">Kim, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A vast literature attests to the adverse behavioral and psychological effects of being a target of racial prejudice and discrimination, ranging from being fearful about being judged negatively or stereotypically (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0170840611435597">Steele, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0170840611435597">Steele et al., 2002</xref>), to expending energy in interactions to fend off such judgments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0170840611435597">Roberts, 2005</xref>), to engaging in behaviors that confirm them, as in self-fulfilling prophecies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0170840611435597">Chen &amp; Bargh, 1997</xref>). The notion of ‘embedded’ intergroup dynamics further suggests that the unequal distribution of power across racial groups in society affects how members of different racial groups think, feel, and behave at work, even when they occupy equivalent organizational positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840611435597">Alderfer,1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840611435597">Alderfer &amp; Smith, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611435597">DiTomaso et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0170840611435597">Ragins, 1997</xref>).</p> <p>We argue that in order to understand racial diversity in teams, it is necessary to consider the relative power-status position of racial groups in society because that position affects expectations and interactions among team members inside organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0170840611435597">Ridgeway et al., 1998</xref>). In other words, pervasive stereotypes about racial minorities endemic to the larger culture hold sway in organizations by default. Yet local conditions can counter this default orientation, contributing to variability in the effects of race on individual experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840611435597">Deaux &amp; Ethier, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0170840611435597">Ragins, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0170840611435597">Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0170840611435597">West &amp; Fenstermaker, 1995</xref>). This perspective on race suggests that, despite the penetrating force of societal power imbalances, local organizational or team conditions can moderate their impact.</p>

<title>Learning in Racially Diverse Teams</title>
<p>Team-learning behaviors include sharing information and insights, experimenting, seeking and giving feedback, asking questions, and talking about errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0170840611435597">Edmondson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0170840611435597">Van der Vegt &amp; Bunderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0170840611435597">Zarraga &amp; Bonache, 2005</xref>). These behaviors allow teams to detect changes in the environment, learn about customers’ requirements, further members’ collective understanding of a situation, and improve causal reasoning about the consequences of previous actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0170840611435597">Edmondson, 1999</xref>). Despite their advantages, these activities are interpersonally risky, since they may evoke embarrassment, rejection, or punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840611435597">Argyris, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0170840611435597">Edmondson, 1999</xref>). Research on team learning suggests that when members believe the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking, they are more likely to engage in learning behaviors, which enhances team performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0170840611435597">Edmondson, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0170840611435597">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840611435597">Edmondson, Bohmer, &amp; Pisano, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0170840611435597">Zarraga &amp; Bonache, 2005</xref>).

As they note, racial groups’ distinct historical experiences give rise to ‘distinct concerns, corresponding with [their] differences in status,’ such that Whites’ concerns, as the higher status group, center on being perceived as prejudiced by racial minorities, whereas racial minorities’ concerns, as the lower status group, center on being the target of Whites’ prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0170840611435597">Tropp &amp; Pettigrew, 2005</xref>, p. 951).

Members of minority racial groups believe that their errors are likely to reflect negatively on them as individuals and on their race as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840611435597">Catalyst, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840611435597">Alderfer, Alderfer, Tucker, &amp; Tucker, 1980</xref>); that they risk being misunderstood if they open up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840611435597">Bell &amp; Nkomo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0170840611435597">Xin, 1997</xref>); and that their attempts to seek feedback will yield untrustworthy assessments, whether positive or negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0170840611435597">Cohen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840611435597">Harber, 1998</xref>). These race-based concerns may lead racial minorities to avoid engaging in learning behaviors such as talking about errors, sharing information and insights, asking questions, and seeking feedback. Supporting this logic is research suggesting that racial minorities, as low-status group members in society, may be more likely than Whites to withhold information or participate with caution in mixed-race work settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0170840611435597">Hollingshead, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0170840611435597">Wingfield, 2010</xref>). Whites, for their part, may or may not engage in learning behaviors, but they are unlikely to associate what they do in this regard with race.</p>
<p>For example, in a racially diverse team trying to solve a problem, a Black team member may be reluctant to share insights or offer an untested idea—i.e., to engage in a risky learning behavior—because if these contributions were rejected or proven unworthy, he risks confirming a societal stereotype about his racial group being incompetent. A White team member may be similarly reluctant to engage in a risky learning behavior, but his reluctance is not because he is White, since stereotypes of incompetence do not attach to Whites. In short, the Black team member would be <italic>racially</italic> motivated to self-censor whereas the White team member would not. He therefore would be more likely than his White counterpart to view the dynamics surrounding the exchange of work-related ideas as having a racial component; in contrast, this social context would not prompt the White coworker to think of himself in racial terms.</p> <p>We are not saying that Whites have no concerns regarding race, but rather that their particular concern—that they might be perceived as prejudiced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840611435597">Apfelbaum &amp; Sommers, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0170840611435597">Apfelbaum et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0170840611435597">Plant &amp; Devine, 2003</xref>)—is unlikely to influence whether or not they offer a task-related contribution. While research has shown that being in the numerical minority has a negative effect on Whites’ workplace attitudes (such as organizational commitment) and on behavioral correlates of such attitudes (such as turnover intentions and absenteeism) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0170840611435597">Tsui et al., 1992</xref>), this research does not speak to the impact of numerical-minority status on the type of team behaviors relevant to this study, namely, learning behaviors. In fact, some research has shown that when Whites are in the numerical minority they are more, not less, likely to participate in team discussions, because engaging in behavior that is prototypical for Whites—taking up conversational space—counters the potential threat to their status posed by being in a predominantly Black team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840611435597">Stewart &amp; Garcia-Prieto, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, whereas Whites on racially diverse teams may be reluctant to speak up about <italic>racial</italic> matters (due to worries that others may perceive them as prejudiced), being White is unlikely to affect their willingness to speak up about <italic>task</italic> matters (which typically do not concern race).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0170840611435597">2</xref></sup> In short, Whites are less likely than minorities to interpret as race-related any misgivings they may have about engaging in learning behaviors, even in racially diverse teams.</p>

<title>The impact of racial patterns in perceptions of the team’s learning environment on the diversity–performance link</title>
<p>Teams can counter negative racial dynamics, and thus we expect variation in the racial pattern that characterizes members’ perceptions of the learning environment. These patterns, we argue, influence whether racial diversity is an asset or a liability in a team and thus whether it has a positive or negative effect on performance. In short, we posit that the effect of racial diversity on performance depends on both White and minority assessments of the team’s learning environment. Below, we describe four racial patterns in team members’ assessments (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0170840611435597">Table 1</xref>) and explain how each should affect the relationship between racial diversity and performance.</p>

<p>The idea of racial asymmetries informs our hypothesis about the patterns that condition a negative relationship between racial diversity and team performance. Patterns in which racial minorities view the learning environment as unsupportive partly reflect minorities’ distinct concern that their racial group membership may have negative consequences for them. Whites, for their part, may view the learning environment as supportive (pattern 1) or unsupportive (pattern 2), but either way, our approach suggests that, even in racially diverse teams, they are unlikely to make a racial attribution for their assessment because their willingness to contribute their point of view is unrelated to their race. Thus, from a racial perspective, these two patterns are similar in three key respects: minorities view the learning environment as unsupportive, they have a racial interpretation of the team’s learning environment, and Whites do not have such an interpretation. These dynamics around race inhibit mutual learning and sustain an undercurrent, however subterranean, of racial tension in racially diverse teams—tension that emanates from minorities’ negative experiences—ultimately undermining team performance. Thus, when minorities perceive the learning environment as unsupportive, Whites’ perceptions are less consequential for the racial diversity–performance link, making minorities’ perceptions determinative: in teams with patterns where minorities view the learning environment as unsupportive, those with less diversity should have a competitive advantage over those with more because of process losses associated with diversity under these conditions.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Whites and minorities may share the view that the team values and encourages learning (pattern 3), which should result in a positive relationship between diversity and performance. This propitious pattern could arise, for example, when local organizational or team conditions disrupt the default racial dynamic described above by introducing management practices that diminish minorities’ fears of being stereotyped. In teams with this pattern, members feel free, regardless of their race, to provide input on task-related affairs, yielding a performance pay-off to diversity. Thus, in teams where both Whites and minorities perceive the learning environment as supportive, those with greater diversity should have a competitive advantage over those with less.</p>
<p>A final pattern (pattern 4) is characterized by a reversal of conventional racial dynamics—minorities experience the learning environment as supportive and Whites do not. We expect this pattern to arise idiosyncratically or, in any case, not to arise as a function of societal stereotypes about minorities’ competence. Hence, we remain agnostic as to whether or how this pattern will condition the relationship between diversity and performance.</p>
<p>To test these ideas, we offer the following hypothesis:</p>

<title>Data and Methods</title>
<sec id="section7-0170840611435597">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Data come from the retail branches of a leading diversified financial services company, headquartered in a large northeastern US city. The retail branch division services more than 30 million individuals and small businesses concentrated in northeastern urban and suburban areas.</p>
<p>The nature of the retail branches’ work justifies treating them as teams and using the terms ‘branch’ and ‘team’ interchangeably. The work of a branch involves traditional banking services, such as opening and servicing accounts at the request of customers. Each branch operates under the direction of a branch manager supported by one or more assistant branch managers. The branch consists of the managers and two groups of workers, tellers and ‘platform’ employees, who all work interdependently to service the broad financial needs of each client. Tellers, who stand behind counters, execute account transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and currency exchanges. They also are trained to identify opportunities to sell other financial products and thus routinely refer clients to platform employees. Platform employees, who typically sit near the tellers at desks in the branch’s open workspace, create accounts, troubleshoot problems, and often specialize in a particular customer segment or product, for example, small business customers or financial planning. Ideally, deposit account customers will also use the bank’s loan investment services when needed. To promote the desired cross-selling and customer service, the company defines branches as teams, expects employees within a branch to function interdependently as a team, and rewards them collectively for doing so. Employees refer to their branch as their ‘team’ and receive feedback on their branch processes and performance as ‘teams.’ Thus, the branch fits the widely accepted definition of organizational teams as groups that exist within the context of a larger organization, have clear boundaries defining who is and is not a member, and share responsibility for team products or services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840611435597">Alderfer, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0170840611435597">Hackman, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>We collected quantitative, secondary data on all the firm’s retail branches for 2000 and 2001, drawing on three sources: (1) demographic data supplied by the bank’s human resource department on the race, sex, and hierarchical position of each employee in each branch; (2) employee attitude-satisfaction data from an annual survey (with an 87 percent response rate in 2000 and 85 percent in 2001); and (3) year-end branch performance data from the firm’s bonus incentive plan. We constructed a branch-level dataset for the 496 branches with at least one year of data (461 branches in 2000 and 477 branches in 2001). This dataset comprises data from all three sources. Branches ranged in size from four to 66 employees (m = 15.2; SD = 8.7); 91 percent had 25 or fewer employees, and less than 1 percent had over 50 employees.</p>
<p>The bank classified employees in one of five racial groups: White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, or Native American. On average, the branches were 47 percent White, 27 percent Black, 18 percent Hispanic, 8 percent Asian, and less than 1 percent Native American. The relatively high proportion of minorities is a function of branches’ urban locations and the fact that the jobs are relatively low level. Proportion minority in this sample is comparable to other samples from large US financial and service organizations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840611435597">Elvira, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0170840611435597">Elvira &amp; Town, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0170840611435597">Zatzick, Elvira, &amp; Cohen, 2003</xref>). The branches’ racial composition is wide-ranging, including ones that are predominantly Black, Hispanic, Asian, or White, as well as ones with virtually every possible mix of these groups. This feature of the sample overcomes a common limitation in diversity research, in which racial heterogeneity is confounded with the (often low) proportion of minorities (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0170840611435597">van Knippenberg &amp; Schippers, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0170840611435597">Williams &amp; O’Reilly, 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section9-0170840611435597">
<title>Team learning environment</title>
<p>We used four items on the annual employee attitude-satisfaction survey to assess perceptions of a team’s learning environment: (1) ‘My work group has a climate in which diverse perspectives are valued,’ (2) ‘I feel encouraged to come up with new and better ways of doing things,’ (3) ‘My supervisor encourages a diversity of styles and approaches,’ and (4) ‘Sufficient effort is made to get the opinions and thinking of people who work here.’ Employees rated each item on a five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). Principal components factor analysis of the individual-level survey data, followed by varimax rotation, yielded a single factor with loadings between 0.47 and 0.68. We calculated the mean response to the four items for each employee (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.85) and interpreted the score as the individual’s perception of the branch’s learning environment.</p>
<p>This scale relates to learning because the items tap the employee’s perception of how much the branch encourages the employee individually (item 2) and branch employees collectively (items 1, 3, and 4) to engage in learning behaviors, particularly offering and receiving new or different points of view and approaches to the work. This definition is consistent with research suggesting that encouraging input is key to a team’s capacity to learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0170840611435597">Edmondson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840611435597">Edmondson et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>To capture the racial patterning of team members’ perceptions of the branch’s learning environment—the condition we expect to moderate the diversity–performance link—we calculated the mean on the learning environment scale for two subgroups of employees within a branch: White employees and racial minorities (Black, Hispanic, Asian, or Native American). We combined minority groups despite their cultural and historical differences because their shared lower-status racial position in society renders their organizational and employment experiences more similar to each other’s than to Whites’. Thus, two learning environment variables—<italic>Whites’ perception of the learning environment</italic> and <italic>minorities’ perception of the learning environment</italic>—were calculated for each branch. A high score for a racial group indicates that these employees viewed the learning environment as supportive—one that encourages and supports employees to take the risk of speaking up, i.e., to contribute to team learning. We assessed the impact of <italic>racial patterns</italic> in members’ assessments of the team’s learning environment in two ways: first, by examining the interaction between these two branch-level variables, thus, in essence, assessing all possible combinations of White and minority scores; and second, by using these two branch-level variables to categorize branches according to the four patterns identified in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0170840611435597">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>To assess the appropriateness of aggregating data to a larger-unit level—in this case, from the individual to the racial-group-within-branch—requires meeting several criteria. The construct must be conceptually meaningful at the larger unit level, there must be significant within-unit agreement among individual respondents, and there must be significant between-unit differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840611435597">Chan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0170840611435597">Kenny &amp; La Voie, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840611435597">Kozlowski &amp; Klein, 2000</xref>).</p> <p>To establish the learning environment construct as conceptually meaningful at the larger unit (i.e., racial-group-within-branch) level, we must specify its functional relationship to learning environment perceptions at the individual (i.e., employee) level. The individual level involves the meanings an employee attaches to the branch’s learning environment, which originate in his or her experiences, thoughts, and feelings, and are captured by the four-item scale described above. The group level involves the shared assignment of such meanings among members of a racial group (White or minority) within the branch, which converge as a function of the racial group’s shared cultural experiences and its intra- and inter-racial group social interactions in the branch. Hence, the focal construct—a racial group’s perception of the branch’s learning environment—is a shared unit property, and its functional relationship to the construct at the individual level is isomorphic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840611435597">Kozlowski &amp; Klein, 2000</xref>).</p> <p>Statistical analyses further justified our use of racial group means within a branch—the mean for Whites and the mean for minorities—as an aggregation strategy. We calculated two sets of within-group correlations (R<sub>wg</sub>s), one to measure within-branch agreement among Whites and another to measure within-branch agreement among minorities; the average correlation across branches was greater than 0.7 for both, indicating acceptable levels of agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0170840611435597">Klein et al., 2000</xref>). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), used to assess between-branch differences in Whites’ assessments and between-branch differences in minorities’ assessments, were significant at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001 level for both racial groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0170840611435597">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>Racial diversity</title>
<p>We used the index of heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840611435597">Blau, 1977</xref>) to construct a measure of branches’ <italic>racial diversity</italic> based on two racial categories, Whites and racial minorities. We used this binary distinction because it emphasizes differences in racial groups’ status in the wider society, and societal status is the axis of racial group asymmetries that constitute the theoretical building blocks for this paper. As noted above, research suggests that, relative to Whites, members of racial minority groups share lower social status, even if not equivalently low; hence, we again combined racial minorities into a single category. This measure ranges from 0, for homogeneous branches (all White or all minority employees), to 0.5, for branches that are maximally heterogeneous (half White and half minority employees), and was correlated between −0.08 and 0.05 with the proportion of Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American employees in the branch.</p>

<sec id="section11-0170840611435597">
<title>Team performance</title>
<p>Dependent variables were year-end measures of performance, obtained from the firm’s bonus incentive plan, which assessed branch performance in several domains relative to goals set for the branch. Goals were a formulaic function of the branch’s performance in the previous period, adjusted for environmental irregularities, such as staffing shortages or the closing of a nearby branch. The firm’s incentive plan allocated points on the basis of the percentage of goal attainment. Branches that met their goals received a total performance score of 100 points; additional points were awarded to those that exceeded their goals. Points were converted into monetary bonuses distributed to all branch employees.</p>
<p>The key dependent variable is <italic>total performance score</italic>, the total points a branch received across performance domains. As a second dependent variable, we also analyzed its main financial component, <italic>new sales revenue</italic>, measured as percentage of the goal attained. The correlation between the two measures was 0.59.</p>
<p>By using relative indices of performance, we were able to control for much of the variance in performance that stems from differences in the wealth and size of the branches’ service area, since goals were set with these factors in mind. A branch serving a wealthier clientele, for example, would have higher performance goals than one serving a poorer clientele, <italic>ceteris paribus</italic>, and thus, in order to gain equivalent points, would need to achieve similar proportional gains in relation to a higher absolute standard. Gains across branches are therefore comparable.</p>

<p>We pooled the two years of data and conducted regression analyses with robust variance estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0170840611435597">Froot, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0170840611435597">Rogers, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0170840611435597">Wooldridge, 2002</xref>). These variance estimates adjusted for within-branch correlations between years, enabling us to use branch-year as the unit of analysis without violating the regression assumption of uncorrelated error terms.</p>
<p>Before testing for moderated effects of diversity on performance, we assessed the main effects of our three key branch-level variables—Whites’ perception of the learning environment, minorities’ perception of the learning environment, and the racial diversity measure—as well as the two-way interaction effects. Neither diversity nor minorities’ perception of the learning environment exerted a main effect on total performance or on new sales revenue. Whites’ perception of the learning environment, however, was positively related to both performance measures. (See model 1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0170840611435597">Table 3</xref>.) None of the two-way interactions was significant.</p>

<p>We tested our hypothesis that the relationship between racial diversity and team performance depends on the racial pattern in employees’ perceptions of the branch’s learning environment by regressing the performance measures on Whites’ perception of the learning environment, minorities’ perception of the learning environment, and the racial diversity measure; the two- and three-way interactions among these variables; and the control variables. The hypothesized effect is captured in the b-coefficient for the three-way interaction term. That b-coefficient was significant for both total performance and new sales revenue (see model 2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0170840611435597">Table 3</xref>), indicating that together White and minority perceptions of the branch’s learning environment moderate the impact of racial diversity on performance. Moreover, a branch-level measure of learning environment perceptions aggregated across White and minority employees (i.e., learning environment perceptions averaged across all employees in a branch) failed to moderate the effect of racial diversity on performance (results not shown), providing further support for the notion that White and minority perceptions should be measured separately and assessed as joint moderators of the diversity–performance link.</p>
<p>We assessed our hypotheses about the specific nature of this interaction by categorizing branches into the four racial patterns depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0170840611435597">Table 1</xref>—Whites supportive/minorities unsupportive (pattern 1), both groups unsupportive (pattern 2), both groups supportive (pattern 3), and Whites unsupportive/minorities supportive (pattern 4)—and then assessing the relationship between racial diversity and performance for each pattern.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0170840611435597">5</xref></sup> We used two criteria for categorizing branches, median splits and upper/lower quartiles, both of which yielded the same pattern of results. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0170840611435597">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0170840611435597">2</xref> show, this pattern was largely consistent with our predictions. We tested slopes’ significance by regressing each performance measure (total performance and new sales revenue) on the following variables: dummy variables for patterns 1, 3, and 4 (pattern 2—both groups unsupportive—was the base category); the racial diversity measure (which captures the effect of racial heterogeneity for pattern 2); interactions between each dummy variable and the racial heterogeneity measure (which capture the incremental effect of racial heterogeneity for patterns 1, 3, and 4 relative to the effect for pattern 2); and the control variables. Significance tests for the quartile-based analyses (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840611435597">Table 4</xref>) largely supported our contention that (a) racial minorities’ negative assessments of a team’s learning environment drive the negative relationship between racial diversity and performance and (b) both groups’ positive assessments are necessary for a positive relationship. The median-based analyses, although producing a similar pattern of results, failed to reach conventional levels of significance.</p>

Each pattern is a dummy variable equal to 1 for branches characterized by that pattern, 0 otherwise. B-coefficients for the ‘main effects’ of patterns represent intercept shifts; the b-coefficient for the ‘main effect’ of racial diversity represents the relationship between diversity and performance in pattern 2 branches (the base category); b-coefficients for the interactions of racial diversity and pattern 1, 3, and 4 are the incremental effect of diversity on performance in pattern 1, 3, and 4 branches, respectively, relative to the effect of diversity on performance in pattern 2 branches. Criteria for categorization were the upper and lower quartiles of the White and minority learning environment scales.

<p>Specifically, in branches where minorities and Whites both perceived the learning environment as unsupportive, the slope was negative, and this result was significant for the two performance measures, supporting our hypothesis. In fact, the worst-performing branches in the sample were the maximally diverse ones with this pattern. As expected, the slope was also negative in branches where minorities perceived the learning environment as unsupportive and Whites perceived it as supportive, although the effect was significant only for the sales measure. Also supporting our predictions, the slope was positive and significant for total performance when minorities and Whites both considered the learning environment supportive. In fact, the highest-performing branches on the total performance measure were the maximally diverse ones with this pattern. For new sales revenue, however, the slope was essentially flat. Still, it improved significantly relative to the slope in branches where minorities considered the learning environment unsupportive, and diverse branches with this pattern performed better on sales than did diverse branches with any other pattern.</p>
<p>When minorities perceived the learning environment as supportive and Whites did not—the pattern for which we offered no prediction—the slope was essentially flat. This finding is consistent with our contention that this pattern likely arises idiosyncratically.</p>

<sec id="section14-0170840611435597" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We argued that whether diversity is an asset or a liability hinges on a team’s ability to resist the undermining effects on learning of society-wide stereotypes about racial minorities’ competence. Without this ability, the threat of stereotypes reigns, discouraging minorities from engaging in the risk-taking that learning requires, and creating at least an undercurrent of racial tension in the team. No similar dynamic discourages Whites’ inclinations to take such risks. While these asymmetrical experiences are likely to be the norm, teams can counter them, enabling members to participate freely.</p>
<p>This study investigated racial asymmetries in the dynamics of team learning and their impact on the link between racial diversity and bottom-line performance, using two years of data from 496 retail branches of a bank. These asymmetries informed our hypothesis, which was largely confirmed, concerning the conditions that moderate the link between racial diversity and team performance. Specifically, whether a branch’s racial diversity positively or negatively influenced its performance depended on the racial pattern characterizing employees’ assessments of the branch’s learning environment. A graphical representation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0170840611435597">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0170840611435597">2</xref>) indicated that when minorities viewed the learning environment as unsupportive—whether or not Whites did—racial diversity was negatively related to performance. This is not to say that Whites’ assessments of the learning environment had no effect on performance, however. Indeed, when Whites perceived the learning environment as supportive, even though minorities did not, performance across the board increased somewhat—as the upward shift in intercept indicates. Nevertheless, the relationship between diversity and performance remained negative for these latter branches—while the intercept shifted upward, the slope remained negative (although significantly so only for the sales measure). This finding is consistent with the idea that this lack of symmetry between Whites’ and minorities’ experiences of learning produced performance losses from diversity. Interestingly, however, when the asymmetry went the other way—minorities viewed the learning environment as supportive but Whites did not—racial diversity was unrelated to performance (which suffered across the board). Thus, it appears that societal status matters: the negative experiences of racial minorities, as the lower status group, carry disproportionate weight in determining performance losses from diversity.</p>
<p>Finally, when both Whites and minorities viewed the learning environment as supportive, not only was performance enhanced across the board, but greater racial diversity magnified this effect for the total performance measure. What accounts for this magnification? Previous theory suggests that it may result from the greater range of ideas made available by virtue of team members’ varied racial group experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0170840611435597">Ely &amp; Thomas, 2001</xref>). Yet in a bank setting where the content of racial knowledge is not particularly relevant to the team’s task, the more determinative pay-off to diversity may lie elsewhere. Rather than stemming from <italic>content</italic> gains, it may stem from <italic>process</italic> gains: the experience of cross-racial learning itself may result in a boon to performance. This is because overcoming the racial divisiveness endemic to the wider society may strengthen members’ relationships, which should increase the team’s general resilience in the face of conflict or other stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0170840611435597">Dutton &amp; Heaphy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0170840611435597">Kramer, 1999</xref>). Our data do not allow us to adjudicate between these two possibilities, but future research could address this question, further deepening an appreciation of learning as a mechanism for extracting performance gains from diversity.</p> <p>The finding that status asymmetries matter has implications for how scholars might reconceptualize moderators of the diversity–performance link. Moderators could be improved if they were adapted to reflect status asymmetries on the diversity dimensions in question. For example, interpersonal congruence—the degree to which team members see others in the team as they see themselves—moderates the effect of demographic diversity on team performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0170840611435597">Polzer et al., 2002</xref>). But when considering the impact of a specific dimension of identity-group-based diversity, such as race, it may be more fruitful to distinguish levels of interpersonal congruence across low- and high-status groups (e.g., Whites and minorities) and then examine racial patterns in interpersonal congruence as the moderator. In short, it is important to consider the social embeddedness of the particular identity groups in question when conceptualizing moderating conditions.</p>
<p>These findings regarding status asymmetries also have implications for investigations of psychological safety and team learning. While research has established that concerns about status differences stemming from hierarchical position can inhibit learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0170840611435597">Edmondson, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0170840611435597">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840611435597">Edmondson et al., 2001</xref>), we extend this insight to identity-group-related status differences. Members of low-status identity groups, such as racial minorities or women, may feel unsafe broaching the topic of team power dynamics unless norms to the contrary encourage them to do so. Absent such norms, differential perceptions of risk increase the likelihood of schisms and of lower-status members either withdrawing or adopting defensive goals instead of task-oriented ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840611435597">Argyris, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840611435597">Davidson &amp; Friedman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0170840611435597">Edmondson, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0170840611435597">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840611435597">Edmondson et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, scholars should consider variability in identity groups’ assessments of psychological safety when measuring this construct and predicting its performance effects in diverse teams.</p>
<p>This study also makes several empirical contributions. First, it speaks directly to race, one of the more divisive and politically charged dimensions of cultural difference in US society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0170840611435597">Collins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0170840611435597">Omi &amp; Winant, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0170840611435597">Tomaskovic-Devey et al., 2006</xref>). Most research on moderators of the diversity–performance link elides racial differences by using aggregate measures of cultural diversity, potentially limiting its relevance to race. Second, this study is unusual in being able to assess the effects of racial diversity, controlling for racial groups’ proportional representation. In most diversity research, these variables are confounded such that the more homogeneous the team the higher the proportion of Whites; in other words, racial minorities typically do not come even close to a numerical majority on the teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0170840611435597">van Knippenberg &amp; Schippers, 2007</xref>). In our study, in contrast, maximally homogeneous teams included all-racial-minority as well as all-White teams, and maximally diverse teams were made up of half White members and half racial minority members. Third, whereas most research on team moderators lacks objective performance indicators and is conducted on MBA-student samples (for exceptions, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840611435597">Ely, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840611435597">Jackson &amp; Joshi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0170840611435597">Jehn &amp; Bezrukova, 2004</xref>), we assessed objective performance in a field setting. Thus, we can place greater confidence in our conclusions about the conditions under which racial diversity enhances or detracts from team performance.</p>
<p>Our reliance on secondary data presents some limitations, however. First, because we lacked a measure of how race influences team members’ apprehensions in team interactions, we were unable to directly assess the rationale underlying our hypotheses. Second, our use of secondary data constrained our learning environment measure, which focused on only one set of learning behaviors—offering and receiving new or different points of view or approaches to the work. Given the opportunity to collect primary data, we would add other learning behaviors, such as seeking and giving feedback, asking for help, and discussing errors, all behaviors that may be affected by one’s racial group membership. Our constrained learning environment measure may have increased measurement error, possibly accounting for our inability to detect significant diversity–performance effects for racial patterns defined by median splits in the White and minority responses on that measure. The significant quartile-based analyses, which more sharply delineate the racial patterns, would support this interpretation. Primary data collected expressly to measure this construct would address these problems.</p> <p>Our study may also be limited by our use of branches as the team unit of analysis. If larger branches contained subteams with different learning environments, and if we had access to data on those subteams’ performance, then subteams would have been a more appropriate unit for analyzing those branches. The fact that the company treated the whole branch as a team, however, suggests our approach was appropriate.</p>
<p>Finally, the theory we developed and the hypotheses we tested apply only to diversity on identity-group-based dimensions that, like race in our research setting, meet two criteria. First, the dimension in question is associated with stereotypes about competence, because negative stereotypes about competence lessen members’ willingness to take risks associated with learning, causing the team to suffer performance losses from diversity; and second, learning across such differences would enhance either the quality of the team’s work or the quality of its process. Whether an identity-group-based dimension (gender, social class, religion, etc.) meets these criteria depends on the team’s task and context. This is because tasks are differently associated with identity-group-based competence stereotypes (e.g., engineering tasks are associated with gender stereotypes about competence) and differently informed by identity-group-based perspectives (e.g., philanthropic work in low-income communities could be enriched by different social class experiences), and because contexts vary on the contentiousness of identity-group-based divisions (e.g., the Middle East is contentious on the dimension of religion). In short, our theory and results should generalize to situations in which the diversity dimension in question is associated with competence stereotypes and is also either task-relevant or socially divisive.</p>
<p>This study offers grounds for cautious optimism. Our evidence indicates that under the right conditions diverse teams—even those spanning the contentious racial divide—not only can avoid the process losses commonly associated with diversity, they also can reap performance gains by virtue of their skill in creating open and constructive learning environments. Moreover, in a world marked by racial discord, our findings suggest that the satisfaction derived from membership in a racially diverse group that works effectively because of—not despite—its diversity may have value in its own right. Such working relationships perpetuate a virtuous cycle by creating an impetus for members to engage with one another productively, which begets further success, satisfaction, and so on. This possibility suggests that the benefits of racial diversity may be as much relational and emotional as intellectual, making racial diversity a potentially powerful but rarely developed source of competitive advantage in any setting.</p>

<p>The learning behaviors most germane to the environment we study are offering or receiving new or different points of view or approaches to the work. We focus on this aspect of the team’s learning environment because these are the behaviors associated with a team’s ability to extract value from diversity (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0170840611435597">Jackson &amp; Joshi, 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>To generate the ICCs, we conducted two one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) on the individual-level survey dataset, one on the sample of 5,173 minority employees and another on the sample of 5,056 White employees. In each, branch was the independent variable and the four-item scale was the dependent variable. ICCs are significant when the one-way ANOVAs from which the coefficients are derived are significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840611435597">Bliese, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0170840611435597">Kenny &amp; La Voie, 1985</xref>). The ICC(1) coefficients were 0.05 for both the minority and White scales, which is within the typical range of ICC(1) values in field research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840611435597">Bliese, 2000</xref>, p. 361). The ICC(2) coefficients, which indicate the stability of the group-level score (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0170840611435597">Pollock, 1998</xref>), were 0.33 and 0.32 for the minority and White scales, respectively.</p>

<p>This categorical analysis had the advantage of including all-White and all-minority branches, which were automatically dropped from regressions that included the White and the minority learning environment scales. By virtue of their homogeneity, these branches had missing values on one or the other of these scales. In the categorical analysis, we were able to make use of these observations by assigning them to pattern 2 if employees rated the learning environment as unsupportive and to pattern 3 if employees rated it as supportive.</p>
