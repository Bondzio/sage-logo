            <p>In Scotland, the Children’s Hearing system determines the placement of maltreated children. A locally tailored version of the New Orleans Intervention for such children is about to be introduced in Glasgow. As part of an evaluation of its impact, an exploration was conducted of decision-making by children’s panel members, their possible role in the new intervention and their attitudes towards the changes. Interviews were held with focus groups and with members of the Children’s Hearing system using vignettes and a topic guide to focus the discussions. Thematic analysis identified key themes about the decision-making process and how the new service might impact on this. It was found that making decisions about a child’s eventual permanent placement is complex, but discussions generally focused on the parent rather than the child. Panel members highlighted how decision-making could be facilitated by a solid evidence base and knowing that a future care plan for the child is in place. Many of them were positive about the new intervention. Good, clear communication will be essential if they are to accept recommendations from a new service. Also, training will be crucial if they are to appreciate the validity of the reports that emerge.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Children who have been maltreated are at much greater risk of mental health problems than the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0308575913477076">Dimigen et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0308575913477076">Gilbert et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0308575913477076">McCann et al, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0308575913477076">Meltzer et al, 2003</xref>). Disruptions to attachment relationships resulting from maltreatment can impair brain development with a host of negative consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0308575913477076">Teicher et al, 2003</xref>). Maltreatment at this early stage can lead to extreme antisocial behaviour continuing into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0308575913477076">Aguilar et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0308575913477076">Moffitt et al, 2002</xref>) with high costs to individuals, their families and society, including health and education services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0308575913477076">Scott et al, 2001</xref>). Therefore, early intervention to improve the lives and mental health of maltreated children may result in large savings and have potential benefit to society. For children to recover from the effects of early maltreatment it is essential that they receive good care as soon as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0308575913477076">Nelson et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0308575913477076">Smyke et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0308575913477076">Zeanah et al, 2009</xref>). This requires the improvement of existing relationships or the establishment of new ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0308575913477076">Beckett et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0308575913477076">Nelson et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0308575913477076">Stovall-McClough and Dozier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0308575913477076">Zeanah et al, 2009</xref>).</p>
         <p>Despite this evidence, in the UK decisions about the permanent placement of children are not generally made until about the age of four (BAAF, undated; General Register Office for Scotland, 2004). As a result, many children drift between birth families, where they experience abuse and neglect, and foster care for several years before a decision is reached that adoption is necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0308575913477076">Minnis et al, 2010</xref>). This places them at greater risk of attachment insecurity and further exposure to maltreatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0308575913477076">Lewis et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0308575913477076">Rubin et al, 2004</xref>).</p>
         <p>There have been attempts in the UK to develop systems whereby children can be placed in a family with a view to adoption while simultaneously assessing the birth family for the potential rehabilitation of the child. This is termed ‘concurrent planning’ and has been endorsed by the British Association for Adoption and Fostering (BAAF) after independent evaluation of such schemes in England (the Manchester Adoption Society, Coram Family in London and Brighton &amp; Hove social services). The research concludes that despite potential advantages, concurrent planning will require a change in professional attitudes if it is to succeed and that modifications to adoption legislation will help facilitate its successful use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0308575913477076">Monck, Reynolds and Wigfall, 2004</xref>).</p>
         <p>Adoption legislation differs in Scotland compared to England and Wales and a new Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act was introduced in 2007. This made various changes to existing legislation, including a requirement for local authorities to provide adoption support services and to proceed according to timescales that are in the best interests of the child. The implementation of these required timescales, however, requires appropriate administrative systems to be in place. Permanency decisions in Scotland are made in the courts, but whether and at what stage adoption decisions are made depends to a large extent on decisions arrived at in the Children’s Hearing system. The system was developed in the 1970s and is based on welfare principles. Although it has been feted internationally for its non-adversarial approach to youth justice, it has also been strongly criticised for its role in permanency decisions for looked after and accommodated children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0308575913477076">Granville and Mulholland, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0308575913477076">Holloway et al, 2009</xref>). As in other parts of the UK, decisions about the permanent future of maltreated young children are fraught with difficulties. In Scotland, young children who have to be removed from their parents due to abuse or neglect are usually placed in temporary foster care and decisions about whether or not they should return home are often based on little evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0308575913477076">Minnis et al, 2010</xref>). A recent Glasgow audit showed that there was a ‘yo-yoing’ of young children between foster care and the birth family before permanent placement was actually achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0308575913477076">Minnis et al, 2010</xref>).</p>
         <p>With the aim of improving the outlook for maltreated children, an exploratory randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a new service for such children and their families is planned in Glasgow. Every maltreated child under the age of five who comes into foster care will be offered either the new service or best current practice. The new service is based on the New Orleans Intervention, which has been running for ten years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0308575913477076">Zeanah et al, 2001</xref>).</p>
         <p>The New Orleans Intervention offers an intensive infant mental health service to families in which a child has been maltreated. In New Orleans, every child who has experienced maltreatment and who enters foster care is referred. Structured attachment-based assessments are carried out with the child and each carer (both birth parents and foster carers). Following the assessment period, a therapeutic programme is tailored for each family with the explicit aim of maximising the chances of the child returning home. This intensive child–parent therapy is provided by a multidisciplinary team involving psychiatry, psychology and social work professionals. During the intervention, the child is looked after in foster care and, where possible, the carers are jointly registered as potential adopters so that, if the child requires adoption, there is no need for a further break in attachment. The intervention goes considerably beyond existing UK concurrent planning schemes by providing ‘concurrent intervention’ (Zeanah, personal communication). In other words, the birth family is provided with an intensive service aimed at improving family relationships and infant mental health while the child is living in a nurturing foster placement. The recommendations made to the legal system are based, in large part, on the fact that the birth family has been offered the chance to change.</p>
         <p>There is already some evidence for the effectiveness of the New Orleans Intervention. Zeanah and colleagues scrutinised routine data on episodes of child abuse and neglect in the four years before and the four years after its implementation. This demonstrated that despite the explicit aim of improving the child’s chances of returning home, more children were in fact freed for adoption. However, when children did return to their birth families, there was a reduction in maltreatment of both the index child and of subsequent siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0308575913477076">Zeanah et al, 2001</xref>). Additionally, the 80 children exposed to the intervention, whether adopted or rehabilitated, were found to be similar to their peers in terms of their mental health in a seven-year follow-up study (Zeanah, personal communication) – a remarkable result in view of the well-known difficulties associated with early life maltreatment. But despite this relatively robust evidence, there are no published child mental health outcome data on the New Orleans Intervention and there have been no studies that have included the rigour of a RCT methodology. Such a trial is now underway in Glasgow.</p>
         <p>It was important to understand barriers and facilitators to implementation of the model in Glasgow before the RCT began. The UK Medical Research Council’s framework for design and evaluation of complex interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0308575913477076">Campbell et al, 2000</xref>) emphasises the importance of understanding the context into which new services are introduced. In the present case, this included qualitative ‘mapping and modelling’ work, involving interviews with key health and social work professionals in Glasgow and New Orleans.</p>
         <p>Taking this approach, we explored the work of the children’s panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0308575913477076">Kuenssberg, 2007</xref>). Panels comprise three lay volunteers and make many of the decisions regarding a child’s eventual permanent placement. During the proposed randomised trial, panel members will have to evaluate detailed assessments of the quality of the parent–child relationships as well as any change that has occurred through the intervention, and formulate plans for the child accordingly. The implementation of the intervention will thus have a significant impact on the children’s panel which, in turn, will have an important role in its outcome. It is hoped that the detailed information provided will improve decision-making, but this will depend on the attitudes of panel members. If significant positive change in the parent–child relationship has been achieved, a recommendation will be made to the panel that the child is rehabilitated back to the birth family. If not, the recommendation is made that the child should be freed for adoption.</p>
         <p>Naturally, there are significant differences between the legal system in New Orleans and Glasgow. First, there is a legal framework in the US, the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA), which strongly encourages a permanency decision to be made after 15 months of the child being in care. The infant team thus has a time limit for assessment of the child, intervention and report writing. Another significant difference is that most foster carers are also registered as potential adoptive parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0308575913477076">Minnis et al, 2010</xref>). This is not the case in Glasgow where most foster carers are seen as ‘temporary’, as described above. We wanted to know whether the new intervention could be introduced into Glasgow’s very different legal context.</p>
         <p>Thus, our aim was to establish the views of key members of the children’s panel about: (1) the likely impact of the intervention on them; and (2) the ways in which the panel is likely to have an impact on the intervention.</p>

         <title>Methods</title>
         <p>We decided to explore the views of members of the Children’s Hearing system qualitatively because these methods ‘enable us to access areas not amenable to quantitative research, such as lay and professional health beliefs’ and are particularly useful in areas that have previously had little investigation, in which it would be hard to formulate appropriate questions for quantitative testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0308575913477076">Pope and Mays, 1995</xref>). We used both individual interviews and focus groups.</p>
         <p>Individual semi-structured interviews allow topics, especially sensitive ones, to be explored in depth and we therefore chose this methodology for our initial interviews with members of the Children's Hearing system whom we suspected may feel threatened by our proposed research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0308575913477076">Britten, 1995</xref>). These interviews gave us an opportunity to understand the topics that were of greatest importance for further exploration in focus groups (see below) and suggestions about how to approach these topics sensitively. Interviews were held early in 2010 with the children’s panel authority chair, a children’s reporter (the professional who co-ordinates the panel and usually has a social work or legal background) and the training officer for Children's Hearings. These gave us a greater understanding of what happens to a maltreated child under five years old in Glasgow following referral to social work, and the role of the children’s panel in this process. From these interviews a topic guide was developed prior to starting the focus groups.</p>
         <sec id="sec3-0308575913477076">
            <title>Focus groups</title>
            <p>Focus groups provide a context in which groups can discuss and make sense of their attitudes and ideas. They can be used to examine what people think, why they think in that way, their understandings and priorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0308575913477076">Kitzinger, 1995</xref>). The discussions were used to explore panel members’ opinions and experiences of decision-making and to examine why they make the decisions they do about the permanency of children.</p>
            <p>Three focus groups with a total of 19 participants were held at the University of Glasgow in early 2011. Each lasted for between one hour and 90 minutes.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="sec4-0308575913477076">
            <title>Recruitment</title>
            <p>Each of the six sectors in Glasgow has a children’s panel, and panel members attend hearings on a rotational basis. Each sector has one panel chair.</p>
            <p>The first group of participants was recruited from all panel chairs in Glasgow, six in total, each representing one area of the city. Two further panel members were identified from each area to participate in separate focus groups using purposive sampling. Participants were recruited by email contact.</p>
            <p>In the group of panel chairs, all participants knew one another, as they had attended training and meetings together. For the panel members, this was less the case, although a few had sat on hearings together. Demographic details about panel members were collected at the beginning of focus group (FG) discussions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0308575913477076">Table 1</xref>) and provide a description of the sample. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0308575913477076">Table 1</xref>, there was a reasonable balance of focus group members across the different roles within the panel, years of experience, sectors of the city in which members were practising and gender.

            <p>Stimulus material was used to encourage discussion. Written information about the study and a summary of the New Orleans Intervention was sent to all participants one to two weeks before each focus group. Vignettes describing typical but fictional cases of maltreated children, two from the Scottish system and two from New Orleans, were developed in consultation with a social work and child psychiatry expert. These were sent to the participants two days before the meeting. The vignettes were piloted with a panel member not otherwise involved in the study before they were sent out. Focus groups were used because we wanted to encourage interaction between participants and the vignettes made it easier to compare data across groups.</p>
            <p>Before the discussions began, an overview of the New Orleans system was given (including the AFSA and its role in placing a time framework around decision-making) to ensure that participants understood the scenarios. Following this, participants were asked to discuss their decision about permanency for each child. The discussions were recorded and transcribed verbatim.</p>

         <p>Transcripts were analysed thematically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0308575913477076">Braun and Clarke, 2006</xref>). We listened to all the recordings and read the transcripts several times. An initial coding frame was developed and a final version of codes was agreed with three researchers. All transcripts were coded using this frame (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0308575913477076">Table 2</xref>). Codes were pulled together into potential themes, and data relevant to each potential theme were collated. Themes were refined and grouped into clusters to form superordinate themes.

         <title>Findings</title>
         <p>Five main themes were identified relating to decision-making: information used; evaluating the evidence; influences; problems making decisions; and how the decision-making process could be influenced by the New Orleans Intervention.</p>
         <sec id="sec7-0308575913477076">
            <title>Information used</title>
            <p>The information panel members used to make decisions was largely related to the parent. This included the history of why the child came into care in the first place and the rate of readmission.</p>
            <p>Panel members discussed changes the parent might have made since the child came into care. Some commented on the importance of parents accepting responsibility. For example, one panel member said:<disp-quote>
                  <p>… If you don’t see what the problem is how can you make the changes that are necessary for things to improve?</p>
               </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>Panel members often made predictions about how the parent would cope in the future if they had the right support.</p>
            <p>Although some of the information used was related to the child, the discussions were mainly focused on the parent. For example, most of the discussion on the ‘quality of contact’ with the child focused on whether the parent turned up to visits. Two panel members acknowledged this to be true of most hearings when saying:<disp-quote>
                  <p>It shouldn’t be the Children’s Hearing system it should be the Family Hearing system. (FG 3, PM 2)</p>
                  <p>I think it should be the parents’ panel actually. (FG 3, PM 5)</p>
               </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>However, some did question what impact contact had on the child, for example:<disp-quote>
                  <p>He’s ping ponged three times … At what point do you say to yourself, that’s three lots of attachments that they’ve had to make? (FG 3, PM 2)</p>
               </disp-quote>Panel members often commented on timescales but were more concerned over the length of time the child had been in care rather than his or her actual age. The urgency of making decisions about children who are very young was not always recognised and sometimes recommendations were made that information about parents could be gathered from contact without reference to potentially detrimental effects on the child, for example:<disp-quote>
                  <p>… the child is quite young. And if you did increase the contact to say, fortnightly</p>
                  <p>… you would learn quicker whether the mum was going to pull her socks up.</p>

            <title>Evaluating the evidence</title>
            <p>On weighing up the evidence available to them, it seemed that panel members usually based their decisions on the following questions:

               <disp-quote>
                  <p>If there was a lot of intervention, as there are with some parents, and it still hasn’t worked then it’s quite easy to make the decision to draw the line, but if you turn up once a week for seven weeks to sit and talk to someone, is that enough intervention?</p>

               </list>Particular emphasis was placed on the parent’s ‘engagement’ with services, although interpretations of a parent’s engagement varied between panel members. For example:<disp-quote>
                  <p>… up to this point she’s never engaged with alcohol [counselling] or refused to acknowledge that alcohol addiction is part of the problem.</p>
               </disp-quote>Some panel members were very clear in the distinction between parents complying with a service and engaging fully in this:<disp-quote>
                  <p>There’s nothing there to actually say that she’s achieved anything from psychotherapy … And it’s easy to turn up but if you’re not actually going to take anything on board …</p>

            <p>Panel members were clear that their role is to weigh up the evidence before making a decision and not just go with what social workers say. Panel members stressed that they often made judgements at the hearing about the parent and child relationship, or about the parent(s)’ progress:<disp-quote>
                  <p>… you can tell by their body language and even their physical presence.</p>

            <title>Problems in decision-making</title>
            <p>Panel members explicitly held different opinions about the role of the Children’s Hearing system and many felt this variety was its strength. For example, one’s view was:<disp-quote>
                  <p>The whole point of the Children’s Hearing system is to get children back with their birth parents.</p>
               </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>However, others felt that the child’s best interests were more important:<disp-quote>
                  <p>But then again you are sacrificing the child for the needs of the mother. Do you let her practise on him or do you just say no? He wasn’t brought into the world for her to practise being a parent.</p>
               </disp-quote>Some panel members expressed a lack of confidence dealing with a situation where there were conflicts between the parent’s presentation, the lawyer and the social worker report. Panel members commented that in difficult situations like these, the quality of the written report, the ability of a social worker to present it and the strength of the underpinning evidence were vital. Most members felt that this was not always available to them. They shared frustrations of not always having enough information to make decisions, which could include missing reports, missing people and lack of details from key workers. Getting more information from the social worker at the hearing and knowing which further questions to ask for clarification were important in such situations.</p>
            <p>It was suggested that social workers and reporters who will be presenting their recommendations to panels should be trained.</p>

            <title>Overlapping themes between current decision-making and New Orleans Intervention</title>
            <p>The issue of evidence base was common to comments about problems in the current system and the potential for the New Orleans system to work. Panel members acknowledged that a good-quality written report that is well presented at the hearing could facilitate the decision-making process:<disp-quote>
                  <p>If we were to be able to sit around the table and say the information we got all the time was spot on, it would make the decision-making process much better.</p>
               </disp-quote>One panel member felt that this would be particularly important for the new system to work if they had concerns about removing a child from a parent when the evidence was not valid:<disp-quote>
                  <p>If the information is not accurate, effective and better than it is at the moment, then it worries me considerably if we are talking about taking children away.</p>
               </disp-quote>It was believed that a long-term care plan facilitated decision-making and panel members would more readily make the decision about permanency when they knew there was a potential adoptive parent in place:<disp-quote>
                  <p>… the reassurance that the assessment with the foster carers is good and that they are potential adopters would give a hearing a greater level of confidence that this was the right decision to make this kid’s life better for the future.</p>
               </disp-quote>This contrasted with the current Glasgow situation where panel members believe there is often no better alternative to the child returning to the birth parent because the quality of potential foster care or kinship care is poor and the child will drift back to the birth parent’s care anyway. This was considered by many panel members to be one of the major flaws of the current system. In the discussions on the case scenarios, however, most did go along with the New Orleans model team’s recommendation but mainly because the ASFA, as outlined in the introduction, imposed limits to flexibility with regard to decision-making.</p>
            <p>Overall, looking across all the themes, we were struck by panel members’ tendency to focus on the parent at all levels of the discussion, even when presented with detailed evidence about the child and his or her relationships with parents. They also appeared overwhelmed by often conflicting information from different parties and found it difficult to hold the needs of the child in the centre of their thinking.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>One of the most important findings of the study was that panel members bring their own experiences and opinions to the hearing and this is likely to be applicable across all panels. Many factors can either help or hinder them from making decisions, and opinions about the role of the hearing system were especially influential, even though they varied between individuals.</p>
         <p>A particular concern for panel members was whether the parent had been given a fair and sufficient chance, which included them having the optimum support possible and the time to make changes, and it is important to note that this will continue to be an issue under the new system.</p>
         <p>But panel members believed that two aspects of the New Orleans Intervention would make decision-making better: the assurance that a long-term care plan would be followed through and having a report with a recommendation supported by evidence. Thus, the crucial role of the social worker should not be underestimated in the decision-making process. It may be difficult for panel members to take recommendations from different professionals or a new kind of team. On the other hand, they might willingly accept a recommendation from the infant team provided that it is supported by evidence, as panel members claim to do with social workers’ reports.</p>
         <p>A major aspect which panel members considered when making decisions was the parents’ history with the child and evidence that they had performed poorly in the past. Therefore, panel members may find it difficult to accept the infant team’s recommendation where there is no evidence of further abuse and neglect or because the assessments happen over a relatively short time. As a result, many of them welcomed the prospect of having a suitable alternative placement available for the child, while others favoured the flexibility of Glasgow’s current system where contact can be more easily maintained with the birth parent.</p>
         <p>The focus group methodology proved to be useful as it allowed panel members to express their views about the New Orleans Intervention while also eliciting information about the impact they may have on this. All participants took part in the discussions and a diversity of views was expressed: purposive sampling allowed representatives from different levels of the Hearing systems and geographical areas to take part.</p>
         <p>It is not, however, possible to generalise our findings to other parts of the Hearing or legal system. It would have been useful to complement the focus groups by observing real hearings to see how panel members operate, although this was impractical due to ethical constraints. In the focus groups it was difficult to appreciate the process underlying decision-making and it would be useful to know if panel members do this in a systematic way.</p>
         <p>Only trialling the new system will show whether panel members are willing to make a decision that may involve ending contact completely, especially when so many factors, including emotional responses, are involved on the day of the hearing. It may take time for panel members to change their thinking, especially as some of them believe that a child should still be allowed some personal contact with their birth parent(s), even if going into long-term care.</p>

            <title>Implications</title>
            <p>Extra training is essential for panel members to appreciate the validity of the standardised assessments and methodology used by the infant team. Clearly the preamble and vignettes did not really lend themselves to this, as many panel members were not easily convinced by the infant team’s recommendations and, as discussed above, decisions they made seemed to be based on the ASFA.</p>
            <p>In the randomised trial there is likely to be a small group of children’s panels working under the New Orleans system exclusively. However, panel members involved will be required to have the knowledge base first to make decisions in a systematic, evidence-based way which could support evaluation of reports from the infant team. At the moment, decision-making can be inconsistent, in large part resulting from a lack of evidence.</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>Some panel members felt it was disappointing that we should be trying to introduce a new system when current services could work well if adequate resources were available. Despite this, most were optimistic about the new intervention. They are likely to welcome the clear reports that the infant team will contribute. However, for the intervention to work, panel members will need to agree that decisions about the permanent placement of a child in care should be made within a strict time limit. This will involve sometimes prioritising the child’s needs over those of the parent and an appreciation that timescales of the parent may be too long for an infant to wait for a stable attachment.</p>
         <p>Panel members might struggle to change their habits of deciding to return children to the birth family based more on considerations about the parents than about the child. They will inevitably bring their diverse opinions to the decision-making process and it remains likely that whether or not a permanency decision is made will be dependent on the panel make-up on each day in question.</p>
