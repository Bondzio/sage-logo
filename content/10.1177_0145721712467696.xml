<title>Purpose</title>
<p>Treatment guidelines recommend insulin progression (switching from basal to a premixed insulin regimen, adding bolus doses, and/or increasing dosing frequency) to achieve A1C targets as type 2 diabetes progresses, but fewer patients are being progressed than would be indicated based on their disease status. This systematic review proposes 2 questions regarding insulin progression among patients with type 2 diabetes: (1) What are the patient, provider, and health system barriers to insulin progression? (2) Do insulin progression barriers differ between insulin-naive and insulin-experienced patients?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0145721712467696">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We conducted a systematic review in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases through July 2011.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0145721712467696">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Of 745 potentially relevant articles, 10 met inclusion criteria: 7 evaluated patient and 2 evaluated provider barriers, and 1 was an intervention to reduce barriers among physicians. Patients with prior insulin experience had fewer barriers arising from injection-related concerns and worries about the burden of insulin progression than did insulin-naive patients. Physician barriers included concerns about patients’ ability to follow more complicated regimens as well as physicians’ own inexperience with insulin and progression algorithms. The cross- sectional nature, narrow scope, and failure of all studies to examine patient, provider, and health systems barriers concurrently limited both barrier identification and an assessment of their impact on progression.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0145721712467696">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Patient and physician experience with insulin and diabetes/insulin education were associated with fewer perceived barriers to insulin progression. Future studies should use multilevel longitudinal designs to quantify the relative impact of potential patient, provider, and health system factors on progression and health outcomes.</p>

<body>
<p>The worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes continues to increase, bringing with it a substantial impact on morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. It is estimated that 329 million patients will have type 2 diabetes by the year 2030, approximately double the number from year 2000; this projected increase is largely driven by the inexorable process of aging rather than changes in lifestyle factors, so it is likely a conservative estimate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712467696">1</xref></sup> More than 3 million deaths per year are attributable to diabetes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712467696">2</xref></sup> making it the fifth leading cause of death worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712467696">3</xref></sup> In the United States, diabetes-related health expenditures exceeded $174 billion in 2007, with $58 billion spent on preventable complications such as stroke, heart disease, and kidney failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712467696">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>When initial lifestyle modifications and oral antidiabetic medications are not sufficient to maintain glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, expert consensus guidelines and evidence-based algorithms recommend insulin initiation and subsequent insulin progression (switching from a basal insulin regimen to a premixed insulin, adding bolus doses, and/or increasing the frequency of dosing) to achieve hemoglobin A1C targets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712467696">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712467696"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712467696">7</xref></sup> However, observational studies in real-world settings reveal gaps in the implementation of these treatment guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712467696">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712467696"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712467696"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712467696">11</xref></sup> A population-based study in Germany and the United Kingdom found that only 25% of patients who did not meet A1C goals on a basal insulin regimen had their insulin therapy progressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712467696">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712467696">10</xref></sup> A US academic medical center-based study found that fewer than 50% of patients whose diabetes status warranted insulin progression were actually progressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712467696">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In recognition that appropriate insulin progression can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes–related complications and reduce unnecessary health expenditures, researchers, clinicians, and policy makers have an interest in understanding and addressing barriers to progression among patients with type 2 diabetes. In this systematic review, we evaluate the peer-reviewed literature through July 2011 to answer 2 questions regarding insulin progression among patients with type 2 diabetes: (1) What are the patient, provider, and health system barriers to insulin progression? (2) Do insulin progression barriers differ between insulin-naive and insulin-experienced patients, and how? By enumerating the multiple sources of potential barriers to insulin progression and the challenges of patients with different insulin treatment experiences, this review summarizes the best available evidence regarding obstacles to insulin progression, highlights opportunities for overcoming those barriers, and identifies knowledge gaps.</p>

<title>Research Design and Method</title>
<p>We followed PRISMA guidelines for the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712467696">12</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section6-0145721712467696">
<title>Data Sources</title>
<p>We limited initial searches to articles published in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index (ISI Web of Science), PsycINFO, CINAHL, or the Cochrane Library on or before July 15, 2011. Our search strategy focused on terms related to type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin, and treatment progression (eg, in Medline: [<italic>Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2</italic>[Mesh] AND <italic>“Insulin”</italic>[Mesh] AND <italic>“Therapeutics”</italic>[Mesh] AND (<italic>intens*</italic> OR <italic>escalat*</italic> OR <italic>increas*</italic> OR <italic>progres*</italic>) AND (<italic>barrier*</italic> OR <italic>obstacle*</italic> OR <italic>challeng*</italic> OR <italic>disincentiv*</italic> OR <italic>impediment*</italic> OR <italic>difficult*</italic> OR <italic>limitation*</italic>)]. Search strategies specific to each database can be found in the online appendix. After eliminating duplicates across search databases, articles meeting search criteria were included in the review and were reference mined for related articles. No language restriction was imposed.</p>

<sec id="section7-0145721712467696">
<title>Study Selection</title>
<p>Final articles were included if they reported original data regarding barriers to insulin treatment progression among patients with type 2 diabetes, whether data were drawn from self-report surveys, interviews, clinical trials, and/or observational studies. Both patient and physician data were included. Articles reporting only barriers to insulin initiation were excluded, as were case studies and case series. Five reviewers (J.P., B.S., B.C., J.S., J.C.) participated in the study selection process, with at least 2 reviewers evaluating each title and abstract to identify potentially relevant articles. At least 2 reviewers then assessed complete articles for inclusion, noting 1 or more reasons for exclusion if the article was removed from consideration. Disagreement at these 2 stages of the review process was resolved by the judgment of a third reviewer (J.P., B.S., or J.C). All 5 reviewers assessed the final group of selected articles for inclusion.</p>

<sec id="section8-0145721712467696">
<title>Data Extraction</title>
<p>Two reviewers extracted data from selected articles (B.S., J.P.), including the key research questions, data sources, characteristics of the study population, study design, survey/questionnaire used or outcomes measured, results, and conclusions. J.P. and B.S. evaluated the methodological quality of all cross-sectional study analyses using a 9-point, modified assessment checklist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712467696">13</xref></sup> that assigned 1 point for each of the following: representativeness of the study population (external validity); participation rate of 60% or more; description of subject attrition/data completeness; and assessment of or adjustment for type 2 diabetes disease duration, weight or body mass index, age, gender, insulin dose/type, and/or A1C when comparing 2 or more groups.</p>

<title>Patient Barriers and Patient Experience With Insulin</title>
<p>All 7 patient-focused studies used surveys or choice instruments to elicit patients’ opinions regarding insulin progression, and many compared perceived barriers between insulin-naive versus insulin-experienced patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721712467696">Table 1</xref>).

<p>The first study ranked 274 patients’ willingness to pay for different benefits and costs associated with insulin use, including improved glucose control, weight gain, hypoglycemic episodes, and route of insulin administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712467696">15</xref></sup> Patients with type 2 diabetes (N = 227) were willing to pay the most ($114) for optimal fasting glucose control, followed by $58 for 2 kg of weight gain per year as opposed to 6 or 10 kg, and $49 for no hypoglycemic episodes. Route of insulin administration was the least important attribute in a regimen for both insulin-naive and insulin-experienced patients, but experience with insulin mattered: Experienced insulin users were willing to pay only up to $9 to avoid injecting insulin, whereas insulin-naive patients were willing to pay up to $75. These data suggest that once patients were familiar with insulin injection, its importance as a barrier to treatment and insulin progression was minimized.</p>
<p>Injection experience was also important in a survey of 11,883 patients with type 2 diabetes: Only 3% of insulin-experienced patients ranked administration route (oral vs injected) as the most important attribute of a treatment regimen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712467696">14</xref></sup> Patients who had received diabetes training placed less importance on administration route than those who had not, 28% versus 34% (P &lt; .0001). The presence of side effects (32% vs 14%), maintenance of blood sugar levels (28% vs 13%), and avoidance of hypoglycemia (22% vs 17%) were more important attributes for insulin-treated patients than for insulin-naive patients. In a validation study for a new insulin treatment appraisal scale (ITAS), insulin experience was again associated with more favorable appraisals of insulin among 282 patients with type 2 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712467696">18</xref></sup> When insulin-treated patients were compared with insulin-naive patients, fewer believed that insulin was demanding to administer (28% vs 61%) or that insulin would make others perceive greater sickness (20% vs 41%). However, more agreed that insulin use would cause weight gain (54% vs 23%). Although fear of needle injection was dramatically lower (6% vs 47%), 38% of insulin-treated patients still agreed that injection was painful.</p>
<p>Among 1653 veterans responding to a survey, insulin experience was associated with lower perceived treatment burden by 1.2 to 2.8 points on a 7-point scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712467696">19</xref></sup> In a multivariate analysis of adherence to therapy, the veterans’ ratings of burden were the only significant predictor of adherence to insulin and of willingness to accept insulin therapy. One study occurred in the context of an open-label randomized controlled trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712467696">17</xref></sup> Among 50 patients randomized to receive basal insulin plus a rapid-acting insulin analog for 20 weeks, patients reported on a 6-point scale (with higher ratings indicating more favorable opinion) that the regimen made it harder to control their weight (mean score = 2.83 ± 1.85). That said, these same patients agreed that the regimen’s overall benefit outweighed the need to administer additional injections (mean score = 4.70 ± 1.38), made it easier to avoid hypoglycemia (mean score = 4.00 ± 1.46), and made it easier to control appetite (mean score = 4.00 ± 1.46). The study also compared the new regimen to a basal insulin plus pramlintide regimen, but the follow-up periods on treatment were unequal, making the comparison between regimens invalid.</p>
<p>Two studies did not break out results by diabetes type. A questionnaire validation study found that 70% of insulin-treated patients versus 30% of insulin-naive patients were willing to increase the frequency of insulin injection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712467696">16</xref></sup> In a study that explored injection-related anxiety among 80 patients with type 1 and 35 with type 2 diabetes, nearly 30% of patients injecting insulin reported being troubled by the prospect of additional injections, and 14% reported avoiding injections altogether.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712467696">20</xref></sup> There was a slight negative correlation between number of daily injections and insulin anxiety score, −0.17 (95% confidence interval, −0.27 to −0.07). Patients with high insulin anxiety scores also reported high generalized anxiety scores; however, generalized anxiety score was not associated with A1C control.</p>

<p>A cross-sectional study performed in an outpatient clinic surveyed 5 physicians and 8 nurses regarding their treatment progression decisions during 1416 patient visits for type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145721712467696">Table 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712467696">22</xref></sup> Although study results described barriers to any diabetes treatment progression, 40% of patients were already taking insulin. When providers could not agree on a treatment plan, physicians more often endorsed progression whereas nurses favored delayed action due to perceptions of glycemic control or patient noncompliance. Among 146 patients with poor glycemic control whose treatment was not progressed, providers most often reported that control was improving (34%), patients were noncompliant with medications (16%) or diet (10%), or there was an acute intervening illness (8%), or provided no reason (18%).</p>

<p>In a second study, a Web-based survey was administered to 600 physicians across 6 countries to explore barriers to insulin progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712467696">21</xref></sup> Nearly 40% of primary care physicians and 30% of specialists found administration of progressed insulin therapy difficult and wanted more support staff and resources to assist them. About one-half (49%) reported that doctors lack experience with available types of insulin and that educating patients regarding progression would take too much time. Almost 40% agreed that patients cannot cope with progressed regimens, there is a lack of guidance about insulin progression, and there is a lack of patient monitoring to show when patients with type 2 diabetes require progression. In the United Kingdom, Germany, and Turkey, 6% cited strict national guidelines as barriers to progression. In the United States, Spain, and Japan, 10% cited reimbursement difficulties as a barrier.

<title>An Intervention to Address Barriers</title>
<p>In an inpatient setting, 33 physicians (representing a 46% response) responded to a survey regarding inpatient insulin use after they attended a 20-minute educational lecture to introduce and promote the use of a new standardized basal-bolus treatment protocol in place of a sliding scale approach (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0145721712467696">Table 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712467696">23</xref></sup> On a 5-point Likert scale, physicians indicated great willingness to prescribe the new basal-bolus therapy (median [interquartile range] = 5 [5-5]). Most (4 [4-5]) agreed that standardized basal-bolus insulin therapy would provide better control than the former sliding scale protocol, but most also had concerns about a greater risk of hypoglycemia (4 [2.5-5]). Providers were divided about the simplicity of administering the new protocol (3 [2-4]) but did adopt it. Patient discharge records showed that 17% of inpatients were treated with basal-bolus therapy before the educational intervention, 85% at 3 months post intervention, and 93% at 9 months post intervention.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This systematic review identified 10 studies that examined barriers to insulin progression. Many compared barriers to insulin use among insulin-naive versus insulin-experienced patients. Studies that examined patient barriers to progression were most common, followed by 2 studies of provider barriers and 1 study describing an educational intervention to improve progression rates. Overall, both patient and provider experience with insulin and education about progression appeared to mitigate barriers to progression. However, the small number of studies available, along with existing studies’ methodological limitations, narrow focus on only a few potential barriers, and grouping of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, makes a comprehensive assessment of barriers to insulin progression difficult.</p>
<p>Of the 7 studies describing patient barriers to insulin progression, 6 compared the perceptions and beliefs of insulin-treated patients with insulin-naive patients. Across all 6 studies, injection-related concerns were less prominent and perceptions of insulin progression and burden of insulin therapy were more favorable among insulin-treated versus insulin-naive patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712467696">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712467696">19</xref></sup> Insulin-treated patients were less likely to believe that insulin was hard to administer, injection was painful, progression would limit their daily activities, or progression would result in greater perceptions of sickness by others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712467696">18</xref></sup> As compared with insulin-naive patients, insulin-treated patients were more concerned with side effects, glycemic control, weight gain, and hypoglycemic events than with the need for injections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712467696">14</xref></sup> These results suggest that experience with insulin and/or diabetes education can minimize barriers to insulin progression, and the results highlight the potential of educational interventions to address injection and burden of disease-related barriers. Indeed, one study found that lower perceived burden of treatment regimen was the only consistent predictor of willingness to progress and of adherence to progressed treatment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712467696">19</xref></sup> and the authors suggested that barriers to treatment progression might be reduced if patients were offered insulin as a “temporary trial.” This approach allows patients to gain experience and reassess their perceptions of insulin therapy but relieves the pressure of all-or-nothing long-term use.</p>
<p>However, even patients’ experience and education did not eliminate all barriers evaluated. Nearly 40% of insulin-treated patients still reported that injection was painful<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712467696">18</xref></sup> and 30% expressed concern about the need for additional injections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712467696">20</xref></sup> Insulin-treated patients also reported weight gain concerns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712467696">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712467696">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712467696">18</xref></sup> Engaging patients in a shared decision-making process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712467696">24</xref></sup> to compare the benefits of treatment with potential drawbacks may improve patients’ willingness to progress their therapy and their adherence to it. In one study, patients agreed that the progressed regimen “provided enough benefit to outweigh the extra injections.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712467696">17</xref></sup> For the most part, the patient-focused studies examined barriers that have previously been identified as important predictors of insulin initiation and assessed their presence in the context of insulin progression. Few studies examined barriers that might be progression-specific, leaving a gap in our understanding of barriers that might be unique to insulin progression.</p>
<p>Provider-related barriers to insulin progression often derived from providers’ concerns about their patients’ abilities or willingness to adopt a progressed regimen. Barriers cited by providers in 2 studies included patients’ noncompliance with the existing pharmacological treatment regimen or diet,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712467696">22</xref></sup> patients’ inability to cope with a progressed regimen,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712467696">21</xref></sup> and lack of time to educate patients about progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712467696">21</xref></sup> Physicians also described their own lack of experience with and knowledge of types of insulin and progression protocols,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712467696">21</xref></sup> even those who had just participated in an educational intervention to improve progression rates in the inpatient setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712467696">23</xref></sup> However, the proportion of patients in whom insulin therapy was progressed was increased following the educational intervention, suggesting that education represents an opportunity to reduce barriers to progression.</p>
<p>A full exploration of barriers to insulin progression was limited by the cross-sectional design of the available studies, generally low methodological quality, and narrow focus. Included studies largely relied on self-reported data assessed at a single point in time, so that they did not evaluate which barriers affected subsequent progression of therapy or the occurrence of health outcomes related to diabetes. Although 2 provider-based studies supplemented their cross-sectional data with prospective or retrospective assessment of insulin progression over time, none accounted for time-varying factors that might confound the association between intervention/survey and progression, nor did they quantify the association between barriers and progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712467696">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712467696">23</xref></sup> In their analyses, only 2 studies controlled for factors that might confound exposure-outcome associations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712467696">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712467696">23</xref></sup> Few studies examined social stigma, access to pharmacies, or adherence to progressed therapy. Several studies failed to distinguish between patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes or between patients who progressed to more frequent insulin administration versus those who progressed to other therapies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712467696">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712467696">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712467696">20</xref></sup> Despite our extensive search, we found no studies that examined health system–based barriers, nor did we find any studies that examined patient, provider, and health system barriers concurrently to explore their impact on the likelihood of insulin progression. Because treatment decisions involve all 3 levels of influence, such comprehensive studies are needed.</p>
<p>This systematic review suggests that both patients and physicians who have experience with insulin or who have received diabetes or insulin-specific education have fewer barriers to insulin progression compared with those who are insulin-naive. Interventions that introduce patients and physicians to insulin use and/or educate them about it may be effective in reducing barriers that can impede insulin progression, such as injection-related aversion, perceived burden of disease, and perceived inability of patients to handle progressed regimens. However, studies in large part failed to identify novel barriers that might additionally explain incomplete application of insulin progression where indicated. Novel barriers such as cost, access, social stigma, social support, and health system–based factors must be proposed and studied among insulin-experienced patients whose disease status merits progression. Cross-sectional data need to be supplemented with longitudinal data, and investigators need to use study designs that address confounding factors and the clustering of patients within providers and within health care environments. The most helpful future studies will be both multifactorial and longitudinal in nature, examining the relative contributions of patient, provider, and health system factors on progression rates and type 2 diabetes–related health outcomes. At present, enhanced education is a promising strategy, and future studies will both furnish researchers and clinicians with improved data to develop educational interventions and provide guidance on additional efforts that may be needed.</p>
