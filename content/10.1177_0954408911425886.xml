<abstract>
<p>The hydraulic transport of solids, crude oil, waste waters etc. imposes the need for the use of pumps whose quality and reliable sealing of the rotating elements is a precondition to successful operation. The noticed problems, on the sealing of the existing facilities, has imposed numerous questions, to which answers should be provided. The conclusion is as follows: in order to make greater progress in this sphere, it is necessary, before the designing of a new facility, or the reconstruction of the old one, to apply research to define all the significant values that influence the sealing quality and the sealing life span. The task of this paper is to find a procedure that would improve impellers shaft sealing, to display the manner of research and apply the acquired results. The set goal has been realized, and the realized reconstruction is characterized by a longer life span and reliable operation.</p>

<p>Pumps, separators, classifiers, thickeners, etc., are all machines that are massively used in mining and all operate in heavy conditions (the presence of solid particles, chemically aggressive substances, gases, etc). The analysis of failure of crude oil pump<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954408911425886">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954408911425886">3</xref></sup> shows more than 50% of failures which are a result of the consequence of shaft bearing sealing failure. The friction pair life span (steel–bronze or carbon-based composite) of sealing is in the range 1500–2000 h<sup>2</sup> when the transported fluid (crude oil) contains less than 0.5% of solid particles. A far shorter life span is with the sealing at the water injection pump. For the axial turbodrill bearing sealing, a short life span (50–100 h) is quite characteristic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954408911425886">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The pumps used for the hydraulic transport of solid materials is a specific example of heavy working conditions (large concentrations of solid, large particles of solid and high speed).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954408911425886">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954408911425886">5</xref></sup> The short life span of certain elements of these pumps, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954408911425886">Table 1</xref>, refers to significant problems that need to be solved when designing and exploiting these machines.

<p>Finding the most efficient sealing procedure is one of the goals of modern science and its relevant industries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954408911425886">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954408911425886">7</xref></sup> The biggest part of the recent research studies, in case of contact sealings, is aimed at the choice of materials for sliding rings. The smaller part of research is aimed at other causes of the short life span of these sealings such as constructive solutions, operating regime and maintenance conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954408911425886">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954408911425886">8</xref></sup> The existing constructions of pumps for the transport of slurry use the following technical sealing solutions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954408911425886">Figure 1</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954408911425886">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954408911425886">10</xref></sup>

<p>The procedures for acquiring valid data are a part of the solution, based on which facility design and reconstruction are approached. These data are acquired by research in lab, semi-industrial and industrial conditions. These procedures can be long lasting with a request of engaging expensive equipments and expert labour.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954408911425886">6</xref></sup> Very often the acquired results due to the material specifics treated and the operating regime cannot be generalized and applied to other facilities, which additionally makes the research and the use of results more complex and expensive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954408911425886">7</xref></sup>
<list id="list1-0954408911425886" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Centrifugal sealings, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954408911425886">Figure1(a)</xref>, are solutions used in cases when there is little difference between the pressure and the non-pressure zones. Centrifugal seal forms a centrifugal acceleration field by expeller. This field prevents the solid particles from penetrating into the contact zone: the shaft-sealing sleeve. Grease from the nipple is used for lubricating the packing. They only function when the shaft is turning and it is necessary to provide secondary sealing.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Contact (gland) sealings, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954408911425886">Figure 1(b)</xref>, are cells with soft filling which come into direct contact with the shaft surface which they are sealing. Water is used as the lubricating and cooling fluid. Water under pressure is supplied to a lantern ring. From the lantern ring, water flows out and spray prevents the penetration of solid particles in the gaps between the sleeves and shaft. Water lubricates and cools the seal. They can have limited flow, when the volume of the seal casing is filled with limited amount of water, that prevents the contact of slurry with the sealing elements, or they can have a full flow, i.e. when the amount of sealing water is increased.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mechanical sealing, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954408911425886">Figure 1(c)</xref>, with sliding rings has so far been rarely used on pumps used for the hydraulic transport of solid materials (they are used on pumps for crude oil) since their construction is expensive and the life span is not long enough to justify the increased expenses. Since with most of the high-speed machines (pump shaft rotation speed in the range: 700–1500 o/min is considered as a normal speed. Anything above this speed is high speed.), mechanical sealings are more often used for shaft sealing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954408911425886">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954408911425886">10</xref></sup></p></list-item>

<p>The high surface pressure, high sliding speed, operation in abrasive surroundings, strong corrosion, etc. together with the demands with regard to sealing reliability impose the need for a more careful choice of material, quality construction, precise installing and quality maintenance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954408911425886">11</xref></sup> It has been proven that the new technical solutions, new materials and procedures for increasing the resistance to wearing (thermic treatment, hard coatings and other forms of processing) are insufficient for acquiring an optimal solution,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954408911425886">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954408911425886">13</xref></sup> i.e. a complex approach is needed, that would, based on the experimental work, accept the specific exploitation conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954408911425886">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954408911425886">6</xref></sup> With regard to pumps used for the hydraulic transport of solid materials (crude oil), the experience so far has shown that the sealing life span is mostly influenced by the wearing – the consequence of impact-contact pressure and the presence of abrasive (mineral particles) in the transported slurry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954408911425886">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954408911425886">6</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec2-0954408911425886"><title>Test pump and the research procedure</title>
<p>The performance of a mechanical seal is improved when wear at the sealing surfaces can be eliminated or greatly reduced. The causes of wear at the seal face have been identified as:
<list id="list3-0954408911425886" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>impact load;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>erosive wear.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Each is the result of abrasive particles being moved through the pump.</p>
<p>The impact load arises as a consequence of the shaft percussion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954408911425886">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954408911425886">16</xref></sup> This movement is the consequence of inertia forces, unbalanced masses of the impeller and expeller, which lead to a moment that tends to separate–connect the sliding rings of the mechanical seal. Movement of the free ring leads to strong contact (impact) load which results in deteriorated lubricating conditions (dry or semi-wet friction), material fatigue contact surface deformation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954408911425886">Figure 2</xref>, and loss of mass and sealing. Mating surface is immobile ring with similar damages.

<p>Research studies are planned with a basic aim of acquiring valid data on material behaviour as well as of the sealings, in whole, under specific exploitation conditions. The existing test facilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954408911425886">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954408911425886">19</xref></sup> do not satisfy the set tasks, and therefore work on a new test facility has begun, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954408911425886">Figure 3</xref>.

<p>The test pump has the ability to work with slurry or crude oil.</p>
<p>The concentration of the solids, in the chamber (3) with slurry, is maintained stable by circulating the slurry through the pipe connections (8). The stationary (11) and the rotating (12) sliding rings are set in the sealing cell, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954408911425886">Figure 4</xref>. The ring (12) is tied to the hub (13) that is integrated with the shaft (4), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954408911425886">Figure 3</xref>. The force of the contact pressure is realized by tying the thrust pin (14) and the spring (16). For the research on the sliding ring wearing, of a mechanical seal, on the lubricating part of the facility, two working regimes have been used: lubrication with oil and water. Oil or water, in the sealing cell, circles through the pipe connections (7).

<p>By analysing the results acquired during the research, one can realize the following.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0954408911425886"><title>The operating regime when oil is the lubricating fluid (semi-wet friction)</title>
<p>Mechanical seals are widely used in pumps for the transport of crude oil. In addition to gas, oil contains water, sand (up to 3%), and so on. For lubrication, cooling of the seal oil or cleaned crude oil is used. One of the aims of this study is to observe the behaviour of these seals in terms of working with crude oil. Tests were performed for all samples provided in test plan. Typical image of wear for pair Č1530–Č1530 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954408911425886">Figure 7</xref>.
<fig id="fig7-0954408911425886" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Wear of sliding ring.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954408911425886-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The friction pair bronze–steel (CuSn14–ČL1530) gives higher wearing intensity when compared to etalon (friction pair: steel–steel ČL1530–ČL1530). Also, the roughness surface is higher (<italic>Ra</italic> = 2–20 µm) which leads to wrong assembly tightness. This is explained by the domination of the plastic contact, with oil and abrasive, and the full gap. Friction pairs ČL4751–ČL4751, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>–Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and PTFE K20–Č1530 with values 5.73, 2.76 and 7.0 show greater resistance to wearing in comparison to etalon (Č1530–Č1530). Friction pair Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>–Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> shows admirable resistance to wearing until a part of it is damaged or the protection layer is worn. After that, wearing intensification ensues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0954408911425886"><title>The operating regime when water is the lubricating fluid-wet friction</title>
<p>In classical solutions of the seal, water is commonly used as a sealing and lubricating fluid. Therefore, in these tests, water is used as a lubricating fluid.</p>
<p>Reduced water flow leads to intensive wear of sliding ring. This wear is the strongest on the output edges of the ring. Three characteristic zones are noticeable, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954408911425886">Figure 8</xref>.
<list id="list5-0954408911425886" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>I – Zone of intensive wearing, whereas the wearing process is the consequence of particle impact and depends on the abrasive size and the relation of pressure in the chamber containing slurry and the sealing chamber.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Zone II has the shape of a gap and in it, wearing is the consequence of sliding and micro-chipping caused by crushed abrasive particles.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Zone III has still not been protruded by abrasive particles and in it, assembly tightness has been kept. The ring life span (assembly tightness) defines the values of this zone.</p></list-item>
</list>
<fig id="fig8-0954408911425886" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>A typical wearing profile of sliding rings surrounded by slurry (reduced flow): (10) O-ring, (11) sliding plate and (12) sliding ring.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954408911425886-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The wearing is minimal, i.e. it is noticed only on the peripheral edges of the rings. The friction coefficient is minimal as well. The fluid temperature in the contact zone is only slightly increased.</p>
<p>When the water flow increased, the following improvements were observed.
<list id="list6-0954408911425886" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The absence of intensive wearing of sliding ring edges is explained by the influence of water jet, which flows out of the gap in between the rings and removes the abrasive particles in the gap zone.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A larger amount of water that flows out of the contact gap reduces the friction coefficient and the water temperature as well.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Still, the increased amount of water negatively influences the quality of the transported slurry; so, frequent application of this solution is inadmissible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0954408911425886"><title>The new solution</title>
<p>Noticing the weaknesses of the existing construction (poor sealing of the large pressure differences and great oscillation which causes strong impact load), the author formed a new constructive solution, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954408911425886">Figure 9</xref>, which he has also tested on the experimental facility. New technical solution is aimed at the reconstruction of the pump sealing system that works on transportation of flotation tailings. The novelty is mainly in replacement of centrifugal seals with mechanical seal. To achieve this, minimal changes are made in the construction of impeller shaft (1) and back liner. The back liner is fastened with screws and plate (10) on which slide rings (12) are present. Rings (12) are placed inside the casing (14), which is inside the casing (15). Rotation of shaft (1) through the casings (15) and (14) is transferred to the sliding rings (12) to slide by a thin layer of lubricator (water). A force of pressure in the lubricator layer separates the mobile rings (12) from immobile ones (10). The termination of rings rotates the pressure force, in a layer of fluid between the rings (12), and drops and the rings (12) under the influence of pressure force in O-rings (13) close the gap and seal becomes completely hermetic.

<p>The new solution has also been tested on the experimental facility. Testing was done only with water with the same working regime as was done in the previous case. For sealing rings, the following pair was applied:ČL4751–ČL4751. By this constructive solution the following has been achieved:

<list-item><p>smooth operation of seals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954408911425886">Figure 10</xref>, without impact load, because the angular movement, through the casings (14) and (15), is transferred to the sliding rings (12), which adjust its position to the fixed plate (10);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the force of pressure in the fluid provides a non-contact operation of the rings; friction is reduced to a minimum and seal tightness is kept at all operating conditions.</p></list-item>

<sec id="sec7-0954408911425886" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Frequent failure of the slurry pumps, which is a result of defects in the sealing device, forced us to look for new solutions, solutions that should reduce failures at the pumps. To reach the optimal solution, both the choice of materials and the selection of construction are necessary to dispose off abundant information: the characteristics of the transported material, conditions of slurry pump work, available resources, ability to maintain, and so on. Information obtained during the exploitation are reliable, but obtaining them is associated with long-time collection and high cost. To avoid this, the author proposes a short testing procedures on the experimental plants, wherein conditions similar to conditions of exploitation can get large amount of data useful for selection of materials and design. Part of the test procedure and the received results is presented in this article. Based on this research, the author has formed an innovative solution that is characterized by.
<list id="list8-0954408911425886" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The possibility of better sealing in comparison with dynamic seals.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Wear is radically reduced. The reasons are: around the rotating body, centrifugal field is formed which prevents the solid particles to reach the interior of the seal. The termination of rotation of the sliding rings closes the gap completely hermetic which prevents the penetration of solid particles into the inner part of seal.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Water in gap between the sliding rings reduces the friction and power losses.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Constructive solution of seal housing enables self-adjustment of sliding ring and prevents impact load. The result is longer working life and better sealing.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The use of water has been decreased (from 60 to 2 L/min).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>As a final result of this study, we have effective sealing, the maintenance expenses have been decreased, the sealing construction working life extended (550–600 to 3000 h). Greater availability of the slurry pump and lower expenses are facts that justify the work invested into this facility. The research procedures carried out and the formed test facility can successfully be used for the research of sealing in different working conditions.</p>
