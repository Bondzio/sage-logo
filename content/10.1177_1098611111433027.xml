<p>The “veil-of-darkness” method is an innovative and low-cost approach that circumvents many of the benchmarking issues that arise in testing for racial profiling. Changes in natural lighting are used to establish a presumptively more race-neutral benchmark on the assumption that after dark, police suffer an impaired ability to detect motorists’ race. Applying the veil-of-darkness method to vehicle stops by the Syracuse (NY) police between 2006 and 2009 and examining differences among officers assigned to specialized traffic units and crime-suppression units, we found that African Americans were no more likely to be stopped during daylight than during darkness, indicating no racial bias.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Innumerable state and local police agencies collect data on the traffic stops that their officers make, as part of an effort to address public concerns about racial profiling. Analyses of those data, for the purpose of drawing inferences about the nature and source(s) of any racial disparities, confront thorny challenges. Ideally, clues about racial bias would emerge from a comparison of the characteristics of the people stopped by the police with the characteristics of the people who could have been legitimately stopped; discrepancies between the former and the latter might suggest that police stops were influenced by factors other than the behavior of the citizens involved.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1098611111433027">1</xref></sup> Unfortunately, however, satisfactorily valid information on the latter population, which represents a suitable “benchmark,” is at best difficult and costly to come by; this is the widely discussed benchmarking problem in analyses of racial bias in police stops.</p>
<p>The “veil-of-darkness” method, devised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098611111433027">Grogger and Ridgeway (2006)</xref>, is an innovative and low-cost approach to resolving many of these issues. The basic idea is to use changes in natural lighting to establish a benchmark, on the assumption that after dark, police officers suffer a degraded ability to detect motorists’ race; the pattern of stops during darkness represents the presumptively more race-neutral benchmark, against which the pattern of stops during daytime can be compared. The comparison is limited to stops that occur “near the boundary of daylight and darkness,” in what has been called the “intertwilight” period, lest the analysis confound differences in officers’ decisions to stop with changes in the composition of the driving (and violator) population across the hours of the day. To our knowledge, this method has been applied in analyses of stops in only three cities: Oakland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098611111433027">Grogger &amp; Ridgeway, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098611111433027">Oakland Police Department, 2004</xref>, pp. 40-43), Cincinnati (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098611111433027">Ridgeway, 2009</xref>), and Minneapolis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1098611111433027">Ritter &amp; Bael, 2009</xref>). It may be useful in many sites that seek answers to questions about racial profiling by police, and we believe that it should be considered as one—or the—approach in cities and departments that are examining patterns of vehicle stops by police. The potential utility of the method would be enhanced by the accumulation of the analytical results that its application yields, and so in this article we report the results of our application of the veil-of-darkness method to data on vehicle stops by the Syracuse (NY) police.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1098611111433027">Tillyer, Engel, and Wooldredge (2008)</xref> observe that “[w]hile there is some consensus in the research community that residential census populations are the least reliable of the benchmarks available, there is no such consensus regarding the validity of other techniques” (p. 143). If a consensus is to form, it will likely take shape only with the execution and dissemination of individual studies like this one. No one study can by itself establish a sufficient base of knowledge to support assertions about valid (and invalid) benchmarks, and so as in the past, further advances in our knowledge about racial profiling and the analysis of racial profiling will turn mainly on the incremental accumulation of findings across individual studies.</p>
<p>Public concern about racial profiling by Syracuse police prompted the collection of data on stops in that city, beginning in 2001. We examine stops conducted and recorded between 2006 and 2009, inclusive. First we review the development and previous applications of the veil-of-darkness method. Then, we describe stops by Syracuse police: the temporal and spatial distributions of the stops, the assignments of the officers who made the stops, the reasons for the stops, and the characteristics of the people who are stopped. Then we present the veil-of-darkness analysis of Syracuse stops.</p>

<sec id="section2-1098611111433027">
<title>The Veil-of-Darkness Method</title>
<p>Noting the costs of many benchmarking techniques, such as observations of vehicular traffic, and their inevitable flaws (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098611111433027">Engel, Calnon, &amp; Bernard, 2002</xref>, pp. 256-258; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098611111433027">Engel &amp; Calnon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098611111433027">Tillyer, Engel, &amp; Cherkauskas, 2010</xref>), Grogger and Ridgeway propose a fairly simple test based primarily on a simple and plausible assumption: If police are more prone to stop African American drivers, evidence of their bias will be more pronounced among stops made in daylight, when drivers’ race can be more readily detected. They stress that the method need not presume that race is completely obscured without natural light (or that race is completely visible with it), but rather only that officers’ ability to discern drivers’ race is impaired in darkness; that is, the race neutrality of nighttime stops is relative, not absolute. This is an assumption that has intuitive appeal, and it is also consistent with the experiences of several researchers who, for the construction of benchmarks, sought to detect and record the race of drivers. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098611111433027">Ridgeway (2009</xref>, p. 12) reports, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098611111433027">Greenwald (2001)</xref> abandoned plans to conduct nighttime observations of traffic on learning that the race of only 6% of drivers could be determined around dusk, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098611111433027">Lamberth’s (2003)</xref> traffic survey required auxiliary lighting for nighttime observations. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098611111433027">Lange, Johnson, and Voas (2005</xref>, pp. 201-202) used two large strobe lights in taking high-resolution photographs of vehicles on the New Jersey Turnpike.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to overstate the importance of valid, credible benchmarks in analyzing data on police stops for evidence of racial bias. A host of factors other than racial bias—some organizational, such as the allocation of patrol resources across police beats, and some individual—may affect the number of stops conducted by police and their distribution across social space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098611111433027">Engel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111433027">Stroshine, Alpert, &amp; Dunham, 2008</xref>). Plausibly eliminating those other factors as explanations for racial disparities is the analytical burden borne by any analysis of stops. Moreover, any racial bias would affect officers’ behavior (consciously and deliberately or unconsciously and stereotypically) at the margin, net of (or contingent on) other factors, such as the seriousness of violations (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1098611111433027">Fyfe, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1098611111433027">Smith, Visher, &amp; Davidson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1098611111433027">Worden, 1995</xref>; more generally see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098611111433027">National Research Council, 2004</xref>, pp. 122-126); even with a perfect calibration of any racial bias, then, we would not in most cases expect it to be very large in magnitude. Against this analytical backdrop, the shortcomings of the benchmarks used in previous analyses are thrown into stark relief. Some analyses of police stops compare the racial composition of those who are stopped with the racial composition of the residential population, even though it is typically acknowledged that the comparison is liable to be misleading for several reasons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1098611111433027">2</xref></sup> A number of studies have conducted field research in an effort to form a benchmark for comparison that more plausibly captures the characteristics of the violator population, sampling times and places at which the race of passing motorists is tabulated, and even providing for the use of radar or “rolling surveys” to tabulate <italic>violators’</italic> race. These approaches provide benchmarks that are superior to census data on the residential population, but none of them captures all of the legitimate reasons for police stops, and most may be better suited to highway traffic enforcement than to city policing. Worse still, the costs of constructing these benchmarks can be considerable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1098611111433027">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The veil-of-darkness method may offer a solution as simple as it is inexpensive, but as Grogger and Ridgeway caution, some additional assumptions or controls are necessary. One is to limit the analysis to the “intertwilight” period: Depending on the time of year, stops made at any point during this time frame may have been initiated in darkness or during daylight, but in this delimited period of time during each day, we might presume that the driving population does not change dramatically. In addition, however, they impose additional controls for changes in the driving population across times of the day as well as seasons of the year. In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098611111433027">Ridgeway (2009</xref>) takes advantage of the semiannual changes to and from Daylight Savings Time (DST), which allows an analyst to still more effectively hold time of day constant—and with it, presumably, patterns of driving—as natural lighting abruptly shifts. This DST-focused analysis, delimited to 30 days before and after the switches to and from DST, sacrifices a large degree of statistical power, but it may be advantageous in controlling for seasonal variation in driving patterns. Grogger and Ridgeway also provide for statistical controls for clock time and for geographic areas across which police deployments can vary, in analyzing intertwilight stops across the entire year. Furthermore, the analysis may be confined to stops for moving violations, given that some kinds of equipment violations (e.g., malfunctioning headlights) are uniquely nighttime violations, and it is conceivable that the incidence of such equipment violations is also correlated with drivers’ race.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1098611111433027">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>To our knowledge, the veil-of-darkness method has been applied previously only in Oakland, Cincinnati, and Minneapolis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1098611111433027">5</xref></sup> The RAND corporation analyzed stop data collected in Oakland from June through December, 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098611111433027">Oakland Police Department, 2004</xref>). During that time, Oakland police recorded information on 7,607 stops, though with substantial underreporting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1098611111433027">6</xref></sup> The analysis focused on stops for moving violations in Oakland’s intertwilight period, from 5:19 p.m. to 9:06 p.m. Stops between sunset and the end of civil twilight were excluded, inasmuch as the visibility at that time of day was ambiguous. In all, 976 stops were subjected to analysis. To control for potential changes in the driving population within the intertwilight period, additional analysis focused on 1 hour before and after the end of civil twilight. To control for seasonal changes in the driving population during intertwilight hours, another analysis focused on only stops during October and November. In each analysis, Blacks were somewhat <italic>less</italic> likely to be stopped during the day, contrary to the pattern that would be observed if officers engaged in racial profiling.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098611111433027">Grogger and Ridgeway (2006)</xref> analyzed the same Oakland stop data. From the 7,607 stops, Grogger and Ridgeway excluded 329 that were made pursuant to a criminal investigation, and an additional 776 with missing data. From among the remaining, usable stops, they focused mainly on 1,130 made in the intertwilight period, including stops for nonmoving (equipment or registration) violations. They note, however, that their results were insensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of stops for nonmoving violations, which they suggest would generally comprise a small proportion of all stops (p. 886). They too found no evidence of racial bias.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098611111433027">Ridgeway (2009</xref>) analyzed vehicle stops by Cincinnati police, including those in 2008 and those in the 2003-2008 period. His analysis of 2008 stops focused primarily on 598 stops for moving violations in the intertwilight period—5:50 p.m. to 8:06 p.m.—and within 30 days of the spring and fall switches to and from DST. Additional analysis examined 5,036 stops for moving violations in the intertwilight period across the entire year, which represented about 14% of the stops for moving violations at any time of the day and about 9% of the vehicle stops. Ridgeway’s analysis of 2003-2008 stops included 3,726 stops within 30 days of a DST switch and 28,927 across all seasons of the 6 years. None of these analyses yielded evidence of racial profiling, and in 2008, Blacks were less likely to be stopped during the daytime.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1098611111433027">Ritter and Bael (2009)</xref> analyzed data on 53,559 stops by the Minneapolis police in 2002. The “official report” on Minneapolis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098611111433027">Council on Crime and Justice and Institute on Race and Poverty, 2003</xref>), which relied on comparisons of the racial composition of the drivers who were stopped with that of the (approximated) driving population, concluded that Blacks and Latinos were stopped with disproportionate frequency. Noting the respects in which the benchmark failed to eliminate alternative explanations for racial disparities, Ritter and Bael applied the veil-of-darkness method to the same data. Focusing on intertwilight stops and controlling statistically for the time of day, they report substantively and statistically significant differences in the probabilities with which Blacks and Latinos are stopped in daylight rather than darkness, and the differences are uniformly consistent with the racial profiling proposition.</p>
<sec id="section3-1098611111433027">
<title>Looking for Bias in All the Right Places</title>
<p>We might expect that evidence of racial profiling would be most likely to emerge among officers whose assignments are the most crime focused. Anecdotal accounts of profiling attest to its crime-detection emphasis. One type of situation is a driver or passengers who do not “match” the vehicle—for example, a BMW with an African American driver. Another type of situation is a person of color traveling through predominantly White neighborhoods, stopped by police because they do not “belong” there and may be engaged in criminal activity. More generally, “[p]olice departments often use traffic-stops as a means of ferreting out illicit drugs and weapons,” and “[t]he escalating pressure from the war on drugs has led some police officers to target people of color whom police believe to be disproportionally involved in drug use and trafficking” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1098611111433027">Ramirez, McDevitt, &amp; Farrell, 2000</xref>, pp. 9-10). Insofar as race is (an inappropriate) part of an offender profile, we would expect that its use would be most prevalent among officers with a specialized crime-suppression mission. By contrast, officers assigned to traffic units have, in the policing context, fairly unambiguous operational objectives: issuing tickets for traffic violations. Some of their work is supported by grant funding that reinforces the mission focus. We would therefore expect that racial profiling would be least prevalent among traffic officers. Other things being equal, then, we would expect that the officers with specialized crime-focused assignments would be most likely, and traffic officers the least likely, to exhibit a disparity between daylight and darkness in the percentages of minority drivers stopped—patterns that would be attenuated in the aggregate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1098611111433027">7</xref></sup> Hence we conduct separate analysis of the stops made by officers with these specialized assignments and by patrol officers, respectively.</p>

<title>Stops by Syracuse Police</title>
<p>Located in central New York, Syracuse is a city of 25 sq. miles and nearly 150,000 people (based on the 2000 census), one quarter of whom were Black, and nearly two thirds of whom were White, 5% were Hispanic. Syracuse is the urban center of a metropolitan county of more than 450,000 people, and both north–south and east–west limited-access highways intersect near the geographic center of the city. Syracuse is served by a police department of nearly 500 sworn officers.</p>
<p>We replicate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098611111433027">Ridgeway’s (2009)</xref> veil-of-darkness analysis of Cincinnati stops, albeit in a city with a substantially longer intertwilight period, during which (proportionally) much larger numbers of stops were made. The Syracuse Police Department (SPD) provided data on stops conducted in a 4-year period, from 2006 through 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1098611111433027">8</xref></sup> Information about these stops is drawn from two sources: citizen contact forms, which are completed by Syracuse police when they have enforcement-related contacts with citizens that do not eventuate in an arrest and arrest reports for “on-view” arrests (i.e., arrests made in incidents that officers initiated rather than pursuant to a dispatch).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1098611111433027">9</xref></sup> The citizen contact forms include much of the information that is needed for analysis of the kind normally performed on this subject, though these records lack some information about searches, particularly the reason for the search. Moreover, the arrest records do not capture information about the reasons for stops, nor do they contain information about searches.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1098611111433027">10</xref></sup> Hence we examine stops but not poststop outcomes.</p>
<p>In addition, we examine the differences among officers assigned to different units, including specialized traffic units and crime-suppression units. SPD personnel manually coded information on officers’ assignments for 1 of the 4 years (2009), identifying those assigned to either the traffic division or to the Crime Reduction Team (CRT), so that we could examine patterns by officers in each of these units separately. The traffic division is responsible for proactive enforcement of state vehicle and traffic laws and vehicle-related city ordinances. The CRT focuses on reducing violent and other crime, is deployed mainly to high-crime areas, and uses proactive patrol tactics.</p>
<p>We have confined our focus to vehicle stops, on the presumption that the veil-of-darkness method does not apply plausibly to pedestrian stops.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1098611111433027">11</xref></sup> Syracuse police made more than 50,000 vehicle stops in the 4 years examined here, 87% of which were documented on a citizen contact form. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1098611111433027">Table 1</xref> shows the distribution of stops across times of the day, overall and, for 2009, by officer assignment. We would of course expect that the numbers of vehicle stops would fluctuate with both the volume of vehicular traffic and the deployment of police, and so it is no surprise that stops are most numerous during the afternoon commuting hours and the evening hours. Stops in the intertwilight period comprise about one third of the stops in Syracuse.</p>

<p>To some degree the numbers and the mix of vehicle stops vary across the hours of the day with the deployment of different units. CRT officers make virtually all of their stops between 3 p.m. and 3 a.m., with 80% of them between 3 p.m. and 11 p.m., although CRT stops represent only 15.3% of all of the vehicle stops. Most of the vehicle stops by traffic officers are made between 3 p.m. and 3 a.m. Between 3 a.m. and 3 p.m., the majority of vehicle stops—52%—are made by officers who are not assigned to one of these specialized units. Stops in the intertwilight period are disproportionately made by traffic and CRT officers, compared with other times of the day.</p>
<p>We also note that vehicle stops are widely distributed spatially, but they are more densely concentrated in the central parts of the city, and especially along major traffic arterials.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1098611111433027">12</xref></sup> When the spatial distribution is disaggregated by officers’ assignments, they exhibit differences that are consistent with the units’ respective missions. Stops by CRT officers are more concentrated spatially, and in areas that tend to have higher rates of crime. Stops by traffic officers are more widely dispersed and tend to be congruent with major traffic arterials. Stops by officers with neither of these assignments are also rather widely dispersed but appear to cluster more in higher crime areas than the traffic officers’ stops do, which may reflect deployment patterns.</p>

<title>Intertwilight Stops</title>
<p>Our analytic focus, in testing for evidence of racial bias in stops, is on the stops made during the intertwilight period. The intertwilight period is marked by the earliest time at which civil twilight ends during the year—in Syracuse, that is 5:02 p.m. in December—and the latest time at which civil twilight ends—in Syracuse, 9:23 p.m. in June. (Vehicle stops during the morning intertwilight period—approximately 5 a.m. to 7 a.m. in Syracuse—are far less numerous, and we do not include them in our veil-of-darkness analysis.) The driving population might change some over this period of time, as we discuss below, but not as much as the population would be expected to change across all of the hours of the day, and so to a degree, the focus on the intertwilight period serves to control for officers’ opportunities to make stops. Here, we briefly describe these stops: the reasons for the stops, the assignments of the officers who make them, and the characteristics of the people who are stopped. One would be properly concerned about the degree to which stops during the intertwilight period resemble those made during the other hours of the day, so these comparisons set an important context for interpreting the results of the veil-of-darkness analysis.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1098611111433027">Table 2</xref> displays the reasons for the stops, as officers recorded them, across all 4 years and for 2009 for officers with different assignments; intertwilight stops are shown in each cell with the corresponding numbers and percentages of all stops, regardless of time of day, appearing within parentheses. The reasons for stops during the intertwilight period mirror those for stops more generally: at least three quarters of the stops were made for traffic violations, and the proportion is probably higher still, assuming that a fraction of the stops ending in arrests began as stops for traffic violations and through investigation (e.g., warrant checks or searches) officers established probable cause for arrest. Fewer suspicion stops are made in the intertwilight period than at other times of the day, but they are few in number generally.</p>

<p>When the reasons for stops are disaggregated by officers’ assignments, we likewise find that the stops during the intertwilight period display a pattern that resembles that of stops more generally (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1098611111433027">Table 2</xref>), and also that the stops made by traffic officers, CRT officers, and all other officers, respectively, exhibit somewhat different patterns that are consistent with their respective missions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1098611111433027">13</xref></sup> Overall (across all hours of the day), approximately 55% of the stops were made by officers assigned to the traffic division, and all but very small fractions of the stops made by traffic officers were, as expected, for traffic violations. A larger proportion of the stops made by CRT officers either end in arrest or are of suspicious vehicles or people; given the nature of these officers’ assignments, this too is as expected. We infer that other officers (mainly patrol officers) also make, proportionally, fewer stops merely for traffic violations than traffic division officers do, and compared with CRT officers, a smaller fraction of these stops resulted in arrest.</p>
<p>The people stopped during the intertwilight period differ somewhat, as a group, from the larger population of those who are stopped.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1098611111433027">14</xref></sup> A slim majority of the people stopped in this period are African American, and compared with the stopped population as a whole, they are disproportionately African American, as well as disproportionately younger and male (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1098611111433027">Table 3</xref>).

<p>The composition of the stopped population differs some for officers with different assignments. A majority of the people stopped by traffic division officers are White; compared with the people stopped by other police units, a somewhat smaller proportion of those stopped by the traffic division are men, and the distribution of ages is more nearly even. The people stopped by CRT officers are disproportionately African American, male, and young, as one would expect given their unit’s mission: These officers work mainly in higher crime areas, which tend to have a greater residential representation of minorities, and offenders are disproportionately young men.</p>

<title>Testing for Racial Bias in Stops</title>
<p>The simplest application of the veil-of-darkness method is to compare two proportions: of those who are stopped during daylight, the proportion who are African American; and of those who are stopped during darkness, the proportion who are African American. If police are biased against African Americans in making stops, then the former proportion will be larger than the latter. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1098611111433027">Figure 1</xref> displays these proportions as a line graph. For each half hour interval between 5 p.m. and 9:30 p.m., the solid line represents the percentage of stops in daylight that involved at least one Black occupant, whereas the dashed line represents the percentage of stops in darkness that involved at least one Black occupant, with the scale of percentages on the left axis.</p>

<p>Percent stops of African Americans, daylight and darkness</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1098611111433027-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Two facts are immediately apparent from the line graph. First, the proportion of stops involving a Black occupant varies some across the intertwilight period, increasing from 5:00 until about 7:00, and then holding roughly steady. We attribute this pattern mainly to a changing composition of the driving population, though it could be partly a function of police deployment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1098611111433027">15</xref></sup> Second, and more importantly, the proportions of stops involving Black occupants during daylight and darkness, respectively, are in the main quite similar during each clock-time interval, with the possible exception of the 8:30-8:59 interval, when 50% of the nighttime stops, and 57% of the daytime stops, involved one or more African Americans. The daytime–nighttime disparity in the 8:30-8:59 interval is consistent with a pattern of racial bias, but otherwise the disparities are small and several are in the opposite direction, leading us to infer that this one larger difference is a statistical anomaly.</p>
<p>A more analytically powerful—but less visually intuitive—approach is to statistically control for variation in time and place, so that we can better isolate the effect of daylight on the probability that an African American will be stopped. We use the technique of logistic regression to hold clock time (in 15-minute intervals), day of week, and police beat constant. From the regression results, we compute an odds ratio that indicates how many times more likely it is that daylight stops involved an African American citizen, compared with nighttime stops. An odds ratio of 1.0 tells us that African Americans were no more (and no less) likely to be stopped during daylight than in darkness. An odds ratio greater than 1.0 is consistent with an inference of racial bias, signifying that African Americans were more likely to be stopped during daylight than in darkness. An odds ratio of less than 1.0 signifies that African Americans were less likely to be stopped during daylight than in darkness, a pattern contrary to the proposition that stops are racially biased. We conduct this analysis for each year and for all 4 years together, with the relevant results displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1098611111433027">Table 4</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1098611111433027">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>DST-Focused Analysis</title>
<p>When we delimit the analysis to stops conducted in the 30 days before and after the switch to or from DST, thereby controlling for seasonal differences in the driving population, we find for the most part similar patterns, with one exception; see the columns on the right of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1098611111433027">Table 4</xref>. Overall and for 3 of the 4 years, the odds ratios are all well within a 95% confidence interval around 1.0, and while that fact does not prove the null hypothesis of no racial bias, we would take the point estimates to signify no more than a small difference between day and night in the likelihood that an African American would be stopped. For 2008, however, the odds ratio is substantially and statistically greater than 1.0, consistent with an inference of racial bias. We are aware of no police operations or other events that might have coincided with the transition from or to DST in 2008, and neither are the SPD command staff with whom we discussed this finding. We can offer no substantive explanation why such a pattern would emerge in 1 year and in none of the others, before and since, and this isolated result prompts us to doubt whether this reflects a larger pattern of police behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1098611111433027">20</xref></sup></p>

These differences remain with controls for police beat in a logistic regression: CRT officers are twice as likely to stop a Black motorist as other (mainly patrol) officers are, whereas traffic officers are two-thirds as likely to stop a Black motorist.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1098611111433027">21</xref></sup> When we conduct separate analyses of CRT, traffic, and other officers, respectively, we find that the odds ratios conform with our a priori expectations; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1098611111433027">Table 5</xref>. The odds ratio for CRT officers is not only larger than 1.0, but also substantively large (1.376) and greater than those for other officers; the odds ratio for traffic officers is the smallest of the three. All of the odds ratios, however, are within a 90% confidence interval of 1.0 and of one another. We can reject neither the null hypothesis of race-neutral stops for any of these three groups nor the null hypothesis that officers with different assignments exhibit the same pattern of stops, but in view of the estimated odds ratios, <italic>N</italic>s, and confidence intervals, we cannot conclude that all three sets of officers are unbiased in their stops.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Addressing the reality and the perceptions of biased policing calls for serious efforts to detect patterns of racially biased police practices, determine the origins of any bias that is detected, and establish fair and equitable practices. But detecting bias in police practice is subject to daunting analytic challenges in discriminating biases—subtle biases—from systematic but legitimate influences as well as stochastic effects. Policing is a complex set of tasks, with ambiguous and even conflicting goals. Information about police–citizen encounters is never as rich as the events are nuanced, and analysis requires simplifying assumptions that can sometimes yield misleading results. Erroneous findings could eventuate in unwarranted and unproductive—even counterproductive—policy interventions or in inaction that leaves serious concerns unresolved. Social scientists have made herculean efforts over the past decade to identify the analytical pitfalls of racial profiling research and devise methods that avoid those pitfalls, and even with good faith efforts by cities and researchers to fund and implement those methods, the research seldom if ever supports definitive conclusions. Firm conclusions are inevitably elusive, given the inability of any analyst to establish indisputably valid benchmarks. Moreover, the best benchmarks are not inexpensive to form. A more economical approach that promises to generate equally (or more) credible results is needed, one that can be applied even in cash-strapped municipalities whose concern about racial profiling by police outstrips their ability to pay for benchmarking data collection.</p>
<p>The veil-of-darkness method might be that approach. It may be as close to a strong quasi-experiment as research on racial profiling can come, minimizing the variables that should be measured and statistically controlled; economical studies of racial profiling cannot measure and analyze all or even most of the factors that affect officers’ decisions to stop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098611111433027">Engel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111433027">Stroshine et al., 2008</xref>). In our judgment, the veil-of-darkness approach affords the most useful, cost-effective benchmark yet devised. Although no analysis of data, of the kind examined here, can definitively establish that officers’ decisions to stop citizens are—or are not—influenced by racial bias, the preponderantly null finding yielded by the veil-of-darkness analysis of Syracuse stops is, we believe, fairly persuasive evidence of racial neutrality by Syracuse police in making traffic stops. By themselves, these findings are of particular interest mainly to the people of Syracuse, but like the findings of other analyses of individual cities, they are also of value to the field more generally, as our knowledge of policing practices and methods of analysis deepens with the accumulation of studies like this one.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1098611111433027">22</xref></sup></p>

<p>Discrepancies could also arise from differences in exposure to law enforcement and the risk of detection and enforcement action associated with the violation.</p></fn>

A benchmark should approximate the racial composition of the population that could be legitimately stopped by police, given their deployment patterns and race neutrality in stopping vehicles. Data on the residential population are readily available in the U.S. Census, but they provide a poor approximation. The residential population includes people who do not drive, and the driving population in many places includes people who are not residents. Among those who do drive, one can find variation in how much they drive and, perhaps more importantly, in their commission of traffic violations or other acts that make them legitimately susceptible to police intervention.</p></fn>

<p>For example, a recent analysis of stops by Cleveland police provided for 557 hours of observation of traffic and traffic violations in order to form a benchmark; observations were done by pairs of trained observers who recorded data on 41,257 vehicles, their drivers, and moving violations across ten selected locations in the city. Only 10 locations could be observed “due to budgetary limitations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098611111433027">Engel, Frank, Tillyer, &amp; Klahm, 2006</xref>, p. x); we would conservatively estimate that the time of the observers alone would cost at least US$14,000, and the associated costs of instrumentation, sample selection, training and supervision, data entry, and analysis would double or triple the costs of an observation-based benchmark.</p></fn>

<label>4.</label>
<p>Although we believe that it would be best to always test for racial bias both with and without nonmoving violations in the analysis, we suppose neither that such violations are typically the reason for only a small proportion of stops (e.g., they comprised 22,351 of 56,609 vehicle stops in Cincinnati) nor that they should presumptively be removed from the analysis. Nonmoving violations are a heterogeneous category of infractions whose rates of commission and/or detection can be expected to vary across daylight and darkness. Headlight and taillight malfunctions are uniquely nighttime violations, and if race is correlated with these violations, then the assumption that the at-risk population is the same at any given time whether it is daylight or dark is violated. But many nonmoving violations, for example, expired registrations or inspections, are detectable mainly in daylight. Furthermore, emerging technology, such as automated license plate readers, enables police to readily detect registration and inspection violations in darkness, despite the lack of visibility.</p></fn>

<p>The RAND study of Oakland also included self-reports by officers of their ability to detect drivers’ race, as the stop data collection form included the question: “Could you determine prior to the stop whether the person was of color?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098611111433027">Oakland Police Department, 2004</xref>, p. 37). The construction of this item would seem to be suboptimal, and the report concludes that the use of these self-reports was “problematic” (2004, p. 39).</p></fn>

<p>Without forming hypotheses about the factors that might predispose some officers to disproportionately stop minority drivers, some researchers have conducted analyses of individual officers’ stop patterns, consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098611111433027">Walker’s (2001)</xref> proposal to construct an “internal” benchmark. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098611111433027">Ridgeway (2009</xref>) conducted such an analysis of Cincinnati stops, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098611111433027">Ridgeway (2007)</xref> also conducted an analysis of this kind of NYPD stop, question, and frisk encounters. The rationale can be succinctly stated: “racial profiling resembles other forms of police misconduct and will therefore be particularly acute among a small number of officers in any given agency” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098611111433027">Walker, 2001</xref>, p. 84). (But see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098611111433027">Fagan’s [2010]</xref> critique of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098611111433027">Ridgeway’s [2007]</xref> analysis.) The statistical results do not by themselves indicate that any officer’s stops are influenced by a racial bias, however, and in Syracuse, few officers make a sufficient number of stops to generate the statistical power needed to detect differences (Ridgeway used 50 as the minimum number of stops).</p></fn>

<p>These data included some duplicate records of individual events, which were removed prior to our analysis. In addition, we note here that for some stops the data on time or place were invalid, and as a consequence, these stops were eliminated from analysis that required data on time and place.</p></fn>

<p>We would also note, more generally, that many on-view arrests are not “stops” of the sort that arouse concern about racial profiling. The literature does not offer a widely accepted definition of a stop, but in general, stops are based either on an officer’s observation of a traffic or other minor violation, or on reasonable suspicion. Officer-initiated arrests based on probable cause—for example, pursuant to an investigation—do not fit the description of a stop. See, for example, the NYPD policy governing the completion of stop, question, and frisk (UF250) forms: “arrests that occur directly from a level-4 encounter . . . [in which an officer has probable cause to believe that an individual was involved in a crime] should not be documented on a UF250” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098611111433027">Ridgeway, 2007</xref>, p. 2).</p></fn>

<p>The numbers of on-view arrests that were recorded as vehicle stops declined substantially and sharply between 2007 and 2008, because during the summer of 2007, the Onondaga County 911 Center discontinued its use of the source code that identifies traffic stops (personal communication with Captain Richard Trudell, March 5, 2010). We have, consequently, made use of some additional information about the arrests that characterizes the nature of the incident. From among the codes in this information field, we identified three that we believe are reliably indicative of a vehicle stop: “stop”; “suspicious vehicle”; and “DWI.” We treat as a vehicle stop any on-view arrest in any of the 4 years that was entered as a “traffic stop” in the source field, or as one of these three incident types. We suppose that we have undercounted stops among the arrests in 2008 and 2009, but we believe that if we were to include arrests with other incident-type codes, we would likely capture not only additional vehicle stops but also arrests that did not stem from vehicle stops, thereby introducing a different kind of distortion into the analysis.</p></fn>

<p>Syracuse police effected nearly 4,000 pedestrian stops that did not end in arrest and an unknown number that did end in arrest. The findings that we report in this article do not speak to the existence of any bias in pedestrian stops, which are not amenable to analysis using the veil-of-darkness method. We suppose that pedestrian stops are prompted by crime-related objectives more consistently than vehicle stops are, and thus they may exhibit a different pattern, if we were able to describe that pattern in terms of a suitable benchmark. This may represent a more circumscribed analytical challenge, subject to different solution, but not one that has been devised to date; see Ridgeway’s analysis of NYPD stop, question, and frisk encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098611111433027">Ridgeway, 2007</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>Such variation in the composition of the driving population would not be unique to Syracuse. See, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1098611111433027">Smith et al.

<p>We include measures of statistical significance, even though we analyze the entire population of stops and not only a sample, because stops are subject to a number of stochastic or random elements, including at any given time the “available” population on the street, the volume of calls for service, the numbers of police units on duty, and the deployment of “details” or special operations that might augment or detract from the time that police have at their disposal to engage in proactive police work. However, we are mindful of the logic of null hypothesis significance testing, which is sometimes twisted in criminal justice research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1098611111433027">Weisburd, Lum, &amp; Yang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098611111433027">Bushway &amp; Sweeten, 2006</xref>), and we would submit that a Type II error is as important as a Type I error in analyses of racial profiling.</p></fn>

<p>Note that if the exclusion of stops ending in arrests distorts the pattern, it is not evident in the year-by-year results, at least within a margin of error. The odds ratios for years (2008 and 2009) in which we presumably underrepresent arrests are somewhat higher, but none is statistically distinguishable from 1.0.</p></fn>

<p>A post hoc power analysis shows that, with 17,172 intertwilight stops and a .05 alpha level, we would detect a 3% difference between the daytime and nighttime probabilities that an African American would be stopped 91 times out of 100. (The power analysis was conducted with G*Power 3 software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098611111433027">Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007]</xref>, with the conditional probability of an African American being stopped during daylight 53%, the probability of a stop occurring in the daytime set to 54.5%, and the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of other predictors set to .3, all based on the observed sample characteristics of the full sample. We note that post hoc power analysis is controversial; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1098611111433027">Hoenig &amp; Heisey, 2001</xref>.)</p>
<p>Be that as it may, taking careful account of the values of the odds ratios, and applying unconventionally large alpha values (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1098611111433027">Schneider &amp; Darcy, 1984</xref>), we infer from these results that overall, Syracuse police have not been biased in making stops.</p></fn>

<p>These results are insensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of stops made between sunset and the end of civil twilight, when visibility is ambiguous (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098611111433027">Grogger &amp; Ridgeway, 2006</xref>, p. 883).
