<title>Adverse Cardiac Events</title>
<p>A 12-month prospective observational study was conducted to determine the incidence of and risk factors for adverse cardiac events during catecholamine vasopressor therapy in 112 surgical intensive care unit patients with cardiovascular failure at a tertiary university teaching hospital. Catecholamine vasopressor therapy was defined as an infusion of 1 or more of the following drugs: norepinephrine, epinephrine, phenylephrine, and/or dopamine at dosages greater than 5 µg/kg/min. Adverse cardiac events were defined as prolonged elevated heart rate, tachyarrhythmia, myocardial cell damage, acute cardiac arrest or death, pulmonary hypertension-induced right heart dysfunction, and reduction of systemic blood flow. Approximately half of the study patients (54/112) developed a total of 114 adverse cardiac events. There was no difference in rate or type of adverse cardiac events between patients with or without chronic cardiovascular diseases or between patients with or without cardiac surgery. Patients who developed cardiac events often presented with higher heart rates, higher serum troponin concentrations, and received more catecholamine vasopressors simultaneously more often than patients who did not develop adverse cardiac events. Chronic liver disease, need for renal replacement therapy, the SAPS II, the number of catecholamine vasopressor drugs infused at time of study enrollment, and the duration of catecholamine vasopressor therapy were independently associated with the occurrence of adverse cardiac events. Use of epinephrine (reported odds ratio = 3.35; 95% confidence interval = 1.27-8.87; <italic>P</italic> = .02) and the dose of phenylephrine (reported odds ratio = 2.1; 95% confidence interval = 1.04-4.26; <italic>P</italic> = .04) were independently associated with the occurrence of adverse cardiac events.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that adverse cardiac events occur in almost half of surgical intensive care unit patients during catecholamine vasopressor therapy and are related to both morbidity and mortality. The proposed mechanism for adverse cardiac events is related to the distribution of adrenergic receptors on cardiac muscle and the agent’s activity on adrenergic postreceptor pathways.</p>

<title>Decreased Suicidal Thoughts and Behavior (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477012455144">*</xref>)</title>
<p>A reanalysis of randomized controlled trials on fluoxetine and venlafaxine was conducted to determine the impact antidepressants have on the course of depression and suicidal thoughts and behaviors in different age groups. All sponsor-conducted randomized controlled trials were included for a total of 12 adult, 4 geriatric, and 4 youth trials of fluoxetine and 21 adult trials of venlafaxine. The suicide items from the Children’s Depression Rating Scale–Revised and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale as well as adverse event reports of suicide attempts and suicide during active treatment were analyzed in 9185 patients (fluoxetine: 2635 adults, 960 geriatric patients, 708 youths; venlafaxine: 2421 adults with immediate-release venlafaxine and 2461 adults with extended-release venlafaxine) for a total of 53 260 person-week observations. In adult and geriatric patients randomized to fluoxetine or venlafaxine compared with placebo, suicidal thoughts and behavior decreased over time. No differences were found in youths. In all age groups, the severity of depression improved with medication use and was significantly related to suicide ideation or behavior.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that fluoxetine and venlafaxine decreased suicidal thoughts and behavior in adult and geriatric patients, and this was mediated by decreases in depressive symptoms with treatment. They added that the analyses examined the mediating role of depressive symptoms using complete longitudinal data from a large set of published and unpublished studies and this approach seeks to provide the clinician with a more accurate risk–benefit estimation for using antidepressants for major depressive disorder at all ages.</p>

<title>Major Bleeding Risks</title>
<p>A population-based cohort study, which used administrative data from 4.1 million patients in Italy, was performed to determine the incidence of hospitalization for major gastrointestinal and intracranial bleeding episodes in individuals with and without diabetes taking aspirin. The patients were indexed through 12 local health authorities from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2008. The study included 186 425 patients ≥30 years of age with new prescriptions for low-dose aspirin (≤300 mg) and 186 425 matched controls without aspirin use. Drugs considered to promote or protect against bleeding were taken into account. During a median follow-up of 5.7 years, the overall incidence rate of bleeding events was 5.58 (95% confidence interval = 5.39-5.77) per 1000 person-years for aspirin users and 3.60 (95% confidence interval = 3.48-3.72) per 1000 person-years nonaspirin users (incidence rate ratio = 1.55; 95% confidence interval = 1.48-1.63). Aspirin use was associated with a greater risk of major bleeding in most of the subgroups investigated but not in individuals with diabetes (incidence rate ratio = 1.09; 95% confidence interval = 0.97-1.22). Regardless of aspirin use, diabetes was independently associated with an increased risk of major bleeding episodes (incidence rate ratio = 1.36; 95% confidence interval = 1.28-1.44).</p>
<p>The authors concluded that aspirin was associated with an increased risk of major gastrointestinal or cerebral bleeding episodes and patients with diabetes had a high rate of bleeding not independently associated with aspirin use. They recommend weighing the benefits and risks in prescribing aspirin for primary prevention.</p>

<title>Deep Vein Thrombosis and Immune Thrombocytopenia</title>
<p>An 82-year-old woman admitted to the hospital with deep vein thrombosis and cellulitis of the right leg subsequently developed immune thrombocytopenia secondary to an acquired factor V inhibitor. The patient had no prior history of surgery, use of bovine products, or transfusions in the past but was taking low-dose aspirin and clopidogrel for a percutaneous coronary stenting performed 1 month prior to admission. On admission the patient had no signs of hemorrhage, and white blood cell, platelets, and hemoglobin values were within normal limits. Other coagulation studies revealed reduced factor V activity (2%, reference value = 70-152), factor II activity (37%, reference value = 74-146), and factor X activity (52%, reference value = 70-130). The patient’s plasma protein was positive for factor V inhibitor (4 Bethesda units/mL). On hospital day 7, after treatment for cellulitis, the patient’s platelet count decreased and subcutaneous hemorrhage developed. Results of bone marrow aspiration were consistent with immune thrombocytopenia. The patient was treated with prednisolone. After 1 month, the patient’s prothrombin time and platelets had returned to normal and the patient was discharged from the hospital. Factor V inhibitor was no longer detected and PA-IgG normalized 1 month after hospital discharge.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the deep vein thrombosis and immune thrombocytopenia were related to development of factor V inhibitor. This patient’s clinical picture was proposed to have developed secondary to an immune response stimulated by formation of a factor V inhibitor.</p>

<title>Visceral Leishmaniasis Infection</title>
<p>A 62-year-old male patient developed <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> after receiving 5 cycles of intravenous bortezomib (1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) plus dexamethasone (days 1, 4, 8, and 11). Prior medical history included history of stage II, IgA κ multiple myeloma, and prior treatment with intravenous dexamethasone and oral thalidomide. Pertinent laboratory results on hospital admission included mild leukopenia (3.0 × 10<sup>9</sup> L<sup>−1</sup>) and splenomegaly (170 mm on ultrasound). Results from a bone marrow aspiration revealed numerous amastigotes of <italic>Leishmania</italic>, which was confirmed by <italic>Leishmania</italic>-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis of bone marrow and blood samples.

<p>The authors suggested that infection with <italic>Leishmania</italic> was a result of treatment with bortezomib. The proposed mechanism for incidence of opportunistic infection in this patient may have been related to bortezomib’s modulation of the cell-mediated immune response.</p>

<title>Drug Interaction: Decreased Concentrations of Quinidine (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477012455144">*</xref>)</title>
<p>A 63-year-old female inpatient developed decreased plasma concentrations of quinidine after concurrent therapy with intravenous flucloxacillin (1 g 6 times daily for 3 days and increased to 2 g 6 times daily). The patient experienced episodes of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, for which oral quinidine (initial dose not provided) was started and underwent <italic>implantable cardioverter defibrillator</italic> implantation several days later. Flucloxacillin therapy was initiated after an infection from the temporary pacemaker lead developed (identification of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>). Approximately 3 weeks after concurrent administration of both quinidine and flucloxacillin, the quinidine dose was increased to 2800 mg/d due to inability to achieve sinus rhythm; however, on assessing quinidine plasma concentrations, a supratherapeutic level of 1.1 mg/L was found (therapeutic range = 2.5-5 mg/L). Approximately 8 days after the discontinuation of flucloxacillin (total course of 6 weeks), quinidine levels were therapeutic (3.8 mg/L) despite a dose reduction (600 mg 3 times daily) and patient was discharged from hospital.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that flucloxacillin is an inducer of both P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 (quinidine is a known substrate for both), although further research is needed to definitively prove this mechanism. The final recommendation of the authors stated that quinidine plasma levels should be carefully monitored and doses adjusted accordingly when concurrently administering both flucloxacillin and quinidine.</p>

<title>Autoimmune Hepatitis</title>
<p>A 35-year-old female patient developed autoimmune hepatitis after receiving a total of 5 subcutaneous adalimumab injections (dose not provided) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Concurrent medications included perindopril (dose not provided). Approximately 2 months after beginning adalimumab therapy, elevated liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase = 266 UI/L and aspartate aminotransferase = 555 UI/L) were documented and adalimumab was discontinued. All other biological parameters were normal and serology testing for hepatitis A-E, Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and toxoplasmosis was negative. However, abnormal levels of anti–smooth muscle antibody with a titer of 1:320 were detected, as well as an ultrasound showing mild hepatomegaly with signs of steatosis and a liver biopsy indicating portal fibrosis. A diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis was made and oral prednisone (60 mg daily) was initiated with normalized liver enzymes observed after 6 weeks.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the patient’s autoimmune hepatitis was associated with adalimumab therapy and most likely due to adalimumab’s ability to induce paradoxal production of autoantibodies, which can lead to autoimmune diseases. The final recommendation included implementation of mandatory liver function test monitoring within the first months of anti–tumor necrosis factor therapy.</p>

<title>Acute Pancreatitis</title>
<p>A case–control study over a 2-year period was performed to evaluate an association between use of tetracyclines and acute pancreatitis in a randomly selected mid to late-aged (40-84 years) adults (N = 61 137). Tetracycline use (doses and durations of therapy not provided) in an outpatient setting were identified from the control population and classified as “current” (0-30 days), “recent” (31-180 days), “past” (181-365 days), or “former” (1-3.5 years) users. These data were then compared with the identification of first-time acute pancreatitis cases in patients (case subjects), discovered from the Swedish Patient Register (n = 6161). Findings showed that the case subjects had a higher presence of both current and previous use of tetracyclines (1.3% and 12.9%, respectively) compared with that of the control population’s current and previous use of tetracyclines (0.6% and 9.8%, respectively), with the case subjects showing the highest incidence (60%) for developing acute pancreatitis among the “current users” after adjusting for potential confounders. In addition, doxycycline was the most common offender of acute pancreatitis episodes (and most common tetracycline prescribed), accounting for 94% of the case subjects (n = 77), followed by lymecycline (6.1% of case subjects; n = 5).</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the current use of tetracyclines is associated with an increased risk for developing acute pancreatitis. Three mechanisms have been suggested for this reaction: (<italic>a</italic>) formation of a toxic metabolite, (<italic>b</italic>) hypertriglyceridemia, and (<italic>c</italic>) a high biliary concentration, although more research is need to clarify these proposed mechanisms. Due to the common prescribing of this class of antibiotics, the authors recommend that both physicians and patients be aware of tetracycline use and potential for developing acute pancreatitis.</p>

<title>Vomiting in Pediatric Patients (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477012455144">*</xref>)</title>
<p>Ten case reports of severe vomiting in pediatric patients treated with domperidone (4 times a day) for gastroparesis were described. All the patients were hospitalized in a neurorehabilitation unit and had severe brain injury and were receiving enteral nutrition secondary to dysphagia. Concurrent medications included baclofen, diazepam, valproate, omeprazole, and antibiotics as needed. The onset of emesis, evolving from slight regurgitation to sustained alimentary vomiting, was noted within 1 day from administration of domperidone. Six patients displayed persistent stagnation of enteral nutrition and required gastric aspiration after most meals. Drug withdrawal led to a rapid decrease in the severity of vomiting and a reduction in the number of episodes followed 2 to 3 days later.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the patients experienced severe vomiting related to the paradoxical effect of domperidone on dysphagia and decreased vagal tone. Use of the Naranjo algorithm indicates a probable relationship between the patients’ adverse reaction and exposure to domperidone. They recommend performing a gastric transit examination early after initiating domperidone in pediatrics patients affected by brain injury.</p>

<title>Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonitis</title>
<p>A 29-year-old female patient presented with a 1-month history of progressive dyspnea, nonproductive cough, fatigue, and night sweats after receiving a second dose of infliximab for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Prior treatment for ulcerative colitis included mesalamine and prednisone, and mesalamine was discontinued secondary to the development of acute pericarditis. Concurrent medications included intranasal fluticasone, cetririzine, iron supplements, lansoprazole, bupropion, ibuprofen, and drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol. Abnormal laboratory results at the time of presentation included an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (48 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (40 mg/L). Chest radiograph demonstrated bibasilar infiltrates with decreased lung volume and chest computed tomography showed patchy infiltrates in the right middle and right lower lobes. Pulmonary function tests were consistent with restriction. Bronchoalveolar lavage showed CD8 T-cell lymphocyte predominance with CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.74. The patient then required oxygen support as clinical status deteriorated. A video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy revealed a cellular, airway-centered pneumonia most consistent with nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis. Corticosteroid initiation resulted in clinical improvement and resolution of hypoxia. Infliximab was thought to be the cause of nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis and was not continued. Three months later, pulmonary function tests and chest computed tomography scan showed resolution of previous abnormalities.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis was caused due to infliximab’s effect on tumor necrosis factor-α. This case adds to existing literature regarding pulmonary complications of infliximab, and the authors recommend that physicians consider this potentially serious adverse event.</p>

Concurrent medications included methotrexate, memantine, mirtazapine, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. At presentation, the patient was confused and had dry mucous membranes.

The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and treatment was initiated with 5% dextrose in water at 130 mL/h with a goal of correcting serum sodium at 0.5 mEq/h. Demeclocycline was discontinued, and 7 days later, serum sodium reached 141 mEq/L. No more seizures were noted, mental status returned to baseline, and the patient was discharged home.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the patient developed severe hypernatremia related to demeclocycline and strict fluid restriction. Demeclocycline enhances free water excretion despite the presence of high antidiuretic hormone levels and is often reserved for patients who cannot comply with strict fluid restriction. They suggest monitoring weekly serum sodium in outpatients being treated with demeclocycline and fluid restriction and recommend demeclocycline be reserved for patients who do not tolerate or are unwilling to follow strict fluid restriction.</p>

<title>Hemorrhagic Events</title>
<p>A retrospective study was conducted to describe hemorrhagic events associated with varenicline use. Reported cases were identified from the New Zealand Intensive Medicines Monitoring Program, the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb, and from the World Health Organization Uppsala Monitoring Center databases between April 2007 and November 2010. All case reports of hemorrhagic events, defined as any bleeding event or event clinically considered to be a risk factor for bleeding, underwent a causality assessment. Of note, reports of gynecological bleeding were excluded from further analysis as the mechanism of menstrual bleeding is different from other types of hemorrhagic events. A total of 30 cases were identified from the New Zealand Intensive Medicines Monitoring Program (n = 16) and the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb (n = 14) databases. Six cases of epistaxis were identified, and 4 patients had a positive dechallenge on varenicline withdrawal, suggesting a causal relationship. Another 5 reports of gingival bleeding were indentified, with 3 patients having a positive dechallenge. One patient experienced hemoptysis while taking varenicline and had a positive dechallenge. An additional 49 reports of epistaxis, 39 reports of hemoptysis, and 21 cases of thrombocytopenia were identified from the World Health Organization Uppsala Monitoring Center; however, data were limited and a causal relationship with varenicline use could not be determined.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that hemorrhagic events may have a causal relationship with varenicline use. A plausible mechanism for these events may be a result of varenicline’s interaction with the serotonin receptor system and transporters.</p>

<title>Risk of Serious Infections</title>
<p>A case controlled analysis was conducted to examine the association between the risk of “serious” infection and “real-life” patterns of glucocorticoid use. The study matched 1947 “serious” infection cases to 5 controls. Cases were obtained using data from a Canadian administration database containing 16 207 patients at least 65 years of age with rheumatoid arthritis over a 18-year period. A weighted cumulative dose model was used to account for variations in glucocorticoid dosage, duration of therapy, timing of therapy, and to explore how risk depends on treatment regimen. Results from the weighted cumulative dose model were subsequently compared with 10 conventional models. The weighted cumulative dose model predicted risks better than the conventional models. The weighted cumulative dose model determined that current and recent glucocorticoid doses had the highest impact on current infection risk, although doses received up to 2.5 years ago were still associated with an increased infection risk. Based on the weighted cumulative dose model, a current user of prednisone 5 mg daily has a 30%, 46%, or 100% increased risk of serious infection when used continuously for 3 months, 6 months, or 3 years, respectively.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that infection risk in older patients with rheumatoid arthritis was associated with glucocorticoid therapy and that risk is associated with timing of treatment.</p>

<title>Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy</title>
<p>A retrospective analysis was conducted to assess the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy associated with the use of natalizumab and anti-JC virus antibody status, prior immunosuppressant use, and/or duration of natalizumab treatment. Subjects were identified from the Biogen Idec global safety database and clinical studies (AFFIRM, STRATIFY-1, and TYGRIS) through February 29, 2012. Among 99 571 patients exposed to natalizumab for 209 123 patient-years, 212 confirmed cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy were identified (1.01 cases per 1000 patient-years). Following diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, 46 (22%) patients died and 23 with available data experienced severe disability. Approximately 46% of patients received at least 2 years of natalizumab treatment, whereas only 14% of patients received greater than 4 years of treatment. The risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy correlated to the duration of treatment, with the greatest risk observed after 2 years of therapy. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was more frequently diagnosed in patients who had used immunosuppressants prior to natalizumab initiation versus those who did not (34.5% vs 20.3%). The most commonly used immunosuppressive agents were mitoxantrone, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil. Of 5896 patients with baseline samples available for anti-JC virus antibody testing, 54.9% (95% confidence interval = 53.7-56.2) had anti-JC virus antibodies. The prevalence of anti-JC virus antibodies increased with age and was more common in men than women. Among these subjects, 100% of the 54 diagnosed cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy were positive for anti-JC virus antibodies. The estimated incidence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy among patients who were positive for anti-JC virus antibodies was estimated as 3.87 cases per 1000 patients treated with natalizumab (95% confidence interval = 2.91-5.05). No patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy had tested negative for anti-JC virus antibodies, and thus, the estimated incidence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy among patients negative for anti-JC virus antibodies was 0 cases per 1000 patients (95% confidence interval = 0-0.32). Since true risk cannot be zero, an additional sensitivity analysis of 1 hypothetical case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy diagnosed in a patient negative for anti-JC virus antibodies reestimated the incidence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy to be 0.09 cases per 1000 patients (95% confidence interval = 0-0.48). Among patients who received natalizumab treatment for greater than 24 months, had positive anti-JC virus antibodies, and previously used immunosuppressants, the estimated incidence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was approximately 11.1 cases per 1000 patients treated (95% confidence interval = 8.3-14.5).</p>
<p>The authors concluded that positive anti-JC virus antibodies, prior immunosuppressant use, and treatment with natalizumab for greater than 24 months were significantly associated with developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Risk stratification according to these factors may assist in identifying patients most appropriate for natalizumab treatment and reduce the incidence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The authors note that prospective studies are needed to further describe these risk factors.</p>
