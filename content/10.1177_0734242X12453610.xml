<p>Municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills need to be managed after closure to assure long-term environmental compatibility. Aftercare can be completed when the authorities consider the landfill not likely to pose a threat to humans and the environment. In this work, a methodology for deriving site-specific aftercare completion criteria is presented and its application is illustrated via a case study. The evaluation method combines models addressing waste emission behavior, long-term barrier performance, and pollutant migration to assess the potential impact of landfill emissions on the environment. Based on the definition of acceptable impact levels at certain points of compliance, scenario- and pollutant-specific aftercare completion criteria are derived. The methodology was applied to a closed MSW landfill in Austria and potential aftercare durations were determined. While landfill gas emissions may become environmentally tolerable within decades at the site, leachate-related aftercare measures were expected to be necessary for centuries (primarily as a result of ammonium). Although the evaluation comes with large uncertainties, it allows for linking aftercare intensity and duration with respect to an environmentally compatible state of the landfill in the absence of aftercare. However, further case studies including regulatory review and acceptance are needed to use the methodology in a decision support tool on aftercare completion.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Landfills are key elements in modern waste management, as they represent anthropogenic sinks for substances which cannot be recovered for economic or ecologic reasons. In general, landfills need to be managed after closure to assure the long-term protection of humans and the environment. This aftercare period typically comprises the monitoring of landfill emissions (e.g. leachate) and receiving systems (e.g. groundwater), and the maintenance and control of landfill facilities (e.g. cover, leachate collection and treatment), as well as site surveillance (e.g. restricted access and use). It can be brought to an end when the authorities consider the landfill to no longer pose a threat to humans and the environment in the absence of aftercare (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12453610">European Parliament, 1999</xref>). While simple qualitative criteria are often suggested as a basis to evaluate aftercare, rigorous methodologies and data to evaluate aftercare and aftercare completion are difficult to build and are rarely available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X12453610">Laner et al., 2012</xref>). Different approaches have been suggested to evaluate landfill aftercare and its completion (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12453610">Environment Agency, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X12453610">Morris and Barlaz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734242X12453610">Scharff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0734242X12453610">Stegmann et al. 2006</xref>), but a consistent methodology to derive aftercare completion criteria in view of long-term environmental risks associated with a closed landfill has not yet been established. However, such a methodology is needed as a basis for the design of appropriate funding accrual mechanisms for aftercare (i.e. by reducing the uncertainty about the intensity and duration of aftercare) and for supporting authorities’ decisions on the extension, reduction or completion of aftercare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12453610">Barlaz et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, it is the aim of this work to introduce a methodology for defining site-specific aftercare completion criteria and to illustrate its application to a closed MSW landfill.</p>
<p>While the evaluation methodology is applicable to different kinds of landfills in principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X12453610">Laner, 2011</xref>), in this article the focus is put on municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. On the one hand MSW landfills have been, or still are, the major waste disposal option in many parts of the world. On the other hand, emissions from these landfills, mainly associated with the degradation of organic matter and the leaching of inorganic components (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12453610">Bookter and Ham, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12453610">El-Fadel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12453610">Farquhar and Rovers, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12453610">Kjeldsen et al., 2002</xref>), may be of potential environmental significance for many decades or centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12453610">Belevi and Baccini, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X12453610">Krümpelbeck, 2000</xref>). Hence, environmentally-protective and cost-efficient strategies for the long-term management of these landfills are urgently needed.</p>
<p>First, we present a methodology to evaluate landfill environmental compatibility via deriving site-specific aftercare completion criteria. In this work aftercare completion is defined as the end of regulated aftercare (landfill owner is released from the responsibility for the site) because the closed landfill is not likely to present a threat to human health and the environment in the absence of aftercare. In the subsequent section the application of the evaluation methodology to a closed MSW landfill in Austria is illustrated and potential aftercare durations are determined based on site-specific completion criteria. Finally, we discuss the application of the evaluation methodology as a basis to optimize landfill long-term management and provide an outlook on potential future research activities.</p>

<title>Method to determine aftercare completion criteria</title>
<p>The evaluation of landfill environmental compatibility needs to address different aspects significant to the environmental impact associated with a landfill. These include the behavior of the deposited waste and associated emissions, the (long-term) performance of the technical barrier system, and the migration of pollutants in environmental media and potential adverse effects on the environment. In essence, the evaluation of aftercare and its completion resembles a site-specific endeavor about acceptable risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734242X12453610">Scharff et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The methodology to derive aftercare completion criteria consists of several elements: (i) models on emission characteristics; (ii) models on the performance of the containment system (iii) substance migration models in the environment (i.e. subsurface environment); and (iv) points of compliance where certain criteria have to be met. These elements are combined to derive site-specific completion criteria. Subsequent to the evaluation, monitoring of emission levels and criteria related to the state of the landfill (e.g. geotechnical stability, cover performance) is carried out to either confirm the models underlying the evaluation or to adapt the models to incorporate the new observations. The procedure to derive completion criteria for a closed landfill is schematically illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12453610">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<sec id="section3-0734242X12453610">
<title>Characterization of the landfill-environment system</title>
<p>The basis of the evaluation is the collection of data and information about the conditions at a site (e.g. climate, geology, topographic location), the containment system (i.e. technical barriers), and the deposited waste and associated emissions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12453610">Figure 1</xref>). In general, data need to be critically evaluated. For monitoring data this means, for instance, checking the representativeness of the sampling location, measurement protocols, collection efficiencies or leachate discharge rates during sampling. Monitoring at closed landfills could be optimized by gathering information in view of the situation at the site and the significance of the data for modeling purposes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0734242X12453610">Zweifel et al., 1999</xref>). For instance, measurements including a wide range of parameters could be done once every few years, whereas routine monitoring could be restricted to a few parameters (e.g. electric conductivity, leachate discharge rate, ammonium, and total organic carbon) measured at a higher frequency/resolution to gain process understanding for model development. Provided that conditions at the site are constant (e.g. after top cover installation) the observation of a few parameters can also allow for statements about the behavior of other parameters for which correlations have been established (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12453610">Kylefors, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X12453610">Laner et al., 2011b</xref>). In all cases, input data and models are uncertain, at least as a result of natural variability, and should be treated accordingly (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12453610">Gibbons and Bull, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0734242X12453610">
<title>Emission parameters and scenario analysis</title>
<p>Environmentally significant emission parameters are identified based on the observations at the site and waste characterization data (e.g. shaking leaching tests). The concentrations of relevant leachate constituents are predicted based on the model suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12453610">Belevi and Baccini (1989)</xref>, which is adapted to consider water flow heterogeneity and the continuous release of substances due to ongoing organic degradation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X12453610">Laner et al., 2011a</xref>). According to the model, the substance concentrations in the leachate decrease exponentially with the increase of liquid-to-solid ratio (amount of water in liters that passed through 1 kg of waste dry matter) of the deposited waste. To establish the model, information about the initial leachate concentrations (after landfill closure and after gas generation has significantly dropped), the mobilizable amount of substances of the waste, the heterogeneity of water flow through the waste, the rate of water infiltration per year and the amount of landfilled waste is necessary. The model parameters are determined based on investigations of the landfilled waste and available monitoring data at the site (gathered in step 1 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12453610">Figure 1</xref>). The model is fitted to emission characteristics observed after landfill closure and estimates on future leachate composition are derived with the calibrated model as a function of liquid-to-solid ratio. However, it should be noted that the described emission model assumes constant water flow patterns within the landfilled waste and no change of the dominant release mechanisms. Thus, within a scenario to investigate the effect of a change in the landfill’s water flow pattern, the emission model would have to be adapted to account for a re-distribution of water in the waste and a potential increase in leachate concentration levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X12453610">Laner et al., 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>Mathematical models to describe the rate of landfill gas generation in a landfill are typically based on first order kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12453610">Barlaz et al., 1990</xref>). The models differ with respect to their complexity and with respect to basic assumptions on the biodegradability of organic matter (i.e. degradation rate or half-life values for refuse components). In any case, gas generation models need to be calibrated with site-specific data to allow for credible projections because actual gas generation is dependent on site-specific factors, such as waste characteristics, moisture content and distribution, temperature, pH, microbial communities, nutrient availability and the presence of inhibitors. As gas generation models typically overestimate the amount of gas produced at the site because of the assumption of optimal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X12453610">Krümpelbeck, 2000</xref>), they should be adapted to fit observed gas collection and/or emission data. However, it should be noted that gas collection efficiency is always below 100% and that other factors need to be considered when using measured gas data (e.g. suction of air in active gas collection, potentially occurring methane oxidation processes in the landfill cover, etc.).</p>
<p>Technical barriers typically consist of several components with low-permeability mineral layers (e.g. clay liners), geomembranes (e.g. high density polyethylene (HDPE) liners), geosynthetic clay layers, drainage layers and recultivation layers being among the most important ones. The performance of the technical barrier system is the product of the interaction of the different elements. In the short term the most important factors with respect to barrier performance are proper design and construction of the system and geotechnical stability issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12453610">Bonaparte et al., 2002</xref>), while the long-term performance is dependent primarily on the stresses induced on the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12453610">Inyang, 2004</xref>). The elements of a technical barrier system have different service lives. Estimates of the long-term performance of different barrier components (under the assumption that no maintenance and repair is taking place) range from several decades for leachate drainage systems to geologic time periods (thousands of years) for low-permeability mineral liners (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734242X12453610">Rowe, 2005</xref>). As field data are lacking to evaluate the long-term performance of containment systems, a set of scenarios is used to illustrate the effect of different containment system performance levels on landfill emissions. A first scenario assumes an unchanged performance of the barrier system; a second one investigates the slow deterioration of the technical barriers and a consequent decrease of the barrier performance levels; and a third one is used to illustrate the effect of a total failure of the containment system. The barrier performance levels are estimated based on an evaluation of the actual system design and function and, in case of an expected gradual performance decrease over time, on a weighting matrix derived from expert interviews assessing the importance of different factors for long-term performance (for detailed information about the barrier evaluation scheme see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X12453610">Laner et al. (2011b)</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X12453610">Laner (2011)</xref>). The different barrier performance levels are combined with appropriate emission models (e.g. constant release mechanisms and unaltered water flow pattern are assumed) and scenario-based emission estimates are derived. However, as the estimated barrier performance levels are highly speculative, they should not be seen as reliable predictions, but as specific scenario conditions used to highlight the effect of different barrier deterioration patterns. Overall, the layout and number of emission scenarios is dependent on potential future conditions at the site characteristics on the one hand (e.g. site in a flood plain) and the expected after-use of the landfill on the other (e.g. human intrusion as an event to be included).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0734242X12453610">
<title>Transport pathways and pollutant migration</title>
<p>The scenario-based estimates on future emission levels form the input for pollutant migration modeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12453610">Figure 1</xref>, step 3). Although several pollutant migration pathways might be relevant for a closed landfill (e.g. subsurface migration of landfill gas or discharge of collected leachate to surface waters), only the migration of leachate in the subsurface is addressed below. This is owing to the potential risk a landfill poses to the groundwater and because the leachate pathway is considered to dominate the long-term pollution potential of MSW landfills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12453610">Kjeldsen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X12453610">Krümpelbeck, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Leachate seeping from a landfill enters the zone below the landfill and potentially contaminates the groundwater underneath. While naturally occurring processes in the subsurface can potentially attenuate pollutants present in landfill leachate, there is no easy-to-use protocol available on how to assess attenuation potentials for a specific environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12453610">Christensen et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The complexity of models to describe substance migration in the subsurface varies from simple screening tables to sophisticated numerical models. As the model complexity relates directly to the quality and quantity of data to establish, calibrate and validate the model, rather simple and robust models are used to describe pollutant migration in the subsurface within the evaluation methodology. On the one hand this is in accordance with the substantial uncertainties of input data (e.g. projections of emission rates or typically poor data availability on subsurface properties at closed landfill sites), but, on the other hand, in a higher tier evaluation simpler models could be replaced by more complex models, provided that additional data are collected at the site.</p>
<p>The pollutant migration in the vadose zone below the landfill is evaluated with the one-dimensional model by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734242X12453610">Schneider and Stöfen (2004)</xref>, which is based on the analytical solution of the advection-dispersion equation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0734242X12453610">van Genuchten, 1982</xref>). In the model, a continuous, stationary and downward flow field in the unsaturated zone is assumed without initial pollution of the transport pathway. Processes considered in the model include advection, dispersion, diffusion in soil liquid and gas, linear sorption and degradation at a first order rate. As a result, the model calculates the maximum pollutant concentration above the groundwater surface [a more detailed description of the model features and its application can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X12453610">Laner (2011)</xref>]. For scenarios with a varying leachate generation rate (e.g. gradual decrease in barrier performance), a mass balance approach is used (i.e. the pollutant concentration in the leachate at the time of maximum load equals the concentration entering the groundwater). The effect of leachate mixing with groundwater and pollutant migration in the groundwater are also described with a mass balance approach [for more details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X12453610">Laner (2011)</xref>]. The calculated concentrations at the points of compliance (PoCs) along the migration pathway represent predicted maximum concentration levels for the pollutants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0734242X12453610">
<title>Determination of completion criteria</title>
<p>The estimated maximum concentrations along the migration pathway are used to derive scenario- and pollutant-specific attenuation factors (AFs). The AF between two points of compliance is defined as the ratio of the maximum concentration at the first to the maximum concentration at the second (AF = C<sub>first</sub>/C<sub>second</sub>). Subsequently, the AFs, together with specific quality criteria at a certain point of compliance (e.g. groundwater mixing zone), can be used to calculate tolerable landfill emission levels (i.e. emissions that do not cause a violation of the quality criteria applied at the PoC) for each scenario. The procedure to determine completion criteria for landfill leachate follows a backwards calculation from the critical PoC to the source (landfill base). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12453610">Figure 2</xref> AFs specific to a substance and an emission scenario are illustrated schematically. Assume 10 mg/l of Cl was the quality criteria to be fulfilled at PoC 3, then the tolerable concentration of Cl in the landfill leachate is 200 mg/l (10 mg/l×2×2×5), using the data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12453610">Figure 2</xref>. Thus, if the Cl concentration in the leachate is 200 mg/l or lower, future leachate emissions will be environmentally tolerable provided that the conditions of the underlying emission scenario are met. Therefore, in addition to the emission criteria the completion of aftercare is associated with criteria referring to the underlying emission scenario. For example, the assumption of optimal containment system performance within the underlying emission scenario would imply the maintenance and repair of the containment system (after the termination of aftercare) as a necessary completion criterion. The only emission scenario with no criteria in addition to tolerable emissions would be one where the tolerable emission levels relate to scenario conditions of waste without any containment and fully exposed to external conditions at the site [i.e. waste of final storage quality; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12453610">Baccini (1989)</xref>]. In any case, it will be necessary to outline the basic long-term management within the procedure to derive completion criteria, thereby making the evaluation of long-term environmental risks more transparent to decision makers.</p>

<p>Landfill gas emissions can be assessed based on acceptable area-specific methane flow rates into the top cover [a tolerable, maximum area-specific inflow of methane to the top cover of 0.5 liters CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>−2</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> has been suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0734242X12453610">Stegmann et al. (2006)</xref>] or based on tolerable, maximum methane flux to the atmosphere [e.g. 0.05 liters CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>−2</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12453610">Fellner et al., 2008</xref>)]. The methane flux into the top cover is estimated based on the predictions of the gas generation model, assuming homogeneous inflow. Methane emissions to the atmosphere are calculated in consideration of potentially occurring methane oxidation processes in the cover (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X12453610">Huber-Humer, 2004</xref>). Constant average annual fractions of oxidized methane are often used [e.g. 10% oxidation is suggested by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X12453610">IPCC (2007)</xref>], although such an approach does not account for the effect of various factors, such as the level of methane flux into the cover, or climatic conditions on methane oxidation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X12453610">Chanton et al., 2011</xref>). In general, high methane oxidation rates should be demonstrated in the field-scale over an extended period of time before they are used to assess methane emissions to the atmosphere. Screening models to estimate methane oxidation rates should at least consider the methane flux into the top cover.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0734242X12453610">
<title>Confirmation monitoring and surveillance</title>
<p>Confirmation monitoring is necessary after the evaluation to underpin model estimates (i.e. emission models), as well as to observe whether the conditions at the site (e.g. top cover performance, leachate collection and recovery system) develop in accordance with the assumptions of the emission scenario underlying the evaluation. If model estimates and scenario assumptions are supported by the observations, the evaluation results and the corresponding completion criteria are validated. In case emissions and/or conditions at the site develop differently, the evaluation needs to be adapted or repeated to account for the observed landfill behavior. Consequently, it is expected that the application of the evaluation methodology and the determination of aftercare completion criteria resemble iterative processes continuously increasing the reliability of the assessment of long-term environmental risks. Therefore, the evaluation of the desired state of the landfill at the end of aftercare should be started early during the aftercare period to optimize measurements at the site (i.e. goal-oriented monitoring) and to increase the reliability of the evaluation models. In any case, it can be expected that the authorities will demand appropriate documentation and model validation before they may assume the responsibility for a closed landfill and release the owner from aftercare obligations. After aftercare completion, site surveillance assures that the appropriate after-use of the site and pollutant concentrations in the ambient environment are monitored to demonstrate no unacceptable impacts. Depending on the long-term emission scenario underlying the evaluation, further activities may be part of the long-term management concept (e.g. cover inspection and maintenance) to be implemented by the responsible authorities.</p>

<title>Case study: Breitenau landfill</title>

<p>The Breitenau experimental landfill is located in Austria, around 60 km south of Vienna (47° 44’ 37’’ N, 16° 08’ 28’’ E). Between 1987 and 1988 approximately 95,000 metric tons of municipal solid waste were disposed of in three compartments in a former gravel pit. The landfill compartments were equipped with different top covers (earthen covers or gravel layers with or without compost on top) and with different sealing systems [i.e. a HDPE membrane with (compartments 1 and 2) or without (compartment 3) a mineral liner of 1.7-m thickness above] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734242X12453610">Riehl-Herwirsch et al., 1995</xref>). After 20 years of temporary cover, a final cover was been constructed in 2009, consisting of an equalization layer above the waste, a composite liner (mineral liner of 0.5 m thickness below a HDPE membrane), a drainage layer and a top soil layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X12453610">Laner et al., 2011a</xref>). The landfill is extraordinarily well investigated as it served as an experimental site for numerous research studies conducted by the Vienna University of Technology (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12453610">Binner et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12453610">Fellner et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Emission scenarios</title>

<title>Emission models</title>
<p>Extensive monitoring data are available with high resolution for landfill leachate with continuous monitoring of leachate generation rates since June 2001 and of selected leachate quality parameters (i.e. electric conductivity and temperature) since October 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X12453610">Laner et al., 2011b</xref>). Emission models are established for ammonia-nitrogen (NH<sub>4</sub>-N), chloride (Cl) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), as these parameters still exceed current regulatory standards for the discharge of leachate into surface water bodies by at least one order of magnitude and are expected to be significant for long-term leachate pollution at most MSW landfills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12453610">Kjeldsen et al., 2002</xref>). The measured concentrations (either measured directly in the storage tank or the weighted average of leachate measurements for the three compartments) of NH<sub>4</sub>-N, Cl and COD in the leachate are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X12453610">Figure 3</xref>, together with emission model estimates before and after final cover installation. Although measurements scatter substantially along the fitted model curves, a decreasing concentration trend was apparent before top cover installation. However, after the construction of the final cover leachate concentrations of NH<sub>4</sub>-N, Cl and COD increased by approximately a factor two. The major reason for the drastic rise in concentration levels after cover installation is supposed to be a partial redistribution of water flow paths in the waste body due to the construction of the cover (particularly because of the re-arrangement of top waste layers) causing the leaching of substances from waste newly participating in the water flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X12453610">Laner et al., 2011b</xref>). The formulation of the emission models for NH<sub>4</sub>-N, Cl and COD are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X12453610">Table 1</xref>. Parameter values are chosen in a plausible range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X12453610">Laner et al., 2011b</xref>) with the priority to fit the model to the monitoring data. While the period before final cover installation is used for model calibration only (determination of parameters based on the observed concentration trends), the model formulation for the period after final cover construction is the basis for emission scenario estimates.</p>

<p>In contrast to leachate data, landfill gas data are scarce and of poor quality at the site. A gas collection (gas wells) and treatment (flare) system was installed at the landfill and operated from 1989 to 1995, but the collected amount and composition of landfill gas was only documented until 1991 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12453610">Figure 4</xref>). After 1995 there was no active gas management (one landfill gas extraction experiment took place in 2005) until 2009, when the gas collection system was upgraded in the course of the final cover installation to treat the produced landfill gas in a biofilter. Because of the poor data (including unknown collection efficiencies), rather conservative estimates for methane production at the landfill have been developed using the LandGem model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0734242X12453610">US EPA, 2005</xref>) with a methane generation potential (L<sub>0</sub>) of 90 m<sup>3</sup> Mg<sup>−1</sup> waste and a methane generation rate (k) of 0.035 and 0.050 respectively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12453610">Figure 4</xref> illustrates that both estimated methane generation curves are well above methane collection data (even after final cover installation, when collection efficiency is supposed to be high, i.e. &gt;80%). Hence, they represent an upper boundary for methane generation rather than a realistic estimate (especially considering the minimization of water infiltration after final cover, i.e. within the first year leachate generation decreased by an order of magnitude). Therefore, the methane production rates shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12453610">Figure 4</xref> are treated as worst case scenarios and no further scenarios are derived to evaluate future methane generation and potential emission rates.</p>

<title>Scenario analysis</title>
<p>Landfill emissions are estimated using emission scenarios which are based on the developed emission models for leachate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X12453610">Figure 3</xref>) and gas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12453610">Figure 4</xref>), and on assumptions concerning the future conditions in and around the landfill. As no drastic change of release mechanisms and no abrupt re-distribution of water flow paths are expected at the site during the next decades to centuries, the emission estimates for the Breitenau landfill focus on scenarios addressing different deterioration patterns of the technical barrier system (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12453610">Table 2</xref>). The base line year for all scenarios is 2010 (i.e. time of evaluation) and the investigation period is set arbitrarily to 300 years.</p>

<p>The Status quo scenario is founded on constant (optimal) technical barrier performance at the top and at the bottom of the landfill throughout the modeling period of 300 years. Hence, 0.5% of annual precipitation (633 mm yr<sup>−1</sup>) infiltrates into the waste, and 99% of the generated leachate is retained at the landfill base (1% is released to the subsurface) and drains gravitationally to a leachate collection tank outside the landfill. The emission estimates for the status quo are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X12453610">Figure 5</xref> (left) with respect to the leachate parameters Cl, NH<sub>4</sub>-N and COD. Owing to the minimal water infiltration rate, the concentrations decrease slowly in the leachate and approximately halve during the modeling period of 300 years. The total substance loads in the leachate range between 25 kg yr<sup>−1</sup> (NH<sub>4</sub>-N) and 36 kg yr<sup>−1</sup> (Cl) at the beginning, and decrease at the same rate as the concentrations (constant infiltration rate is assumed). One percent of the substance loads in the leachate are released to the subsurface (right vertical axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X12453610">Figure 5</xref>, bottom left) and 99% is directed to the leachate collection tank.</p>

</fig>
<p>As the status quo* scenario assumes an ineffective technical barrier at the landfill base (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12453610">Table 2</xref>), the total substance loads of Cl, NH<sub>4</sub>-N and COD in the leachate are released to the subsurface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X12453610">Figure 5</xref>, bottom left).</p>
<p>Scenario A investigates the effect of a gradual decrease of technical barrier performance at the top and at the landfill base on the leachate emissions. The future performance of the containment systems is evaluated using a procedure addressing the best and worst service levels of the system, the current performance of the system, the construction and design of the barriers, and different factors significant to the long-term barrier functioning [for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X12453610">Laner et al. (2011b)</xref>]. For the Breitenau landfill, the evaluation results in a leachate generation rate of 3.2 mm yr<sup>−1</sup> at the beginning (best performance level), 32 mm yr<sup>−1</sup> after 100 years, 77 mm yr<sup>−1</sup> after 200 years and 107 mm yr<sup>−1</sup> after 300 years. The respective leachate release rates to the subsurface are 0.03 mm yr<sup>−1</sup> at the beginning, 3.2 mm yr<sup>−1</sup> after 100 years, 34 mm yr<sup>−1</sup> after 200 years and 59 mm yr<sup>−1</sup> after 300 years. The estimated concentrations and substance loads in the leachate for Scenario A are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X12453610">Figure 5</xref> (center). While concentrations decrease slowly at the beginning the decrease accelerates with time due to increasing water infiltration rates. The maximum substance loads in the leachate amount for 106–166 kg yr<sup>−1</sup> and occur after 60 years (COD), 70 years (Cl) and 130 years (NH<sub>4</sub>-N) respectively. The maximum loads released to the subsurface take place later during the scenario, after 80 years for Cl and after 150 years for NH<sub>4</sub>-N and COD.</p>
<p>Scenario A* differs from Scenario A by assuming an ineffective barrier at the landfill base. Therefore, the released substance loads to the subsurface during Scenario A* are equal to the total substance loads in the leachate of Scenario A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X12453610">Figure 5</xref>, bottom center).</p>
<p>Scenario B reflects the worst case with respect to containment performance, as 25% of the annual precipitation infiltrates into the waste body (infiltration rate observed during temporary cover with earthen material) and all the generated leachate is released to the subsurface (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12453610">Table 2</xref>). Consequently, the concentrations in the leachate decrease rapidly during this scenario (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X12453610">Figure 5</xref>, right) and fall below 100 mg l<sup>−1</sup> within 30 years for Cl and within 50 years for NH<sub>4</sub>-N and COD. The corresponding substance loads are initially very high (1230 kg NH<sub>4</sub>-N yr<sup>−1</sup>, 1685 kg COD yr<sup>−1</sup> and 1780 kg Cl yr<sup>−1</sup>) decreasing to levels of around 55 kg yr<sup>−1</sup> for NH<sub>4</sub>-N and COD and to 0.6 kg yr<sup>−1</sup> in case of Cl after 100 years (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X12453610">Figure 5</xref>, bottom right).</p>

<title>Pollutant migration</title>
<p>The landfill was built in a former gravel pit and is located in the ‘Steinfeldschotter’ quarternary gravel terrace formed during the Würm ice age. The geologic strata below the landfill therefore consists mainly of gravel with low contents of sand and silt (local conglomerations). The distance between the landfill base and the maximum groundwater levels which have been observed in the monitoring wells adjacent to the landfill upstream (one well) and downstream (three wells) is slightly more than 4 m. It is made up of two soil layers, a thin sandy, silty gravel layer (0.1 m thickness) below the landfill base followed by a loamy gravel layer with lower sand and silt contents (4.0 m thickness). The thickness of the aquifer is around 15 m with conglomerated loamy gravel at the bottom forming the aquitard. The general groundwater flow direction below the landfill is southwest to northeast, the average filter velocity in the groundwater is 300 m yr<sup>−1</sup> and the contaminated width (cross section through the landfill perpendicular to groundwater flow) is 150 m. A schematic illustration of the leachate pathway in the subsurface is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0734242X12453610">Figure 6</xref>. Emissions to the subsurface percolate through the vadose zone to reach the PoC 1 located above the groundwater surface. PoC 2 reflects the emission-induced maximum pollutant concentration after leachate mixing with groundwater, assuming homogenous mixing along the contaminated width and over a depth of 0.5 m. PoC 3 is located 100 m downstream of PoC 2, with dilution between PoC 2 and PoC 3 taking place solely as a result of local groundwater recharge (15% of annual precipitation). At PoC 4 the maximum pollutant concentration due to the release from the landfill is averaged for the top 5 m of the aquifer (dilution). It may be interesting to evaluate the effect of a pollutant release on groundwater withdrawal in PoC4 via a well from the top third of the groundwater stream. In order to account for the poor resolution of available data (e.g. soil properties, flow velocities) and the assumptions in the modeling (e.g. homogeneous release pattern), simple and conservative transport models are used. Vadose zone transport is described via the one-dimensional transport developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734242X12453610">Schneider and Stöfen (2004)</xref> or using a mass balance approach based on maximum pollutant loads. Also, groundwater pollutant transport is evaluated by applying a mass balance approach. Apart from diffusion and longitudinal dispersion in the vadose zone and dilution in the groundwater, no processes potentially attenuating pollutant concentrations (i.e. no transversal dispersion, no sorption, and no transformation) are considered at the site, with the exception of ammonia nitrogen, as nitrification of ammonia in the oxygen-rich groundwater (O<sub>2</sub> saturation around 80%) may occur to a certain extent. This is reflected by the quality standard applied at PoC 3 relating to nitrate-nitrogen in addition to the quality standard relating to NH<sub>4</sub>-N in the groundwater (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X12453610">Table 4</xref>). Substance-specific transport parameters (i.e. diffusion coefficients) are obtained from the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X12453610">Laner, 2011</xref>). Subsurface transport of COD is evaluated exclusively using the mass balance approach, as the mixture of organic compounds summarized as COD could not be assigned representative substance-specific transport parameters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12453610">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Complete nitrification of NH<sub>4</sub>-N is considered in the groundwater: the quality criteria for nitrate at PoC 3 is set to 5 mg l<sup>−1</sup>, which would increase the total NO<sub>3</sub> concentration in the groundwater leachate plume by around 50% to a bit below 15 mg l<sup>−1</sup> (the drinking water limit for nitrate is 50 mg l<sup>−1</sup>); the concentration of oxygen in the groundwater upstream of the landfill is &gt;8 mg l<sup>−1</sup> resulting in a minimum annual oxygen load of 180 kg O<sub>2</sub> yr<sup>−1</sup> flowing into the leachate mixing zone. In case of Scenario A*, approximately 50% of the oxygen would be depleted because of the nitrification of ammonium-nitrogen contained in the leachate.</p>

<p>The scenario- and substance-specific AFs resulting from the transport modeling are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12453610">Table 3</xref>. According to the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12453610">Table 3</xref> the maximum concentration of chloride for Scenario A decreases by a factor of 1.8 between the landfill base and PoC 1 (above the groundwater surface), reducing the chloride concentration from 990 mg l<sup>−1</sup> at the source to 565 mg l<sup>−1</sup> at PoC 1. As dilution due to mixing of groundwater and leachate is reflected by the AFs at PoC 2, AF values decrease for scenarios with higher leachate release rates. Dilution due to local groundwater recharge (PoC 2 → PoC 3) has only a minor effect on pollutant concentrations, while homogeneously mixing the pollutants in the top 5 m of the groundwater body (PoC 3 → PoC 4) reduces the maximum pollutant concentrations by factors between 6.5 and 6.9. The results from the transport modeling are subsequently used to determine completion criteria for landfill leachate.</p>

<sec id="section15-0734242X12453610">
<title>Completion criteria</title>
<p>The leachate-related completion criteria are calculated by applying Austrian drinking water quality standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0734242X12453610">TVW, 2001</xref>) as compliance criteria at PoC 3. However, the optional quality standard for nitrate-nitrogen (if nitrification in the groundwater is to be considered) is based on the nitrate concentrations of the upstream groundwater and is limited to a maximum increase of nitrate concentrations in the groundwater plume by 50%, which corresponds to 5 mg NO<sub>3</sub> l<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X12453610">Table 4</xref>). PoC 3 is chosen as the pollutant concentrations in the leachate plume (thickness of 0.5 m) shall comply with drinking water quality standards at the property border, notwithstanding the fact that the groundwater stream is directed towards a forest without current, or planned, groundwater uses and no residential building within a distance of 1.5 km. The consequent maximum tolerable concentrations of Cl, NH<sub>4</sub>-N (with an additional calculation to consider nitrification), and COD in the leachate are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X12453610">Table 4</xref> for each emission scenario. In any case, NH<sub>4</sub>-N can be identified as the most critical leachate parameter, as the observed concentrations are above tolerable concentration levels for the scenarios status quo*, A, A* and B if no nitrification is assumed and for the scenarios A, A* and B if nitrification is taken into account. With scenario A* (gradual deterioration of top cover system and ineffective technical barrier at the landfill base) chosen as the significant long-term emission scenario at the site, the tolerable concentration of NH<sub>4</sub>-N in the landfill leachate is 78 mg l<sup>−1</sup> (no nitrification) or 177 mg l<sup>−1</sup> (considering nitrification) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X12453610">Table 4</xref>). Concentrations of NH<sub>4</sub>-N observed currently in the leachate are higher by a factor of 2–7 than tolerable levels.</p>
<p>For landfill gas, completion criteria are defined for the methane flux into the top cover system and for the methane flux into the atmosphere. The flux criterion for the former is 0.5 l CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>−2</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> (4.2 m<sup>3</sup> CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>−2</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>) and for the latter 0.05 l CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>−2</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> (0.42 m<sup>3</sup> CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>−2</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>). Consequently, if the inflow criterion is applied, it has to be demonstrated that the fraction of methane oxidation in the top cover is 90% or above.</p>
<p>Apart from the emission-related completion criteria above, further completion criteria are implied by the choice of the long-term emission scenario: long-term geotechnical stability of the landfill; surveillance of the cover to exclude damages and rapid deterioration, use restrictions of the site to avoid intrusion, etc.; and monitoring of ambient concentrations in the environment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0734242X12453610">
<title>Potential aftercare durations</title>
<p>Three different aftercare strategies are compared to illustrate the effect of aftercare measures on leachate emissions. If top cover performance is kept constant at the best level (0.5% of annual precipitation infiltrate into the landfill) during the whole aftercare period, it will take more than 500 years until tolerable concentrations of NH<sub>4</sub>-N in the leachate can be reached (no matter if nitrification in the groundwater is considered or not). If water infiltration through the top cover is kept at the level of 5% of annual precipitation during aftercare [the legally-required maximum infiltration rate after final cover in Austria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12453610">DVO 2008</xref>)], it will take approximately 270 years (no nitrification) or 110 years (nitrification), respectively, to reach tolerable NH<sub>4</sub>-N levels in the leachate. Finally, if the same maximum infiltration rate as during the period of temporary cover (25% of annual precipitation infiltrate into the landfill) is allowed for, the concentrations of NH<sub>4</sub>-N are expected to comply with leachate criteria within 55 years (no nitrification) or 20 years (nitrification) respectively. Hence, depending on the aftercare management it may take between 20 and &gt;500 years to comply with leachate completion criteria for NH<sub>4</sub>-N, even if full nitrification of (potentially released) ammonia is assumed in the groundwater at the site. However, in order to consider nitrification in the groundwater it would have to be demonstrated for the site, provided that authorities would consent to using a part of the groundwater as a potential long-term treatment filter. In any case, leachate-related aftercare durations at the Breitenau landfill lie in the range of centuries based on the current management strategy.</p>
<p>With respect to landfill gas, after 30 years (in 2040) the worst case estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12453610">Figure 4</xref>) on future methane production rates range below the inflow criterion. If methane oxidation in the top cover was not considered, the emission criterion could be met after 65 (lower curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12453610">Figure 4</xref>) to 100 years (upper curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12453610">Figure 4</xref>) respectively. In any case, it can be expected that methane emissions will become environmentally insignificant while aftercare measures will be still necessary to control and manage leachate emissions at the site.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>The evaluation of aftercare completion is based on the environmental risks associated with a closed landfill in the absence of aftercare. As substantial uncertainty is inherent in an evaluation of long-term environmental impacts, the presented methodology builds on scenario-based assessments to determine the environmentally-tolerable state of the landfill at the end of aftercare. Aftercare completion criteria are derived based on the combination of different models and include tolerable emission levels at the site, as well as criteria associated with the long-term emission scenario underlying the evaluation.</p>
<p>The application of the methodology is illustrated for the Breitenau landfill, a closed MSW landfill around 60 km south of Vienna. At the site, leachate-related aftercare measures are expected to be necessary for centuries, as NH<sub>4</sub>-N concentrations in the leachate will not comply over such time periods with the determined completion criteria (even if nitrification is considered to occur in the groundwater). While aftercare measures addressing leachate emissions need to be maintained at the site for many decades to centuries, landfill gas emissions are expected to be environmentally insignificant within several decades, especially if methane oxidation in the cover can be demonstrated to mitigate negative effects from landfill gas production. As the extent of leachate-related aftercare measures is dominated primarily by the persistent presence of ammonia in the leachate at high concentrations, low-intensity and low-technology solutions for the long-term treatment of ammonia, as well as the demonstration of natural attenuation mitigating a potential release of ammonia to the subsurface may be substantial elements of the long-term management concept at the Breitenau landfill.</p>
<p>Following up on the evaluation, monitoring is necessary in the future to validate the models underlying the emission scenarios (e.g. leachate emission model) and to adapt the measurement frequency and parameter selection to suit the data requirements of the evaluation. In general, this means replacing cost-intensive measurement campaigns by informed measurements reflecting the emission status of the landfill restricted to environmentally-significant factors. On the one hand, the site evaluation and consequent monitoring will allow gathering information required to demonstrate aftercare completion to authorities from early on during aftercare. On the other hand, goal-oriented (i.e. related to the desired state of the landfill at the end of aftercare) monitoring will allow for the effective use of aftercare funds with respect to the long management periods required at MSW landfills.</p>
<p>In view of the potentially long aftercare periods at closed MSW landfills, increasing attention should be given to research about the lasting effect of enhanced emission reduction measures after landfill closure (e.g. in situ aeration, flushing) and to low-intensity technologies suitable for dealing with residual emissions persisting at the landfill for long time (e.g. methane oxidation in bio-active covers or extensive leachate treatment concepts especially addressing NH<sub>4</sub>-N). As the presented methodology allows for linking the intensity and duration of aftercare in view of the conditions at the landfill, it forms a valuable basis to plan and optimize landfill aftercare and therefore enable environmentally-protective, cost-effective long-term landfill management. To highlight the utility of the methodology as a decision support tool on aftercare management and completion, case studies including regulatory review and acceptance are needed.</p>
