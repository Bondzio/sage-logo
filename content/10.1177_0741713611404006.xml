<p><italic>Transformative Learning in Practice: Insights From Community, Workplace, and Higher Education</italic> comprises peer-selected papers accepted for presentation at International Transformative Learning Conferences from 1998 to 2007, in addition to published articles on fostering transformative learning.</p>
<p>The text is neatly divided by contextual settings: higher education, workplace education, and communities. The 24 chapters are arranged into sections describing educational experiences within the exclusive contextual domains. The reader might be tempted to simply read the section applicable to his or her educational setting. It is wise to explore the text in its entirety. The methods, strategies, and insights illuminated in each section provide techniques and perspectives that may be used across each of the contextual settings.</p>
<p>The contributors share a plethora of creative strategies that include innovations to some traditional pedagogies, such as critical self-reflection, both written and dialogical; individual and group work; problem-posing case studies; and arts-based techniques. Each of these approaches draws on lived experiences to disrupt deeply imbedded assumptions and make space for alternative perspectives. The authors were reflective practitioners who were also forthcoming in describing the challenges they faced in creating transformative learning environments.</p>
<p>Though the text emphasis is on practice, contributors offer reflections and/or analysis on theory as it relates to their contextual settings. Since the definition of transformational learning comprises many elements, authors’ foundational perspectives were helpful. Many described their own personal transformations resulting from their experiences as educators, recognizing and embracing the symbiotic nature of the teacher as student, and student as teacher.</p>
<p>The final chapter offers a comparative analysis highlighting salient themes. This summation discusses the importance of purposeful intention in creating transformational learning environments; confronting power in and out of the classroom, in addition to addressing cultural differences; guiding learners to the edge of their comfort zones in order to identify, confront, and disrupt personal assumptions; encouraging reflection; and modeling the practice of transformational learning. It is presented in a conversant manner describing how each author interprets and engages students in transformational learning.</p>
<p>References to other literature intertwine with self-critique. Mezirow points out how colleagues have challenged his overemphasis on rationality, which fails to recognize the influence of “ideology, culture, power, and race, class, and gender differences” (p. 28). Although Taylor reflects on how the text emphasizes the importance of reflection in general, he does not discuss the role of <italic>critical</italic> reflection, as defined in Brookfield’s chapter, “the process by which a grossly iniquitous society uses dominant ideology to convince people this is a normal state of affairs” (p. 126). Taylor grapples with this issue discussing two conflicting theoretical perspectives on transformational learning, one that emphasizes individual personal transformation with little attention to the role of context and social change and another that suggests social change and personal transformation are inherently linked, because learners must “develop an awareness of power and . . . (political consciousness) to transform society and their own reality” (p. 5).</p>
<p>Although many portions of the text express the need for cultural sensitivity and attention to underrepresented voices, nuances in the subtexts make generalizations based on the dominant culture. For example, Sobal was referenced in a discussion on how storytelling might be used to foster transformative learning. Storytelling was called an “emerging” technique “enjoying a revival in America since the late 1970’s” (p. 137) and that it has “helped reclaim stories from the domains of children’s bedside stories and campfires” (p. 138). This perspective does not seem to recognize the historical use of stories in African American and Native American traditions. The author further confines the use of stories to “personal narratives as opposed to myths, fables, or folklore” (p. 138). From an epistemological stance, the dismissal of stories that do not fall within a prescribed genre might impede the transformative learning process. However, overall, the text spoke to diversity and recognized the voices of marginalized peoples on both individual and societal levels.</p>
<p>The collective voice of this text suggests that transformational learning in practice is also undergoing transformation. What once was confined to individual learning experiences is now moving toward recognizing the importance of collective transformation to work toward social change. As suggested in a dialogue between <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741713611404006">Shor and Freire (1987)</xref>,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Transformation is not just a question of methods and techniques . . . this would just require a change in some traditional methodologies by some modernized ones. This is not the issue. The question is a different relationship to knowledge and to society. (p. 35)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Transformative Learning in Practice: Insights From Community, Workplace, and Higher Education</italic> is recommended for adult educators in higher education, the workplace, and those in community settings because it melds practice and theory while offering concrete strategies designed to foster transformative learning for both individuals and communities seeking social change.</p>
