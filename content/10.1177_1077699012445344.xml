<p>In the gripping final scene of <italic>All the President’s Men</italic>, the Hollywood version of Watergate, the two young reporters who broke the story are told that nothing is riding on their investigation except for “the First Amendment to the Constitution, freedom of the press and maybe the future of the country.” Journalism in the 1970s remains a perfect teaching moment for brave, dogged reporting that helped shape America’s direction.</p>
<p>Both of these books forcefully document its history—one by surveying the origins and possible future of the kind of investigative journalism of which the <italic>Washington Post</italic>’s Watergate stories were a paragon and the other by putting together a compilation of writings from one of the hardest-hitting war correspondents of the era.</p>
<p>Jon Marshall’s history of investigative journalism is another gem in the growing Visions of the American Press series by the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern, and it is an eminently readable option for a textbook in undergraduate or graduate classes about the history of American journalism. Famed Vietnam correspondent Sydney Schanberg’s collection, centered on his 1970s articles from South Asia, makes for a page-turning read that anyone interested in war and media would find hard to put down. Read together today, when the media landscape seems dominated by all the non-public-affairs news that’s fit to post, these two volumes offer a powerful snapshot of what journalism in the public interest can accomplish.</p>
<p>One of the main strengths of Marshall’s book is that it traces the history of “the investigative impulse” from colonial news sheets to ProPublica, weaving in relevant aspects of changing journalism practices, structures, and sociopolitical pressures across more than three centuries. Marshall’s central argument is a sad paradox—Watergate might have been both the apex and the undoing of the kind of reporting that hinges on shining a spotlight on disturbing information that someone has tried very hard to keep hidden. And it is precisely that kind of reporting that has buttressed the role of a free press in a democracy.</p>
<p>Marshall, a former reporter and columnist who now teaches news writing at Northwestern University, starts his chronological narrative in the 1600s, when American protojournalists were busy ferreting out information that colonial administrators wanted the public to ignore. As the concept of original reporting and the interview developed in the first half of the nineteenth century, penny press journalists pursued cover-ups in everything from the milk industry to brothels.</p>
<p>Pulling together threads from a rich literature in investigative journalism, Marshall shows how, at the turn of the twentieth century, national magazines took up investigating with a vengeance, earning the nickname of muckrakers while spurring government reforms of corporate giants such as those in the oil and meatpacking industries. The world wars ushered in major press restrictions and increasingly sophisticated public relations operations, and the journalism establishment put controversial digging on hold under the veneer of expert objectivity.</p>
<p>Outside the mainstream, however, the tradition continued. <italic>The Investigative Impulse</italic> helpfully reminds readers that advances in journalism history were not carried only by heavyweights like the <italic>Washington Post</italic> but also by small underground publications, ethnic presses like the African American newspapers, and countercultural outlets that never benefited from large budgets or institutional prestige.</p>
<p>While the book focuses on print, Marshall does not neglect other media, such as television in the 1950s, where Edward R. Murrow dared to take on Joseph McCarthy, and in the 1960s, when video from Vietnam intensified citizens’ mistrust of the government. It was in these years and the 1970s that investigative journalism reached its prime, helped by supportive legal rulings—another facet of the story that Marshall skillfully incorporates in his survey. Two central chapters tell the story of Watergate, pitting Richard Nixon—the first president to hire staff to craft his public persona—against two “exceptionally dogged” <italic>Washington Post</italic> reporters who, working “spectacularly hard,” unearthed the scandal that toppled his presidency.</p>
<p>With perhaps a touch of exaggeration, Marshall argues that when Nixon resigned in 1974, “the American press was more powerful than it had ever been.” The book then shifts to the great irony—journalism’s pursuit of corruption, its use of often oblique methods (such as using anonymous sources), and the distrust in institutions it investigated helped turn the public against the press. In the following decades, a penchant for scandal mongering that hurt journalistic credibility, corporate control of news focused on the bottom line, and vigorous efforts by officials to orchestrate public relations campaigns and to sell their stories directly to the American public combined to dampen the impulse for investigation.</p>
<p>By the twenty-first century, with the media business in free fall, the fate of the few remaining Woodwards and Bernsteins is dramatically illustrated in the episode of suburban Phoenix’s <italic>East Valley Tribune.</italic> The newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize for spending half of 2008 investigating a sheriff’s notorious immigration enforcement efforts and their repercussions, but by the time the award was announced, both the principal reporter and the project editor had been laid off, and the newspaper itself did not survive 2009.</p>
<p>As Marshall puts it, a few online publications and nonprofits have taken up some of the slack and produced extensive and effective investigations, but the question remains of how journalists at the mainstream media that most Americans see can scrounge up the money and time for Watergate-like projects.</p>
<p>The book notes how the political environment throughout the years also influenced journalism, and the only criticism of <italic>Watergate’s Legacy</italic> is that it stops at the Bush era, which Marshall terms a time of investigative failures and backlash against the press. Journalists covering the Obama White House, and commentators for the likes of the <italic>Columbia Journalism Review</italic>, have lamented further restrictions on press access and savvier use of social media to bypass journalistic scrutiny. One hopes an updated edition might tackle such issues, as well as the ethical quandaries that WikiLeaks has generated for the investigate impulse.</p>
<p>It was a similar impulse that drove the <italic>New York Times</italic>’s Sydney Schanberg to cover the conflict between India and Pakistan over Bangladesh’s autonomy in 1971 and a North Vietnamese offensive in 1972. Several of his articles are collected in his <italic>War Writings</italic>, showing a reporter who was not afraid to risk a bullet or to express outrage and sympathy for civilians caught in the cross fire. In one story from Dhaka, he tells of a Pakistani “captain who grew enraged at a group of newsmen who had walked out the front door [of the hotel] to talk to him. He ordered them back into the building and, to their retreating backs, he shouted, ‘I can handle you. If I can kill my own people, I can kill you.’”</p>
<p>From Vietnam, Schanberg wrote of the “suspicion, distrust and sometimes outright animosity” that marked relations between American press officers and reporters, but also of his frustration with readers back home who “haven’t wanted to read or hear anything that might interfere with their point of view.”</p>
<p>His frankness, his fascinated horror of war, and his Hemingwayesque attention to tiny details that encapsulate the incongruities of bloodshed in a couple of lines best come together in his heartrending writings from Cambodia. Schanberg and the <italic>Times</italic> local correspondent, photographer Dith Pran, decided to stay in Phnom Penh to witness the Khmer Rouge’s takeover in 1975. As he cabled his editor, “I have made judgement [<italic>sic</italic>] to stay. I would appreciate your supporting that judgement rather than sending me alarmist cables which will only make a difficult situation more difficult.” Pran saved Schanberg’s life when the Khmer Rouge guerillas threatened to execute him. But then, the Cambodian journalist was forced to leave the refuge of the French Embassy where most Westerners were holed up as the communist rebels began their gruesome and lethal attempt to revolutionize Cambodia by forcing millions of people into marches into the countryside that would leave 20% of the population dead in the “killing fields.”</p>
<p>Removed to Thailand, Schanberg launched a long-distance search for Pran that lasted nearly five years, until Pran escaped, too. Pran’s story, the centerpiece of the book and the topic of an Oscar-winning movie, <italic>The Killing Fields</italic>, turns out to be an investigation of not only a friend’s disappearance but also one of the most surreal atrocities of the twentieth century. Spanning from geopolitical to gut level, the story is journalism at its rawest and most gripping.</p>
<p>One of the best qualities of Schanberg’s masterful writing, for which he won a Pulitzer Prize, is its refreshing bluntness in describing not only Cambodian scenes but also his own mind. Many international correspondents would recognize themselves in Schanberg’s life-risking attempt to get back his notebooks from his captors because they held “all my thoughts” and in his annoyance at his own pique over the “countercolonial movement” as he nursed an ill, newly escaped Pran, whose job had been to take care of the prestigious American journalist.</p>
<p>Schanberg’s book shows the power of dogged reporting whose history Marshall’s book traces. They both are powerful narratives that will fascinate the general reader. For the media scholar and teacher whose students might have been born well after the filming of <italic>All the President’s Men</italic> and <italic>The Killing Fields</italic>, they are essential tools to remind what journalism can do when it shines a light in the world’s darkest corners.</p>
