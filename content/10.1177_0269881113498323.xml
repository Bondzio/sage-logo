<body>
<p>Twenty years ago an editorial in the <italic>Journal of Psychopharmacology</italic> discussed the possible resurrection of interest in noradrenaline as a therapeutic target in psychiatry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881113498323">Nutt, 1991</xref>). Despite the subsequent development of a number of antidepressants that either solely (reboxetine) or partially (mirtazapine, venlafaxine, duloxetine) work through noradrenaline mechanisms, interest in this neurotransmitter lags behind that of the other two amine neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-HT. The papers in this special issue may help rectify this by bringing the current knowledge of noradrenaline together in an exciting and comprehensive set of reviews.</p>
<p>One of the challenges dealing with noradrenaline is the fact that it has such a wide distribution through the brain – in contrast with dopamine, where the projections are much more discrete. Given that noradrenaline synthesis is via dopamine, it is difficult to manipulate its production without also influencing dopamine concentrations. Moreover, noradrenaline has a major role in the peripheral nervous system, unlike either dopamine or 5-HT. This complicates the use of drugs that interact with noradrenaline receptors and is a major reason why this work has been challenging. The overview of Szabadi elegantly demonstrates how much we know about the organization of central and peripheral noradrenaline processes. A multitude of effects does at least provide many targets for theory testing.</p>
<p>Noradrenaline has many roles that are currently understood. An exciting area of research is that of cognitive control and Chamberlain and Robbins describe the growing evidence of a role in executive functions that offer therapeutic opportunities for disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and possibly dementia. One great advantage of targeting noradrenaline, rather than dopamine, in this arena is the relative lack of abuse potential for pure noradrenaline acting drugs.</p>
<p>One of the remarkable and perplexing aspects of the treatment of depression is the fact that mood can be lifted by treatments that enhance either 5-HT or noradrenaline transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881113498323">Wiles et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover the antidepressant response is specific to the neurotransmitter targeted, since the effects of noradrenaline acting antidepressants can be abolished by blocking noradrenaline production with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881113498323">Miller et al 1996</xref>), but not by 5-HT depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881113498323">Delgado et al., 1999</xref>). It has been suggested for several decades that noradrenaline and 5-HT neurotransmission deficits result in different symptom clusters and that this might in turn be differentially ameliorated by selective noradrenergic or 5-HT antidepressants. There has been some recent support for this notion from a large randomized trial comparing nortriptyline and escitalopram. While there were no overall differences in reduction of depressive symptoms, the former outperformed the latter in relation to reductions of neuro-vegative symptoms while the opposite pattern was seen in relation to cognitive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881113498323">Uher et al., 2009</xref>). The paper by Pringle et al. explains the ways in which the two neurotransmitters affect mood in different ways – noradrenaline via elevating hedonic tone and 5-HT through reducing distress. The challenge now is to work out a way to identify which approach would benefit which particular patient.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why noradrenaline-acting antidepressant drugs have not received as much attention as 5-HT acting ones, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), is over concerns about safety; the role of noradrenaline in the control of blood pressure and heart rate being a consideration. The review by Whiskey and Taylor allays these fears and points out that in other aspects noradrenaline-acting antidepressants have advantages over the SSRIs – e.g. they cause less sexual adverse effects. Importantly, the risk of death from overdose (a long held concern for noradrenaline-acting drugs going back to the days of maprotiline) does not now seem to be any different from those of other new (non-tricyclic) antidepressants.</p>
<p>Finally, the clinical issue of whether to combine noradrenaline-acting antidepressants with SSRIs in patients failing to respond to SSRI monotherapy is addressed by Bradley and Lenox-Smith. They explore some large data sets that suggest there are significant clinical benefits to this approach, which is reassuring to those clinicians among us who have been using such augmentation therapy for years! However, the idea still needs to be fully tested in specific head-to-head trials comparing different augmentation/combination strategies.</p>
<p>Altogether, this <italic>Journal of Psychopharmacology</italic> special issue is a landmark in the field and one we hope will encourage more research in the area of noradrenaline – both from academics and pharmaceutical companies alike. Noradrenaline is still very much a viable target for new drug discovery, particularly around molecules that can regulate presynaptic receptor mechanisms and target specific post-synaptic receptor subtypes.</p>
