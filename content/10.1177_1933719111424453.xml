<abstract>
<p>Accumulating evidence suggests that endometriosis is an epigenetic disease. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of valproic acid (VPA) and progesterone (P4) in a rat model of endometriosis on serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels, hot plate and tail-flick latencies, lesion size, and body weight. We used 77 adult female rats, and endometriosis was induced by autotransplanting pieces of uterus (ENDO) or fat (SHAM) to the pelvic cavity. The BLANK group received no surgery. After 2 weeks, the ENDO group was further divided, randomly, into 5 groups, receiving, respectively, treatment with low- and high-dose VPA, P4 alone, VPA + P4, and no treatment. The SHAM rats received no treatment. The BLANK rats were further divided into 2 groups, one received VPA treatment and the other, no treatment. After 4 weeks, all rats were sacrificed. Response latency in hot plate and tail-flick tests, body weight, and serum TNF-α levels were measured before the surgery, before and after the treatment, along with lesion size. We found that induced endometriosis reduced response latency. ENDO rats receiving VPA and/or P4 treatment had significantly reduced lesion size as compared with untreated ones, and had significantly improved response to noxious thermal stimuli. They also had significantly increased weight gain. Serum TNF-α levels increased following surgery but eventually decreased regardless of treatment or not. In conclusion, VPA is well tolerated. Treatment with VPA significantly reduces lesion growth and improves sensitivity to nocifensive stimuli. The improvement is specific to endometriosis-induced hyperalgesia. Thus, histone deacetylase inhibitors may be a promising therapeutics for treating endometriosis.</p>

<p>Characterized by the ectopic presence of endometrial gland and stroma, endometriosis is a common gynecological disorder with an enigmatic pathogenesis and few nonsurgical treatment options with proven long-term efficacy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719111424453">1</xref>
</sup> Its predominant clinical feature is pain, which represents the most debilitating nature of the disease.<sup>

</sup> Consequently, in treating women with endometriosis, the therapeutic efficacy often is measured by means of assessment of pains.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719111424453">3</xref>

</p>
<p>In the last 5 years, there has been accumulating evidence suggesting that endometriosis is an epigenetic disease,<sup>

<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719111424453">17</xref>
</sup> Indeed, in vitro studies have shown that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) can inhibit proliferation, suppress invasion, and reactivate genes that are aberrantly silenced in endometriosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719111424453">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719111424453"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719111424453"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719111424453"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719111424453">22</xref>
</sup> We have recently shown that in a mouse model of endometriosis, the administration of trichostatin A (TSA), an HDACI, results in the inhibition of lesion growth and improvement in response to a noxious thermal stimulus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719111424453">23</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In this study, we attempted to address the following questions. First, since TSA is known to have a poor bioavailability and its toxicity is high, would other HDACIs, such as valproic acid (VPA), an anticonvulsant with an excellent safety record, be equally or more efficacious in treating endometriosis? Second, if the answer to the previous question is affirmative, would VPA be of dose-dependent efficacy? Unfortunately, the mouse experiment used only a single dosage and was thus unable to address this issue. Third, while TSA treatment was shown to improve hyperalgesia resulting from endometriosis, it is unclear whether the improvement was <italic>specific</italic> to endometriosis-induced hyperalgesia. In other words, does the treatment improve the sensitivity to the noxious stimulus resulting from endometriosis-induced hyperalgesia or simply lower the overall sensitivity to noxious stimuli? Fourth, while TSA treatment was shown to be superior to no treatment at all, how does the treatment compare with drugs used in standard care such as progestin? Fifth, while TSA appeared to be well tolerated in mice, no physiological measurement such as growth was performed. Since TSA is an HDACI, there may be concern that it may exert wide-ranging effects other than its intended therapeutic targets. After all, endometriosis is a benign disease, and, as such, it demands higher standard for safety for any drug that is intended for treating endometriosis. Finally, if HDACIs work in mice, do they also work in rats? Rats, after all, are physiologically closer than mice to humans. In the absence of a perfect animal model for evaluating potential therapeutics for endometriosis, testing in more animal species is desirable.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that VPA can suppress the growth of endometrial implants in vivo and, more importantly, reduce hyperalgesia in rats with induced endometriosis. We used a rat endometriosis model to evaluate the treatment effect of VPA under low and high dosages, along with or in conjunction with progesterone (P4). In addition, we used both hot plate and tail-flick tests to gauge the treatment effect on generalized hyperalgesia resulting from endometriosis. Moreover, we treated rats without endometriosis with high-dose VPA to see whether VPA treatment would lower their response latency to thermal stimuli in the absence of endometriosis. We also measured the body weight of rats going through endometriosis-inducing surgery and then treatment. Since tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and other proinflammatory cytokines have been reported to be associated with the severity of endometriosis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719111424453">24</xref>
</sup> and also implicated in inflammatory hyperalgesia,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719111424453">25</xref>
</sup> we hypothesized that serum TNF-α level in rats with induced endometriosis would be elevated, but VPA treatment would reduce it. We sought to determine whether the VPA treatment would suppress the growth of endometrial implants, improve tolerance to noxious thermal stimuli, and decrease serum TNF-α level in rats with induced endometriosis.</p>

<sec id="section2-1933719111424453">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>Seventy-seven Sprague-Dawley virgin female rats (SCXK-2008-0016), 200 to 220 g in weight, were purchased from the Shanghai Xipuer-Bikai Laboratory Animal Science (Shanghai, China) and used for this study. They were maintained under controlled conditions with a 12-/12-hour light/dark cycle and had access to chows and water ad libitum. All studies were performed under the guidelines of the National Research Council’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the institutional experimental animals review board of Shanghai OB/GYN Hospital, Fudan University.</p>

<title>Experiment Protocol</title>
<p>After 3 days of acclimatization and before surgery, the baseline hot plate test and tail-flick test (described below) were administrated to all rats and 1 to 1.2 mL of peripheral blood was drawn from the inner canthus vein of the right eye for baseline measurement of serum TNF-α levels. Then the rats were randomly divided into 3 groups, the BLANK group (n = 15), the SHAM group (n = 10), and the ENDO group (n = 52). Rats in the SHAM group received a sham endometriosis–inducing surgery, while the ENDO group (n = 52) received a real endometriosis–inducing surgery (see Surgical procedures below). In contrast, rats in the BLANK group received no surgery. The schematic diagram illustrating the design of this experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719111424453">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Two weeks after surgery, a second round hot plate and tail-flick tests were administrated to each rat and their peripheral blood was drawn in a similar fashion. The ENDO group (now n = 50, as 2 rats died of intestinal obstruction after surgery) was further divided into 5 groups at random, equal in size (n = 10 each):<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>group U, or untreated group, that received 500 μL of physiological saline, injected intramuscularly with 0.1 mL peanut oil daily;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>group L, or the low-dose VPA group, that received daily oral VPA sodium salt (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri) 100 mg/kg body weight in 500 μL physiological saline;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>group H or the high-dose VPA group (same as group L except the dose: 200/mg per kg);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the P4 group received daily intramuscular injection of 1 mg P4 (Sigma) dissolved in peanut oil;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the V + P (designated as J, for joint treatment) group that received daily oral VPA 200 mg/kg body weight in 500 μL physiological saline in conjunction with intramuscular injection of P4.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Similarly, rats in the BLANK group were further divided into 2 groups at random: one is group C or blank control group that received no treatment at all, and the other, group N, or the nonspecificity control group that received daily oral administration of high-dose VPA just as in group H. The purpose of setting up this group was to see whether the administration of VPA would increase the tolerance to noxious thermal stimuli in the absence of endometriosis, so that we can evaluate whether the reduction, through the administration of VPA, in hyperalgesia resulting from induced endometriosis is a result of VPA treatment or a nonspecific analgesic effect of VPA. All treatments lasted 4 weeks.</p>
<p>Four weeks after the treatment started, the third round of hot plate and tail-flick tests was administrated and a similar amount of peripheral blood was drawn. Thereafter, all rats were anesthetized with 300 mg/kg chloral hydrate. The abdominal cavity was immediately reopened through the original incision, and the lesions were measured by 3 perpendicular diameters (D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, and D<sub>3</sub>). The volume of each endometrial implant tissue was calculated by the following formula as previously reported<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719111424453">26</xref>
</sup>: V = 0.52 × D<sub>1</sub> × D<sub>2</sub> × D<sub>3</sub>, where D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, and D<sub>3 </sub>denote the width, length, and height, respectively, all in millimeter. The number and total volume (in mm<sup>3</sup>) of ectopic lesions in ENDO rats were evaluated. After these measurements, the rats were transcardially perfused using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.01 mol/L), followed by a fixation solution (phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde, pH = 7.0). The ectopic lesion tissues were excised and postfixed overnight in the same fixation solution, then embedded in paraffin for histopathologic examination and immunohistochemical analysis, which will be reported elsewhere.</p>

<sec id="section4-1933719111424453">
<title>Surgical Procedures</title>
<p>Surgery was performed under aseptic precautions to autotransplant small pieces of uterine (for the ENDO group) or fat tissues (for the SHAM group) to the peritoneum of the pelvic cavity and the arterial cascades of the small intestine, as described in published studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719111424453">27</xref>
</sup> Prior to any invasive procedure, the rats were anesthetized with 300 mg/kg chloral hydrate. For the ENDO group, laparotomy was performed and the left uterine horns were removed. The excised horns were immersed in a sterile lactate solution and opened longitudinally. Each uterine segment was then cut into 4 smaller, roughly equal-sized (∼2.5 mm in diameter) fragments. For the SHAM group, laparotomy was performed and the similarly sized pieces of fat tissues were removed from the abdomen and divided into pieces approximately equal in size to those of uterine fragments. Two uterine (ENDO) or fat fragments (SHAM) were sutured onto the peritoneum with a 6/0 braided silk suture, and the remaining 2 fragments were sutured onto the arterial cascades of the small intestine with a 6/0 braided silk suture. Then the midline incision was closed with a 4/0 braided silk suture. After surgery, all rats, including SHAM and BLANK rats, received 0.2 mg/kg body weight 17β-estradiol (Sigma) solution subcutaneously every 2 days for the next 2 weeks. Penicillin (40000 U/d) was administrated intramuscularly (im) to all rats for 2 days to prevent infection after surgery.</p>

<title>Hot Plate and Tail-Flick Tests</title>
<p>Hot plate and tail-flick tests are 2 commonly used methods for measuring nociception in rodents<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719111424453">28</xref>
</sup> and are tests of response thresholds to thermal stimuli, representing a form of acute thermal pain.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719111424453">29</xref>
</sup> In this study, the hot plate test was performed with a commercially available Hot Plate Meter (Model BME-480; Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, China) consisting of a metal plate of 25 cm×25 cm in size. The surface of the plate can be heated to a constant temperature of 53.0°C ± 0.1°C as measured by a built-in digital thermometer, and a plastic cylinder (20 cm in diameter, 18 cm in height) was placed on the hot plate. Rats were brought to the testing room and allowed to acclimatize for 10 minutes prior to the test. The latency to respond to thermal stimulus, defined to be the time (in second) elapsed from the moment when the rat was placed inside the cylinder to the point when it licked its hind paws. Each animal was tested only once in 1 session. The latency was calculated as mean of 2 readings recorded at intervals of 12 hours.</p>
<p>The tail-flick test was evaluated with a commercially available tail-flick Meter (Model ZH-LUO/B, Zhenghua Co. Ltd, Huaibei, Anhui, China). Thermal stimulation was given by a beam of high-intensity light focused on the tail 2 to 3 cm distal to the tip. The time between the start of the stimulation and tail withdrawal was measured as the tail-flick latency. The intensity of the beam was adjusted to produce a mean control reaction time within 60 seconds before the test begins, after which the light intensity was held constant for all rats. Rats were placed in a metallic cage with their tails extended through a slot located at the rear of the cage and allowed to acclimatize for 10 minutes before the test began. Withdrawal of the tail exposed to the light turned off the thermal stimulus, automatically stopped the clock, and the latency time was automatically displayed and then recorded. Each animal was tested only once in 1 session. The latency was calculated as the mean of 2 readings recorded at intervals of 12 hours.</p>

<title>Measurement of Serum Levels of TNF-α by ELISA</title>
<p>Serum levels of TNF-α were quantified using a rat-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (R&amp;D Systems Inc, Minneapolis, Minnesota). The minimum detectable level was 15.0 pg/mL for TNF-α. The intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation were both less than 10% in this assay.</p>

<sec id="section7-1933719111424453">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The comparison of distributions of continuous variables between 2 or more groups was made using the Wilcoxon and Kruskal tests, respectively, and the paired Wilcoxon test was used when the before–after comparison was made for the same group of rats. Pearson or Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used when evaluating correlations between 2 variables when both variables are continuous or when at least 1 variable is ordinal. To see whether VPA/P4 treatment and other possible factors were responsible for the change in hot plate/tail-flick latency and in serum TNF-α level before and after the treatment, a multiple linear regression model was used.</p>

<p>Using hot plate and tail-flick tests, we assessed the rats’ response to noxious thermal stimuli prior to the surgical induction of endometriosis or sham surgery (test 1, or baseline), 2 weeks after the surgery (test 2 or pretreatment test), and 4 weeks after the drug treatment (test 3 or after treatment test). As expected, there was no difference in baseline hot plate latency (<italic>P</italic> = .94) or tail-flick latency (<italic>P</italic> = .97) among the 8 groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1933719111424453">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1933719111424453">E</xref>), indicating that these groups were comparable prior to the surgical induction of endometriosis or sham surgery. For the 2 test modalities, the latencies were correlated (all <italic>r</italic>s &gt;.39 and all <italic>P</italic> values &lt;.0005).</p>

<p>Two weeks after the surgery but before the drug treatment, both hot plate and tail-flick latencies in all 5 groups with induced endometriosis (ie, the ENDO group) were significantly decreased as compared with the baseline levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1933719111424453">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1933719111424453">F</xref>; <italic>P</italic> = 8.3 × 10<sup>−10</sup> and <italic>P</italic> = 6.6 × 10<sup>−9</sup>, respectively, both paired Wilcoxon test). In contrast, no significant reduction was observed for either the BLANK or the SHAM rats (all <italic>P</italic> values &gt;.06). To increase the sample size, we then combined the BLANK and SHAM rats into a single group and compared the change in test latency between this group and the ENDO group. We found that there was a significant difference in change in test latency between the ENDO group and the BLANK/SHAM group, with the magnitude of the average reduction in the ENDO group being 5.7 and 3.6 folds over the BLANK/SHAM group, respectively, for hot plate and tail-flick tests (<italic>P</italic> = 2.2 × 10<sup>−6</sup> and <italic>P</italic> = .0006, respectively). More specifically, the hot plate and tail-flick latency in ENDO rats was reduced, on average, by 29.9% and 17.9%, respectively, while in BLANK/SHAM rats the reduction was 5.2% and 5.0%, respectively. These data suggest that induced endometriosis significantly lowered the tolerance to noxious thermal stimuli as compared with the baseline, even though the location that received the stimuli was remote to the sites where endometrial or fat tissues were transplanted. In contrast, BLANK or SHAM rats did not experience reduced tolerance to noxious thermal stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1933719111424453">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>In ENDO rats, we found that rats treated with active drugs for 4 weeks had a significant improvement in both test latencies as compared with the untreated rats (<italic>P</italic> = 3.5 × 10<sup>−6</sup> and <italic>P</italic> = 4.6 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, respectively, for hot plate and tail-flick tests; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1933719111424453">Figure 4B</xref>-D and F-H). A multiple linear regression analysis using the change in test latency as an independent variable and the pretreatment latency, the VPA and P4 treatment, surgery or not, and induction of endometriosis or not as covariates showed that, for both hot plate and tail-flick tests, both surgery and induction of endometriosis significantly reduced, while both VPA and P4 treatment significantly elevated, the response latency (all <italic>P</italic> values &lt;.014). The pretreatment latency was also associated with higher posttreatment latency (both <italic>P</italic> values &lt;5.0 × 10<sup>−12</sup>). In addition, the interaction term of VPA and P4 treatment was also significant but the coefficient was negative, indicting that the joint treatment of VPA and P4 did not have a synergistic effect in further improving the response latency.</p>
<p>More quantitatively, the drug treatment resulted in an increase by 12.4%, 19.3%, 24.8%, and 17.8% in hot plate latency and 14.0%, 21.5%, 24.1%, and 14.2% in tail-flick latency in groups L, H, P, and J, respectively, as compared with a further reduction of 29.0% and 21.6%, respectively, in the untreated rats.</p>
<p>To better appreciate the dynamic change in test latency, we plotted the time course of mean test latency for different groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1933719111424453">Figure 5A</xref>). For the hot plate test, the baseline latencies among all groups were comparable, as expected. However, 2 weeks after surgery, all rats that received endometriosis-inducing surgery had significantly reduced latencies. In contrast, there was little change in latency among rats received no or sham surgery. Four weeks after the treatment, the latency was further deteriorated in rats with induced endometriosis that received no treatment. In contrast, their treated counterparts had significantly improved latencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1933719111424453">Figure 5A</xref>). For rats with no or sham surgery, there was virtually no change in latency as compared with their baseline or after-surgery levels. Moreover, for group N rats, little change was observed, indicating that the administration of VPA alone did not change the hot plate latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1933719111424453">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>

<p>For the tail-flick test, the basic findings were similar to the hot plate test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1933719111424453">Figure 5B</xref>). There was a significant reduction in latency in rats with induced endometriosis but not in those with no or sham surgery. After treatment, rats with induced endometriosis that received drug treatment all had improved latencies but not in those received no treatment. There was virtually no change in rats with no or sham surgery, and the rats in group N had little change in latency despite the fact they received drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1933719111424453">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>While all treatments improved hot plate latency, it should be noted that they did not completely restore rats’ latency to their baseline levels. Specifically, the hot plate latency in groups L, H, P, and J rats was 81.2%, 85.3%, 83.0%, and 83.9%, respectively, of their baseline level, as compared with 48.7% in the untreated rats. The tail-flick test latency, however, was nearly restored after treatment as in groups L, H, P, and J rats the latency was 93.4%, 98.9%, 99.0%, and 92.0%, respectively, of their baseline level, as compared with 68.4% in the untreated ENDO rats.</p>
<p>To see the treatment effect on test latencies based on the 2 modalities in rats with induced endometriosis, we plotted the change in both hot plate and tail-flick tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1933719111424453">Figure 6</xref>). We can see that among untreated ENDO rats, 9 out of 10 did not have any improvement in either hot plate or tail-flick test while only 1 had a slight improvement in tail-flick test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1933719111424453">Figure 6</xref>). In contrast, ENDO rats that received low-, high-dose VPA, P4, or VPA + P4 treatment showed improvement in at least 1 test. In fact, 8 of out 10 rats in the low-dose VPA group, 7 out of 10 in the high-dose VPA group, and 8 out of 10 rats in the P4 and in the VPA + P4 groups had improvement in both tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1933719111424453">Figure 6</xref>). This suggests that the drug treatment significantly improved the generalized hyperalgesia in rats with induced endometriosis.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Test 3 latencies were negatively correlated with the volume of lesions in rats with induced endometriosis (<italic>r</italic> = −.31, <italic>P</italic> = .027 and <italic>r</italic> = −.39, <italic>P</italic> = .005, respectively, for hot plate and tail-flick latencies, respectively).

<title>Effect of Surgery and Treatment on Serum Level of TNF-α</title>
<p>We also evaluated the dynamic change in serum TNF-α levels at approximately the same time when hot plate and tail-flick tests were administrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1933719111424453">Figure 7</xref>). As expected, there was no difference in serum TNF-α<bold> </bold>level before the surgery—real or sham (<italic>P</italic> = .77, Kruskal test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1933719111424453">Figure 7</xref>). Two weeks after surgery, the serum TNF-α<bold> </bold>levels within the ENDO rats, but not among all rats, were also comparable (<italic>P</italic> = .57), just as expected. However, ENDO rats had significantly higher serum TNF-α<bold> </bold>levels than either SHAM or BLANK rats (both <italic>P</italic> values &lt;.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1933719111424453">Figure 7</xref>). In addition, the serum TNF-α levels in ENDO rats also increased significantly as compared with their baseline levels (<italic>P</italic> = 7.8 × 10<sup>−10</sup>, paired test). Interestingly, the SHAM rats also had significantly increased serum TNF-α level (<italic>P</italic> = .037, paired test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1933719111424453">Figure 7</xref>), but rats that received no surgery had no significant change (<italic>P</italic> = .56, paired test). In fact, at test 2 the serum TNF-α<bold> </bold>level in SHAM rats was 34.2% lower than the ENDO rats (80.3 vs 122.0 pg/mL) but 44.3% higher than the BLANK rats (80.3 vs 55.6 pg/mL). This seems to suggest that surgery alone increased the serum TNF-α<bold> </bold>level, but endometriosis-inducing surgery increased it even further.</p>

A multiple linear regression analysis incorporating surgery or not, induction of endometriosis or not, VPA treatment, P4 treatment, and pretreatment (test 2) TNF-α level as covariates revealed that the pretreatment TNF-α level was the only covariate that is highly significantly associated with the change in serum TNF-α level after treatment (<italic>R</italic>

A multiple linear regression on the before–after change in body weight incorporating pretreatment body weight, surgery or not, the induction of endometriosis or not, VPA or P4 treatment as covariates found that the induction of endometriosis and the pre-treatment body weight were both significantly associated with the negative change (<italic>P</italic> = .026 and <italic>P</italic> = 2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup>, respectively), while both VPA and P4 treatment were associated with the positive change (<italic>P</italic> = .005 and <italic>P</italic> = .014, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1933719111424453">Figure 8</xref>).

<p>As shown above, the surgical induction of endometriosis resulted in hypersensitivity to noxious thermal stimuli.

Coding endometriosis with 1 and no endometriosis with 0, we carried out a logistic regression incorporating test 2 hot plate and tail-flick latencies, as well as serum TNF-α levels as covariates.

<title>Endometriosis Induces Generalized Hyperalgesia</title>
<p>Consistent with our previous report that women with endometriosis had generalized hyperalgesia as compared to women without endometriosis,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1933719111424453">31</xref>
</sup> this study also found that rats with induced endometriosis had significantly reduced response latency in both hot plate and tail-flick tests. This is also consistent with the finding in rats that induced endometriosis yields vaginal hyperalgesia as manifested by heightened sensitivity to vaginal distention<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1933719111424453">32</xref>
</sup> and essentially replicates our own finding in rats<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719111424453">33</xref>
</sup> and mice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719111424453">23</xref>
</sup> We will report elsewhere that this effect appears to be centrally mediated since some mediators involved in central sensitization were aberrantly expressed as a result of induced endometriosis, as we found previously.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719111424453">33</xref>

</p>
<p>While the hot plate test measures response thresholds to high-intensity stimulus and is thus an “acute pain test,”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719111424453">29</xref>
</sup> the response nonetheless is mediated by spinal–brain, stem–spinal reflexes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1933719111424453">34</xref>
</sup> While the exact mechanisms underlying endometriosis-induced generalized hyperalgesia are poorly understood as of now, it is possible that endometriosis-induced inflammation causes persistent peripheral and visceral pain, possibly through the involvement of peripheral and central neuroplastic changes. Persistent, low-grade chronic inflammation may also sensitize visceral afferent pathways, leading to generalized hyperalgesia.</p>
<p>Interestingly, our data indicate that in rats with induced endometriosis their generalized hyperalgesia would continue to deteriorate if left untreated. The increased production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines in endometriosis,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1933719111424453">35</xref>
</sup> along with innervation in the reproductive tract, may activate visceral nociceptive receptors to generate pain perception, manifested as generalized hyperalgesia. The activity- and/or use-dependent increase in the excitability of nociceptive neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord may outlast the barrage of nociceptive inputs, leading to central sensitization.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719111424453">36</xref>
</sup> The persistent presence of ectopic endometrium may perpetuate or even intensify or magnify the inflammatory process, leading to wider involvement of central neuroplastic modifications, which, in turn, result in worsening and progressive pain.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a successful intervention such as surgery or drug treatment should reduce or even eliminate ectopic implants, as we observed. As a result, the intervention would also reduce or diminish the source for proinflammatory mediators and at the same time possibly serve as denervation, blocking the barrage of insults to primary nociceptive afferent neurons surrounding the ectopic implants and gradually attenuating or alleviating central sensitization, as seen in the progressive improvement in the generalized hyperalgesia in women with endometriosis after a successful surgery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1933719111424453">31</xref>
</sup> This is in line with the observation in a rat model of endometriosis that the decrease in vaginal hyperalgesia took over a period of 3 to 6 weeks after surgery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1933719111424453">37</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Therefore, our finding appears to suggest that early intervention may forestall afferent barrage of insults, halt progressive changes in synaptic plasticity, possibly by changes in the density, nature and properties of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1933719111424453">38</xref>
</sup> and/or arrest in innervation. This, if also true in humans, would imply that early treatment of women with endometriosis may be important to forestall progressive and worsening pains. This may also explain the longer diagnostic delay in women with more advanced endometriosis.<sup>

</sup> As we have shown in this study, surgically induced endometriosis resulted in elevated serum level of TNF-α, possibly as a result of inflammation. More interestingly, the serum level somehow decreased as the disease apparently progressed. This finding is consistent with our previous report on a mice model of endometriosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719111424453">23</xref>
</sup> In that study, we also found that the serum TNF-α levels are reduced in mice with endometriosis but received no treatment. However, since these mice were given dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a solvent of TSA, which has been used to treat intractable interstitial cystitis, radiation cystitis, chronic prostatitis, and chronic female trigonitis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1933719111424453">41</xref>
</sup> and is now used most widely as a topical analgesic,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1933719111424453">42</xref>
</sup> it was not clear whether the reduction was spontaneous or a result of DMSO treatment. Given our results in rats and mice, we conclude that serum TNF-α levels in rodents with induced endometriosis can decrease spontaneously without any intervention.</p>
<p>Serum TNF-α levels have been reported to be elevated in women with endometriosis and thus proposed to be a putative biomarker of endometriosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1933719111424453">43</xref>
</sup> However, a recent systematic review found it unable to identify any single or panel of biomarkers, including serum TNF-α levels, to be clinically useful.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1933719111424453">44</xref>
</sup> One possible explanation to this, at least for serum TNF-α level in this rat model, is that the serum level may be a function of disease progression: elevated right after the ectopic endometrium is implanted but gradually returning, more or less, to their normal levels, even in the absence of any intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1933719111424453">Figure 7</xref>). Therefore, when a study group consists of mostly patients with early-stage (not necessarily lower revised American Fertility Society [rAFS] scores) endometriosis, the results may be positive, but when the group is composed of mostly patients with later stage endometriosis or of mixed stages, the results would be more likely to be negative. This may explain why there are conflicting reports regarding the use of serum TNF-α level as a biomarker for endometriosis.</p>

<title>Body Weight and Pain</title>
<p>We found that rats with induced endometriosis, but not sham surgery, had less weight gains as compared to rats that did not undergo surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1933719111424453">Figure 8</xref>). In addition, compared with untreated rats, the rats receiving drug treatment had increased gains in body weight to the level comparable with rats without endometriosis after treatment. These findings suggest that, first, both VPA and P4 treatment are well tolerated in rats, and, second, the change in body weight may be a proxy measure for pain severity. This notion seems to be supported by positive correlations between pre- and posttreatment body weight and response latencies. It is likely that generalized hyperalgesia resulting from induced endometriosis may lead to suppression of food intake, which, in turn, leads to diminished gain in body weight. This appears to be consistent with the report that a brief noxious stimulation of the dura in conscious rats produced a transient suppression of food intake<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1933719111424453">45</xref>
</sup> and also with the report that intraperitoneal acetic acid–induced writhing test and the use of morphine, an analgesia, affected food intake in mice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1933719111424453">46</xref>
</sup> Reduced food intake, a pain-suppressed behavior,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1933719111424453">46</xref>
</sup> is likely to lead to reduced body weight or less weight gain, and thus it may correlate with the sensitivity to noxious thermal stimuli, a pain-elicited behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1933719111424453">
<title>Therapeutic Potentials of VPA</title>
<p>Consistent with our previous results on TSA efficacy in treating induced endometriosis in mice,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719111424453">23</xref>
</sup> this study demonstrates that VPA treatment dose-dependently results in significantly reduced lesion size in rats with endometriosis. In addition, VPA treatment results in significantly improved response to noxious thermal stimuli or generalized hyperalgesia as compared with untreated rats in a dose-dependent manner (based on linear regression results). Notably, the improvement in hyperalgesia resulting from the VPA treatment is not nonspecific, since the high-dose VPA treatment in rats without endometriosis results virtually in no change in response to noxious thermal stimuli or body weight.</p>
<p>As an agent that blocks histone deacetylation on a global level, there is a reasonable concern that administration of HDACs may have negative health outcomes, especially when used systemically and/or for a long term. It should be noted that several herbal products have weak HDACI activities. In fact, royal jelly, the material responsible for the making of honey bee queens, also has weak HDACI activities<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1933719111424453">47</xref>
</sup> and may be responsible for the epigenetic changes leading to strikingly different phenotypes in queens and her workers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1933719111424453">48</xref>
</sup> So far, HDACIs used in cancer trials appear to be well tolerated, and 2 of them, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and depsipeptide (FK228), have been recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) for treating refractory cutaneous T cell lymphoma.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1933719111424453">49</xref>
</sup> Valproic acid belongs to the alpha acid class of HDACIs and is a weak HDACI, with activity at millimolar concentrations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1933719111424453">49</xref>
</sup> As such, it may not be the best choice for epigenetic therapy of endometriosis. Since endometriosis, as a benign and nonfatal disease, naturally places higher premium on drug safety than other life-threatening diseases,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719111424453">17</xref>
</sup> future research is warranted to explore the possibility of local route of administration and to determine whether the use of pan-HDAC inhibitors and class-selective or isoform-selective HDACIs can improve the benefit/risk ratio.</p>
<p>Progesterone is a well-accepted benchmark therapeutics for endometriosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1933719111424453">50</xref>
</sup> Based on lesion size and the response to nocifensive thermal stimuli as reported in this article, we can conclude that the efficacy of VPA is similar to that of P4, if not better. While this may raise question as to why we need novel drugs for treating endometriosis, it should be noted that about 9% of women with endometriosis simply do not respond to progestin therapy<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1933719111424453">51</xref>
</sup> due to progestin resistance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1933719111424453">50</xref>
</sup> Since the action of progestin is mediated with P4 receptors (PRs) and PR-B (as well PR-A) expression is reduced in endometriosis,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1933719111424453">52</xref>
</sup> the progestin resistance is likely due to the PR-B downregulation, possibly because of PR-B hypermethylation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1933719111424453">53</xref>
</sup> Obviously, when PR-B is hypermethylated and thus silenced, progestin treatment is unlikely to be effective. In contrast, HDACIs such as TSA and VPA can reactivate PR-B even when it is hypermethylated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719111424453">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719111424453">19</xref>
</sup> In addition, HDACIs have been shown to suppress cellular proliferation, invasiveness, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation in endometriosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719111424453">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719111424453">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719111424453">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1933719111424453">54</xref>
</sup> In view of all these, VPA appears to be a promising therapeutics for endometriosis.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to see that the joint administration of P4 and VPA did not further improve its efficacy over either P4 or VPA treatment alone. This may be attributed to the fact that, even though PR-B is downregulated in endometriosis, the aberrant expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein in endometriosis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1933719111424453">55</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1933719111424453">56</xref>
</sup> leads to increased production of P4 in endometriotic stromal cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1933719111424453">55</xref>
</sup> Hence, the added P4 as in our experiment does not help. This may explain our recent finding that the addition of intrauterine device containing progestin in conjunction with VPA results in similar results as in VPA treatment alone for patients with adenomyosis.<sup>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>In summary, our study provides evidence that treatment with VPA and/or P4 inhibits lesion growth and also reduces generalized hyperalgesia in experimentally induced endometriosis in rats as compared with those without the treatment. In addition, VPA is well tolerated, as with P4, and their treatment increases the weight gain in rats with endometriosis. These data, along with the mounting evidence that endometriosis is an epigenetic disease, suggest that HDACIs may be a promising therapeutics for treating endometriosis.</p>
