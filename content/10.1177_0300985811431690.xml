<p>If you need some guidance in neuropathology (and who doesn’t?), this is the book you have been waiting for. For many years there were limited book references for veterinary neuropathology, first with the 1962 edition of <italic>Comparative Neuropathology</italic>, by J. R. M. Innes and L. Z. Saunders, then the 1995 edition of <italic>Veterinary Neuropathology</italic>, by Brian A. Summers, John F. Cummings, and Alexander de Lahunta, and now the 2011 edition of <italic>Fundamental Neuropathology for Pathologists and Toxicologists: Principles and Techniques</italic>, edited by Brad Bolon and Mark Butt. I can finish my review now and say it’s a bargain at $149.95, the list price, but even better at lower prices via a popular shopping website. I will, however, review select aspects of the book and what makes it a great resource for veterinary neuropathology.</p>
<p>The book is composed of 35 chapters and 8 appendices, written by 55 coauthors. The content is divided into 4 parts: “Fundamentals of Neurobiology,” “Toxicologic Neuropathology: Methodology,” “Toxicological Neuropathology: Current Practices,” and “Applied Toxicological Neuropathology.”</p>
<p>As the editors note, “this book is not an atlas of lesions,” and it need not be. Instead, it is a valuable resource of methods, techniques, expertise, and procedures used by world experts in the fields of neurobiology and neuropathology. Various types of lesions are illustrated, however, in several chapters. An atlas of lesions will be published in the INHAND nomenclature series. Although some of the concepts have been published in the January 2011 issue of <italic>Toxicologic Pathology</italic>, this book represents more detail for these and many other methods. Some unique chapters and subjects include principles of development, comparative neuroanatomy, functional neuroanatomy, localizing lesions using neurologic findings, histologic artifacts, histologic markers of neurotoxicity, molecular techniques, imaging, regulatory considerations, and appendices including neural cell markers and neurobiological parameters. There are many chapters that are outstanding, while others are merely very good. The chapter on localizing neuropathologic lesions using neurologic findings is particularly helpful, as is the chapter on comparative neuroanatomy. There is some duplication, which is good for such a difficult specialty. Chapters on the pathology of the eye, ear, olfactory mucosa (nose), and skeletal muscle are also included, especially as these organs are associated with neurotoxicity.</p>
<p>Few negative comments can be made about this book. One feature of the book is not optimal but is available in a practical format. Figures are in black and white in each chapter of the printed version, but a group of 88 color figures drawn from many (but not all) chapters are found printed together in a section of the book. This procedure allows for much lower printing costs. As a bonus, you can go online and download all color figures to use for references in lectures. Another missing feature is a comprehensive listing of known neurotoxic chemicals and other agents; instead, this information is found as a subsection of some, but not all, chapters. For example, a compilation with examples by chemical class or even sources of databases could have been included, for carcinogens (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://potency.berkeley.edu/pdfs/CPDBPathology.pdf">http://potency.berkeley.edu/pdfs/CPDBPathology.pdf</ext-link>) or toxins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://toxipedia.org/display/toxipedia/Neurotoxins">http://toxipedia.org/display/toxipedia/Neurotoxins</ext-link>), for example. The references to atlases and other text or online resources is given in Appendix 2, but a chapter on a review of the atlases or description of one of them may have been more helpful.</p>
<p>Overall, I highly recommend this book for pathologists, toxicologists, and anyone interested in neuropathology and neurotoxicity. It is a great value at the price and a great resource for your library.</p>
