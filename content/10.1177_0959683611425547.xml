<abstract>
<p>High-resolution climate reconstructions from a range of natural archives across the world are fundamental to place current climate change into perspective. Paleoclimate records for the Southern Hemisphere are scarce and only a few quantitative high-resolution reconstructions exist for the past millennium. We present a record of annually laminated sediments of Lago Plomo (46°59′S, 72°52′W,203 m a.s.l.) located east of the Northern Patagonian Ice Field (NPI). Radiometric dating (<sup>210</sup>Pb, <sup>137</sup>Cs, <sup>14</sup>C AMS) is consistent with counts of millimetre-scale laminae, confirming the annual nature of the laminae couplets with a light summer and a dark winter layer. The varves were analyzed for thickness, mass accumulation rate (MAR), scanning x-ray fluorescence (XRF) and scanning reflectance spectroscopy in the visible range (VIS-RS). MAR data were calibrated against austral winter (JJA) precipitation data (CRU TS 3.0) for the period <sc>ad</sc> 1930–2002 (<italic>r</italic> = 0.67, <italic>p</italic><sub>(aut)</sub> &lt; 0.05). Using a linear inverse regression model we reconstructed winter precipitation for Lago Plomo back to <sc>ad</sc> 1530. The root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) is small (13.3 mm/month; 12% of the average precipitation) compared with the pronounced decadal and multidecadal variability, suggesting that most of the reconstructed variability is significant. Wetter phases (reference <sc>ad</sc> 1930–2002) were observed around <sc>ad</sc> 1600, <sc>ad</sc> 1630–1690 and <sc>ad</sc> 1780–1850, and a prolonged drier period <sc>ad</sc> 1690–1780 with a multidecadal minimum centered on <sc>ad</sc> 1770. The spatial correlation for South America suggests that the JJA precipitation record from Lago Plomo is representative for large areas in the southwest between <italic>c</italic>. 41°S and 51°S.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In order to place recent climatic changes into the long-term perspective, regional expressions of forced and unforced natural variability must be understood and discriminated from anthropogenic sources of climate change. Therefore, investigating past regional, hemispheric and global climatic changes is crucial for understanding present and future climate change, assessing the underlying dynamics and teleconnections, and to reduce uncertainties in future projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683611425547">Hegerl et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>South America is of particular interest because it is the only large land mass that extends through the main area of the modern Southern Hemisphere westerly wind belt at 40–55°S and, therefore, plays a crucial role for paleoclimate reconstruction in the Southern Hemisphere (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959683611425547">Garreaud et al., 2009</xref>). The precipitation regime in southern South America is very variable both in space and time because of the topography of the Andes and changes in the strength and latitudinal position of the southern Westerlies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959683611425547">Garreaud et al., 2009</xref>). Precipitation is also influenced by the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO).</p>
<p>Whereas much progress has been made in the development of paleoclimate records in Europe and North America, the Southern Hemisphere still lacks high-quality data sets with adequate temporal and spatial distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683611425547">Mann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959683611425547">Villalba et al., 2009</xref>), and information about temperature and precipitation for specific seasons of the year is heterogeneous. In the most recent comprehensive multiproxy and multisite summer temperature reconstruction for southern South America for the last millennium, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683611425547">Neukom et al. (2010b)</xref> only found five summer temperature records of adequate quality extending back beyond <sc>ad</sc> 1650. Most of these data sets are from tree ring studies, corals or ice cores and only one from lake sediments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611425547">von Gunten et al., 2009a</xref>). For precipitation, the data base is even worse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683611425547">Neukom et al., 2010a</xref>): the comprehensive reconstruction for South America does not reach further back than <sc>ad</sc> 1498 for summer precipitation and <sc>ad</sc> 1590 for winter precipitation.</p>
<p>At the regional level, distinct differences exist between the northern (40–47°S) and southern (47–55°S) Patagonian climates. This is shown by tree-ring derived temperature reconstructions in both areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683611425547">Villalba et al., 2003</xref>): while some features (e.g. a strong warming trend between <sc>ad</sc> 1850 and 1920) were found in both areas, the regional expressions of decadal and multidecadal variability were mostly out of phase between northern and southern Patagonia for the past 250 years. These opposite temperature trends are particularly striking in the past 50 years when northern Patagonia experienced a strong cooling and southern Patagonia a strong warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959683611425547">Falvey and Garreaud, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Paleoclimate information in the south (Lago Guanaco 51°S; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683611425547">Moy et al., 2009</xref>) suggests a gradual increase in the westerly flow and decreasing temperatures culminating during the ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA, <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1550–1900). Interestingly, Laguna Las Vizcachas (50°42′S) further to the east shows similar cool conditions between <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1450–1650 but afterwards relatively warm and moist conditions until <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1750 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683611425547">Fey et al., 2009</xref>). High lake levels and cool conditions persisted in the Pali Aike Volcanic Field (52°S, East Patagonian Steppe) throughout the LIA, particularly between <sc>ad</sc> 1670 and 1890 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683611425547">Haberzettl et al., 2005</xref>). However, the modern wind/precipitation relationship suggests that western and eastern Patagonia should show opposite humidity responses to enhanced westerly flow (wetter in the west, drier in the east; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683611425547">Moy et al., 2009</xref>), which is only partly reflected in the regional records.</p>
<p>Further north of our study site, high resolution marine sediment cores also suggest northward displacement of the westerlies, wetter conditions and cooler sea surface temperatures (SST) between <sc>ad</sc> 1550 and 1750 followed by rapid warming and drying between <sc>ad</sc> 1750 and 1850 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683611425547">Lamy et al., 2002</xref>). The precise ages of these changes (calibrated <sup>14</sup>C ages) are, however poorly constrained (e.g. one <sup>14</sup>C date per 1000 years). The most detailed study is the quantitative annually resolved autumn/winter recipitation reconstruction from varved Lago Puyehue (41°S) for the past 600 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683611425547">Boës and Fagel, 2008</xref>). This record is highly accurate in its chronology and reveals strong multidecadal to centennial precipitation variability. Tree ring series from northern Patagonia show pronounced decadal variability in precipitation, stream flow and temperature fluctuating around a mean value, whereby a low-frequency structure as found in the sediment records during the LIA is hardly visible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611425547">Boninsegna et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The only paleoclimate record close to our study site comes from Glaciar Soler, an outlet glacier of the Northern Patagonian Ice Field (NPI) in the catchment of Lago Plomo. <sup>14</sup>C dated advances were reported for the mid-fourteenth century and the beginning of the eighteenth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683611425547">Glasser et al., 2002</xref>), followed by several minor advances until <sc>ad</sc> 1950. Generally, glaciers in northern Patagonia showed the LIA maximum in the nineteenth century, while glaciers in southern Patagonia were largest in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683611425547">Masiokas et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>We present an annually resolved quantitative calibrated and validated austral winter precipitation reconstruction from lake sediments in the Patagonian Andes at 47°S back to <sc>ad</sc> 1530. This area is located in the climatic transition zone between southern (47°S–55°S) and northern (<italic>c</italic>. 37°S–47°S) Patagonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611425547">Boninsegna et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959683611425547">Garreaud et al., 2009</xref>). Our record is based on varved (annually laminated) sediments from proglacial Lago Plomo. Such sediments are rare for South America (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683611425547">Ariztegui et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>This paper starts with a description of the lake and the catchment followed by a detailed microstratigraphic characterization of the sediment laminae. We then compare laminae counts with radionuclide activity profiles to establish (i) an independent chronology supporting the annual nature of the laminae couplets and (ii) the varve chronology. Mass Accumulation Rates (MAR) were calibrated to austral winter precipitation, validated, and extended back to <sc>ad</sc> 1530. Finally, our reconstruction is compared with regional paleoclimate records.</p>

<title>Study area</title>
<p>Lago Plomo (46°59′S, 72°52′W, 203 m a.s.l.) is a proglacial, polymictic, oligotrophic, deep (&gt; 200 m) exorheic lake located on the eastern side of the NPI. It is partly dammed by a Lateglacial moraine and drains through an isthmus to Lago Bertrand.</p>
<p>The catchment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611425547">Figure 1a</xref>) extends with deep valleys and very steep slopes to the glaciers and snowfields of the NPI in the west and the Cordon Contreras in the north; peaks range up to <italic>c</italic>. 2000 m. Bedrock in the catchment is mostly composed of Devonian carboniferous sandstone and phyllite, and Jurassic quartzous diorite, granodiorite, granite and tonalite with biotite, pyroxene and hornblende (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959683611425547">SERNAGEOMIN, 2003</xref>). Snow and ice meltwater from the NPI, mainly from the Soler glacier and other smaller outlet glaciers drain into Lago Plomo and transport fluvioglacial sediments into the lake. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683611425547">Glasser et al. (2009)</xref> reported that the Soler glacier (50 km<sup>2</sup>, visited in <sc>ad</sc> 2000) is a land-terminating glacier, but currently recedes into a shallow moraine-dammed proglacial lake. The glacier formed a low, cross-valley proglacial moraine, ice scoured bedrock and extensive sandar deposits on the major ice discharge route. These glaciofluvial outwash plains are composed of rounded sandy gravel or sand present at the valley floor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683611425547">Glasser et al., 2009</xref>). The course of the river Soler is very variable, which is shown by several old courses on the outwash plain. Small rivers on the side slopes close to our coring site have smaller watersheds and no glaciers in their catchment and therefore contribute less to the sediment transport into the lake. The water of the lake contains a lot of suspended material which leads to very limited light transparency (Secchi-disc depth = 0.5 m). The water column did not show temperature stratification during summer (January 2009). The degree of mineralization is extremely low (electric conductivity 26.7 µS/cm), the pH is neutral (7.1) and phosphate concentrations were below detection limit.</p>

<p>Today, a temperate climate characterizes the area and is dominated by the westerly winds and precipitation. The CRU TS 3.0 data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683611425547">Mitchell and Jones, 2005</xref>) shows average annual temperatures for Lago Plomo of 5–6°C and <italic>c</italic>. 990 mm annual precipitation. The closest climate stations are Puerto Aysen, Chile Chico, Coyhaique and Balmaceda, but the records are very short and discontinuous, and the spatial precipitation gradients are very steep. The Andes play a major role in rainfall distribution: orographic precipitation leads to a local maximum (6000–7000 mm) on the windward side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959683611425547">Garreaud et al., 2009</xref>), decreases to about 1000 mm on the eastern slopes of the Andes, and to as little as 300 mm at Chile Chico on the border with Argentina. The NPI is dependent on the vigorous mid-latitude weather systems, which bring high rainfall; ablation rates are high, mass balance gradients steep and ice flow velocities high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683611425547">Matsuoka and Naruse, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959683611425547">Michel and Rignot, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959683611425547">Rott et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore glacier fluctuations are a response to changing circulation patterns including both equatorward and poleward shifts in the moisture-bearing southern Westerlies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683611425547">Glasser et al., 2002</xref>). In this area the Westerlies are strongest during austral summer peaking between 45° and 55°S. During winter, low level Westerlies expand equatorward but weaken (particularly at ~50°S), while the jet stream moves to lower latitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959683611425547">Garreaud et al., 2009</xref>). In the western part of Patagonia, the strength of the Westerlies and precipitation are positively correlated. This relationship disappears or becomes negative in the eastern part of Patagonia where Atlantic moisture sources increase.</p>
<p>The correlation field analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611425547">Figure 1</xref> inset, CRU TS 3.0, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683611425547">Mitchell and Jones, 2005</xref>, 47.0°S 72.5°W, <sc>ad</sc> 1930–2000) shows that Austral winter precipitation at Lago Plomo is positively correlated with winter precipitation in southern Chile and southwestern Argentina (41–51°S), showing the regional influence of the southern Westerlies.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>In January 2009 two parallel sediment cores of 1.2 and 0.86 m length (PLO-09-4 and PLO-09-5, respectively) were retrieved from the distal part of Lago Plomo at a water depth of 29 m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611425547">Figure 1b</xref>). We used an UWITEC gravity corer. The cores were sealed and stored under dark and cool (4°C) conditions prior to analysis. Radiometric dating, non-destructive reflectance spectrometry (VIS-RS) and varve counts were performed on PLO-09-5 while scanning x-ray fluorescence (XRF), varve counts, VIS-RS, MAR and thin sections were made on PLO-09-4. The data from the shorter core (PLO-09-5) were stratigraphically correlated varve by varve to the master core PLO-09-4.</p>
<p>Immediately after opening, the cores were analyzed with scanning (2 mm resolution) VIS-RS (visible spectrum: 380–730 nm; spectral resolution 10 nm) using a Gretag Mcbeth Spectrolino (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683611425547">Rein and Sirocko, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683611425547">Trachsel et al., 2010</xref>). The characteristic patterns and absorption bands of the reflectance spectra provide information about organic compounds (mainly photopigments; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683611425547">Rein and Sirocko, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611425547">von Gunten et al., 2009a</xref>) and the concentration and composition of lithic matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959683611425547">Rein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683611425547">Trachsel et al., 2010</xref>). Here we use two established proxies: (i) clastic sediments show a systematic increase in reflectance between 570 nm and 630 nm wavelength (i.e. the slope between 570 and 630 nm; <italic>R</italic><sub>570</sub>/<italic>R</italic><sub>630</sub>), which is attributed to illite, chlorite and biotite, and thus serves as a proxy for the concentration of the lithogenic fraction in the sediments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683611425547">Rein and Sirocko, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683611425547">Trachsel et al., 2010</xref>); (ii) total brightness as calculated from the average reflectance of the 36 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959683611425547">Rein et al., 2005</xref>) is used as a proxy indicating the relative proportions of the light summer layer to the dark winter layer in the varves.</p>
<p>The AVAATECH XRF Core Scanner ‘LisbETH’ of the Geological Institute ETH Zurich provided information about the elemental composition of the sediments at a 0.2 mm measuring resolution. Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe were measured at a tube voltage of 10 kV. The split sediment core surface was covered with a 4 µm thick <italic>Ultralene SPEX CertiPrep</italic>-foil to avoid contamination and desiccation of the sediment.</p>
<p>The nature of the laminations was investigated and the laminae counts performed under a light microscope and an environmental Scanning Electron Microscope LEO (Carl Zeiss) EVO 40XVP-BU on epoxy resin embedded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683611425547">Lotter and Lemcke, 1999</xref>) and polished (6 µm) sediment blocks of 18 cm length. Four sediment sequences (6.7–8 cm; 10.8–12.1 cm; 99–100.3 cm; 102.5–103.8 cm sediment depth of PLO-09-4) were scanned with a µ-XRF EAGLE III XRF, whereby the spatial arrangement of Al, Br, Mn, Ti, Si, Ca and Fe was mapped at ~100 µm resolution under vacuum conditions. This provided information on the elemental (and thus mineralogical) composition of the dark and the light laminae. The mineralogical composition of bulk sediments was determined with quantitative x-ray diffraction (XRD).</p>
<p>Laminae were counted by two people, five times each, along different lines on the resin-embedded sediment blocks using the software package Image J. Varve thickness measurements followed the same procedure.</p>
<p>The core PLO-09-5 was sampled at 0.5 cm intervals for <sup>210</sup>Pb and <sup>137</sup>Cs activity and water content measurements. Gamma ray counts of <sup>210</sup>Pb (46.5 keV) and <sup>137</sup>Cs (662 keV) were collected for more than 20 h using Canberra low background, well HPGe-detectors at EAWAG Duebendorf. <sup>226</sup>Ra was determined by measuring the activity of <sup>214</sup>Pb (352keV) and <sup>214</sup>Bi (609keV) (in radioactive equilibrium). Unsupported <sup>210</sup>Pb was calculated with the level-by-level method from the <sup>226</sup>Ra activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683611425547">Appleby, 2001</xref>). The measurement at 11.84 cm was not used for <sup>210</sup>Pb age modeling because of anomalously low activity values. In order to convert <sup>210</sup>Pb activity profiles into ages, we used three different numerical model types, the Constant Initial Concentration (CIC), Constant Rate of Supply (CRS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683611425547">Appleby, 2001</xref>) and the Sediment Isotope Tomography (SIT) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683611425547">Carroll et al., 1999</xref>). The CIC model displayed several age inversions and was not used.</p>
<p><sup>137</sup>Cs measurements were used as an independent time marker to constrain the <sup>210</sup>Pb age models. <sup>137</sup>Cs fallout in this area peaked in <sc>ad</sc> 1963 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683611425547">The Environmental Measurements Laboratory, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>A small fragment of wood buried in the sediments of core PLO-09-5 was AMS radiocarbon dated at the Poznan Radiocarbon Laboratory, Poland, and calibrated using the ShCal04 Southern Hemisphere Calibration curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683611425547">McCormac et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>We used the <sup>137</sup>Cs-constrained <sup>210</sup>Pb age models and the radiocarbon measurement to (i) corroborate the annual nature of the lamina couplets and (ii) verify the varve counting chronologies. The varve chronology with the smallest offset to the most plausible <sup>210</sup>Pb chronology (constrained SIT and constrained CRS) was used to convert varve thickness measurements into annual MAR after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959683611425547">Niessen et al.

<p>Subsequently the time series of annual MAR was detrended using locally weighted regression (loess, span = 0.85) to remove multicentury trends which might be related to non-climatic causes or indirect effects such as long-term ecosystem evolution in the catchment (e.g. vegetation dynamics and glacier length variations). Locally weighted regression estimates a regression surface to data through a multivariate smoothing procedure. The dependent variable is smoothed as a function of the independent variables in a moving form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683611425547">Cleveland and Devlin, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>As it is not a-priori known which climate variable and season is best predicted by our proxies measured, we prepared a correlation matrix and compared MAR with the seasonal and annual temperature and precipitation data of the CRU TS 3.0 data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683611425547">Mitchell and Jones, 2005</xref>; grid cell 46.5–47.0°S and 72.5–73.0°W). Local meteorological data are not available. As we will show in the section below, MAR data best predict winter (June–August, JJA) precipitation. We used the Pearson’s product moment correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> and corrected the <italic>p</italic>-values for autocorrelation (<italic>p</italic><sub>(aut)</sub>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683611425547">Dawdy and Matalas, 1964</xref>).</p>

<sub>(aut)</sub> &lt; 0.001, 1931–1992). Data from 1992 onwards are missing. Before <sc>ad</sc> 1930, the quality of the reanalysis data is reduced because of a strong decline in the number of stations available (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959683611425547">Garreaud et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683611425547">Neukom et al., 2010a</xref>). Therefore, we select the calibration period starting from <sc>ad</sc> 1930. As varve counting in the soft topmost sediments is ambiguous, we end the calibration period in the year <sc>ad</sc> 2002 (see below).</p>
<p>For the calibration, we used raw and five-years triangular filtered MAR data. The spread of the filter was selected according to the varve counting uncertainties in the calibration period (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683611425547">Koining et al., 2002</xref>). The climate inference model was calculated with linear inverse regression.

<title>Sediment classification and microfacies analysis</title>
<p>The sediments of Lago Plomo consist of light gray (Munsell color: gley 1–4/10GY) silty clay (median 6.0 µm) with very low concentrations of organic matter (TOC &lt; 1%). No diatoms or algae are present in the sediment and microscopic investigation of the resin embedded blocks showed very few terrestrial microfossils, namely larvae, remains of insects and small fragments of wood. The lithogenic fraction is composed of quartz (10–12%), orthoclase (<italic>c</italic>. 10%), plagioclase (38–45%) and clay minerals (<italic>c</italic>. 40%, not specified). The composition is very homogenous throughout the 120 cm long core.</p>
<p>Both cores show rhythmically laminated sediments that alternate between a light silty and a dark clay-rich millimetre-scale layer. The contacts between the silty and overlying clay-rich laminae are continuous. In contrast, the boundaries between clay-rich and overlying silty laminae are sharp. Each couplet with a silty and its overlying clay-rich layer represents a fining upward sequence as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611425547">Figure 2</xref>. These changes in particle size and colour correlate well with variations in elemental composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611425547">Figure 2b</xref>): the silty laminae contain higher concentrations of Fe whereas the clay laminae showed higher Ca and Si values.</p>

<p>The varve counting error amounts to ± 2.4 years from the top of the core to the depth of the <sup>137</sup>Cs peak (<sc>ad</sc> 1963) and increases towards the bottom of the core (<sc>ad</sc> 1530) cumulatively to ± 18.5 varve years (<italic>c</italic>. 4%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611425547">Figure 3c</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611425547">Figure 3b</xref> also shows a systematic offset of 4–6 varve years between the constrained <sup>210</sup>Pb ages and the varve counts. The <sup>210</sup>Pb profiles suggest that the ‘missing varves’ were lost in the top 1–2 cm of the core. This may be due to the very soft surface sediments and disturbance of the sediment–water interface during coring. Below 2 cm sediment depth, the varve counting and radiometric chronologies are consistent and go nicely in parallel. Thus for the final chronology, we fitted the varve chronology of the sediments below <italic>c</italic>. 1 cm sediment depth through the radiometric chronology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611425547">Figure 3b</xref>; parallel shift of 6 years) and do not use the years 2003–2008 for calibration. Also, the radiocarbon age of the wood fragment at 41 cm sediment depth (140 ± 30 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP, POZ-31863, calibrated midpoint <sc>ad</sc> 1840, ± 1σ range <sc>ad</sc> 1698–1945) fits with the varve counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611425547">Figure 3c</xref>). The uncertainty range of calibrated <sup>14</sup>C ages is, however, large in this period of time.</p>
<p>The overall varve count chronology is consistent with the radiometric chronology (<sup>210</sup>Pb, <sup>137</sup>Cs, <sup>14</sup>C). Therefore we interpret the lamina couplets as clastic varves, whereby one light layer and one dark layer represent sedimentation during one year. We interpret the light silty layer as deposition during the season when water inflows and undercurrents in the lake are very active, the suspended sediment load and the density of the lake water is high, and relatively coarse grains may be transported to the distal parts of the lake. Clay size sediments remain largely in suspension and are exported to Lago Bertrand. This is typical for the snow and ice melt season in spring and summer. In contrast, the dark clay-rich layer would be deposited in winter, when less kinetic energy is available (no snowmelt, weak undercurrents and weak winds) and conditions are calm.</p>
<p>The sedimentation rate appears relatively constant throughout the core.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In order to assess the quality of the austral winter precipitation reconstruction here, a number of related issues are fundamental. Most critical is the question whether or not the laminae couplets are annual deposits as this determined the chronology. This in turn is fundamental for developing the proxy–climate calibration and the temporal accuracy of the paleoclimate reconstruction. Furthermore, the robustness of the calibration method needs to be evaluated and a mechanistic explanation is required to corroborate the statistical relationship between MAR and JJA precipitation. Finally, we need to synthesize a regional paleoclimate picture that is dynamically consistent and reflects existing teleconnection patterns.</p>
<sec id="section10-0959683611425547">
<title>Are the laminae seasonal and how good is the chronology?</title>
<p>Two independent lines of argument support our interpretation that the laminae couplets are annual deposits.</p>
<p>From the sedimentological and microstratigraphic point of view, the laminae of Lago Plomo are very similar to the clastic varves that have been identified in Laguna Frias, which is located in a comparable setting on the east side of the Andes: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683611425547">Ariztegui et al. (2007)</xref> found light and dark layers, and suggested that the light silty material would be deposited during spring and summer snowmelt whereas the darker clay material would be deposited in winter under calmer conditions. In Laguna Frias the material is partly washed out by rainfall from the catchment and partly transported by fluvio-glacial processes into the lake. Glaciers produce fine sediment material by abrasion of the bedrock, which is carried as suspension load by meltwater during spring and summer and deposited in the lake. The erosion rate is dependent on the glacier size and thickness and therefore indirectly controlled by climate (summer temperature and winter precipitation). Therefore climatic changes can be archived in proglacial lake sediments, as variations in the accumulated amount of the silt- and clay-sized mineral fraction in a proglacial lake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683611425547">Leemann and Niessen, 1994</xref>). A limiting factor for sediment accumulation in winter is the strong seasonality of the meteorological parameters (higher precipitation and lower temperature) and that most of the catchment of Laguna Frias remains frozen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683611425547">Ariztegui et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A similar process provides a mechanistic explanation for the relationship between MAR and winter precipitation in Lago Plomo: winter precipitation (snow) reaches the lake during snowmelt in spring and summer, when detrital sediments are conveyed by active undercurrents to the distal part of the lake and form the coarse and light summer layer of the varve couplet. It is expected that MAR of the summer layer also contains a summer precipitation and/or a temperature signal. However, this does not seem to be statistically significant but may contribute to the error of prediction in the calibration model.</p>
<p>In order to confirm the annual nature of the laminations it is important to compare the lamina counts with independent age determination such as <sup>210</sup>Pb model age profiles, <sup>137</sup>Cs markers and radiocarbon dating. We systematically tested different <sup>210</sup>Pb age models (CIC, CRS and SIT) and found that the constrained CRS and SIT models produced very similar results. This was also found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683611425547">von Gunten et al. (2009b)</xref> who tested the <sup>210</sup>Pb age models on clastic sediments from two high-elevation glacial lakes in the Central Chilean Andes. The CIC model was rejected because of multiple age inversions. Overall, the constrained <sup>210</sup>Pb chronologies are highly consistent with the varve counts during the calibration period. Additionally, the radiocarbon age mid-point of a small wood fragment is in line with varve counts around <sc>ad</sc> 1840 suggesting that the varve chronology is also robust on longer timescales. However, the age uncertainty (calibration range) of <sup>14</sup>C dates in this time period is very large.</p>
<p>The varve counting was carried out repeatedly by different people in order to gain an estimation of the chronological uncertainty (± 18.5 varves cumulatively for the total core length). The uncertainty of the chronology and the probabilistic nature of the sediment ages during the calibration period (± 3.5 varves) determines the degree of Gaussian or triangular data filtering that is recommended for the proxy–climate calibration-in-time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683611425547">Koining et al., 2002</xref>). However, the degree of smoothing marks the upper limit of the temporal resolution for the reconstruction, which is meaningful for palaeoclimate interpretations, enhances the correlation coefficient but also reduces the statistical significance of the correlation (predictor-predictand) because the time series get increasingly autocorrelated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683611425547">Dawdy and Matalas, 1964</xref>).</p>
<p>A common problem for proxy–climate calibration and <sup>210</sup>Pb dating is the disturbance of the soft sediment–water interface during coring. Disturbed, erroneously identified or missing varves may lead to wrong interpretations of the palaeoclimate signal. We found that varve counting and radiometric chronologies go nicely in parallel below 1–2 cm sediment depth whereas a few varves seem to be missing at the top. In Lago Plomo, varve identification in the top sediments is not unambiguous. Thus, we have systematically tested the match between the varve chronology and (i) the independent radiometric chronology and (ii) the results of the calibration statistics by varying the number of varves ‘lost’ in the top sediments. The best match appeared with a lag of minus six varves, when the varve chronology fits through the <sup>210</sup>Pb chronology and the <sup>137</sup>Cs marker, and the calibration statistics perform best.</p>

<sec id="section11-0959683611425547">
<title>How good are the calibration and the reconstruction?</title>
<p>Another important issue is to systematically evaluate the quality of the calibration with the meteorological data set. Since very few regional weather stations exist and records are often discontinuous, we have chosen the gridded precipitation data from the CRU TS 3.0 data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683611425547">Mitchell and Jones, 2005</xref>) to calibrate the MAR record. The gridded data perform well in this area and are highly correlated with the nearest reasonably long regional weather station in Puerto Aysen.</p>
<p>The length of the calibration period and the amplitude of variability represented during this time are most critical for the calibration-in-time approach. Although the calibration period is very short (77 years), it features a large range from dry (<sc>ad</sc> 1940–1955 and <sc>ad</sc> 1982–1997) to very humid conditions (<sc>ad</sc> 1955–1981), encompassing most of the variability comprised in the proxy data series during the last 480 years.</p>
<p>The MAR record is well dated and has been developed independently. It appears from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611425547">Figure 5</xref> that MAR data and meteorological data (5-years filtered) are sometimes offset by 1–2 years, which is likely due to varve counting errors. This offset is smaller than the varve counting uncertainty and can be adjusted for. The mineralogical composition, color and microstratigraphy of the sediments remain the same throughout the entire core, which allows us to extrapolate the calibration model from the recent sediments back in time.</p>
<p>The proxy data were loess detrended to eliminate possible low-frequency non-climate effects on the sedimentation rate. The span was chosen to ensure the full interannual to multidecadal variability of the calibration period was retained, but (multi)centennial effects such as long-term glacier length variations, vegetation dynamics or soil formation were eliminated.</p>
<p>To reconstruct precipitation we tested linear inverse regression, linear inverse prediction and scaling as statistical methods. Linear inverse regression, the most commonly used method revealed the best results (i.e. smallest RMSEP). The RMSEP of 13.3 mm/month is very small compared with the amplitude of the decadal variability, which means that most of the changes observed are significant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0959683611425547">
<title>How well does the reconstruction fit with the regional paleoclimate history (North and South Patagonia)?</title>
<p>Our record shows very humid phases around <sc>ad</sc> 1600, 1640–1690 and around <sc>ad</sc> 1780–1850; dry periods occurred generally in the eighteenth century and the second half of the nineteenth century through to the present.</p>
<p>Since Lago Plomo is located in the transition zone between north and south Patagonia we may expect changing influences from both the north and the south. At least temperature-wise over the past 400 years, both areas at times show a coherent pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683611425547">Villalba et al., 2003</xref>). The spatial distribution of rainfall makes regional comparisons more difficult.</p>
<p>The paleoclimate archive closest to our study site is Glaciar Soler. <sup>14</sup>C and tree ring dated maximum advances prior to <sc>ad</sc> 1720 and prior to <sc>ad</sc> 1850 (minimum ages; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683611425547">Masiokas et al., 2009</xref>) are consistent with humid phases and enhanced MAR in the late seventeenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century, taking into account a response-lag of the glacier in the order of two to three decades and that glaciers in this area respond predominantly to humidity changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683611425547">Glasser et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>More difficult is the comparison with marine SST and humidity records off the Chilean coast at 41°S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683611425547">Lamy et al., 2002</xref>) and lake sediment/vegetation records from Laguna Las Vizcachas and Lago Guanaco at 51°S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683611425547">Fey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683611425547">Moreno et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683611425547">Moy et al., 2009</xref>). The main limitations are (i) the poor dating control (typically one <sup>14</sup>C date per 500 or 1000 years, four in Laguna Las Vizcachas) and (ii) the presence of mixed signals (wind, precipitation, temperature and evaporation) in the sediment proxies. Judging from the data, it remains inconclusive whether the decadal-scale precipitation variability as presented in our record is in or out of phase with the decadal-scale variability of the hydrological cycle and/or strength of the zonal wind as shown in the other regional records. However, the wet phase in the late seventeenth century in west Patagonia (Lago Plomo, Laguna Las Vizcachas, marine proxies from GeoB-3313-1 at 41°S and to some extent at Lago Guanaco at 51°S) concurrent with the drying in east Patagonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683611425547">Haberzettl et al., 2005</xref>) appears regionally significant and dynamically consistent. In contrast, the beginning of the eighteenth century (1690–1780) appears dry in this region (Lago Plomo, Laguna Las Vizcachas) whereas east Patagonia (Laguna Potrok Aike) suggests enhanced fluvial input, which is in line with teleconnection patterns.</p>
<p>Surprising is the consistency of our record with the only existing highly resolved, well dated and quantitative winter precipitation reconstruction from Lago Puyehue 41°S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611425547">Figure 6b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683611425547">Boës and Fagel, 2008</xref>). The quality and resolution of both records allows for a comparison of decadal-scale winter precipitation variability. As shown by the spatial correlation patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611425547">Figure 1</xref> inset), the precipitation variability is correlated at Lago Plomo and Lago Puyehue, suggesting that both independent records provide a robust regional record. The authors report higher winter precipitation for the periods <sc>ad</sc> 1630–1730 and <sc>ad</sc> 1780–1820, which coincides with wet phases in our record (<sc>ad</sc> 1640–1690, <sc>ad</sc>1780–1850). Drier conditions at Lago Puyehue are reported for <sc>ad</sc> 1730–1780 and <sc>ad</sc> 1820–1920 and decreasing precipitation for <sc>ad</sc> 1950–2000. Dry phases at Lago Plomo occurred in the eighteenth century and the second half of the nineteenth century and from <sc>ad</sc> 1950 to the present.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The laminated sediments of Lago Plomo provide a quantitative high-resolution reconstruction of interannual to multidecadal winter precipitation variability for western Patagonia. This record is based on MAR and extends back to <sc>ad</sc> 1530 with high chronological accuracy. Independent <sup>210</sup>Pb and <sup>137</sup>Cs profiles and <sup>14</sup>C AMS data confirmed the varve counts and thus the annual nature of the laminae. The varves have been counted repeatedly and counting uncertainty has been assessed to <italic>c</italic>. ± 4%.</p>
<p>The quantitative statistical relationship (calibration) between MAR and JJA precipitation is explained with a well-established mechanistic model: the light coarse-grained layer of the laminae couplet is formed during snowmelt in spring and summer, when large amounts of suspended sediments are transported in active undercurrents to the distal parts of the lake. In contrast, the clay-rich dark layer of the couplet is formed during winter under calm conditions. We conclude that (i) the laminae couplets are annual deposits and provide a highly accurate chronology with annual resolution, and that (ii) the varve formation process and the proxy to predict JJA precipitation (MAR) is understood and plausible.</p>
<p>The calibration-in-time has been tested and cross-validated. The statistics of the model indicate MAR may be used to reconstruct JJA precipitation with a small error of prediction. Further more, the calibration period covers most of the reconstructed decadal-scale variability and trends, which shows the robustness of the reconstruction from a statistical point of view.</p>
<p>The presented reconstruction provides insight into subdecadal- to centennial-scale climate variability for the area of 47°S, thus filling a gap between North and South Patagonia. Our record suggests more humid phases (with reference to the twentieth century) around <sc>ad</sc> 1600, in the late seventeenth and first half of the nineteenth century, and a prolonged drier period in the eighteenth century (<sc>ad</sc> 1690–1780) with a multidecadal minimum centered on <sc>ad</sc> 1770. However, decadal-scale variability was pronounced throughout our record (i.e. since 1530). Our JJA precipitation reconstruction compares well (even at the decadal scale) with a quantitative autumn/winter precipitation reconstruction from varved Lago Puyehue (41°S), which is consistent with spatial correlation patterns of the modern climate. Our record is also consistent with regional glacier length fluctuations, marine sediments off the Chilean coast (41°S) and lake sediment records in western and eastern Patagonia (51°S). These records are, however, relatively poorly constrained in their chronology and often contain mixed climatic signals. The overall comparison shows that our JJA precipitation record is robust and can be used to extend the comprehensive spatially explicit multiproxy and multisite reconstructions that are currently limited to <sc>ad</sc> 1750 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683611425547">Neukom et al., 2010a</xref>).</p>
