<p>With the emergence of the new Localism Bill, which will devolve greater power to councils and neighbourhoods and give more control over housing and planning, the decisions that will impact on the wider determinants of health will rest in the hands of the local community. The shift in power from central government back into the hands of individuals, communities and councils comes as the Government’s strategy for public health in England, ‘Healthy Lives, Healthy People’ (November 2010) moves forward through a series of public health system reforms placing public health within local authorities.</p>
<p>‘Promoting the wellbeing of individuals and communities is fundamental to the work of local government, and is a strong motivator for local councillors everywhere,’ writes Councillor David Rogers OBE, chair of the Local Government Association Community Wellbeing Programme Board, in his foreword to the 2010 report, The Role of Local Government in Promoting Wellbeing.</p>
<p>The Role of Local Government in Promoting Wellbeing (commissioned by Local Government Improvement and Development and the National Mental Health Development Unit) examined how local government can support a better life for its citizens to help build resilient communities, now and in the long term. So how will elected members of councils reshape their role in making decisions that will prevent long-term health problems and achieve reductions in expenditure and efficiency savings?</p>
<p>North West Employers recognised the challenge early and, with the Healthy Communities team at NHS Central Lancashire, undertook a health literacy knowledge and skills assessment. Building on the findings from this work and in collaboration with the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) Training Solutions team, North West Employers and NHS Central Lancashire successfully designed an innovative programme on health improvement to develop the councillor health champion.</p>
<p>North West Employers exists to help organizations deliver public services with and for local people that reflect their priorities. It believes that a highly motivated, productive workforce, together with skilled and supported councillors, are key to making this happen. Central to its work is supporting councillors with new and emerging agendas, such as the move of many public health functions to local government.</p>
<p>The collaboration brought together the experience of RSPH Training Solutions with North West Employers in order to identify and anticipate needs so that councillors could prepare to take a more proactive role in improving the well-being of residents in their communities.</p>
<p>Gulab Singh MBE, assistant director of Healthy Communities at NHS Central Lancashire, also a speaker on the programme and whose initial work provided the evidence base, identified that while elected members had a high understanding of the different determinants of health, they had a lower understanding of public health terms and techniques. Also, low levels of awareness about a number of public health terms and tools indicated a need for support in responding to future challenges.</p>
<p>A series of Quick Guides, which complemented the programme, were developed as a result of the health literacy knowledge and skills assessment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1757913911430908">1</xref></sup> The key areas covered were: understanding health and well-being; a look at the national policy changes in relation to health and well-being; a focus on local health and well-being inequalities and how local councillors can positively influence them; practical tools and techniques; how the decisions local government make impact health and well-being; and the role of the councillor health champion. Combined with the learning outcomes for RSPH Understanding Health Improvement, this provided a programme that led to the level 2 accredited award, which is assessed by simple multiple-choice questions.</p>
<p>Councillor Val Slater, North West Employers associate and local councillor in Bradford, anchored the programme, providing expert knowledge and drawing on her experience as chair of the Regeneration and Economy Improvement Committee and her work in the Scrutiny of Affordable Housing 2009.</p>
<p>The design of the programme has been such that there is capacity to embrace local context and flavour by incorporating specialist local speakers of relevance into the public health needs of the area. The programme is both theoretical and practical in nature. In planning the programme, the aim was to ensure that it could be replicable across the country while at the same time reflective and determined by the health needs of the particular region in which it is delivered. The programme helps delegates to understand and navigate the key terms and concepts of health and well-being.</p>
<p>North West Employers and the RSPH are able to offer this programme to member organizations. It is suitable for both district and upper-tier councils and for both ward councillors and those with a leadership role.</p>
