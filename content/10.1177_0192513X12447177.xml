<abstract>
<p>A large number of studies have shown that parental divorce is associated with psychological maladjustment in children. Less is known about whether the magnitude of this association has changed over time. This is mainly because of the lack of repeated data, containing identical measures over time. In the present article, the authors use data from two waves of the Swedish Level of Living Survey, conducted in 1968 and 2000, to analyze whether the association between parental divorce and psychological adjustment in 19- to 34-year-olds (i.e., born during 1934-1949 and 1966-1981) has changed between the two survey years. Results indicate a weakening association over time, but the change does not reach statistical significance. A reason for the persisting link seems to be that parental divorce is still associated with economic hardship and, above all, family dissension, two conditions that in turn are strongly associated with psychological problems in children.</p>

<body>
<p>During the 20th century, divorce rates have increased substantially in most societies in the Western world. It has been well demonstrated that parental divorce is associated with several negative outcomes in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192513X12447177">Amato, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192513X12447177">Amato &amp; Keith, 1991a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192513X12447177">1991b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0192513X12447177">Sigle-Rushton &amp; McLanahan, 2004</xref>), and there is some evidence to suggest that the effect of family structure is causal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192513X12447177">Cherlin, Chase-Lansdale, &amp; McRae, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192513X12447177">Ermisch &amp; Francesconi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0192513X12447177">Gruber, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0192513X12447177">Painter &amp; Levine, 2000</xref>). However, during the past two decades, another relevant question has emerged in the literature concerning whether the impact of parental divorce on children has decreased over time, as divorce has become more common. Studies do show that people’s attitudes toward divorce are less negative than they used to be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0192513X12447177">Thornton &amp; Young-DeMarco, 2001</xref>), and at present parental divorce means something different to children than it did in the past. In Sweden, an ever-increasing proportion of children remain in frequent contact with the noncustodial parent following family dissolution and even live with both parents, alternating between households, something that was uncommon just a few decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0192513X12447177">Statistics Sweden, 2007</xref>). Hence, today outsiders may no longer view divorce as they used to, and a divorce may no longer imply what it once did to those directly involved. Despite these changes, studies on whether the effect of parental divorce on children’s outcomes varies across cohorts are still few. The main reason is that such studies make strong demands on the data. Ideally, data should cover a long time period, maintain identical measures over time, and be based on identical sampling procedures, but such data are rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192513X12447177">Amato, 2001</xref>). Here, we use a Swedish data set that meets these criteria, that is, the Swedish Level of Living Survey (LNU), which covers the period 1968-2000 and includes identical data on family type during childhood and the outcome in focus here, that is, psychological problems, across surveys. Hence using these data, we are able to compare the psychological well-being of young adults (19-34 years) from intact and dissolved families, and in cohorts (1934-1949 and 1966-1981) of individuals who mainly grew up before and after the large increase in divorce rates that took place in the 1970s.</p>

<title>Parental Divorce and Children’s Psychological Well-Being</title>
<p>Research shows that children who experienced parental divorce generally report lower psychological well-being than do children from intact families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192513X12447177">Amato &amp; Keith, 1991b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0192513X12447177">Seltzer, 1994</xref>), even into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192513X12447177">Amato &amp; Sobolewski, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192513X12447177">Booth &amp; Amato, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192513X12447177">Chase-Lansdale, Cherlin, &amp; Kiernan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192513X12447177">Cherlin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X12447177">Furstenberg &amp; Kiernan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0192513X12447177">Sigle-Rushton, Hobcraft, &amp; Kiernan, 2005</xref>). A possible mechanism behind this association is that parental divorce per se affects children’s emotional well-being negatively, as children may experience feelings of loss and abandonment after parental divorce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0192513X12447177">Pryor &amp; Rodgers, 2001</xref>). Parental divorce is also often associated with other stressful conditions for children, however. First, many children experience a decline in standard of living following separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192513X12447177">Amato, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192513X12447177">Del Boca, 2003</xref>), also in Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192513X12447177">Gähler, 2001</xref>), and poor economic conditions during childhood increase the risk for psychological problems in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192513X12447177">Kiernan &amp; Huerta, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0192513X12447177">Kiernan &amp; Mensah, 2009</xref>) and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192513X12447177">Chase-Lansdale et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0192513X12447177">Sobolewski &amp; Amato, 2007</xref>). Second, there is ample evidence that predivorce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192513X12447177">Hanson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192513X12447177">Jekielek, 1998</xref>) and postdivorce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192513X12447177">Kelly &amp; Emery, 2003</xref>) inter-parental conflict is at least partly responsible for the association between parental divorce and children’s psychological well-being. Third, divorce also affects adults’ psychological well-being negatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192513X12447177">Gähler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0192513X12447177">Johnson &amp; Wu, 2002</xref>), and the quality of parenting of both the custodial and the noncustodial parent deteriorates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192513X12447177">Amato &amp; Gilbreth, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0192513X12447177">McLanahan &amp; Sandefur, 1994</xref>). It has also been shown that children whose parents are suffering from psychological distress and have poor parenting skills exhibit higher risks for psychological problems themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192513X12447177">Goodman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192513X12447177">Kiernan &amp; Huerta, 2008</xref>). Finally, studies show that the association between parental divorce and child problems is similar for adopted and biological children, indicating that the link between parental divorce and offspring psychological adjustment is not caused by genetic factors in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X12447177">Amato &amp; Cheadle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192513X12447177">Brodzinsky, Hitt, &amp; Smith, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0192513X12447177">O’Connor, Caspi, DeFries, &amp; Plomin, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Pathways of Changing Negative Effects of Divorce</title>
<p>There are several reasons to assume that the negative effects of divorce should decrease over time as divorce becomes a more commonplace phenomenon and as society becomes more adapted to this new social change. First, because the increase in divorce rates entails that alternative family structures have become more widely accepted, divorce has come to be accompanied by less stigma; as a consequence, the degree of community disapproval should decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0192513X12447177">Sigle-Rushton et al., 2005</xref>). As the stigma decreases, the negative effect of parental divorce on children’s well-being should also diminish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0192513X12447177">Wolfinger, 2005</xref>). Second, during recent decades in Sweden, increased female employment and a number of family and social policy programs have helped to reduce income dispersion between family types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192513X12447177">Gähler, 2001</xref>). Although these differences are by no means eliminated, single mothers in Sweden are still better off economically than their peers in other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192513X12447177">Bradbury &amp; Jäntti, 1999</xref>). Third, recent empirical research suggests that as divorce becomes more prevalent, the nature of marital dissolution changes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192513X12447177">de Graaf and Kalmijn (2006)</xref> show that when parental divorce is rare, severe divorce motives (e.g., violence and infidelity) are more frequent, but when this event is more common, and less select, relational and psychological motives are the norm. When social and economic barriers to divorce are low, even couples who have not experienced severe conflict may decide to divorce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0192513X12447177">Wolfinger, 2005</xref>). Thus, if parental conflict affects children’s psychological well-being, and if parental conflict declines when divorce becomes more prevalent, then it could be argued that the association between parental divorce and children’s psychological well-being should also be reduced. Fourth, over time, parents may have become more aware of children’s needs and of how family dissolution affects children. Hence, today’s parents might be better able to help their children alleviate any negative effects of parental divorce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0192513X12447177">Sigle-Rushton et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>What previous arguments have in common is that they imply a decrease in the effect of parental divorce when divorce is more prevalent. However, in the literature we also find some arguments against the “declining effect hypothesis.” One of them points to the evolution of the social composition of divorce. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192513X12447177">Goode (1962</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192513X12447177">1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192513X12447177">1993</xref>) suggests that the relationship between social class and marital instability depends on the extent to which divorce has become easily acquired and extensively widespread. When legal, social, and economic barriers to divorce are high, and divorce is rare, then this event is more common in higher social strata (whether it is defined as education, occupation, or income). However, as these barriers diminish, marital instability becomes more frequent among lower classes. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192513X12447177">Goode (1970</xref>, p. 86) predicted that “a gradual shift in the <italic>class distribution</italic> of divorce should occur, from a positive correlation between class position and divorce rate, to a negative one,” a prediction that has later been corroborated in several empirical studies (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192513X12447177">Härkönen &amp; Dronkers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192513X12447177">Hoem, 1997</xref>). Following this line of reasoning, we find it reasonable to argue that the association between parental divorce and psychological problems in children should increase when divorce becomes more common in lower social strata, at least insofar as financial hardship is detrimental to children, and insofar as this change is not balanced or outweighed by other changes (see above).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192513X12447177">Amato (2001)</xref> makes another argument against the declining effect hypothesis that concerns family conflict prior to divorce. As noted, in societies with higher divorce rates, parents split up with lower levels of conflict. The literature has demonstrated that divorce can benefit children living in high-conflict marriages, because it removes them from an aversive, stressful, home environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192513X12447177">Amato, Loomis, &amp; Booth, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192513X12447177">Booth &amp; Amato, 2001</xref>). In contrast, however, the dissolution of low-conflict marriages appears to have negative effects on offsprings’ lives because it represents an unexpected and unwelcome event—an event that children are likely to experience as stressful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192513X12447177">Amato et al., 1995</xref>). Divorce under these circumstances represents a major change in what may otherwise have been a secure and (from the child’s perspective) seemingly well-functioning family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192513X12447177">Booth &amp; Amato, 2001</xref>). Thus, if divorce is more harmful for these children, and this type of divorce has become more common, then we would not expect the negative effect of parental divorce to have decreased across generations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0192513X12447177">
<title>Studies on Change Over Time</title>
<p>Despite these theoretical arguments, empirical studies on change over time are few. Therefore, we will also refer to studies that focus on outcomes other than psychological well-being. These studies use three different strategies. One strategy is to compare results from studies conducted during different decades. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192513X12447177">Amato and Keith’s (1991b)</xref> comprehensive meta-analysis on studies conducted between the 1950s and 1980s shows that the effect size of divorce on children is smaller for more recent studies on various outcomes (although not for psychological adjustment). Consequently, they predicted that the effect size of parental divorce should continue to decrease in the next decade. But when replicating the meta-analysis, including studies published in the 1990s, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192513X12447177">Amato (2001)</xref> generally finds that the effect size of parental divorce tends to increase again in the 1990s (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0192513X12447177">Reifman, Villa, Amans, Rethinam, &amp; Telesca, 2001</xref>). In fact, the deterioration during the 1990s is particularly strong for psychological adjustment. Amato speculates that the general trend may be due to an increasing income gap between family types and/or an increase in low-discord marriages ending in divorce and that this, in turn, is especially distressing to children. For adult children, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192513X12447177">Amato and Keith (1991a)</xref> find that the effect of parental divorce on psychological well-being is less negative in the 1980s compared with previous decades. One weakness associated with this strategy, of course, is that studies included in the meta-analyses involve a variety of measures and research designs, thus making direct comparisons difficult.</p>
<p>A second strategy, therefore, is to compare the effect of parental divorce across generations, using identical measures over time. Here again, we find different results depending on the type of outcome studied. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X12447177">Biblarz and Raftery (1999)</xref> show that the effect of family structure on children’s educational and occupational success in the United States has been constant over the past 30 years. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192513X12447177">Ely, Richards, Wadsworth, and Elliott (1999)</xref> compared the effect of parental divorce on children’s educational attainment in three British cohorts (1946, 1958, and 1970) and found that the effect of family breakdown on children has not attenuated with the increasing prevalence of divorce. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0192513X12447177">Sigle-Rushton et al. (2005)</xref>, comparing British cohorts born in 1958 and 1970, show that the association between parental divorce and children’s educational attainment and socioeconomic and psychological well-being has not decreased across generations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0192513X12447177">Wolfinger (2005)</xref>, on the other hand, finds that the relative risk for teenage marriage among children of divorce decreases substantially during the period 1973-1994. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0192513X12447177">Wolfinger (1999)</xref> also shows that the intergenerational transmission of divorce has attenuated over time, a conclusion that is contradicted, however, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0192513X12447177">Li and Wu (2008)</xref>.</p>
<p>We also find mixed evidence using a third strategy, that is, comparing countries with different divorce rates, divorce laws, family policies, and social attitudes toward divorce. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192513X12447177">Kalmijn (2008)</xref> finds that the negative effect of parental divorce on father–child contact is higher in the low-divorce Southern countries than in the high-divorce Nordic countries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192513X12447177">Engelhardt, Trappe, and Dronkers (2002)</xref> show that the intergenerational transmission of divorce was stronger in West Germany, characterized by relatively low divorce rates and traditional divorce laws and family policies, than in East Germany. Accordingly, in a meta-analysis of European studies on divorce, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0192513X12447177">Wagner and Weiß (2006)</xref> find a negative association between the proportion of children from divorced families in a country and the intergenerational transmission of divorce. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X12447177">Daatland (2007)</xref>, however, shows that the negative effects of divorce on parent–child contacts are similar in Norwegian rural and urban areas, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192513X12447177">Ely, West, Sweeting, and Richards (2000)</xref> find that the effect of parental divorce on children’s psychological well-being, educational attainment, lifestyles, and health is not more detrimental in Scotland (with low divorce rates) than in England (with high divorce rates). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0192513X12447177">Tomassini et al. (2004)</xref> show that the effects of parental divorce on mother–child and father–child contacts are not stronger in countries where divorce is an infrequent phenomenon, such as Italy, than in countries where marital breakup is more common, such as Finland, Great Britain, and the Netherlands. Following these findings, there would seem to be no clear conclusion about the declining effect hypothesis.</p>

<title>Data and Analytical Strategy</title>
<p>Our analyses are based on data from two waves of the LNU, collected in 1968 and 2000 (LNU was also carried out in 1974, 1981, and 1991 and is initiated by the Swedish Institute for Social Research at Stockholm University). For all years, a 0.1% random sample of the Swedish population aged 18 to 75 years (15-75 years in 1968, 1974, and 1981) was interviewed face-to-face about their general living conditions, including childhood conditions, family situation, education, health, and economic resources. An essential trait of these data is that they contain identical measures over time for family type in childhood, psychological well-being, and different control variables. LNU has a panel structure, that is, respondents remain in the sample between surveys as long as they meet age criteria. To ensure representativeness of each cross-sectional survey, older cohorts, that is, those who have passed age 75 years between waves, are replaced by younger cohorts and a sample of immigrants that arrived to Sweden between waves is also added. The response rate was 90.8% in 1968 and 76.6% in 2000 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192513X12447177">Jonsson &amp; Mills, 2001</xref>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sofi.su.se">http://www.sofi.su.se</ext-link> for more thorough descriptions of the data set).</p>
<p>Our analytical strategy is to compare individuals of the same age but who experienced parental divorce during different time periods. As a result of the panel structure of the data, most individuals have taken part in more than one survey. To achieve independence between observations, that is, only allow a given respondent to contribute to estimations on one occasion, we distinguished two nonoverlapping time periods during which the parental divorce did occur. The data contain information on whether the respondent has experienced parental divorce up to age 16 years. Hence, analyses for 1968 are based on respondents born during the period 1934-1949 (1,633 observations), who, if at all, experienced parental divorce during the period 1934-1965, and analyses for 2000 are based on cohorts born during the period 1966-1981 (1,460 observations), who, if at all, experienced parental divorce during the period 1966-1997. Thus, respondents aged 19 to 34 years in 1968 and 2000, respectively were included.</p>

<title>Variables</title>
<sec id="section6-0192513X12447177">
<title>The Dependent Variable</title>
<p>The main dependent variable used here is <italic>psychological problems</italic>. Information on six different indicators was used, based on the question “Have you, during the past 12 months, had any of the following illnesses or ailments?” The indicators are “general tiredness,” “insomnia,” “nervous trouble, “overexertion,” “depression,” and “mental illness.” These indicators are based on the respondent’s own perception of psychological problems. For all indicators, three answer categories were given: “no problems,” “mild problems,” and “severe problems.” We dichotomized all indicators into 0 (<italic>no problem</italic>) and 1 (<italic>any problem</italic>). We also constructed a summarizing variable, based on all six indicators, again dichotomized into 0 (<italic>no problem</italic>) and 1 (<italic>any problem</italic>). The internal consistency among the six items of the variable is high (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.84). We applied binary logistic regression for the empirical multivariate analyses. The current procedure was chosen for reasons of simplicity and clarity. Obviously, the dependent variables could have been constructed in a number of other ways. To analyze to what extent our results were sensitive to procedure, we tested a number of other model specifications, using different cutoff points for the dependent variables and other regression techniques (multinomial logit regression for categorized variables and ordinary least squares regression for metric variables). Results (available on request) from these analyses are almost identical to those presented here, and we have therefore decided to use a dichotomized measure, which is easily interpretable.</p>

<title>The Independent Variables</title>
<p>The main independent variable here is <italic>family type in childhood</italic>. This variable is based on the answer to a question reading, “Did you live with both your biological parents during your entire childhood (up to 16 years of age)?” In the following analyses, only respondents answering this question in the affirmative and those who answer “no, because of parental separation or divorce” were included. Hence, the former grew up in an intact family whereas the latter were born into a family with both biological parents, but subsequently experienced a parental divorce (between formally married parents) or separation (between cohabiting parents) during their upbringing. Thus, we are not able to distinguish respondents with married parents from respondents with cohabiting parents. For reasons of simplicity, however, we may sometimes refer to “divorce” rather than “divorce or separation.” Those who did not grow up with both their biological parents for other reasons (mostly parental death or being born to a single parent) were omitted.</p>
<p>In a first model, we also control for four conditions that are arguably in place prior to parental divorce: <italic>Gender</italic> (man/woman), <italic>Respondent’s age</italic> (metric variable), and <italic>Country of origin</italic> (respondents born in Sweden vs. respondents born in another country). The latter variable is controlled for as both parental divorce risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0192513X12447177">Statistics Sweden, 2005</xref>) and psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192513X12447177">Fritzell, Gähler, &amp; Nermo, 2007</xref>) differ between individuals born in Sweden and individuals born in other countries. Moreover, immigration to Sweden has increased substantially during the past decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0192513X12447177">Statistics Sweden, 2011</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192513X12447177">Table 1</xref>). <italic>Parents’ education</italic> is defined as the higher of the two parents’ educational levels (if different) and contains four categories: (a) Primary school, (b) Vocational school, (c) Lower secondary school, and (d) Upper secondary school or higher.</p>

<p>In a second model, we control for a number of conditions whose temporal relationship to family type in childhood is not as clear cut. These variables can precede divorce, follow it, or do both. First, we control for <italic>Family dissension</italic> in the childhood family. This variable is based on the question, “Was there any serious dissension or friction in your family while you were growing up?” Answers were categorized into “yes,” “uncertain,” and “no.” The first two categories were merged (and contrasted with those answering “no”), because we believe that “uncertain” indicates that serious dissension may have occurred, even if the respondent was not willing to give the definite answer “yes.” We have, however, also tested excluding respondents answering “uncertain” from the analyses, but the results were only marginally affected. Unfortunately, we do not know whether the children were referring to family dissension before, during, and/or after parental divorce. Moreover, for the 1968 survey, we do not know between which family members dissension occurred. It is likely, however, that most respondents were referring to inter-parental dissension. In the 2000 survey, respondents were asked between whom dissension occurred, and almost 80% of respondents with divorced and separated parents claimed that it occurred between their biological parents.</p>
<p>The variable <italic>Economic hardship during upbringing</italic> corresponds to the answer (no/yes) to the question, “Did your family experience economic hardship while you were growing up?” It should be noted that for those who grew up in disrupted families, it is not known whether these economic problems occurred as a consequence of the divorce or separation or whether they were apparent already before this event, that is, whether or not there is a selection effect. Previous studies (referring to the situation during the 1980s and 1990s), however, indicate that the lower economic well-being among divorced and separated parents in Sweden could only to a very limited extent be accounted for by such an effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0192513X12447177">Gähler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192513X12447177">Jonsson &amp; Gähler, 1997</xref>). Moreover, we consider that this variable is not solely a reflection of material or objective living conditions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192513X12447177">Hayo &amp; Seifert, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192513X12447177">Conger, Conger, Matthews, and Elder (1999)</xref> demonstrate, however, that both economic resources and perceived economic stress during childhood are important in predicting children’s development.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that children in divorced families achieve less well in school than do children from intact families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192513X12447177">Frisco, Muller, &amp; Frank, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192513X12447177">Jonsson &amp; Gähler, 1997</xref>) and that they themselves divorce and separate more often (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192513X12447177">Dronkers &amp; Härkönen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X12447177">Gähler, Hong, &amp; Bernhardt, 2009</xref>). Education is positively related to psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0192513X12447177">Ross &amp; Mirowsky, 1999</xref>), and divorced and single persons in Sweden have a lower degree of psychological well-being than do those who are married or cohabiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192513X12447177">Gähler, 2006</xref>). Thus, parental divorce or separation may affect psychological well-being in adulthood by mediating attainment or civil status. Hence, we control for <italic>Respondent’s years of education</italic> (metric variable) and <italic>Respondent’s civil status</italic>, that is, single versus married or cohabiting. In deepened analyses, we have tested whether single respondents who have experienced a separation themselves differ in psychological well-being from those who do not have this experience, and whether cohabiting and married respondents differ in psychological well-being. Because we have found no such differences, we only distinguish between single and married/cohabiting respondents. It should be noted that a causal model is assumed, where family situation during childhood affects the individual’s present educational level and civil status, which, in turn, influence psychological well-being at the time of the interview. The causal relationship may be more complex, however. Family type in childhood may have affected psychological well-being earlier, which, in turn, affects the individual’s attainment and civil status. If this is the case, it means that when these conditions are controlled for, the effect of childhood family type is underestimated to some degree and the effect of these present conditions on the respondent’s current psychological health is overestimated. We do not regard this as a great problem, as we are not primarily interested in the association between family type during childhood and psychological problems per se, but rather in whether the strength of this association has changed over time.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics of the variables are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192513X12447177">Table 1</xref>. Based on these data, it is clear that the experience of parental divorce/separation has increased a great deal during the period. Of all respondents who have either experienced growing up with both biological parents or seen their parents divorce/separate, that is, not the entire population, the latter experience was four times more likely for 19- to 34-year-old respondents in 2000 (21%) than in 1968 (5.3%). Moreover, we note, just as previous Swedish studies have done (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0192513X12447177">Ministry of Education and Culture, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0192513X12447177">Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0192513X12447177">National Board of Health and Welfare, 2005</xref>), that the share of young individuals reporting psychological problems has increased substantially over time. In the 1968 sample, slightly more than one fourth reported psychological problems (as we define them). This share had increased to 45% in the 2000 sample. Our main task, however, is to analyze whether the association between family type in childhood and psychological problems in adulthood has changed over time. It seems as if this deterioration of psychological well-being is general, that is, independent of family type of origin, although the relative deterioration actually seems to have been larger for respondents from intact families.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0192513X12447177">Table 2</xref>, we present results from a multivariate analysis using binary logistic regression. Results are presented as odds ratios and the estimates refer to the <italic>risk</italic> of having reduced psychological well-being for each category (for categorical variables) compared with a reference category. The risk of the reference category is set at 1. We start by analyzing the risk of reporting <italic>any</italic> psychological problem during the past 12 months. For this purpose, we use the six-item variable, based on all six indicators on psychological problems. In the first column, we present results for the 1968 sample, that is, respondents born between 1934 and 1949, who, if at all, experienced their parents’ divorce during the period 1934-1965. These results yield that there is, indeed, an association between family type in childhood and the risk of suffering from psychological problems in adulthood. Respondents who grew up in a dissolved family exhibit a risk that—after controlling for gender, age, country of origin, and parents’ education—is almost two times higher with regard to suffering from such problems compared with their peers who grew up in an intact family (Model 1). This difference between family types of origin is statistically significant at the 1% level. The associations between the control variables and psychological problems are generally in the expected direction. Female respondents and respondents born abroad report a relatively high risk for psychological problems. Age, on the other hand, exhibits little association with psychological well-being. It should be noted, however, that this might be due to the relatively young age of the present sample. Among 19- to 34-year-olds, increasing age may not yet be an important determinant of reduced well-being. In the 1968 sample, highly educated respondents report a higher extent of psychological problems. The reason for this result is not clear, but, at the time, it may have been more legitimate and less stigmatizing for these respondents to admit psychological problems. In the 2000 sample, this difference by educational level does not persist.</p>

<p>When we add controls for family dissension, economic hardship during upbringing, respondent’s education, and civil status (Model 2), the excess risk for psychological problems among respondents from dissolved families diminishes substantially, to 19%, and ceases to be statistically significant. Additional and deepened analyses (not displayed) reveal that the decrease is almost entirely because of the control for family dissension, whereas controlling for economic hardship during upbringing, although this factor is strongly associated with psychological problems, has only a limited impact, and controls for respondent’s education and civil status have no impact on the association between family type in childhood and psychological well-being as an adult. These results suggest that one strongly contributing reason for young adults from dissolved families to express a higher extent of psychological problems than respondents from intact families is that the former have experienced family dissension to a much greater extent (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192513X12447177">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The main issue here, however, is whether the magnitude of the association between family type in childhood and psychological problems in adulthood has changed over time. In Model 3, the corresponding results to Model 1, but for the 2000 sample, are displayed. Again, parental divorce is associated with a higher extent of psychological problems. The increased risk is almost halved, from 94% in the 1968 sample to 48% in the 2000 sample, but still remains statistically significant. But what about the reduction in magnitude over time, is it significant? To answer this question, we pool data for both survey years and add survey year and the two-way interaction term Family type in childhood × Survey year to the model (Model 5). A significant interaction term would indicate that there has been a change in the association over time. Although we find an estimate below 1 (0.79), indicating a reduction in effect size between 1968 and 2000, it does not reach statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> = .370). Hence, we have no statistical ground to conclude that psychological problems are less strongly associated with parental divorce in 2000 than they were in 1968 (also see Model 6). Or, more correctly put, individuals whose parents divorced during the period 1966-1997 do not report a higher psychological well-being as 19- to 34-year-olds, compared with individuals from an intact family background, than do corresponding individuals whose parents divorced during the period 1934-1965. Moreover, the strongly significant estimate for survey year 2000 in the pooled data underscores what has been found in previous studies and was apparent already in the descriptive statistics in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192513X12447177">Table 1</xref>—that psychological problems have increased substantially among young Swedes during recent decades.</p>
<p>As in 1968, the excess risk for psychological problems among individuals from dissolved families is no longer significant when we control for a number of conditions in Model 4. Again, deepened analyses (not displayed) show that the strongest reduction in the association is caused by adding family dissension to the model.</p>
<p>Thus far, we have referred to reduced psychological well-being as a composite variable, based on the six different indicators. Would we reach any other conclusion if we instead focused on single items, or do they all tell the same story of no or only little change over time? Results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0192513X12447177">Table 3</xref> rather point to the latter. In Models 1 and 3, the “baseline” models for each survey year, parental divorce is associated with four indicators, three of which are overlapping between the survey years (nervous trouble, overexertion, and depression). For only one item, overexertion, do we detect a weakening association over time. Just as for the six-item variable, however, the magnitude of the associations declines substantially when we control for economic hardship during upbringing, years of education, civil status, and, above all, family dissension in Models 2 and 4. In fact, hardly any association remains statistically significant.</p>

<p>Difference in estimates between 1968 and 2000 for divorced parents is statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> ≤ .10). This conclusion is based on analyses of pooled data, including both survey years, adding the interaction term Family type in childhood × Survey year. Models 1 and 3 include controls for Family type in childhood, Respondent’s age, Respondent’s gender, Respondent’s country of origin, and Parents’ education. Models 2 and 4 add controls for Family dissension, Economic hardship during upbringing, Respondent’s years of education, and Respondent’s civil status.</p>

<p>Our main results, then, are (a) that parental divorce is still, at least for individuals whose parents divorced during the period 1966-1997, associated with offspring adult psychological problems, just as it was for those who experienced parental divorce 30 years earlier and (b) that although there is a tendency for the link between family type in childhood and psychological adjustment in adulthood to weaken over time, there is no statistical proof of a significant change. How should these results be understood? Why is parental divorce in childhood still linked to an extended risk for psychological problems in young adults?</p>
<p>In our analyses, we have identified economic hardship and family dissension during upbringing as important determinants of psychological impairment in adulthood. Moreover, we have shown that these conditions are much more frequent among respondents from dissolved families than among those from intact ones. How have these conditions, and their distributions between family types, changed over time? In the 1968 sample, that is, respondents born during the period 1934-1949, 14% claimed that they had experienced economic hardship while growing up (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192513X12447177">Table 1</xref>). This problem was more than twice as common for respondents from a split-up family background (31%). During later decades, the share of respondents claiming economic hardship during upbringing has declined somewhat, down to 11% in the 2000 sample, that is, respondents born during the period 1966-1981. Moreover, the situation has improved for both family types. However, given the development of the Swedish welfare state, and its strong focus on income redistribution, it may come as a surprise that the relative difference in economic hardship between family types has not declined over time. In 1968, the percentage of children from intact families with economic problems was 13% and in 2000 it was 8%. Hence, there was a relative decrease of 43% for intact families. For children from dissolved families, however, the corresponding decrease is only 22% (from 31% in the 1968 sample to 24% in the 2000 sample). It seems that intact families were better able to benefit from economic growth than were dissolved families, and that welfare state efforts to reduce economic inequality between family types were not sufficient. A possible explanation for these findings, however, is that (just as predicted by Goode) in 1968, the level of education of divorced parents was higher than that of their counterparts in intact families. In 2000, in contrast, there are no differences by family type. Hence, a contributing reason why dissolved families still fare worse economically in 2000 is that the category is less positively selected than it used to be, that is, these parents are no longer better educated than parents in intact families. The effect of economic hardship in childhood on adult psychological well-being is as strong for the 2000 sample as for the 1968 sample (see Models 2 and 4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0192513X12447177">Table 2</xref>). Hence, a contributing factor behind the lasting link between parental divorce in childhood and psychological impairment in adulthood may be the constant difference in exposure to economic hardship between family types over time and the unaltered effect of economic difficulties on psychological adjustment.</p>
<p>Serious dissension in the childhood family is also an important determinant of psychological problems later in life. For our sample, the share with this experience has increased, from 11% to 17%, during the period under study here (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192513X12447177">Table 1</xref>). This increase is due to two trends: First, it has become slightly more common for individuals from an intact family background to claim severe dissension in their childhood family, from 8% to 11% between the 1968 and 2000 samples. Second, and more importantly, an increasing proportion of all respondents have grown up in a dissolved family, and dissension is more common in this family type. Important to note, however, is that within this category, it has become less common to report severe dissension over time. In 1968, 60% of respondents growing up in a dissolved family claimed that they had experienced severe conflict in their childhood family. Three decades later, this proportion had decreased to 42%, a change that is statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = .005). Hence, on the one hand, a contributing reason why we still observe an association between parental divorce and psychological problems is that divorce is still strongly associated with severe dissension in the childhood family. On the other hand, a contributing reason for the (nonsignificant) decrease over time in the association between parental divorce and psychological problems is that the link between parental divorce and serious family dissension is weaker than it used to be and, moreover, that the impact of family dissension on psychological impairment seems to have declined over time (see Models 2 and 4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0192513X12447177">Table 2</xref>). In other words, respondents from dissolved families were less likely to report family dissension in 2000 than their peers in 1968, and, even if they did, dissension was no longer as strong as a determinant of psychological problems.</p>

<title>Concluding Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we compare the effect of parental divorce on psychological problems for two Swedish cohorts, using the LNU, collected in 1968 and 2000. We provide additional evidence of the long-term effects of parental divorce in that, in accordance with British and American studies, we demonstrate that also in Sweden there is an association between parental divorce and psychological problems, and that it persists into adulthood. Moreover, we note, just as previous Swedish studies have done (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0192513X12447177">Ministry of Education and Culture, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0192513X12447177">Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0192513X12447177">National Board of Health and Welfare, 2005</xref>), that there is a general increase in psychological problems among young adults in Sweden.</p>
<p>We find that the increase in psychological problems is valid independent of childhood family type. Still, parental divorce seems to be at least partly responsible for the general deterioration of psychological health among young adults, as there is a link between parental divorce and offspring psychological impairment and an ever-increasing share of young adults have experienced parental divorce during childhood. The picture is more complex, however, because—due to the cross-sectional nature of our data—we cannot determine whether parental divorce per se or other factors that appear in conjunction with divorce cause this link. However, when we control for family dissension and economic hardship during childhood in the model, the negative association between parental divorce and young adult’s psychological problems disappears. Hence, it seems that parental family disruption per se can only, at most, indirectly be blamed for the general increase in psychological problems among young adults in Sweden, as it causes, or is caused by, family dissension and economic difficulties, conditions that, in turn, are associated with psychological problems in the individual.</p>
<p>The main question asked here, however, is whether the magnitude of the link between parental divorce and offspring psychological impairment has changed over time. According to the literature, there are numerous reasons to expect that the strength of this link has weakened due to, for example, less stigmatization associated with divorce, less severe divorce motives, and less serious family dissension following increasing divorce rates, parents being more aware of children’s needs and better able to support their children, and less income inequality between family types.</p>
<p>Contrary to what we expected, however, our data do not show that the association between parental divorce in childhood and psychological problems in adulthood has diminished significantly over time. Whereas the odds ratio for reduced psychological well-being for respondents from dissolved families aged 19 to 34 years in 1968, whose parents divorced between 1934 and 1965, was 1.9 times higher than that for respondents from intact families, it was 1.5 times higher in 2000, for respondents whose parents divorced between 1966 and 1997. Although this result may imply a small decline over time, the change does not reach statistical significance. When studying each of the six indicators on psychological problems (general tiredness, insomnia, nervous trouble, overexertion, depression, and mental illness) separately, it is notable that the pattern of a stable association with family type over time is general. Thus, just as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0192513X12447177">Sigle-Rushton et al. (2005)</xref> show in their longitudinal study comparing British cohorts, we do not find any evidence that the association between parental divorce and psychological problems has decreased across Swedish generations.</p>
<p>Why does this association persist? We are not able to give a comprehensive answer to this question but important reasons seem to be that parental divorce is still associated with economic hardship and family dissension in the family of origin, two conditions that, in turn, are strongly associated with psychological impairment in young adults. First, although economic conditions have generally improved over time, independent of family type, respondents with divorced parents are still much more likely to have experienced economic hardship during their upbringing than have respondents from intact families (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192513X12447177">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, the relative and absolute differences in economic hardship between family types have not declined over time. Does this imply that the Swedish welfare state is not effective in reducing economic differences between family types? Not necessarily. First, as predicted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192513X12447177">Goode (1970)</xref>, the class distribution of divorce has changed. Whereas divorce was previously more common in higher social strata, this association has vanished and even reversed during later decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192513X12447177">Härkönen &amp; Dronkers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192513X12447177">Hoem, 1997</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192513X12447177">Table 1</xref>). Second, according to international comparisons, Swedish single parents are less exposed to poverty than their counterparts in most other societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192513X12447177">Bradbury &amp; Jäntti, 1999</xref>), and the difference in median income, between single-parent and two-parent families, is smaller in Sweden than in other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0192513X12447177">Wong, Garfinkel, &amp; McLanahan, 1993</xref>). Two factors contribute to this situation: a strong income redistribution in general and a high employment rate among single parents (because of economic incentives and a well-developed infrastructure, e.g., child care). Thus, the Swedish welfare state seems to be effective in reducing economic differences between family types, but it does not eliminate them entirely. During recent decades, however, the income gap between single-parent and two-parent families has widened again (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192513X12447177">Fritzell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192513X12447177">Gähler, 2001</xref>), and if this trend continues, we would expect to find increasing differences in psychological well-being between individuals from dissolved and intact families of origin in the future.</p>
<p>Second, parental divorce and family dissension are still closely linked. In 2000, respondents from dissolved families were four times more likely to claim serious dissension in their childhood family than were respondents from intact families (42.5% vs. 11%). However, in accordance with the declining effect hypothesis, we also find that the link has weakened over time. In 1968, respondents from dissolved families were seven times more likely than respondents from intact families to claim serious dissension in their childhood family (60% vs. 8%). Moreover, the impact of family dissension on child psychological well-being has weakened over time. What are the reasons for these changes? One may be that when obtaining a divorce was legally difficult, and associated with a strong social stigma, it was more common that divorce was the result of a highly dysfunctional marriage. Today, marriages are more likely to end for less dramatic reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192513X12447177">de Graaf &amp; Kalmijn, 2006</xref>) and even out of common agreement between the spouses, without any serious dissension. Moreover, greater general attention to these issues may imply that children can now more openly seek help and support from others when their parents fight. In addition, parents may also have become more aware of children’s needs and of the detrimental effect of family discord on children’s psychological adjustment. Thus, today’s parents may try to minimize children’s exposure to conflict or, at least, not expose them to conflict of the same severity as previously.</p>
<p>One advantage of our study is that our data contain identical measures over time of the variables in focus here, that is, family type in childhood, psychological well-being, and different control variables. Thus, the present study makes a contribution to the literature on parental divorce by showing that also in a non–Anglo American country, such as Sweden, there is an association between parental divorce in childhood and offspring psychological problems in adulthood, and furthermore that the magnitude of this association has not decreased over time, even though divorce and separation have become more common and society should be more adapted to them.</p>
