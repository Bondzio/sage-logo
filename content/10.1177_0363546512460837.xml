<title>Background:</title>
<p>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reinjury rates are high in adolescent patients. Knee braces are commonly used after ACL reconstruction to prevent reinjury during return to sports.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512460837">
<title>Hypothesis:</title>
<p>Adolescent patients following ACL injury would demonstrate a decreased vertical ground-reaction force, knee extension moment, knee flexion angle, and knee flexion velocity on the surgical limb when compared with the nonsurgical limb during a side-cutting task. A functional knee extension–resistant brace would decrease the limb asymmetries.</p>

<sec id="section3-0363546512460837">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Controlled laboratory study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512460837">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Twenty-three adolescent patients 6 months after ACL reconstruction were recruited for this study. Three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic data were collected bilaterally (surgical, nonsurgical) during a 35° side-cutting task while the patient was wearing and not wearing a functional knee extension–resistant brace (nonbraced, braced) on the surgical limb.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512460837">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The surgical limb demonstrated a significant decrease in peak impact vertical ground-reaction force (2.55 body weight [BW] vs 2.8 BW; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), peak propulsion vertical ground-reaction force (2.15 BW vs 2.3 BW; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), peak knee extension moment (0.13 BW × body height [BH] vs 0.17 BW × BH; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), knee flexion angle at peak knee flexion velocity (27.8° vs 30.0°; <italic>P</italic> = .01), peak knee flexion angle (44.1° vs 48.5°; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), and peak knee flexion velocity (571.3 deg/sec vs 640.1 deg/sec; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) when compared with the nonsurgical limb during both nonbraced and braced conditions. Bracing increased the initial knee flexion velocity (42.4 deg/sec vs −40.2 deg/sec; <italic>P</italic> = .01) and decreased the initial knee flexion angle on the surgical limb (13.1° vs 15.7°; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Bracing also affected kinematics of the nonsurgical limb. Bracing did not decrease the asymmetry between surgical and nonsurgical limbs.</p>

<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Adolescent patients 6 months after ACL reconstruction demonstrated significant kinematic and kinetic asymmetries between the surgical and nonsurgical limbs.

<p>An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is a common sports-related knee injury. Most ACL injuries occur in a noncontact maneuver that involves a sudden deceleration before a change of direction, such as jump landing and cutting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512460837">5</xref></sup> This injury typically leads to surgical reconstruction. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R) is a surgical intervention to restore knee stability and improve the patients’ chances of returning to sports activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512460837">3</xref></sup> An estimated 200,000 ACL reconstructions are performed annually in the United States with a cost of approximately $20,000 per reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512460837">7</xref></sup> After ACL-R, ACL graft and contralateral ACL reinjury rates are both more than 10% in adolescent and young athletes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512460837">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546512460837">32</xref></sup> Postoperative rehabilitation plays an important role in recovery and return to activity after surgery. The goal of postoperative physical therapy in this patient population is to recover physical function and return to a prior level of activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512460837">30</xref></sup> Knee braces are selectively used during the rehabilitation process to limit excessive range of motion and reduce ACL strain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512460837">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>One potential risk factor for ACL reinjury could be the noticeable limb asymmetries in neuromuscular control that are present after ACL-R. Previous investigators have found that the surgical limb generally has decreased ground-reaction force and knee extension moments when compared with the nonsurgical limb during bilateral squatting,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512460837">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512460837">31</xref></sup> hopping,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512460837">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512460837">26</xref></sup> jump landing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512460837">9</xref></sup> and cutting tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512460837">8</xref></sup> in patients from 6 months to more than 1 year after ACL-R. The surgical knee also tends to have a decreased knee flexion angle during the performance of single-limb athletics tasks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512460837">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512460837">26</xref></sup> Paterno et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512460837">28</xref></sup> recently found that adolescent and young athletes demonstrated limb asymmetries in the vertical ground-reaction force during a jump-landing task; however, the knee kinematics and kinetics were not reported. Although the ACL reinjury rate is high in adolescent patients, studies regarding neuromuscular control patterns during athletic tasks in this specific population are still limited.</p>
<p>One way that knee mechanics can be altered is through the use of bracing. Many physicians prescribe knee braces to patients after ACL-R.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512460837">10</xref></sup> Some researchers have shown that bracing reduced the knee anterior shear force,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512460837">11</xref></sup> pain,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512460837">6</xref></sup> and sense of instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546512460837">35</xref></sup> and assisted in restoring knee range of motion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512460837">23</xref></sup> whereas other researchers found that using a brace had no beneficial effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512460837">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512460837">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512460837">24</xref></sup> Previous investigators have shown that the use of a specially designed knee brace that constrains terminal knee extension increased the knee flexion angle at landing in healthy recreational athletes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512460837">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546512460837">38</xref></sup> and ACL-injured patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512460837">34</xref></sup> Based on the fact that after ACL-R patients tend to land with less knee flexion on the surgical side,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512460837">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512460837">26</xref></sup> it is expected that the use of this type of brace that constrains knee extension could reduce the landing asymmetries. However, the immediate effect of bracing on lower extremity biomechanics in adolescent patients has not been investigated.</p>
<p>Studying limb asymmetries and bracing effects in adolescent patients may provide insight into the high ACL reinjury rate in this population as well as aid in developing effective rehabilitation and injury prevention programs. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the limb asymmetries and bracing effects during a side-cutting task in adolescent patients 6 months after ACL-R. The 6-month time period was chosen because that time is often used as a rehabilitation milestone for return to sports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512460837">19</xref></sup> It was hypothesized that the surgical limb would have a decreased vertical ground-reaction force (VGRF), knee extension moment, knee flexion angle, and knee flexion velocity compared with the nonsurgical limb. It was also hypothesized that the functional brace would decrease the limb asymmetries.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>The estimated effect size for peak VGRF between surgical and nonsurgical limbs was 1.14 based on previous work by Paterno et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512460837">28</xref></sup> The estimated effect size for knee flexion angle at peak posterior ground-reaction force between braced and nonbraced condition was 0.67 based on previous work by Lin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512460837">20</xref></sup> Therefore, the current study used the smaller effect size of 0.67 for a priori power analysis. To achieve a power no less than 0.8 and a type I error no larger than 0.05 for a pairwise comparison, 20 patients were need.</p>
<p>Nine male and 14 female adolescent patients (age, 16.5 ± 1.3 years; height, 1.7 ± 0.1 m; weight, 72.2 ± 15.6 kg; body mass index, 25.0 ± 4.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; time between ACL injury and ACL-R, 1.4 ± 0.7 months; time between ACL-R and testing, 6.2 ± 0.6 months) participated in the study. <italic>Adolescent</italic> is defined by the World Health Organization as a person between 10 and 19 years of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512460837">2</xref></sup> Eleven patients injured the dominant leg based on the preferred leg to kick a soccer ball. Twelve patients injured the nondominant leg. All patients underwent autograft hamstring tendon reconstruction. A tibial tunnel–independent technique was used to locate the anatomic femoral tunnel placement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512460837">1</xref></sup> Fifteen of the 23 patients had meniscus repair or meniscectomy. All surgeries were performed by 2 sports medicine orthopaedic surgeons at the same clinic. These patients had no history of previous ACL-R or any other lower extremity surgery. All patients were high school or collegiate athletes who were expected to return to a sport that involved jumping and cutting tasks. All patients were treated with a standard rehabilitation program under the direction of their own physical therapist. The study was approved by the Duke University Medical Center’s institutional review board, and all patients signed informed consent before study enrollment.</p>

<sec id="section10-0363546512460837">
<title>Data Collection Procedure</title>
<p>To complete the testing protocol, all patients were asked to wear spandex and a standard running shoe (Air Pegasus; Nike Inc, Beaverton, Oregon). After donning the data collection attire, patients were allowed to run on a treadmill at a self-selected speed for approximately 5 minutes to warm up. After the warm-up, patients had a total of 46 retro-reflective markers attached on their skin to track segmental motion during a cutting activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512460837">Figure 1</xref>). For the standing calibration, they were asked to stand with their feet shoulder width apart and pointed straight ahead. Three-dimensional coordinate data were collected using an 8-camera motion capture system at a sampling rate of 120 Hz (Motion Analysis Corp, Santa Rosa, California). Ground-reaction forces were collected using 2 embedded force plates at a sampling rate of 2400 Hz (AMTI, Watertown, Massachusetts). After the standing trial, patients were asked to perform 5 trials of a 35° side-cutting task planting on both the surgical and nonsurgical limbs. They were asked to complete this task with and without the functional knee brace on the surgical limb. The knee brace was a custom-made functional brace (FourcePoint; DonJoy Orthopaedics LLC, Vista, California) that resisted knee extension from 40° to 10° of knee flexion through the application of gradually increasing resistance to a maximum of 3.5 N·m just before 10° of knee flexion. At 10° of knee flexion, there was a stop to prevent further knee extension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512460837">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546512460837">38</xref></sup> During the side-cutting task, patients were instructed to run forward as fast as they could safely and place their cutting foot on one force plate and cut toward a piece of tape that was placed on the ground 35° from the running direction. No other technique instructions were given to avoid changing natural cutting preferences. Patients were allowed to practice the task until they were comfortable with the movement. During the braced condition, they wore the functional knee brace on their surgical limb. The nonbraced condition was tested first, followed by the braced condition, so that patients could become familiar with the task with minimal perturbations. However, the order of cutting direction (cutting toward left or right) in each condition was randomized. A minimum of 5 minutes’ rest was given to patients between conditions to minimize the effects of fatigue. They were allowed to have additional rest between trials and conditions if it was needed by the patient.</p>

<title>Data Reduction and Analysis</title>
<p>The coordinate data were filtered using a low-pass Butterworth filter at 12 Hz. The ground-reaction force data were filtered using a low-pass Butterworth filter at 100 Hz. Time-series data for the kinematics and kinetics variables were calculated using Visual 3D software (C-Motion, Bethesda, Maryland). Joint angles were calculated as Cardan angles between adjacent local segments with an order of rotation of flexion-extension, abduction-adduction, and internal rotation–external rotation. Joint moments were calculated through an inverse dynamic approach and transferred into the local segment coordinate system and were expressed as internal moments. Ground-reaction forces were normalized to body weight. Joint moments were normalized to body weight and height. All data were analyzed from heel strike to toe-off of the cutting stance limb.</p>
<p>Because of the importance of sagittal plane biomechanics in determining ACL loading,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546512460837">36</xref></sup> sagittal plane variables at critical events were extracted for analysis. Knee flexion and knee flexion velocity were examined at initial contact. The knee flexion angle was also examined at the time of the peak knee flexion velocity. The peak VGRF during the weight acceptance and propulsion phases were also identified to examine total body acceleration patterns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512460837">27</xref></sup> Finally, knee extension moments at peak knee flexion velocity and peak knee extension moments were calculated. Peak knee flexion velocity was chosen as a critical event because the timing of peak knee flexion typically occurs around 20% of the stance phase during cutting, and this is when most ACL injuries occur.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512460837">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512460837">18</xref></sup> The average linear speed of the sacral marker 1 step before and 1 step after the cut was used to quantify the cutting speed. The extractions of the dependent variables from the time-series output were performed using subroutines developed in Matlab R2010a (MathWorks Inc, Natick, Massachusetts).</p>
<p>Dependent variables were compared between the braced and nonbraced condition and between the surgical and nonsurgical limbs. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA; brace × limb) was used to determine if statistically significant differences existed. Tukey post hoc testing was conducted to evaluate simple main effect if a significant interaction was found. Considering the differences in cutting speed were very small among conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512460837">Table 1</xref>), we did not include cutting speed as a covariate in the repeated-measure ANOVAs. Type I error was set at 0.05 for significance. Statistical analyses were completed in SPSS 12.0.1 (SPSS Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, Illinois).</p>

<p>A significant interaction was observed for knee extension moment at peak knee flexion velocity (<italic>P</italic> = .02). Post hoc testing indicated that the surgical limb had less knee extension moment at peak knee flexion velocity when compared with the nonsurgical limb only during the braced condition. A significant interaction was observed for the knee flexion velocity at heel strike (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Post hoc testing indicated that bracing increased the initial knee flexion velocity on the surgical limb. During the nonbraced condition, the initial knee flexion velocity was negative for the surgical knee, suggesting the surgical knee was actually extending at ground contact. This extension motion was changed into a flexion motion during the braced condition. In addition, the surgical limb had less initial knee flexion velocity than the nonsurgical limb only during the nonbraced condition.</p>
<p>Main effects for limb showed that the surgical limb had less peak impact VGRF (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), less peak propulsion VGRF (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), and less peak knee extension moment (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) when compared with the nonsurgical limb during both the nonbraced and braced conditions. Main effects for limb also indicated that the surgical limb had less peak knee flexion velocity (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), less knee flexion angle at peak knee flexion velocity (<italic>P</italic> = .01), and less peak knee flexion angle when compared with the nonsurgical limb (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>No main effect for brace was observed for any kinetic variable (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of the study was to evaluate limb asymmetries and bracing effects during a side-cutting task in adolescent patients 6 months after ACL-R. Based on previous literature, it was hypothesized that the surgical limb would have a decreased vertical ground-reaction force, knee extension moment, knee flexion angle, and knee flexion velocity when compared with the nonsurgical limb. It was also hypothesized that the functional brace would decrease these limb asymmetries.</p>
<p>The results of this study supported the hypothesis of limb asymmetry in knee kinematics and kinetics. These results are consistent with the findings by previous investigators who observed limb asymmetries in adult patients after ACL-R.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512460837">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512460837">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512460837">28</xref></sup> During a single-legged hopping test, the surgical limb exhibited a decreased knee extension moment and knee flexion angle compared with the nonsurgical knee in adult patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512460837">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512460837">26</xref></sup> A decreased knee extension moment on the surgical limb was also observed when compared with the nonsurgical limb during jogging and cutting tasks in adult patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512460837">8</xref></sup> Adolescent and young athletes demonstrated approximately 18% less peak vertical ground-reaction forces on the surgical limb than the nonsurgical limb during a drop vertical jump task after patients had returned to their prior sports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512460837">28</xref></sup> In the current study, the patients followed a standard rehabilitation program with a licensed physical therapist and were tested 6 months after the surgery. Six months is often used as a rehabilitation milestone for return to sports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512460837">19</xref></sup> However, a 24% asymmetry was still observed in the peak knee extension moment in these patients 6 months following ACL-R.</p>
<p>Besides asymmetries in kinetic variables, the surgical limb also demonstrated a more erect landing pattern with a decreased knee flexion angle and velocity. The decreased knee flexion of the surgical limb is consistent with the decreased knee extension moment. Decreasing the knee flexion angle generally decreases the moment arm from the body center of mass to the knee joint and therefore decreases the external loading on the knee joint. Previous researchers used knee flexion range of motion as a measure for knee stiffness and found that peak ground-reaction force (GRF) decreased when knee flexion range of motion increased during landing tasks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512460837">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546512460837">39</xref></sup> The findings of the current study appear to be inconsistent with previous literature with regard to the decreased knee flexion range of motion and peak GRF on the surgical side when compared with the nonsurgical side. However, it should be noted that the surgical knee also had a decreased knee extension moment. If the knee stiffness was calculated using the mechanical definition as stiffness = change in applied moment / change in rotation angle, the surgical knee was actually less stiff when compared with the nonsurgical knee. This more erect pattern with a decreased knee extension moment and flexion angle on the surgical limb could be caused by strength deficits, altered neuromuscular control, or cautious movement patterns due to fear of reinjury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512460837">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512460837">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of using a knee extension–resistant brace on knee biomechanics. The brace effect hypothesis was not supported because bracing the surgical knee did not decrease the limb asymmetries. Bracing was associated with changes at initial ground contact with more extension and increased flexion velocity. Previous researchers have shown that wearing a knee brace that resists terminal extension increased the initial knee flexion angle during a stop-jump task in healthy subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546512460837">38</xref></sup> and during walking, jogging, and stair-climbing tasks in ACL-injured subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512460837">34</xref></sup> In the current study, the bracing increased the initial knee flexion velocity from extending to flexing on the surgical limb. However, the decrease in the initial knee flexion angle in the brace condition was not expected because of the inherent knee extension–resistant function of the brace. The decrease in knee flexion angle at initial contact could have resulted from a change in the fear of landing on the injured limb with the additional support of the functional knee brace. While wearing the knee brace, these patients may have been more confident in cutting on the surgical side. The discrepancies between the current study and previous studies could have resulted from examining different tasks and studying different populations. In addition, the fixed testing order of nonbrace and braced conditions may have influenced the bracing effects. In summary, limb asymmetries persisted when patients were wearing a functional knee brace.</p>
<p>Anterior cruciate ligament reinjury rates are high in adolescent patients for both contralateral ACL injury and graft reinjury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512460837">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546512460837">32</xref></sup> The findings of the current study provided some insight into limb asymmetries as a potential risk factor for ACL reinjury. The functional asymmetries between the surgical and nonsurgical limbs suggest that the patients would prefer using their nonsurgical limb at the point when they return to sports, which could put the contralateral ACL at a higher risk for injury. Paterno et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512460837">29</xref></sup> reported that asymmetry in the knee extension moment at initial contact during a drop-jump task was higher in the reinjury group than in the group that was not reinjured. Because the current study did not contain preinjury data, it was unknown if the limb asymmetries existed before the injury or were caused by the injury. However, these limb asymmetries should raise concerns when the patients return to sports, especially in an adolescent population with such a high reinjury rate. Second, previous investigators have suggested that the decrease in the knee extension moments seen on the surgical limb could reduce the anterior shear force and may be a protective strategy to avoid overloading the knee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512460837">26</xref></sup> However, similar to other studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512460837">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512460837">26</xref></sup> it should be noted that the surgical knee had not only less knee extension moment but also decreased knee flexion. Previous researchers have reported that ACL loading resulting from a constant anterior shear force increases as the knee flexion angle decreases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512460837">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512460837">22</xref></sup> Taylor et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546512460837">36</xref></sup> found the ACL strain peaked before ground impact when the knee flexion angles were the lowest, even though the quadriceps forces might not be as high as during landing. Therefore, the decreased knee flexion angle and knee flexion velocity on the surgical side might be a risk factor for ACL graft reinjury.</p>
<p>The major limitation of the current study was that the nonsurgical limb served as a control to the surgical limb without including a control group. The lack of a control group raised concern that the observed limb asymmetries might be caused by factors other than the ACL injury. The nonsurgical limb might also be abnormal compared with a healthy population. In the study by Paterno et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512460837">28</xref></sup> the asymmetry in peak VGRF between dominant and nondominant limbs was about 4% in the control group. van der Harst et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546512460837">37</xref></sup> reported that the side-to-side differences were 1.1° for maximum knee flexion and 0.1° for knee flexion range of motion during a hopping test in an adult population. The limb asymmetries were 3% in the peak VGRF and 4% in the peak knee extension moment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546512460837">37</xref></sup> In the current study, the side-to-side differences in peak knee flexion angle and knee flexion range of motion were approximately 5°. The limb asymmetries were 9% in peak impact VGRF, 7% in peak propulsion VGRF, and 24% in peak knee extension moment. In addition, the ACL-injured side was not associated with being the dominant limb. Previous literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512460837">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546512460837">37</xref></sup> and the findings of the current study suggest that the observed asymmetries were higher than those in a healthy population and were not simply caused by limb dominance. The results of the current study were also compared with the results reported by Sigward and Powers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512460837">33</xref></sup> who studied the effects of experience on knee mechanics during a side-cutting task in healthy adolescent soccer players. The ensemble curves of knee flexion angle and knee extension moments of the nonsurgical side in the current study were similar to the ensemble curves reported by Sigward and Powers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512460837">33</xref></sup> The findings suggested that the nonsurgical knee might be a reasonable control in this population.</p>
<p>There were several other limitations in the current study. A majority of the patients had meniscal injuries that required intervention. However, there is a lack of information examining the effect of meniscal injury on knee kinematics and kinetics. The lack of preinjury motion analysis data makes it difficult to know if the cutting mechanics were altered on the nonsurgical limb after the initial injury and the subsequent ACL-R surgery. There is no information about the potential limb asymmetries that could have existed before the initial injury or if these asymmetries were the result of the injury and ACL-R surgery. However, the limb asymmetries should raise concerns no matter when the asymmetries occurred and should be taken into account when determining when the patient is ready to return to sports after ACL-R. Since it was advisable for the patients to conduct the cutting tasks initially in a familiar way, the order of testing for the brace conditions was not randomized and may have influenced the braced condition results in these patients. In addition, patients were only tested at 6 months after surgery. Future studies with additional follow-up are needed to better understand the changes in lower extremity biomechanics during the rehabilitation process as well as following discharge from physical therapy when patients are cleared to return to sports.</p>
<p>In conclusion, bilateral knee kinematic and kinetic asymmetries were observed during a side-cutting task in adolescent patients 6 months after ACL-R. The patients demonstrated decreased VGRF, knee extension moment, knee flexion angle, and knee flexion velocity compared with the nonsurgical limb. These limb asymmetries persisted when the patients were wearing a custom-made functional knee extension–resistant brace. Bracing decreased the initial knee flexion angle and increased the initial knee flexion velocity on the surgical limb. The limb asymmetries that persisted are of concern with regard to a second ACL injury when the patients are allowed to return to sports. This study indicates the importance of examining the current rehabilitation and return-to-sport criteria for adolescent patients following ACL-R to identify ways to normalize the mechanical asymmetries during sports activities.</p>
