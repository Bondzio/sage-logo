<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Half of all the patients who survive a stroke have impairments that lead to loss of upper limb function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512464502">1</xref></sup> Pain, spasticity and contractures are common impairments that develop rapidly after stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512464502">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512464502"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512464502"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512464502"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512464502">6</xref></sup> and are considered to be major contributors to secondary complications which cause limited mobility, delays in recovery of the paretic limb and problems in rehabilitation. The current methods of treatments or therapies for pain, spasticity and contractures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512464502">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512464502"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512464502"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512464502">10</xref></sup> are unsatisfactory. Despite a threefold increase in treatment interventions for these conditions over 10 years, ‘best practice’ for the rehabilitation of the paretic upper limb is still unclear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512464502">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In stroke, therapeutic surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation has been used to facilitate return of function and prevent complications in the upper limb.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512464502">12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512464502"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512464502"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512464502"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512464502">16</xref></sup> Surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation has been recommended as a safe method to improve upper limb outcomes after stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512464502">12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512464502"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512464502">14</xref></sup> However, robust evidence for efficacy of electrical stimulation is lacking, especially in relation to the treatment of spasticity, development of contractures or prevention of pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512464502">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512464502">18</xref></sup> We have recently shown that early application of functional electrical stimulation to wrist and finger extensors in patients with severe stroke and no functional movement in the upper limb improves muscle strength for wrist extension and grip, but has a small effect on arm function (effect size 0.35 (95% CI −0.20 to 0.91)).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512464502">19</xref></sup> The aim of this study is to investigate whether treatment, given for six weeks, prevents the development of upper limb pain, wrist flexor spasticity and contractures in severely disabled acute stroke patients.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>This was a secondary analysis of data from a recently published single-blind, randomized, controlled trial aimed at investigating the effects of surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation of the wrist combined with routine therapy on recovery of arm function in patients with stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512464502">19</xref></sup> The study was approved by the North Staffordshire Local Research Ethics Committee (Ref no.04/Q2604/1). Ninety stroke patients participated in this trial. Stroke patients admitted to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire within six weeks of a first stroke were eligible to participate if they had no useful hand function, defined as a score of 0 in the grasp subsection of the Action Research Arm Test,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512464502">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215512464502">21</xref></sup> and if they had no contraindication to surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215512464502">22</xref></sup> Patients were excluded if they were medically unstable, had a previous medical history of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or soft tissue injuries that resulted in contractures or had reduced range of movement in the wrist and fingers, or were unwilling to take part in the study.</p>
<p>Patients were randomized into two arms, a control arm and a treatment arm, using a method of concealed random allocation. A pseudo-random computed sequence in blocks was generated and the codes were stored by an independent person not involved in recruitment or measurement. Patients in the treatment arm received 30-minute sessions of surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation to the wrist and finger extensors at least twice a day (a maximum of three times a day) for five days a week. Surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation was delivered by surface electrodes (inactive electrode placed just below the common extensor origin and active electrode placed such that the stimulation produced balanced extension of the wrist, that is, extension without ulnar and radial deviation) positioned on the dorsal surface of the forearm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512464502">16</xref></sup> The stimulation parameters were set to produce slow movement through the full range at maximum participant comfort (pulse width = 300 μs; ON time = 15 s; OFF time = 15 s). The ON time included a ramp up time of 6 s and a ramp down time of 6 s and the frequency of stimulation was set to 40 Hz. The intensity of stimulation was adjusted to obtain maximum range of wrist and finger extension without inducing pain or fatigue. After completing the initial treatment session, the patient or their carer (relative) was trained to apply the surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation system and deliver the treatment independently. Patients in the control group were not given electrical stimulation. Their care was otherwise the same as that of patients in the intervention group. Patients in both the control and treatment arms were given a defined module of routine physiotherapy, with interventions which reflected local clinical practice,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512464502">19</xref></sup> for a period of six weeks in addition to the usual clinical treatment on the stroke unit. The protocol classified therapies based on therapy input as passive, active assisted, active/strengthening and functional.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512464502">19</xref></sup> Treatment compliance in both arms was monitored using a patient record. Both groups also had usual care.</p>
<sec id="section10-0269215512464502">
<title>Clinical measures</title>
<p>Details of the medical history were established by interview and consultation of medical notes. Demographic details including age, gender, and affected side of the body and stroke subtype were taken at recruitment. Patients were examined neurologically and classified as total anterior circulation syndrome, partial anterior circulation syndrome, lacunar syndrome and posterior circulation syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215512464502">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Outcomes were assessed by an independent assessor blinded to the study protocol (separate from the physiotherapist who administered the surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation and study-related physiotherapy). Following a baseline assessment, which was conducted within three days of recruitment, repeated measurements were taken at 6, 12, 24 and 36 weeks after recruitment. Measurements were taken at the patient’s bedside on the acute stroke ward, the stroke rehabilitation unit or at various discharge destinations including nursing home, sheltered housing or residential home.</p>
<p>Pain was measured using a numerical five-point verbal rating scale (ranging from 0 (no pain) to 5 (pain that could not be any worse)).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512464502">24</xref></sup> Spasticity was quantified neurophysiologically by measuring muscle activity during passive extension of the wrist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512464502">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512464502">24</xref></sup> Wrist contractures were characterized biomechanically by measuring the passive range of movement and stiffness at slow stretch at the wrist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512464502">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512464502">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215512464502">25</xref></sup> These measurements were taken using a custom-built device.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215512464502">26</xref></sup> The full measurement procedure has been described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512464502">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Motor performance in the impaired arm was, for classification purposes, assessed using the Action Research Arm Test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512464502">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215512464502">21</xref></sup> Patients who recovered arm function (defined as an improvement of six points in the Action Research Arm Test score) at any time during the study were allocated to the functional group, and those who did not to the non-functional group. An improvement of six points is likely to have resulted in a person progressing from not being able to do a task to being able to complete the task, but with difficulty.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269215512464502">
<title>Statistical methods</title>
<p>To compare significant baseline differences in demographics between the control and treatment arms, Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests were performed on age and time post-stroke while chi-square tests were performed on gender, side of body affected, type of stroke and mortality (over the entire study period).</p>
<p>Data are reported on all those who survived (with intention to treat). The numbers gradually decreased during follow-up, with 67 surviving at the end of the study. Missing values were imputed in two ways: a) the mean of two adjacent values was used when an intermediate assessment was missed and b) the last value was carried forward when someone dropped out of the study.</p>
<p>Data are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215512464502">Table 2</xref> (for the whole group), <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269215512464502">Table 3</xref> (for the subgroup of patients who did not recover functional movement of the upper limb: the non-functional group), <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269215512464502">Table 4</xref> (for the subgroup of patients who did recover functional movement of the upper limb: the functional group) and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0269215512464502">Table 5</xref> (rate of change of outcome measures).</p>
<p>The change over time was analysed using the summary measures approach recommended by Matthews et al. (1990).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215512464502">27</xref></sup> By using this method, changes over time between the control arm and treatment arm could be compared directly with a single comparison as opposed to individually studying the within-group changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512464502">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>The mean and the standard error were used to summarize the results at each time point. Statistical significance of the differences between the control and treatment arms and the functional and non-functional groups was assessed using the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. Mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported where appropriate. All the statistical procedures were carried out using SPSS version 15 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). No correction was applied for multiple testing, as the 95% CI are reported and this descriptive statistic informed the discussion more than the <italic>P</italic>-values per se.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The treatment and control arms were well matched at baseline in terms of age, gender, neurological impairment and other clinical characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215512464502">Table 1</xref>). The consort flowchart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215512464502">Figure 1</xref>) gives details on progression of participant numbers. Out of 90 patients (one patient recovered full function within three days of being screened and recruited and was thus not included in the final analysis), 19 patients recovered some upper limb function within six to 36 weeks after stroke whereas 70 others demonstrated no functional recovery. The treatment group showed a mean compliance of 28% (range 0–100%).</p>

<p>Patients did not demonstrate pain at baseline.

The functional group showed negligible change in pain over time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269215512464502">Table 4</xref>).

<p>Passive range of movement was not significantly different between the control and treatment arms at any time point of measurement over the entire study period (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.2; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215512464502">Table 2</xref>).

Over the treatment period the rate of recovery in passive range of movement was significantly better in the treatment arm in both the non-functional and functional groups. In the non-functional group the mean rate of deterioration in the treatment arm was lower than in the control arm. In the functional group the mean rate of recovery indicated an improvement in the treatment arm as opposed to the deterioration in the control arm. Over the entire study period the gains made by the treatment arm of the non-functional group were maintained and those made by the functional group were lost (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0269215512464502">Table 5</xref>). There was a significant difference favouring treatment for the non-functional group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0269215512464502">Table 5</xref>).

<p>Stiffness in the wrist flexors was not significantly different between control and treatment at any time point during the entire study period, in the whole group (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.2; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215512464502">Table 2</xref>) or in the non-functional and functional groups individually (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.2; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269215512464502">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269215512464502">4</xref>, respectively).

The rate of change in stiffness over time decreased in both the treatment and control arms for the functional group over the entire study period.</p>
<p>Spasticity, as indicated by abnormal muscle activity on electromyography during slow stretch, was seen in the majority of patients (85 out of 90) at baseline (44/45 in the control and 41/45 in the treatment arm), and this abnormal muscle activity persisted until the end of the study (in 64 out of 67 patients, with 34/36 in the control and 30/31 in the treatment arm).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We found that patients with severe stroke who do not recover functional movement in the upper limb are more likely to have pain than patients who recover arm function. Surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation to the wrist and finger extensors, started within six weeks of stroke onset and continued for six weeks, prevented pain in patients who did not regain functional movement in the upper limb. This effect was maintained to the end of the study, 30 weeks after discontinuation of the intervention. There was some evidence that contracture formation was transiently reduced during the treatment period in patients who had not regained functional movement in the upper limb. Treatment had no effect on spasticity.</p>
<p>Upper limb pain is a severe and disabling problem after stroke. While appropriate handling of the upper limb has reduced its incidence, it remains a common problem. There is some evidence that shoulder pain caused by spasticity may respond to Botulinum toxin injections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215512464502">26</xref></sup> Conventional analgesics are largely ineffective, and electrical stimulation of shoulder muscles has previously been shown to be ineffective in relieving pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215512464502">28</xref></sup> When the protocol was designed we assumed that spasticity and contractures were factors in the aetiology of pain, and that effective treatment of spasticity and prevention of contractures would therefore reduce post-stroke upper limb pain. Our research shows that surface neuromuscular stimulation prevented the development of pain without significant effects on spasticity and contractures. It can be hypothesized that sensory motor stimulation combined with mobilization of the upper limb may have prevented the development of pain. This is consistent with the neuromodulation literature, which demonstrates that treatment with surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation has the potential to increase excitability of the central nervous system via antidromic signal transmission in sensory nerves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215512464502">29</xref></sup> This may have reduced pain via gating mechanisms,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215512464502">30</xref></sup> release of endorphins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215512464502">31</xref></sup> and/or prevention of maladaptive plastic changes in the brain. As our measures of pain were subjective records of the presence and severity of pain in the upper limb, we are unable to confirm the exact location of the pain. Therefore we are unable to determine the mechanisms responsible for the observed treatment effect, particularly with respect to whether therapeutic effects were specifically associated with the segment stimulated or whether the effects were extrasegmental. It is important to note that we started treatment relatively early after the stroke, before clinical evidence of pain was documented. Further research should address whether this protocol for providing surface neuromuscular stimulation and mobilization is effective in treating established post-stroke upper limb pain.</p>
<p>Surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation showed no effects on spasticity. There was evidence of spasticity (as seen by stretch-induced muscle activity) at every time point from the baseline to the end of the study. Stimulation of an antagonistic muscle group (wrist extensors in this case) with surface electrical stimulation has previously been shown to reduce spasticity temporarily via spinal inhibition during the period of stimulation. However, such effects cease as soon as the stimulation is terminated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512464502">18</xref></sup> In this study we measured spasticity at least 24 hours after treatment was discontinued and it is possible that any transient treatment effect, if it existed, was missed. However, our findings do confirm that there are no long-term effects of treatment on spasticity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512464502">18</xref></sup> This may or may not be relevant to the development of contractures, as debate continues as to whether spasticity reduction is useful.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512464502">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patients who did not recover arm function were at more risk for the development of contractures. This is consistent with previous findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512464502">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512464502">24</xref></sup> The repeated mobilization associated with treatment may have been the most likely cause for the short-term prevention of contractures. This effect was lost as soon as treatment was discontinued. This might suggest that, if surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation is to have a role in the treatment of stroke patients with no functional recovery, the treatment may need to be provided until functional recovery occurs if the aim was prevention of contractures. There is also the possibility that the treatment was ineffective in the prevention of contractures because the intensity or duration was insufficient. With regard to intensity, we did not attempt to increase the intensity to stretch to end range of movement, but we set the intensity at a level to provide pain-free range of movement. This might not have been adequate to prevent tendon and/or muscle shortening. Different protocols may be required to obtain a better outcome in relation to spasticity and contractures. More work is needed, for example a stretch to the end of the range of movement followed by a period of hold at end range of movement stimulus (as opposed to a simple cycling through the pain-free range of movement). More fundamental work is needed to identify a protocol that will be effective for contracture prevention and/or management.</p>
<p>The present study was carried out on 90 acute stroke patients who were homogeneous in terms of functional performance (i.e. all had no useful functional movement in their upper extremity during recruitment). Patients in both the control and treatment arms were well matched at baseline in terms of age, sex, side affected and stroke type. Twenty-five per cent of patients died before the end of the trial. As all patients included in the study had severe disabling strokes, and were included early after the stroke, when mortality is highest, rather than in the chronic stable phase, this mortality rate is within the expected range. As there was no significant difference in mortality between the two treatment groups, this is unlikely to have introduced a systematic bias. The compliance with treatment was variable and the mean compliance was low. This was expected, as many patients were unable to self-administer treatment. We have not carried out any per protocol analysis to confirm whether response to treatment was influenced by compliance to treatment, as the sample size was small.</p>
<p>This secondary analysis is underpowered. Although based on current practice, the protocol showed limited benefit in terms of spasticity and contractures. There is a need to revisit our protocol and fundamental hypothesis related to the treatment of contractures.</p>
