<p>On my commuter train, the man across the aisle talks into his mobile: “What r u up to? … I think I lost a bit of weight … it <italic>can’t be</italic> that blonde … at least she’s his age … we should pick a day end of the month, talk to u about that as well as kids.” I cite this half-conversation (transcribed on my mobile), because it illustrates the importance of this edited collection. In its mundane, vaguely invasive intimacy and intriguing fragmentedness, this snippet of mobile communication presents the key question Rich Ling, Scott W. Campbell and their fellow authors address: Is mobile communication bringing us together or tearing us apart? Ranging across Australia, Asia, North America, and Europe the book explores key phenomena and facets of a pervasive “replacement of copresent interaction” with mediated mobile communication and its “effects on social cohesion” (p. 1).</p>
<p>Social cohesion is traced across various levels—from interpersonal couple relationships (Amparo Lasén, and Joachim Höflich, and Christine Linke, Chapters Five and Six) to the social cohesion of civil society (Rowan Wilken, and Gerard Goggin, and Kate Crawford, Chapters Seven and Twelve). However there is less analytical attention to distributed forms of sociality that divide or unite societies or communities, such as Durkheim’s mechanical or organic solidarity, or the ethnomethodological accountabilities of Goffman’s interaction order—than feelings of togetherness and community. In Chapter Two, for example, Kathleen Cumiskey examines how people who merge into symbiotic togetherness with remote others through mobile media tear apart the social cohesion of copresent situations in public spaces. While they are busy reinforcing their association with distant others (thus strengthening these relationships and groups), they show a psychological absence and lack of regard toward people nearby, undermining a sense of cohesion between co-present strangers. Nevertheless, based on in-depth interviews with twenty New Yorkers on the sociality of their mobile phone use, Cumiskey concludes that the degree of closeness experienced with remote others may “ultimately encourage a sense of one-world” and social responsibility.</p>
<p>Although I have reservations about the assumption of “replacement” and “effects” and the analytical equation of social cohesion with harmonious interpersonal social relations implicit in much of the work presented in this volume, I appreciate the analytical impetus and breadth of the studies brought together by editors Ling and Campbell. Thirteen substantive empirical, mainly interview-based studies delve into a wide range of mobile communications phenomena, framed by an introduction and conclusion by the editors. It is difficult to generate unity from such diversity, but in their introduction Ling and Campbell identify some core themes around gendered experiences (Chapters Three–Six), media choice (Chapters Seven–Nine), interest-based sociation (Chapters Ten and Eleven), and youth (Chapters Twelve–Fourteen) in relation to different forms of “community.” Larissa Hjorth (Chapter Three), for example, samples how Melbourne women perform emotional labor and form micro “imaging communities” and “gift economies” with different mobile media, asking whether specific “feeling rules” apply in different media, transcending cultural or class differences. Cara Wallis develops the potent concept of “immobile mobility” in an insightful and engaging study of Chinese migrant women worker communities, who are highly creative in their use of mobile phones but ultimately unable to leverage their connectivity for genuine social mobility (Chapter Four). Turning to the role of mobile media in the more private power dynamics of heterosexual couples, Lasén shows how mobiles are “not that personal,” indeed, and are better conceptualized as extensions of socio-material personhood that can be used to control as well as to communicate, amplifying rather than challenging unequal gendered power relations (Chapter Five).</p>
<p>The next set of chapters then explores specificities of different mobile media and the impact of people’s media choices on social cohesion. Observing that mobile phones foster “bonding” rather than “bridging” forms of social capital, Wilken argues that there is a danger of a “balkanization” of the social sphere, given the ever more widespread ability and lure of “telecocooning” with one’s emotionally close but geographically distant associates (Chapter Seven). This does not depend solely on mobile phones, but a whole ecology of mobile media, including the internet, email, and video-telephony, where different levels of technical literacy and access to media reinforce disjunctures, for example along generational faultlines (Thomas de Baillencourt et al., Chapter Eight).</p>
<p>Exploring the impact of mobile communications on local interest groups, Pat Byrne examines the experiences of members of two Irish sports clubs with person-to-person and group SMS messages (Chapter Ten). The study reveals a paradoxical confluence of effects. On the one hand, SMS messages eliminate the need for interactions that are productive of social capital—for example the small talk that comes with a face-to-face visit or a telephone call. On the other hand, club members engage with each other more—augmenting regular off-line meetings with short SMS messages (e.g., about post-match emotions). Peter B. White and Naomi Rosh White (Chapter Eleven) contrast this with a fascinating study of how ephemeral, geographically dispersed, and mobile communities of tourists in the Australian outback use CB radio. They document an emergent “nomadic intimacy” and sociability that transcends the mobile privatization of automobile travellers.</p>
<p>The final set of three chapters on mobile communications among young people begins with an incisive critique of the starting question. Goggin and Crawford (Chapter Twelve) argue that to ask whether mobile communications bring us together or tear us apart can limit analysis, because it imposes a binary logic over a landscape of often complex and contradictory transformations. The ways in which young people use mobile communications, for example, to combine practices of “networked individualism” with intensely affective bonds across distance should inspire an investigation into transformations of what “community” might mean and how it is achieved. The next two chapters then provide insight into two specific aspects of young people’s use of mobile communications: staying in touch with friends while studying abroad (Satomi Sugiyama, Chapter Thirteen), and the sociabilities enacted through emotionally charged drunken calling (Erin Hollenbaugh and Amber Ferris, Chapter Fourteen).</p>
<p>In their conclusion, Ling and Campbell reiterate Hjorth’s assessment that “it’s complicated.” They highlight how virtually all studies in this volume show that mobile communications both bring us together <italic>and</italic> tear us apart, cutting across various levels of social order. I agree. In this respect, <italic>Mobile Communication</italic> is an important and inspiring book. However, this is a starting point, not an end point for analysis. It would be great to see future studies go beyond the conclusion that “it’s complicated” by producing detailed studies of <italic>how</italic> social cohesion is enacted and conceptualized differently in technologically extended sociation.</p>
