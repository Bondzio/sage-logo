<abstract>
<p>In the United States, bipolar disorder is an increasingly common diagnosis in children, and these children can present with severe behavior problems and emotionality. Many studies have documented the frequent coexistence of behavior disorders and speech-language disorders. Like other children with behavior disorders, children with bipolar disorder are probably at greater risk for concomitant speech-language difficulties that can further complicate their behavioral presentation. This article reviews the features of the disorder based on current research perspectives as well as the most common coexisting conditions and evidence-based medical and psychological interventions. The goal is to increase awareness of pediatric bipolar disorder as a potential consideration in the behavioral presentation of children who have a coexisting speech-language disorder. Speech-language intervention should be one component of the comprehensive intervention program. A case study highlights the need for collaboration among caregivers and other team members as intervention plans are developed, implemented, and evaluated.</p>

<p>Bipolar disorder is characterized by episodic shifts from mania to depression and is now widely recognized as a disorder that can develop in childhood. Some controversy remains about diagnostic criteria for children because the current guidelines are based on adult norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525740110387661">Kowatch et al., 2005</xref>). As with any pediatric issue or mental illness, social, academic, behavioral, and vocational difficulties can be exacerbated when the symptoms are untreated or inadequately treated. And, the major mood swings and associated behavioral issues can have a profound effect on any individual’s life, including a child who may not have developed the ability to communicate his or her thoughts and feelings.</p>
<p>The research on the relationship between communication disorders and behavior problems in children spans several decades. A recent study showed that 40% of a large cohort of 5-year-olds with language impairment had associated serious behavior problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1525740110387661">van Daal, Verhoeven, &amp; van Balkom, 2007</xref>). Children ages 7 to 9 years with language problems were frequently rated by their teachers as having behavior problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1525740110387661">Lundervold, Heimann, &amp; Manger, 2008</xref>). In another study, 13 of 19 boys ages 8 to 16 years who had been expelled from schools had significantly poorer expressive language skills than controls matched for receptive language and nonverbal intelligence, and many of these language issues were previously undiagnosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1525740110387661">Ripley &amp; Yuill, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, there is evidence that many children who have speech and language delays early in childhood demonstrate weaker language skills than typical peers on measures of vocabulary, grammar, and verbal memory, even into adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1525740110387661">Rescorla, 2009</xref>); often have friendships of poorer quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525740110387661">Durkin &amp; Conti-Ramsden, 2007</xref>); and have poorer educational and occupational outcomes as young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1525740110387661">Johnson, Beitchman, &amp; Brownlie, 2010</xref>). Specific data on the co-occurrence of language disorders with pediatric bipolar disorder were not readily found, but speech-language pathologists (SLPs) recognize that they have an important role in supporting children with behavior disorders and are eager for additional training in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1525740110387661">Sanger, Moore-Brown, Montgomery, &amp; Hellerich, 2004</xref>). Therefore, SLPs and other professionals who work with children need to be alert to the possibility that some children who have social and communication difficulties along with mood and behavioral difficulties may be at risk for a diagnosis of pediatric bipolar disorder. Timely referrals to mental health professionals are important because without proper treatment and early intervention for bipolar disorder and any comorbid conditions that may exist, these children are at high risk for educational difficulties, behavior problems, social isolation, drug and alcohol abuse, and suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1525740110387661">Geller &amp; DelBello, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525740110387661">Grier, Wilkins, &amp; Jeffords, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525740110387661">Kowatch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1525740110387661">Papolos &amp; Papolos, 2006</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1525740110387661">
<title>Overview of Bipolar Disorder Symptomatology</title>
<p>Dramatic mood swings are the primary characteristic of bipolar disorder. In adults, these episodes typically occur over a period of weeks, months, or years. The presenting problems can include a variety of symptoms, such as preoccupation with death and thoughts of suicide, extreme fatigue, grandiose and manic thinking, and excessive thrill seeking or risk taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1525740110387661">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). Children diagnosed with bipolar disorder may have many rapid changes in mood over the course of each day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525740110387661">Kowatch et al., 2005</xref>), which is called <italic>rapid cycling</italic>. For children, common agreement on specific characteristics has been debatable; however, greater consensus is emerging concerning the presentation of this diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525740110387661">Kowatch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1525740110387661">Post et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>A National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) team has been formed to study bipolar disorder in children, and these researchers have strongly endorsed active consideration of the disorder as a possibility in children in order to begin effective interventions earlier. Their 2007 retrospective study of 480 adults with bipolar disorder revealed that approximately 50% had symptoms in childhood or adolescence, and some waited more than two decades for treatment. Earlier onset of the disorder in children was associated with a more severe presentation, including extreme mood swings, added coexisting conditions, and fewer days of good mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1525740110387661">Leverich et al., 2007</xref>). Underscoring the need for timely referral and intervention, another study of 18 adolescents with bipolar disorder showed that 44% attempted suicide and 72% had suicidal ideation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1525740110387661">Lewinsohn, Seeley, &amp; Klein, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>A basic knowledge of the terminology used to describe the features of bipolar disorder is needed to appreciate its behavioral presentation (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1525740110387661">Table 1</xref> for brief definitions of terminology used to describe these features, based on the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision</italic> [<italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1525740110387661">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>]). It should be noted that the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> acknowledges existence of the disorder only in adults, and children can present much differently. Also, the course of bipolar disorder is unpredictable. Some individuals with milder symptoms may never have any exacerbation of the problem, whereas others may have severe symptoms with a limited response to medication. In an effort to standardize research practices, better capture the rapid mood changes, and determine how these specifically affect children, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1525740110387661">Geller, Tillman, and Bolhofner (2007)</xref> proposed a set of definitions that provide more detailed descriptions than those offered in the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> and that focus on describing the periods of shifting moods that may affect individuals at various times across the lifespan. The definitions are as follows: (a) <italic>episode</italic>: onset to offset of full <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria for bipolar disorder; (b) <italic>ultra-rapid cycling</italic>: mood switches every few days during an episode; and (c) <italic>ultraradian cycling</italic>: mood switches multiple times daily during an episode. The mood swings of bipolar disorder can be conceptualized as a continuum, with fluctuations from depression to mania and with intermediate conditions such as dysthymia and cyclothymia, which are milder forms of depression and bipolar disorder, the two primary mood disorders. <italic>Cyclothymia</italic> can be viewed as a milder form of bipolar disorder with periods of less intense emotional highs and lows. There is evidence that these milder mood swings are strongly linked to subsequent bipolar disorder in adults, so these symptoms should be carefully monitored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1525740110387661">Kochman et al., 2005</xref>). Another condition that can occur is a “mixed state” in which an individual may have a great deal of energy and restlessness that present along with expressions of sadness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1525740110387661">Papolos and Papolos (2006)</xref> indicated that these mixed states are a hallmark of bipolar disorder in children. Mixed states in children typically include extreme symptoms of agitation, irritability, anxiety, and restlessness that are accompanied by destructive behavior and feelings of worthlessness.</p>

<p>Some researchers have begun to look at differences in groups of children who have bipolar symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525740110387661">Kowatch et al., 2005</xref>). Those children diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder I, Narrow-Phenotype Pediatric Bipolar Disorder, have symptoms that look much like those of adults. When the symptomatology is less classic, these children are diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder–Not Otherwise Specified. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1525740110387661">Leibenluft, Charney, Towbin, Bhangoo, and Pine (2003)</xref> proposed definitions of four different phenotypes of juvenile mania based on the duration and types of manic symptoms. Their research indicated that many children will have mood disorder symptoms that include dramatic mood swings, but these children would not meet the criteria that are used in diagnosing adult bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Approximately 1% of adults have been diagnosed as having bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1525740110387661">Lewinsohn et al., 2003</xref>), but prevalence in children has only been studied in the past 15 to 20 years. A 1995 study funded by NIMH revealed that 1% of adolescents ages 14 to 18 years met the criteria for a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or cyclothymia. Another study revealed that an additional 6% had an abnormal period of elevated or irritable moods but did not meet the criteria for a specific mood disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1525740110387661">NIMH, 2000</xref>). A wide range of data exists from clinic settings that have reported various percentages of children meeting criteria for bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1525740110387661">Kowatch &amp; DelBello, 2006</xref>), but an accurate percentage of the frequency with which bipolar disorder occurs in children is not yet known.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1525740110387661">
<title>Assessment and Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder in Children</title>
<p>The diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children remains largely within the realm of clinical judgment after a thorough mental status examination and interview, but there have been some imaging studies that suggest the presence of subtle brain differences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1525740110387661">Vastag (2003)</xref> reported on a NIMH study that used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to document changes in the prefrontal cortex of children with bipolar disorder. In addition, changes were found in the brains of children hospitalized for the first time with manic episodes compared to children who had been hospitalized many times. A second study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525740110387661">DelBello, Zimmerman, Mills, Getz, and Strakowski (2004)</xref> found differences in the areas of the brain thought to mediate mood, including putamen enlargement, smaller amygdala, and reduced total brain volume. Another <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1525740110387661">NIMH (2006)</xref> study report indicated that youth with bipolar disorder more often misread facial expressions as being hostile as measured by increased activation in the left amygdala and related structures via magnetic resonance imaging. Group differences in electroencephalograms (EEGs) have also been reported. A 2007 NIMH study described by Kuehn revealed significant differences in brain activity as measured by EEGs during frustrating tasks when children with bipolar disorder were compared to controls.</p>
<p>Psychiatrists and psychologists are the professionals who conduct the specific evaluations that may lead to a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. They carefully review a child’s history and conduct thorough interviews to determine if the child meets criteria for pediatric bipolar disorder or if another diagnosis would better capture the child’s cluster of symptoms. As with other chronic health conditions, the assessment, diagnosis, and management of this disorder often require an interdisciplinary approach. Speech- language pathologists can contribute to these diagnostic efforts through clear descriptions of the behaviors they have observed in their interactions with the child.</p>
<p>The Biopsychoeducational Model provides a comprehensive framework for the treatment of children with chronic health conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1525740110387661">Bradley-Klug, Grier, &amp; Ax, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525740110387661">Grier &amp; Bradley-Klug, in press</xref>) and may be especially useful when applied to children with bipolar disorder. This model emphasizes use of a collaborative, problem-solving approach to thoroughly assess all factors that may be affecting a child’s functioning, including medical, psychological, educational, familial, and community issues. Comprehensive clinical assessments following this model typically begin with a detailed medical history. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525740110387661">Kowatch et al. (2005)</xref> reviewed a number of medical conditions with symptoms that can mimic the symptoms of bipolar disorder, so these must be considered. Examples are epilepsy, hyperthyroidism, and the side effects of drugs such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications, anti- depressants, corticosteroids, and certain antibiotics. Another important factor is a family history of mood disorders. Children who have a parent or other relatives with bipolar disorder are at higher risk of having the disorder, but it also occurs in individuals who have no family history of bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1525740110387661">Chang &amp; Steiner, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>After a review of the medical history, the caregivers and child are interviewed to gather information about the symptoms experienced, including symptom frequency, intensity, and duration. Commonly used interview scales include the Washington University in St. Louis <italic>Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525740110387661">Geller, Williams, Zimmerman, &amp; Frazier, 1996</xref>) and the <italic>Child Mania Rating Scale–Parent Version</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1525740110387661">Pavuluri, Henry, Devineni, Carbray, &amp; Birmaher, 2006</xref>). For mania to be considered, the symptoms must exceed the baseline functioning for the child. The issue of irritability must be explored carefully because many children with other diagnoses have an irritable mood. Children who have the irritability associated with bipolar disorder frequently have long periods of rage over seemingly trivial matters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525740110387661">Kowatch et al., 2005</xref>). Another possible symptom is <italic>pressured speech</italic>, rapid and uncontrollable spells of speech that appear tense and markedly differently from the child’s normal speech pattern. Pressured speech differs from hyperverbal behaviors in that it is difficult to interrupt and seems unusual. Speech-language pathologists can help determine if any speech behaviors seem out of the ordinary for the child’s developmental level. Other potential issues, such as grandiosity, sleep difficulties, distractibility, hypersexuality, extreme silliness, racing thoughts, unusual disinhibition in seeking out other people, and psychosis, are explored by the medical and psychology professionals. The possibility of suicidal ideation is considered to ensure that appropriate interventions are in place if needed to keep the child safe.</p>
<p>Finally, a comprehensive assessment includes attention to environmental factors that may be contributing to the child’s overall functioning. Assessment of the style of family interactions may provide valuable information concerning the type of support system a child has at home. Children of families with high stress and interaction styles characterized by critical comments, hostility, and emotional overinvolvement (i.e., high expressed emotion) may be at increased risk for relapse, and these families may be in greater need of professional and community support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1525740110387661">Fristad, Gavazzi, &amp; Mackinaw-Koons, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1525740110387661">Miklowitz, 2007</xref>). Assessment of school functioning also may help identify areas requiring support, including academic performance, medication compliance, and behavior management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525740110387661">Grier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525740110387661">Grier, Wilkins, &amp; Szadek, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Further complicating the diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children is the frequent existence of comorbid or coexisting conditions. Some of the most common comorbid conditions are ADHD, anxiety, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1525740110387661">Post et al., 2004</xref>) as well as learning disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1525740110387661">McClure et al., 2005</xref>). In a study of children with bipolar disorder conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1525740110387661">Papolos and Papolos (2006)</xref>, many of those initially diagnosed only with ADHD who were given stimulant medications actually developed symptoms of mania, depression, or psychosis. Distinguishing among these disorders is essential as the interventions and medication treatment for each can be different.</p>
<p>A study from Harvard illustrates the high comorbidity of bipolar disorder and ADHD: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1525740110387661">Giedd (2000)</xref> reported that 94% of a group of children diagnosed with mania also met the criteria for ADHD; in contrast, only 22% of children diagnosed with ADHD met the criteria for bipolar disorder. Therefore, knowing the similarities and differences between ADHD and bipolar disorder can be helpful. Talkativeness, distractibility, and psychomotor agitation are three symptoms that are common to mania and ADHD, but the presence of these alone does not point to bipolar disorder. Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1525740110387661">Geller and DelBello (2003)</xref> suggested that children with bipolar disorder present with more manic-specific behaviors, such as elated mood, grandiosity, flight of ideas, decreased need for sleep, and poor judgment (e.g., hypersexuality, acting out/daredevil behaviors, inappropriate silliness, and uninhibited social interactions). Children with ADHD alone do not present with excessive mood lability, extended tantrums and rage, intentional aggression, suicidality, hypersexuality, and grandiosity, which are quite common in children with bipolar disorder. If a child has coexisting bipolar disorder and ADHD, the impairment can be more severe, with a stronger chance for hospitalization, increased possibility of psychotic symptoms, and higher risk of school failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1525740110387661">Wolf &amp; Wagner, 2003</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525740110387661">Kowatch et al.

The largest differences were on a task that required retrieval of an encoded list. Children who were experiencing acute symptoms had more difficulty on some tasks than those who were not. Comorbid ADHD appeared to contribute to these memory difficulties. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1525740110387661">Kuehn’s (2007)</xref> review of the NIMH study that explored EEG findings in children with and without bipolar disorder indicated that the children with the disorder seemed to have difficulty with executive attention on frustrating tasks. Given that verbal learning, verbal memory, and attention are all associated with language development and are crucial elements for success in school, careful exploration of the child’s abilities in these areas will be important. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525740110387661">Kowatch et al.

In addition, children may have adverse responses to medications (e.g., oversedation) that affect their cognitive processing. Psychological assessment should be conducted to examine the potential for associated cognitive difficulties, which may be present even if major learning difficulties have not been suspected.</p>

<title>Social Issues</title>
<p>Social difficulties are common in children and youths with bipolar disorder. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1525740110387661">Kutcher, Robertson, and Bird (1998)</xref> found that parents of adolescents with Bipolar I rated them as having normal peer relationships and academic functioning prior to the onset of their illness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1525740110387661">Geller et al. (2000)</xref> found in their study that children and adolescents with bipolar disorder had significantly more impairment in parent–child interactions and peer relationships than control participants. Taken together, these studies suggest that psychosocial functioning may deteriorate as bipolar disorder progresses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1525740110387661">Papolos and Papolos (2006)</xref> reviewed issues that create enormous stress within families, such as the unpredictability of the child’s behavior, the difficulty of dealing with prolonged rages, and the pressures associated with being a sibling of a child who has bipolar disorder. In addition, parents must help these children deal with the rejection they may experience as a result of their intrusive behaviors. Many children and youths with bipolar disorder have a great deal of difficulty maintaining friendships.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1525740110387661">
<title>Communication Issues</title>
<p>Given that children with bipolar disorder are at greater risk for memory difficulties, the potential effect on language development is an important consideration. A recent research review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1525740110387661">Montgomery, Magimairaj, and Finney (2010)</xref> described the theoretical relationship between <italic>phonological short-term memory deficits</italic> and language development. Although not all children with specific language impairment or bipolar disorder will have working memory deficits, this possible association merits consideration in children who have either of these disorders.</p>
<p>A more overt speech variation that may be evident in children with bipolar disorder is pressured speech. Descriptions of pressured speech and flight of ideas are common in the literature relating to bipolar disorder in adults. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525740110387661">Kowatch et al. (2005)</xref> indicated that the rapid speech common when children get upset or excited is different from the pressured speech pattern associated with bipolar disorder. The latter may be described as excessive, loud, and intrusive in addition to being rapid. The child may interrupt frequently and try to dominate the conversation. As with all the other symptoms, the distinguishing feature is that the child’s speech is different from baseline.</p>
<p>The SLP’s role is to help distinguish between children whose discourse may be difficult to follow as a result of language impairment as opposed to those who are experiencing inconsistent communication difficulties associated with ADHD and/or a manic state. Multiple observations that demonstrate that the child’s speech is clearly different from his or her typical communication are needed to help the assessment team confirm that pressured or rapid speech is a symptom of a manic state or a part of a language disorder.</p>
<p>Other aspects of communication that have been described in children with bipolar disorder include <italic>word retrieval deficits</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525740110387661">Kowatch et al., 2005</xref>) and <italic>difficulty interpreting and responding to social cues</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1525740110387661">McClure et al., 2005</xref>). Children with word retrieval deficits likely experience an exacerbation of this problem when they are in a manic or depressed state because emotional stress can interfere with communication. Likewise, difficulty interpreting social cues might increase in more extreme emotional states. The obvious association between frustration related to communication difficulties and the potential effect of this frustration on behavior must therefore be considered.</p>
<p>Other social and emotional factors also have been associated with language difficulties and potentially could have an effect on children who have both bipolar disorder and language problems. For example, children who have difficulty expressing themselves and using language as a tool for self-regulation may become aggressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1525740110387661">Sanger et al., 2004</xref>) or withdrawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1525740110387661">Fujiki, Brinton, Isaacson, &amp; Summers, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1525740110387661">Rescorla, Ross, &amp; McClure, 2007</xref>). A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1525740110387661">Wadman, Durkin, and Conti-Ramsden (2008)</xref> indicated that the shyness and self-esteem issues associated with language impairment persist into adolescence, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525740110387661">Durkin and Conti-Ramsden (2007)</xref> found that children with more severe language problems were more likely to have relatively poor quality of friendships.</p>
<p>Researchers have begun to look at differences in social skills and pragmatic language, which are thought to be related to differences in brain structures and functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1525740110387661">McClure et al., 2005</xref>). McClure and colleagues found that students with bipolar disorder had significantly more errors on the Pragmatic Judgment subtest of the <italic>Comprehensive Assessment of Spoken Language</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1525740110387661">Carrow-Woolfolk, 1999</xref>) and on the <italic>Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy Scale</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1525740110387661">Nowicki &amp; Duke, 1994</xref>), which measures the ability to identify facial expressions. Both of these measures reliably differentiated between children with bipolar disorder and healthy controls. Deficits such as these help explain the social difficulties that some individuals with bipolar disorder have.</p>
<p>Speech-language pathologists need to be aware of the social communication implications when bipolar disorder exists. This includes a good understanding of all the interventions recommended by other professionals as well as any specific behavior management techniques that need to be incorporated into their work with the child. The primary concern is to develop a better understanding of how speech-language intervention can be provided in a manner that complements any other social, behavioral, or cognitive interventions that may be in place; consistency across settings is key.</p>

<title>Interventions for Bipolar Disorder</title>
<sec id="section8-1525740110387661">
<title>Medications</title>
<p>Stabilization of mood swings is the first consideration in regard to medication treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1525740110387661">Pavuluri &amp; Bishop, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1525740110387661">Leverich et al. (2007)</xref> reported that there are often long delays before an accurate diagnosis is given, and in the interim, many children are treated with stimulants or antidepressants that complicate their problems by inducing mood swings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1525740110387661">Vastag (2003)</xref> noted that NIMH guidelines warn that a specialist should be consulted immediately if manic symptoms develop while the child is taking stimulant medications.</p>
<p>When medications are recommended to treat bipolar disorder, the optimal level of efficacy may not be reached for 6 to 8 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525740110387661">Kowatch et al., 2005</xref>). Commonly prescribed medications include mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. Some children improve with a single medication, but others need additional pharmacological interventions. This is particularly true for children with comorbid disorders. Close monitoring is needed to document undesirable side effects of the medications or evidence that the medications are ineffective in controlling the symptoms.</p>
<p>Speech-language pathologists are in an excellent position to help monitor these children for medication side effects during their periodic treatment sessions: If the SLP notices any differences in the child’s behaviors while he or she is taking new medicines, their observations can be helpful to the prescribing physician. They must make a note of the specific behaviors observed and suggest that the parents share the information with the physician promptly.</p>

<sec id="section9-1525740110387661">
<title>Counseling</title>
<p>Counseling is an essential element in treatment of bipolar disorder in children because this illness can significantly compromise the quality of life for the child and the family. Parents and children are encouraged to learn all they can about the disorder and to share the responsibility for managing the symptoms. Techniques such as anger management and social skills training are incorporated as needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1525740110387661">Goldberg-Arnold &amp; Fristad, 2003</xref>). Several family treatment programs have been developed that use a psychoeducational approach to increase medication adherence, communication and coping skills, and problem-solving skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1525740110387661">Miklowitz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1525740110387661">Young &amp; Fristad, 2007</xref>).</p>

They may require a 504 Plan or Individualized Education Plan (IEP) to address the difficulties that are functionally limiting or adversely affecting their performance in the school setting. Educating school staff is crucial if the child is to experience success. Selected educational interventions need consistent implementation, and school staff members need to alert caregivers and counselors about changes in the child’s performance that could suggest breakthrough symptoms or undesirable medication side effects.</p>

<title>Case Study</title>
<sec id="section12-1525740110387661">
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Children with bipolar disorder can present as complex and challenging cases requiring intentional collaboration between families and professionals. The Biopsychoeducational Model offers a useful framework to structure this collaboration and encourages the application of an ecological, problem-solving approach to the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of children with chronic health conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1525740110387661">Bradley-Klug et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525740110387661">Grier &amp; Bradley-Klug, in press</xref>). The current case study describes the application of this model in the treatment of a young child with bipolar disorder and highlights the importance of collaboration among families, pediatricians, psychologists, SLPs, and school personnel.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1525740110387661">
<title>Background Information and Presenting Problem</title>
<p>James was a 6-year-old boy living with his single mother and enrolled in first grade at a public school. James was born a few weeks before term and experienced severe colic for 6 months. Early concerns included slow growth and a dislike for certain food textures. At 2 years of age, James entered preschool and began to exhibit severe tantrums lasting 30 to 60 minutes, several times a day, and often with no known trigger. Administration of sensory integration therapy and movement to a preschool with a smaller teacher–student ratio resulted in decreases in the frequency and severity of James’s tantrums; however, he continued to have difficulties in crowded environments. James’s mother described him as an active child who had difficulty sleeping. She reported that his father had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and that his older brother was taking medication for ADHD. James’s mother also revealed that she was “hyper” as a child, was often “in trouble,” and had experienced a bout of depression in her twenties.</p>
<p>James’s current presenting concern was the recurrence of severe behavior problems that emerged over the year he began kindergarten. His extreme behavior included going into prolonged rages lasting as long as an hour or more. These rages included screaming, throwing chairs, and gagging himself until he vomited. James was originally diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed stimulant medication. The school set up a 504 Plan and behavior intervention plan to address his difficulties in the classroom, and James’s developmental pediatrician monitored the effects of his stimulant medication. At each follow-up visit, James’s mother consistently reported that his behavior was much better at home than at school. Although there were times when James’s behavior appeared to have improved, he continued to struggle. A mood disorder was strongly suspected because of his pattern of dramatic mood swings with extreme irritability, long rages, and aggression, along with evidence of depression and poor sleep patterns. Therefore, as he began first grade, the developmental pediatrician referred James within the clinic to a pediatric school psychologist for a comprehensive psychological assessment and to the SLP for a communication evaluation. The three professionals at the clinic worked collaboratively as a team to support James in school and at home.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1525740110387661">
<title>Key Collaborators</title>
<p>In addition to James’s mother, it was imperative to include school personnel on the treatment team. James’s principal, classroom teacher, school SLP, and school psychologist all played valuable roles in James’s treatment. As mentioned, professionals from outside of the school included a developmental pediatrician, pediatric school psychologist, and SLP. Consultation and collaboration occurred via phone calls, e-mail communication, and shared reports documenting evaluation results, treatment, continued observations, and progress monitoring data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1525740110387661">
<title>Problem Identification</title>
<p>The pediatric school psychologist and SLP saw James in the fall of his first-grade year for a comprehensive assessment. Information obtained from the school included a psychoeducational assessment completed by the school-based school psychologist, which indicated that James was functioning at an average to above-average level of cognitive and academic functioning, with a personal weakness in verbal skills. School questionnaires completed by James’s kindergarten and first-grade classroom teachers identified hyperactivity, impulsivity, fighting, distractibility, difficulty completing tasks, social skills weaknesses, and tantrums as significant concerns.</p>
<p>The clinic assessment began in the morning, before James had taken his medication. James demonstrated significant attention problems, a high activity level, and symptoms suggesting depression; he exhibited low frustration tolerance and made a number of negative comments about his performance. He was, however, generally compliant in the assessment. It is important that test results suggested that James had at least average cognitive ability despite the fact that his hyperactivity and inattention likely impaired his ability to give his best effort.</p>
<p>During a lunch break, James took his regular dose of stimulant medication. When he returned for speech and language testing, James appeared much calmer, but he remained highly distractible and somewhat anxious; he was observed to continuously suck and chew on his fingers. As testing went on, James became increasingly defiant and frustrated, not wanting to attempt any of the test items he found more difficult. Speech and language testing was then discontinued. Based on James’s scattered performance, ranging from average to below average, the possibility of significant language difficulties could not be ruled out until further testing could be completed.</p>
<p>Upon termination of speech-language testing, the psychologist attempted to settle James down and showed him a game to distract him. James’s agitation continued to escalate and he began throwing furniture, screaming, and trying to make himself vomit. For approximately 1 hour, the psychologist and James’s mother tried various techniques to calm him down, without success. An ambulance was called, and James was admitted to the hospital for further assessment of his emotional status and behavior, remaining there for 12 days. He was diagnosed as having ADHD and Oppositional Defiant Disorder. James was given medications to address behavior (Risperdal), sleep (Remeron), and attention (Methylin). He refused to take some of the medications, so Daytrana (a stimulant medication delivered via a patch) was tried in an effort to decrease the ADHD symptoms.</p>
<p>After he was released from the hospital, James went back to school, where he continued to have behavioral difficulties despite having a shadow assigned to him as part of his IEP. In the next few weeks, James’s mother and the developmental pediatrician communicated regularly by phone about the efficacy of the medications and about side effects. The Daytrana was stopped because James appeared to be having hallucinations, but he continued taking Risperdal and Remeron.</p>
<p>When James’s behavior had stabilized, the speech and language testing was rescheduled. He was pleasant and cooperative during this assessment, and although he had significant difficulty staying focused, he appeared very motivated to do his best. James demonstrated great difficulty organizing his thoughts to retell a story. In addition, he talked excessively, interrupted often, and rambled in conversations. He was diagnosed as having significant narrative and pragmatic language difficulties, subtle articulation and oral motor difficulties, and a mild fluency problem.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1525740110387661">
<title>Problem Analysis</title>
<p>Based on information gathered from James’s mother and school personnel, as well as the assessment observations and hospital data, the team convened via conference call to analyze James’s complex medical, psychological, academic, and behavioral presentations. Based on observations at home, at school, and during the assessments, it appeared that James’s current medications may have been contributing to his emotional dysregulation and behavior problems. The developmental pediatrician emphasized the importance of maintaining a supportive school environment with frequent contact between the school and James’s mother to ensure medication adherence and to keep track of medication effects to achieve the safest and most effective medication regimen. It appeared that James’s cognitive and academic functioning was in the average range; however, it was clear that his hyperactivity, impulsivity, and difficulty controlling his emotions were significantly affecting his ability to function effectively in school. Speech-language testing revealed weaknesses in James’s ability to communicate that may have been contributing to his behavioral difficulties and interfering with previous attempts at behavior management. The team agreed that an individualized behavior management program that accounted for James’s specific strengths and weaknesses would be a necessary component to his IEP and that he should receive speech-language intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1525740110387661">
<title>Solution Development and Implementation</title>
<p>Based on the team’s conceptualization of James’s behavioral and language difficulties possibly associated with an early onset bipolar disorder, a treatment plan was developed. A communication system was set up that allowed for frequent contact among James’s mother, the educators at school, and the developmental pediatrician to evaluate the medication regimen that was prescribed. Specifically, the principal at James’s school promised to work closely with James’s mother and teacher. He agreed to contact the developmental pediatrician each week to report on James’s progress and any behaviors of concern. A specific one-page report sheet was created that was either faxed or e-mailed to support timely, efficient communication. James’s mother also agreed to check in regularly by phone with the developmental pediatrician. In addition, the pediatric school psychologist and SLPs in the community and at school worked with the teachers to complete a functional analysis of James’s problem behaviors and develop an individualized behavior management program that could be implemented consistently throughout the school day. The school SLP agreed to begin intervention with James. Her focus was on helping him learn to interact more effectively with his peers through practice in negotiating ideas for play activities and discussing potential roles and rules in advance to prevent conflict. The broader goal was to support him in his efforts to develop friendships at school. The psychologist continued to try to educate James’s mother about the issues he was experiencing and attempted to get her support.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1525740110387661">
<title>Intervention Evaluation</title>
<p>As arranged, James’s principal communicated to check in with the medical professionals each week to report on James’s behavior. The school was consistently implementing the behavior management plan and providing speech-language therapy. Things went much better for about 2 months, and then James’s behavior deteriorated again. The principal learned that James’s mother had decided to stop giving him his medication. The pediatric school psychologist and developmental pediatrician tried numerous times to contact his mother, but she did not return the phone calls. Near the end of the year, James’s behavior improved, and it appeared that his mother had started giving him his medication again. Despite continued efforts to reach James’s mother, she did not make follow-up phone calls or schedule appointments so that the developmental pediatrician, pediatric school psychologist, and SLP could help support her and monitor James’s progress.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1525740110387661">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The implementation of the Biopsychoeducational Model provided the structure necessary to complete a comprehensive assessment that took into account James’s functioning across all areas of his life. The application of a problem-solving approach encouraged the collaboration of key individuals in James’s life, including his family, school personnel, and medical team. This case study highlights the successes that can result from such a comprehensive, collaborative approach to treatment. The importance of maintaining communication and adherence to the plan, and the challenges that can arise when this communication breaks down, also were evident.</p>

<title>Implications for SLPs</title>
<sec id="section21-1525740110387661">
<title>Early Referral</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1525740110387661">Oram, Fine, Okamato, and Tannock (1999)</xref> reported that ADHD frequently coexists with speech-language difficulties. Their review of the literature indicated that 20% to 60% of the children with communication difficulties also will have ADHD. Given the frequency with which these two disorders overlap and the fact that extreme attention problems can be a possible sign of bipolar disorder, SLPs may be in the position of seeing symptoms of mood disorders (e.g., pressured speech, flight of ideas) even before these children have been referred to psychologists and psychiatrists. Careful documentation of behavior and social concerns and consultation with teachers and parents are crucial in making certain that children are referred for additional evaluation if their current interventions are not working well.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1525740110387661">
<title>Interventions for Language Difficulties</title>
<p>When language problems exist, the SLP is the expert in choosing strategies to address common communication issues for articulation, receptive language skills, and expressive language. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1525740110387661">Flory et al. (2006)</xref> found that children with ADHD had problems producing narratives that were coherent. A second study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1525740110387661">Flake, Lorch, and Milich (2007)</xref> revealed that children with ADHD had difficulties with story comprehension. Given that most children with bipolar disorder also have ADHD, these types of narrative language issues, along with pragmatic language deficits, will need to be considered when working with these children. Appropriate pragmatic language interventions will always include the evidence-based strategies that are used with children who have difficulty establishing friendships: instruction in the rules of conversational discourse, practice with supportive adults and children who understand the need to create opportunities for positive interactions, and a plan for reducing the supports as generalization of the new skills emerges.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1525740110387661">
<title>Collaboration With Caregivers, Teachers, and Psychologists</title>
<p>The SLP will need to work closely with family members, teachers, and psychologists to provide effective interventions for children with bipolar disorder. Adults who care for the child at home may see a different behavioral presentation than is manifested at school. The differences should be documented because establishing patterns of behavior across environments leads to a better understanding of which behavioral interventions work best. Collaborative intervention plans should include communication with the physician about the child’s response to medications, supports for the family, and assistance for the child at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525740110387661">Grier &amp; Bradley-Klug, in press</xref>).</p>
<p>Gaining the caregivers’ trust is an essential first step in developing a collaborative relationship. The significant vulnerability that caregivers may be feeling when their child is struggling must be considered at the outset. They may be overwhelmed with the challenges of managing the child’s behavior, especially when the child is not sleeping well, because this can result in sleep deprivation for every member of the family. Caregivers may have experienced criticism from other family members or even strangers when the child has misbehaved, and this serves to further erode their parenting confidence and increase their frustration. They may have difficulty explaining the unusual, fluctuating behavior patterns that the child manifests, and this can enhance their feelings of inadequacy. Finally, some caregivers may struggle with mental health problems of their own. School personnel and community professionals thus <italic>must</italic> create opportunities for dialogues with caregivers in which their efforts to support improved behavior in the child also are acknowledged.</p>
<p>Trust is established more easily when all the key players feel that their input and the efforts that they have made to help the child are valued. Professionals must make certain that they offer sincere praise for the child’s strengths and the caregivers’ efforts to manage the complicated issues that surround the child’s mental health, behavior, and academic and social problems rather than focusing only on the behavioral difficulties. They must lay the foundation for interactions that are grounded in mutual respect and that focus on positive approaches to behavior management and educational interventions. This will help caregivers appreciate that the conversations are a joint effort at problem solving directed toward maximizing the child’s potential.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1525740110387661">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As the number of children diagnosed with bipolar disorder increases, it is crucial that SLPs become more familiar with the potential behavioral, cognitive, and communication manifestations that may coexist with this diagnosis. Although establishing this diagnosis is not within the scope of our profession, our behavioral observations will be helpful in early referral. If medication management is initiated, our observations of the child’s response to medication will be one component of an overall plan to maximize the child’s social and academic success. Finally, when communication difficulties also are present, best practice includes offering evidence-based interventions while collaborating closely with the child’s primary caregivers as well as the psychologists, teachers, counselors, and medical professionals who may also be working with these children to support them in their development.</p>
