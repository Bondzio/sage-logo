<title>VIALINK Pipette Management Tool</title>
<p>INTEGRA’s new VIALINK pipette management tool allows users to create and manage custom programs, maintain a service history, and transfer firmware upgrade details between VIAFLO electronic pipettes and a PC. Pipetting protocols can be set up as custom programs with VIALINK and then copied onto VIAFLO pipettes. Users can create a program library that can hold an unlimited number of pipetting protocols. Up to 20 custom programs can then be stored on the pipette itself. Service information, such as date of last calibration or service, can be stored on the pipettes and cannot be deleted afterward, thereby guaranteeing an authentic service history. As INTEGRA releases new firmware upgrades for its electronic pipetting products, VIALINK will enable users to rapidly implement the upgrades on their VIAFLO pipettes. To use VIALINK, VIAFLO single- and multi-channel electronic pipettes require a programming stand that functions as a connector to a PC and serves as a charging stand. To use VIALINK with the VIAFLO 96, only a standard USB cable is required. VIALINK can be downloaded from the INTEGRA Web site.</p>

<title>Calibry 5.0 Pipette Calibration Software</title>
<p>Now compatible with RFID-enabled RAININ pipettes, Calibry 5.0 enables the tracking of pipettes and the monitoring of recalibration dates. Simplified calibration processes allow pipette accuracy to be easily monitored through regular testing. Calibration dates and other identifying information can be written directly to RFID-enabled RAININ pipettes. Calibry can instantly read the serial numbers on pipettes by means of an RFID scanner, speeding up the calibration process for both single- and multi-channel pipettes. Comprehensive pipette information can be accessed via the newly developed Quick Access window. It is easy to check the recalibration dates for individual pipettes, and the calibration method can be started directly from the window. Calibry automatically adds pipettes to the calibration task list as recalibration dates approach and provides step-by-step guidance through the calibration process. Data are recorded automatically.</p>
