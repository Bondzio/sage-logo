<abstract>
<p>The smell of real leather: as you slide on new shoes, or slip into a new car. Luxury. Refinement. Juxtapose this with the person who inappropriately smells of leather, of animal flesh. The nose curls with even the thought: contagion and filth, a different kind of person. These divergent sensibilities of the smell of leather exist alongside each other in contemporary Japan, each requiring a discriminating nose to demarcate sets of smell and sets of people. Set against this backdrop of aromatic bivalency, this paper examines how smell and the capacity for olfaction become key elements in the identification of stigma in Japan. I explore the ecology of interrelating sensibilities that compose the politics of stigma. The Buraku people have historically been marginalized in Japan because of associations with stigmatized industries such as leather and meat production. Since the 1970s, the groundwork for asserting such associations has been dramatically reconfigured. This paper focuses on the changing practices by which such attribution occurs, the demands these practices make on capacities for olfaction and the qualities of scent, and the role ceded to private detectives as purveyors of evidence.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1463499613483397"><title>The scent of stigma</title>
<p>One afternoon in November 2006, I was working on the second floor of a small leather tannery in eastern Tokyo, listening to the radio. It was my third week apprenticing at the factory, and I had moved from the more gruesome tasks handled on the first floor – receiving the raw hide, tanning and dyeing it – up to the drying, stretching, and trimming of the second floor. That morning I had been trained to trim the rough edges off full sheets of processed and dyed leather, and by two o’clock my trainer, moderately satisfied with my bumbling cuts, headed off to another task, leaving me alone with my mistakes and with the radio.</p>
<p>I only half-listened to the programming of modern <italic>enka</italic> songs and personality commentary as I worked, but around three I found my attention caught by a particular radio commercial. It was an ad for bottled aromas, not terribly noticeable in itself. What caught my attention about this one, however, was that the odor in question was that of leather. The commercial touted a ‘real leather smell’ that, when applied, would revive your leather couch, the interior of your car, or your shoes, adding a sense of refinement and luxury to your daily life.</p>
<p>Hearing this commercial while entrenched in a ‘real leather smell’ of a different sort, I found myself slightly stunned by the juxtaposition of the commercial with what I was then doing. Three weeks prior, on the evening before I was to head off to my first day at the factory, I had received an olfactory warning from my 82-year-old neighbor, friend, and frequent dinner companion. The stench of leather, Nakajo-san explained, was atrocious. More than that, the smell of leather stuck – it clung to your clothes, to your hands, to your hair. While the odor might wash off initially, after time, after daily contact with the scent, the smell became part of you. I needed to be prepared to stink – and stink permanently – if I were really going to work in the factory. I also, and here Nakajo-san grew a bit more serious, needed to be prepared to eat dinner alone. He explained that he could not abide the smell of leather and that our shared evening meals would have to end.</p>
<p>The radio advertisement and the neighborly admonition offer two widely divergent appraisals of the smell of leather, each invoking its own set of qualitative experiences, types of person, and larger sociopolitical projects. While the radio commercial promises self-congratulatory pleasure in understanding the smell of leather as a sign of refinement and luxury, Nakajo-san’s admonition urges visceral disgust in response to the smell of leather as a sign of filth and contagion. The advertisement’s effectiveness presumes a spatial and temporal containment. The smell of leather is localizable spatially; it can be contained in a bottle and directed at specific objects like shoes or couches. Similarly, it is limited to a particular time period; the luxurious odor of a leather interior wanes and needs to be refreshed, and will most likely, as we might imagine the maker of the aerosol intends, need to be refreshed again. Nakajo-san’s warning, however, centers on concerns of both qualitative promiscuity and persistence. In his description, odor wafts and clings, crossing boundaries and building over time and exposure. Prolonged and consistent contact with the smell renders infiltration permanent. Each of these appraisals involves a very particular qualitative experience: while both instantiated in leather, the qualities of refinement, demarcatedness, and ephemerality contrast with those of disgust, promiscuity, and tenacity.</p>
<p>These appraisals similarly carve out contrasting categories of person. The realm of the consumable leather smell is populated with individuals equipped both with the correct appreciations of particular odors and with the capacity to choose to display those refinements through consumption. The realm of disgusting leather smell, though, is populated with two types of people: those whose lives are devoted to processing leather and those whose are not. Distinction in this latter case comes not in the form of correct consumption but in correct understanding of the difference between these two types of people. Each of these interpretations consists in an entire ecology of sensibility, with different subjects, temporalities, and sensory demands all in dynamic relation as part of larger, linked sociopolitical projects of cultivating sensibilities. In addition to being tied to consumptive logics of contemporary capitalism, the radio advertisement also reinforces and is energized by a recent burgeoning of artisanal interest in leather work in Japan. Since the turn of the millennium, people in their late 20s and 30s have taken up leather craft, in particular cobbling, an historically stigmatized industry in Japan. Either oblivious of or indifferent to this negative appraisal, these younger people, frequently from families that do not work in stigmatized occupations, have taken up leather craft with artisanal gusto and are effectively establishing conditions for the ‘transvaluation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1463499613483397">Pedersen 2002</xref>: 454) of domestic leather work from something stigmatized to something worthy of higher priced artisanal markets, more in line with the interpretation of leather smell offered in the radio advertisement. This transvaluation, though, is at best partial. Nakajo-san’s adverse reaction to my employment at a tannery is tied to a centuries-long stigmatization of types of labor and the people who conduct it. These people, now called Buraku,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1463499613483397">1</xref></sup> face social marginalization and impoverishment because of relations with stigmatized forms of labor, typically canalized along lines of occupation, residence, and kinship. Working in stigmatized occupations such as leather or meat production, living in neighborhoods that house stigmatized industries, or being related to someone who falls into these categories renders one potentially recognizable as Buraku and thus subject to heightened social, economic, and physical censure. The smell of leather as something disgusting, perhaps invasive and contagious, is intimately tied to this history.</p>
<p>In this essay I linger on one side of this juxtaposition – the admonition thrown into relief against the advertisement – to examine the staying social power of leather as an object of disgust. In particular, in keeping with the theme of this special issue, I am interested in the mutually constitutive interplay between interpretive practices and abstract qualities of things: how social and political projects place demands on the qualitative experiences of leather and, conversely, how qualities, instantiated in experienced qualia, give shape and form to those social and political projects. I develop the concept of an <italic>ecology of sensibility</italic> to explore the dynamic and constitutive relationships among qualities and practices of experience, across multiple sensory modalities. The first portion of this essay is devoted to expanding this notion and using it to provide a detailed examination of the processes by which leather smell in contemporary Japan is constituted as an object of revulsion. The second portion of the essay turns attention to the wider presumptions and effects of these maneuvers. I trace out how this ecology of sensibility is <italic>territorialized</italic>: the logics of relation across people, institutions, and spaces in which this ecology of sensibility consists. I examine how particular sensibilities move, the social and institutional forces that allow particular experiences of leather, as sign of filth and object of disgust, to circulate. In particular, I focus on the role of the private detective industry in this process, exploring how it transforms the epistemic register of sensibilities of disgust from ‘hearsay’ into ‘fact’. Building across the sections, I develop an analysis of distinction and interpretation attentive to multiple modes of sensibility – affective, energetic, or cognitive – and use that analysis to complicate an investigation of circulation that underpins the force of Buraku stigma.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1463499613483397"><title>An ecology of sensibility</title>
<p>To start engaging these questions, I would like first to consider more closely the category I am calling ‘sensibility’. Much of the recent work on affect presumes a split between the affective and the representational, exhibiting a tendency to track separately the logic and circulations of affect, as opposed to representational or rational communication, in order to isolate its liberatory or disruptive, ‘emergent’ potential (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1463499613483397">Massumi 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1463499613483397">Ngai 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1463499613483397">Stewart 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1463499613483397">Warner 2005</xref>). Some authors, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1463499613483397">Mazzarella (2010)</xref>, have argued instead that the dichotomy of ‘immediate’ affect and ‘mediated’ symbolic reason is an historical precipitate, and that ‘immediacy’ itself is a form of mediation, that affect and reason are not so easily delaminated from each other. I follow Mazzarella’s critique of neovitalist literature on affect in my conceptualization of the mediation inherent in a sensibility. I push further, though, to specify particular sensory relations through which this mediation occurs, and elaborate an analysis that demonstrates the interweavings between affect and representation instead of positing a stark divide. In this context, I use the term ‘sensibility’ to refer to the relation of being sensible, i.e. coming to the senses, mediated through whatever mode that sensibility might occur, be it affective, energetic, or cognitive. I take inspiration here from the work of Charles Sanders Peirce and his tripartite analysis of semiotic interpretants to think through these different modes of mediation, and for understanding that such sensibility is never merely a recognition of something already existing, but always a contextually bound way of making demands on objects.</p>
<p>It is in these sets of demands that I locate an analysis of ‘qualia’. In line with the other articles in this issue, I follow Peirce’s understanding of <italic>qualia</italic> as experiential instantiations through which abstract potentialities called <italic>qualities</italic> are known. In Peirce’s analysis, insofar as qualia are known by somebody as standing for something, they serve as <italic>qualisigns</italic>. I approach this qualic experience in terms of a relation of sensibility, asserting that the experience of qualia are always mediated through particular modes of sensibility and lodged in larger ecologies. I propose that we think of qualia as coming about in relations of sensory demands; that abstract potentialities of qualities can only be known as they are instantiated within an experience that makes demands of and allowances to those qualities, necessarily bundling (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1463499613483397">Keane 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1463499613483397">Munn 1986</xref>) with experiences of other qualities, and thereby giving shape to those qualia which in turn provide the grist around which sensory demands are themselves shaped. The broad category of sensibility highlights divergent presumptions and effects of differing modes of relation that actors – anything that stands in an interpretive relation to other things, including but not limited to people and institutions – might have to each other or the things around them, potentially bundled together in ways that affirm, compound, negate, detract from, interfere with, or have only a neutral effect on each other.</p>
<p>The term ‘ecology’ I use in a non-metaphorical sense to encapsulate this dynamic bundling of multiple modes of sensibility and to draw attention to a second order of relationships among these relations. I use it as well to crosscut any clean division between biotic and abiotic actors and instead consider formative relations across both.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1463499613483397">2</xref></sup> In this case I am examining the multiple relations between leather scent and various actors to explore the different olfactory qualia as well as the types of actors forged in those relations. My starting point here immediately places me at odds with the Bourdieuvian tradition of ‘distinction’ that presumes only one mode of recognition and attachment as if there were a simple brand attached to a particular object that subjects merely recognized.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1463499613483397">3</xref></sup> In contrast, I push the limits of this model by exploring an entire ecology of sensibility attendant to the multimodal relationships among actors and objects, and further the relations among those relationships. I also examine the arenas in which a relationship might be held in doubt, without the certainty that undergirds ‘distinction’. A further example highlights my points here and gives an idea of the semiotic processes at work.</p>
<p>Much of my PhD field research was funded by the Japan Foundation. When I received the award letter in 2006, it was with more than the usual surprise: while the Japan Foundation has actively funded foreign research in Japan since their 1972 inception, and while they have consistently received requests for funding from projects studying Buraku issues – that is, issues of stigmatized labor such as leather or meat production and the politics surrounding that stigma – only in the prior two years had they started funding projects even obliquely related to Buraku issues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1463499613483397">4</xref></sup> This shift made me curious why research on the Buraku people might now be a possible or appropriate recipient of Japan Foundation funding, and why Buraku issues might now be considered possible or appropriate representatives of Japan (at least in the eyes of the Japan Foundation) on an international level. As a result of this curiosity, in addition to tracking the organization’s funding history and the conditions of possibility that enabled my own research, I spent time during fieldwork in Tokyo with the staff of the Japan Foundation foreign research support office.</p>
<p>At one dinner with the staff, I found myself sitting next to a man with whom I had never previously spoken. Over the course of dinner and drinks, we launched into a discussion of my research. Hearing that I researched Buraku issues of labor and stigma, the man, whom I will call Hideki, related to me the following story. He had only recently been hired by the Japan Foundation and had previously worked for a bank in Osaka. During his training for the bank, his manager had told the incoming staff which neighborhoods close to the branch were Buraku, as a means of preventing discrimination against clients from those areas. The manager explained: if you as an employee know for certain whether someone is from a Buraku or not, you can be sure to steel your face when they come in, to make sure not to show your disgust visibly. In providing the employees with this information, the manager had essentially given them the tools they needed to discriminate in the first place; had the manager said nothing, Hideki and others very likely would never have known what neighborhoods were Buraku. Hideki explained that ‘steeling his face’ had, at first, been hard for him.</p>
<p>Hideki had grown up in the western city of Himeji, in a neighborhood close to leather tanneries. And when the wind hit just right, the stench from the leather hung out along the riverside to stretch and dry was overwhelming. His family and neighbors, everyone in his neighborhood, would complain about the smell. As a result, he grew up hating the smell of leather; it turned his stomach to even think about it. He had trouble touching leather even now; his body flinched at the thought. His shoes were cloth; he avoided leather furniture or clothing. When the manager of the bank he had worked in identified the surrounding Buraku neighborhoods, his thoughts had immediately gone to the smell of leather when he was a child, and the thought that these people, the Buraku people, worked steeped in this stench their entire lives. It seeped into their pores and lingered on their bodies. Hideki was concerned that his disgust for the smell lingering on these people would show. At this point in the story, he turned to me and gave a half-smile: ‘I know that I shouldn’t feel that way about Buraku people. Working here [at the Japan Foundation] I’ve started to realize that feeling that way is wrong.’ As our dinner ended and we all headed to the vestibule where we had left our footwear, I took out my leather shoes and held them in Hideki’s direction. He laughingly made a show of flinching away. However, although he was laughing, he was careful not to touch my shoes.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1463499613483397">Peirce (1955: 276–284)</xref> here, we can break apart Hideki’s story to track the different, simultaneous ways in which leather smell emerges as sensible. First, there is the reaction of disgust, that is a change in a bodily state, or what Peirce terms an ‘affective interpretant’. Second, there is an outward behavior, purposeful or not, on the part of Hideki – his body flinching back away from a piece of leather. Peirce terms this kind of reaction an ‘energetic interpretant’. And third, we can identify a disposition to signify or interpret, what Peirce terms a ‘representational interpretant’. Hideki’s very description of his disgust here serves as an example. At the same time, we infer another set of interpretants from Hideki’s parting statement, which act in tension with the first set. Hideki says he realizes his disgusted feeling (about Buraku people and potentially about leather) is wrong – a representational interpretant also indexical of a newfound feeling of moral obligation, yet a different affective interpretant (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1463499613483397">Povinelli 2002</xref>, n.d.). This second set of sensibilities, simultaneous with the first, is bound up in the same logics that allowed for my very presence at the restaurant that evening. At that time, only three projects on Buraku related issues had received Japan Foundation funding. My project proposed to study Buraku issues directly whereas the other two more obliquely approached these issues, focusing on education and city planning. In all cases, though, each project framed its investigation of Buraku issues under the rubric of multiculturalism. Alongside this slight shift in funding trajectories, there has been a recent upswing of foreign scholarship on multiculturalism in Japan (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1463499613483397">Befu 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1463499613483397">Lie 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1463499613483397">Weiner 1997</xref>) and an entrenchment of multiculturalism as a mode of organizing social difference among NGOs in Japan (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1463499613483397">Burgess 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1463499613483397">Hankins 2012</xref>). These changes, which enabled my presence at that table with Hideki, are both demonstrative and productive of the rise of a form of ethical obligation – that of a liberal inclusion – taking shape in sensibilities like Hideki’s.</p>
<p>Pulling apart Hideki’s story in this fashion exhibits a tension between affect and representation in the ecology of Buraku stigma.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1463499613483397">5</xref></sup> At ‘places like the Japan Foundation’, places that expect and tout a liberal politics of multicultural tolerance, there are certain feelings, like that of disgust in the presence of Buraku smells or people, that people like Hideki should disavow. Liberal multiculturalism presents itself as tolerant to others’ affective practices, to their ‘smells’, even as it presents itself as ‘odorless’, that is, as abstracted from qualitative experience, a rational endeavor that stipulates appropriate forms of moral obligation. Hideki’s example, however, demonstrates that although multiculturalism here fronts as representational or rational imperative alone, it operates as well via an incitement to affective and energetic sensibility (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1463499613483397">Povinelli 2002</xref>). Hideki, perhaps as a necessity of his institutional position, aspires to this feeling of tolerance, even as he struggles to feel it adequately. In this tension it becomes patent that liberal multiculturalism, as an abstracted system of thought and representation, has its own qualic sensibility, its own affective registers. In the ecology of sensibility surrounding Buraku stigma, multiculturalism itself ‘smells’, despite any pretense otherwise.</p>
<p>The modes of sensibility operative here are multiple and not limited to propositional responses to particular signs. As Kockelman observes, ‘[m]any interpretants are not “mental signs,” or even subsequent utterances (such as answers to questions), but various modes of embodied comportment: feelings, (re)actions, assertions, and habits’ (2005: 278). Interpretation of a smell, or a person, then, as disgusting, promiscuous, and tenaciously contagious is not merely a matter of propositional engagement; it happens along channels of affect, energy, and representation, sometimes at odds with each other, and cultivated across different temporalities and levels of explicit conscious engagement. Within an ecology, therefore, any assessment of an actor as a ‘person’ (such as Hideki) is reliant not simply on a performative event of language use but rather on a broader performative event of bodily assemblages of sensibilities, teased apart in these different modalities. Qualia of scents like leather, as well as capacities of olfaction, occur as similar events within this ecology, shaping and given shape by sets of sensory demands.</p>
<p>If the content of Hideki’s story demonstrates the different sensibilities at work linking people to smells via particular qualia, and the conflicting relationships among different types of sensibility, his telling of the story to me provided a secondary confirmation. As a child he had lived close to Buraku areas and industries. His thick description of his disgust, though, was meant to indicate to me that despite the regular exposure to this smell as a youth, he was not a Buraku person. The disgust itself, its telling and retelling to me and among the neighbors where he grew up as a child, functioned as a way to assure himself and the listener that he was different from Buraku people. His sensibilities were sufficiently refined to be able to discriminate the malodorousness of leather production. His story told me, ‘Yes, I lived close to them, but don’t get me wrong, I am not one of them. Their smell will not cling to me.’ His story, however, was motivated precisely by this possibility of contagion, an assurance to me and potentially to himself that while the smell might have been proximal, it was insufficient to render him this kind of person. The Buraku category of person has historically been defined by the vectors of occupation, space, or kinship – that is, again, by working in a stigmatized industry, living in neighborhoods that house such industries, or being related to someone in either of those first two categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1463499613483397">Inoue 1950</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1463499613483397">Uchida 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1463499613483397">Yoda 2005</xref>). However, Hideki’s account points out another potential vector of contagion beyond this canonical read. The materiality of odor, the qualia demanded of smell in Hideki’s sensibility, distributes stigma promiscuously beyond those traditional lines. Whereas genealogy, space, and occupation have some level of fixity, smell wafts. Its threatening movements are more capricious. It is this caprice that Hideki feels he must explain away to me his listener.</p>
<p>This example – both in the referential content of Hideki’s story and the interactional fact of his telling it to me – gives an indication of the semiotic work involved in coupling the scent of leather with the stigma of the Buraku. In many cases, the distinctive smell of a leather factory is not due to the smell of leather alone; chromium, vitriolic acid, and a host of other chemicals used in the process of tanning leather produce noxious fumes. However, in Hideki’s interpretation, inasmuch as the leather smell is sensible only through its ‘bundling’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1463499613483397">Keane 2003</xref>: 414) with the stench of tanning chemicals, Hideki’s retrospective distillation of the experience is that of leather smell. Leather itself comes to stand in for the leather factory, all invasive, particulate malodor absorbed and concentrated in one object. But, in this interpretation, it is not the qualia of leather alone that are at issue. It is also a type of person: the Buraku person. Here the Buraku person and the leather are co-extensive, not by virtue of a perceived indexical or causal relationship, but by one perceived to be iconic, of shared qualities. Through a maneuver of indexical downshifting (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1463499613483397">Parmentier 1994</xref>: 18; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1463499613483397">Peirce 1932</xref>: 151), or what might be called, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1463499613483397">Gal and Irvine (1995: 974)</xref>, iconization or, really, rhematization, this causal relation is cast as one of sharing of qualities, and in so doing works to regiment what the corresponding qualia are and can be. Both the Buraku person and the smell of leather provoke disgust, stoke the fear of contagion, and foment images of material infiltration. The qualities are seen to be the same, and are aligned, both presupposed and entailed in Hideki’s retrospective interpretation of the odor as that of leather. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1463499613483397">Munn’s (1986)</xref> analysis, then, we can say that leather smell becomes a qualisign both of tanning labor and of Buraku stigmatized social position. It is indexicality iconized, a sign that iconically signifies the productive process that has created it. Inasmuch as the scent of leather can conjure the association with Buraku people, Burakuness itself can be perceived through the concatenation of scents bundled into leather. In this read, leather stinks, and so do Buraku people.</p>
<p>Within this ecology of sensibility, two semiotic moves consolidate and link qualities of things and qualities of people. There is, first, the erasure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1463499613483397">Gal and Irvine 1995</xref>) whereby Hideki’s retrospective understanding of an encounter with the odors of a tannery is that of noxious leather smell alone, and, second, a rhematization that presupposes and entails an iconic link between those noxious qualia and the qualia of Buraku people. At the same time that the iconic link between Buraku and leather relies upon Hideki’s interpretation of leather smell as noxious, it also allows for that interpretation. The downshifting from an indexical to an iconic relation makes this interpretation possible, even as it is motivated by it (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1463499613483397">Silverstein 1993</xref>: 53ff). Note, though, that even as the iconic link between Buraku people and leather via olfactory qualia is presumed by and provocative of Hideki’s varied interpretations, this rhematized linkage also provides him with a line of retreat, should that position come under attack. He is able to ‘upshift’ semiotically, that is, argue against his own interpretations, perhaps backpedaling against the qualisign to offer a counter explanation: ‘It’s not the Buraku I dislike but their smell.’ This possibility raises the questions to which I now turn: namely, under what conditions might stink and identity become distinguishable, or under what conditions might they be so sutured as to be impossible to separate?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1463499613483397">6</xref></sup> And how, in the process, might such sensory experiences circulate?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1463499613483397"><title>From hearsay to fact: The territorialization of an ecology</title>
<p>These links between Buraku people and leather, mediated by qualia of smell, circulate beyond Hideki’s and Nakajo-san’s accounts, serving as the basis for judgments about types of people and prompting the question of the evidentiary status that these links gain in that circulation. The stories of Nakajo-san and Hideki are stories of hearsay, constitutive in their circulation of something we might want to call a ‘hearsay public’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1463499613483397">Yeh 2010</xref>). One might hear: ‘I’ve never been to a leather factory, but I’ve heard they smell. I’ve never met a Buraku person, but I hear that…’. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1463499613483397">Paz (2009)</xref>, drawing on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1463499613483397">Kockelman (2004)</xref>, has argued, rumor or gossip has the function of simultaneously indexing ‘an earlier communicative event as the source’ at the same time that it exhibits ‘a limited degree of commitment to the validity of the knowledge thus characterized’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1463499613483397">Paz 2009</xref>: 136). Such stipulations are explicitly encoded in Japanese grammar, with options to indicate the degree of commitment to validity. Appending <italic>sou da</italic> to the end of a sentence indicates that the preceding information was heard secondhand but suggests the original source might be identifiable. Appending <italic>rashii</italic> to the end of a sentence, however, conveys a more ambiguous sense of validity. The information is secondhand but is more of an impression than something necessarily or actually heard. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1463499613483397">Yeh argues (2010)</xref>, a hearsay public operates through a logic of circulation distinct from that of the bourgeois public sphere, based on different claims to evidence and authority.</p>
<p>This hearsay public is one channel by which the stigma of Buraku people and smells circulate and come to the form of effectiveness apparent in Hideki’s conflicted anecdote, linking in an iconic embrace types of smell and types of people, mediated by qualia of repugnance, permanence, and contagion. However, since the mid 1970s, this ecology of sensibility has undergone a shift in its territorialization with which the impact and force of these hearsay stories has transformed and expanded. Over the past three decades, legal changes in Japan have laid the foundation for a different institutional site – the private detective industry – to reconfigure the epistemic register of such stories from hearsay to fact. This reterritorialization dramatically transforms the authorial backing and social force of these stories. Over the next several paragraphs, I examine how sensibilities of disgust travel across these different epistemic registers and the role of the private detective industry in mediating this movement and its effects.</p>
<p>The private detective industry in Japan offers background checks of individuals for anyone willing and able to pay the large sums of money required. Although illegal in some parts of Japan, background checks are commissioned with great frequency. According to a 2003 survey conducted by the premier Buraku political organization, the Buraku Libeation League (an organization that takes these checks as evidence of entrenched anti-Buraku prejudice), background checks of potential marriage partners are the primary source of business for private detective agencies nation-wide (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1463499613483397">Morii 2003</xref>). This same survey reveals that the people requesting background checks are typically not the fiancé(e) him or herself but rather concerned parents or grandparents who want to know what kind of family is joining with theirs, what kind of person is coming into their familial body (<italic>miuchi</italic>). Like Hideki, these people are worried about Buraku stigma and about the possibility of infiltration and contagion. However, their worries are of a mode very different from that of the wafting smell; clients of private detectives are worried that, via marriage, they or the future progeny of their family might eventually be taken as Buraku. If the background check reveals that the potential partner is from a Buraku family, that information can be sufficient for parents or grandparents, particularly the kind who would and can pay for background checks in the first place, to oppose the marriage.</p>
<p>Prior to 1976, the involvement of private detectives in marriage or employment decisions was much less common than it is currently. In 1976, in part due to pressure from the Buraku political movement, there was a legal change to proscribe private use of official state family registries providing information about a person’s genealogy. With this change, individuals – be they potential employers or marriage partners – could no longer easily obtain background information on other individuals from ward or city offices. Although it too lost easy access to such records, the private detective industry benefitted from this legal restriction. Private detectives became the recipients of inquiries previously channelled through individual initiative and the state. With this shift, detectives then achieved a greater authority, vis-à-vis their clients and the Buraku Liberation League, to decide who was and who was not Buraku.</p>
<p>What, though, are those standards – how do private detectives determine who is and who is not Buraku? According to the director of the National Investigators’ Network, Takeuchi, prior to 1976 standard practice in determining whether someone is Buraku was based on a rule of hypodescent, spanning back five generations, which could potentially be done with access to a family registry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1463499613483397">Kadooka 2005</xref>). If a person was provably even 1/32 Buraku, he or she was Buraku. However, again according to Takeuchi, the 1976 legal change made a five-generation search nigh impossible. It was quickly truncated to a three-generation standard, based on a person’s address and research into their grandparents. That too grew cumbersome. According to a private detective interviewed in 2004, the standard practice now is only one generation: ‘We define a Buraku person as anyone having at least one parent who is Buraku’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1463499613483397">Kadooka 2005</xref>). However, as reliance on genealogical material dwindled, a different reliance – one on space – burgeoned. This same detective went on to say, ‘The easiest way to figure out someone’s background is to look at the <italic>tsurigaki</italic> (genealogy). Barring access to that, you can usually find out if you have that person’s home address – go there and simply ask people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1463499613483397">Kadooka 2005</xref>). The 1976 legislative change had effectively barred that access to a person’s <italic>tsurigaki.</italic> Or, it at least required personal contacts with state bureaucrats willing to divulge restricted information in exchange for money or other potential favors. In either case, the <italic>tsurigaki</italic> has become more difficult for private detectives to access, and the ways in which they acquire information have shifted as a result. Instead of visiting ward offices to obtain family registries, private detectives now visit a person’s residential neighborhood and the surrounding areas to see how residents and neighbors talk about the region. The evidentiary shift indexes a shift in practices. They now, as the detective quoted above suggests, ‘go there and simply ask’.</p>
<p>It is there, while gum-shoeing their way through people’s neighborhoods, that private detectives search for and encounter the types of hearsay stories – with their attendant layers of affective, energetic, and representational interpretants – that motivated Hideki’s interaction with me. Buraku issues in Japan are frequently taboo; outside overtly Buraku political gatherings, the issues tend to be skirted. Even the euphemistic word ‘Buraku’ tends to be spoken in public, if it is spoken at all, in hushed whispers and with furtive glances around to see who is listening. At the same time, the sense that one should not express disgust with Buraku people, a sense evinced by Hideki’s closing remarks of self-censure, is taking root, however tenuous, beyond ‘places like the Japan Foundation’. In combination, the social taboo and the rising value of public liberal tolerance make it difficult for people to comment publicly on whether an area might be Buraku, particularly to strangers – e.g. the inquisitive detective – whose very presence invokes a sense of publicity. This is where rhematized linkages to such qualia as the malodorous gain in explanatory traction. One can speak publicly, with strangers, of a neighborhood’s offensive smell without overtly triggering social taboos or political injunctions against mentioning or deprecating Buraku people. Or rather, one need only to indicate a direction and produce appropriate signs of visceral disgust. Herein lies Hideki’s potential line of retreat: ‘It is not Buraku people I dislike but their smell.’ However, even further, such a de-suturing move need not be one of intentional strategizing. Rather, a sensibility of disgust at types of smell can stand in as a covert interpretive repertoire through which people, knowingly or not, may express disapproval of Buraku people.</p>
<p>An example from a distant context makes this point clearly. In 1932 Hortense Powdermaker, a white anthropologist at the time recently appointed at the Yale Institute of Human Relations, was casting about for a new project following the completion of her PhD. A mentor and the director of the Yale Institute, Edward Sapir, encouraged her to study issues in the United States. Even more than it remains today, this suggestion was unorthodox. The typical object of study for anthropologists at the time was overwhelmingly populations outside of Western modernity, be they native groups of the Americas that scholars like Sapir specialized in, or small-scale societies on islands of Melanesia that scholars such as Bronislav Malinowski, Powdermaker’s PhD advisor at the London School of Economics, studied. Powdermaker, though, found herself intrigued by Sapir’s suggestion, realizing in herself a longstanding interest in issues of race in the United States. She went on to conduct field research on black and white race relations in Indianola, Mississippi. In her final work, <italic>Stranger and Friend: The Way of the Anthropologist</italic>, Powdermaker reflects that growing up in a German Jewish home in Baltimore in the first decades of the century had instilled in her a nascent interest in the subject of race in the United States, and that she ‘must have been thinking, consciously and unconsciously, for a long time about this type of research problem’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1463499613483397">Powdermaker 1966</xref>: 132). She relates one moment from her youth that was formative of her understanding of race:<disp-quote>
<p>I was coming home on a streetcar late one hot August afternoon from the playground where I taught during some summer vacations while a college student. White and Negro men who had obviously been digging and working in the sun boarded the car. They were all dirty and sweaty. The car was crowded and people had to stand close to each other. A white woman standing by me complained of the smell of the Negroes; they did smell. I wondered about the white workers and moved next to them; they smelled, too. The blue cotton uniform which I wore as a playground teacher was wet with perspiration from my strenuous day. I then became aware that I smelled. The streetcar incident stood out as a discovery. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1463499613483397">Powdermaker 1966</xref>: 132)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Powdermaker’s discovery was one of olfactory markedness. The streetcar was awash with bodily smells. However, only ‘Negroes’ were associated with the odor. The other white woman only marked, and felt comfortable remarking on, the smell of the black passengers. Powdermaker, along with the other white woman, recognized immediately that the black passengers smelled; it took detective work on her part, however – in the form of wonder, olfactory sleuthing, and a reorganization of her sensual awareness – to understand that white people, herself included, smelled as well. It took work for her to shift the types of demands placed on qualities of smell. Before that detective work was done, Powdermaker’s selective sensual engagement with the smells of the black passengers felt natural and perhaps innocuous. Her white companion might dodge critiques of racism by asserting that she was simply stating a fact. Smell here functions as a covert interpretive repertoire, comprising affective (a feeling of disgust), energetic (a drawing back from the source of the perceived smell), and representational (a racialized frame through which such a reaction is justified) interpretants, that opens a path for white people in Powdermaker’s example to maintain racial boundaries without appearing overtly racist.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1463499613483397">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Though miles and years apart, there is a similar phenomenon at work in the Buraku case. The rhematized link between a Buraku person and the smell of leather allows people in the neighborhoods visited by private detectives to insinuate that a particular area or group of people is Buraku without mentioning that word. Instead, they only need to evince their disgust in the face of a presumed foul odor, independent of whether that area or group of people actually smells. While Powdermaker’s sleuthing skills revealed an olfactory markedness of a group of people also visibly marked, the sleuthing of the private detectives relies on such olfactory markedness to mark a group that otherwise is invisible.</p>
<p>When I returned home from my first day of work at the tannery, I removed my dirty work clothes, bathed, and put on a second set of clean work clothes before heading over to Nakajo-san’s apartment. Seeing me in my work clothes, he made a show of making a big fuss about me smelling bad and told me that we would both have to go to the public bath before he would let me into his home for dinner. Leather smell was not ‘objectively’ present, but the signs of Buraku association – having come from a Buraku neighborhood, clad in clothes appropriate to a tannery – laid the grounds for an anticipation so strong as to be preemptively offended. I encountered similar sensibilities from a man who owned a coffee house in downtown Tokyo and who had grown up in a neighborhood next to a tanning district in Osaka. While talking, he conveyed to me not only memories of foul odors of his youth but also the fetor of the area that he encounters still on his trips home, 20 years since the last tannery closed its doors. The Buraku case here, alongside the Powdermaker example and others, makes clear that the sensibility of a foul odor is so firmly laminated onto other signs of Buraku that any one of those signs has the potential to invoke the others, crosscutting any clear division among modes of sensibility. My work clothes, though clean, were enough to turn Nakajo-san’s stomach in anticipation of a foul smell. There is a dense analogic bundling of sensibility that constitutes the ecology of Buraku stigma.</p>
<p>It is these stories that the private detectives encounter when they ‘go there and simply ask people’. As both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1463499613483397">Kadooka’s work (2005)</xref> and Nakajo-san’s comments attest, neighbors will evince disgust in response to putrid smells wafting from nearby neighborhoods, either commenting on that disgust or enacting it for detectives. They thereby reference indirectly the presence of Buraku stigma, independent of whether those smells actually exist. In the hands of the private detectives, these hearsay stories about Buraku areas, smells, and people find a new form of authority. Transferred from their ‘hearsay publics’ into the reports by private detectives, and delivered to customers, these stories of disgust and revulsion are relieved of the ‘limited degree of commitment’ characteristic of rumor. Instead, they are denuded of the epistemic markers of <italic>sou da</italic> or <italic>rashii</italic> and are transformed into representational sensibilities and presented as fact – so-and-so person is Buraku. Entextualized in reports, these facts have the capacity to circulate according to the pressures of the private detective industry, eventually making their way to be recontextualized by anxious clients and regaining the capacity to muster repugnance and avoidance. In this process, the particular qualia of leather – its disgustingness, its promiscuity, and its tenacious contagion – achieve a different effective authority and circulatory range.</p>
<p>With the entry of the private detective industry into these hearsay publics, and with their utilization of sensibilities like Hideki’s or Nakajo-san’s, the rhematized relation between type of smell and type of person finds a broader staying power to break marriages, prevent employment, and mobilize a political movement in response. It provides a conduit through which stigma can circulate, tacking across different modes of sensibility – from affective disgust to representational fact and back – in the process. Territorialized across actors like Hideki, the Buraku political movement, and anxious potential marriage partners or employers, the ecology of Buraku stigma resides in this tension internal to these epistemic logics and forms of sensibility.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1463499613483397" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The ways in which Buraku stigma circulates and comes to effect have transformed over the past 30 years. Stigmatized industries have left Japan, instead being displaced to China and India where labor costs are cheaper and environmental standards less stringent. At the same time, the Buraku political movement has achieved unprecedented success on an international level, gaining international recognition of Buraku issues in an attempt to foment pressure on the Japanese government to enact anti-discrimination legislation. With these transformations, the political movement is under greater pressure to produce recognizable evidence of a stigmatized Buraku minority, even as that constituency is becoming less interested in and less capable of identifying itself as Buraku. The objects that serve as evidence of a Buraku identity have changed, as has the distribution of the knowledge required to understand those objects as signs of stigma and to link them to categories of people. Many people whose ancestors might once have worked in stigmatized industries have no conception of themselves as stigmatized.</p>
<p>This essay has been but one slice into this larger process of change. I have endeavored to show how, even in the midst of this transformation, Buraku stigma continues to have the force to differentiate forms of life among Japanese citizens. Buraku stigma circulates not in any simple process of production, transmission, and reception; nor is it limited to travel along lines of occupation, space, and kinship alone. Instead, it is made and remade relevant in relation to particular actors and contexts. The relationship between these actors and contexts and stigma is mutually constitutive: as stigma becomes sensible in particular qualia, it delivers identifiable demands both to types of people as well as to qualities of stigma. In the case I examine, these demands arrive in relation to the capacities of olfaction and the qualities of scent that cross-cut any clear delineations of occupation or space. As the Hideki example attests, this process of making stigma relevant, i.e. the process of <italic>contextualizing</italic> stigma (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1463499613483397">Bauman and Briggs 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1463499613483397">Gal 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1463499613483397">Silverstein 2003</xref>), occurs across a variety of modes of sensibility, bundled together in an ecology that is territorialized through individual and collective actors as well as qualities of materiality. Qualitative experiences take shape in the midst of these demands, even as the particular qualities of leather give shape to those demands and to broader social and political concerns.</p>
<p>In contradistinction to the interpretation of leather smell offered by the radio advertisement at the beginning of this piece, leather smell as a sign of stigma perdures, threatening contagion and contamination across boundaries. The threat of this smell, initially caught up in circulatory logics of hearsay, itself becomes converted into something more permanent. Catching hold of these affectively and energetically charged stories of malodorous stigma, the private detective industry converts the ephemerality of hearsay into the permanence of expert opinion, mediating among modes of sensibility available in response to leather smell and altering the mapping of the Buraku category of person. Taken up by private detectives, the threat of sensibilities like those of Nakajo-san or Hideki become that much more abiding, and that much more contrasting with the short-lived pleasures of a luxurious bottled leather aroma. In the process, these sensibilities gain a further power to shape the risks and possibilities of being Buraku.</p>
