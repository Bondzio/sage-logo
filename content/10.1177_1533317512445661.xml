<bold>Scope:</bold> The aim of the American Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease and Other Dementias (AJADD) is to publish clinically useful, up-to-date research on dementia for healthcare professionals. The scope of the journal also includes reviews and studies of clinically important topics relating to dementia care and management. All manuscripts must be previously unpublished. Submitted work may focus on patient care, management or research. We encourage adherence to the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.icmje.com">www.icmje.com</ext-link>.</p>
<p>
<bold>Manuscript Format</bold>: All manuscripts, figures and tables must be original work, submitted electronically in standard word processing format. Manuscripts should be submitted to http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/ajad. Manuscripts will be sent out anonymously for editorial evaluation. Authors will be required to set up an online account on the SageTrack system powered by ScholarOne. Files should be submitted in Microsoft Word and should include the following elements: complete author names, author contact information, author credentials and affiliations, acknowledgments, abstract (150 words or less), keywords, references, tables, illustrations, and legends. The format and style of the manuscript should follow the guidelines of the AMA (10th ed.).</p>
<p>
<bold>Cover letter</bold>: All manuscripts should be accompanied by a cover letter stating the topic subtype of manuscript (care, management or research). Conflicts of interest, financial and other, should be listed. If there are none, this should be stated. The number of figures and tables should be listed. A statement indicating that all authors have read the final manuscript draft and approve it for submission should be included.</p>
<p>All funding sources supporting the work should be acknowledged on the title page. Word counts (abstract and text) should be listed. The corresponding author should be listed with his/her address, phone, fax and email number. Contact information for reprint requests should also be listed on the cover page. If the work has been previously presented in abstract format, the name, address and date of the meeting should be listed.</p>
<p>If the authors request specific reviewers or would like us to avoid particular reviewers, they should be listed. If the topic of the manuscript is unusual or highly technical, it is requested that the author provide the names of at least two reviewers. Examples include manuscripts on rare, nonvascular/degenerative dementias, unusual treatment/management strategies, highly technical laboratory based research or diagnostic tests that are novel.</p>
<p>
<bold>Title Page</bold>: The title should not be longer than 96 character in length including spaces, punctuation and subtitle. The full names or initials, highest academic degrees, institutional affiliations (including the city and state) for each author should be included.</p>
<p>Include a section titled “Disclosure” on the title page. This section must include each financial or non financial disclosures for each author. This must be consistent with disclosures made on the Authorship and co-author Disclosure forms (see Disclosure policy). If there are no disclosures, the corresponding author is responsible for including the following statement on the title page: “Disclosure: The authors have reported no conflicts of interest.”</p>
<p>
<bold>Abstracts:</bold> Abstracts should be 150 words or less, and should summarize key points and conclusions. For research articles, the background/rationale, methods, and results and conclusions should be summarized. Six to eight key words should be listed at the end of the abstract.</p>
<p>
<bold>Content:</bold> Research articles should include an introduction, methods, results and discussion sections. There is no formal word limitation, however, manuscripts over 4500 words are discouraged.</p>
<p>
<bold>Figures and Tables</bold>: All figures and tables should be titled and numbered Tables should be placed at the end of the file, following text and references, with callouts for each in the text. Elements in tables should be separated by tabs, not cells or lines. High-resolution figures should be uploaded as separate electronic files, with callouts for each in the text. Acceptable file formats for figures include TIFF, EPS, and JPEG, and PDF Microsoft Application Files are acceptable for vector art (line art). (Please do not send glossies).</p>
<p>
<bold>Manuscript Review:</bold> AJADD is a peer-reviewed journal and submitted work usually reviewed by at least two members of our editorial board. The editorial process takes several weeks. If a rapid publication track is desired, it should be stated in the cover letter. Only about half of our manuscripts are accepted. The decision of the editor regarding acceptance or rejection is final.</p>
<p>Our editorial staff reserves the right to make editorial revisions which will be reviewed by the authors in the page proofs prior to publication.</p>
<p>
<bold>References:</bold> Authors are responsible for correctness and completeness of references. References should be typed double-spaced on a separate sheet of paper. They must be numbered consecutively in the order in which they appear in the text by superscript Arabic numerals. References should not include any unpublished observations or personal communications. References should be typed in the style adopted by the American Medical Association, listing up to 6 authors. For example, a standard journal article: Schoni, MH, Casaulta-Aebischer C. Nutrition and lung function in cystic fibrosis patients: review. <italic>Clin Nutr</italic>. 2000;19:79-85.</p>
<p>
<bold>Acknowledgements:</bold> An acknowledgement page at the end of the manuscript may be used to list nonfunding agencies or individuals to be acknowledged. These individuals and agencies should not be acknowledged without their consent.</p>
<p>
<bold>Miscellaneous</bold>: AJADD requires authors to disclose all commercial associations or conflicts that pose a conflict of interest (or perceived conflict of interest) in connection with their submitted manuscripts.</p>
<p>Authors submitting manuscripts to the journal should not simultaneously submit them to another journal, nor should manuscripts have been published elsewhere in substantially similar form or with substantially similar content. Authors in doubt about what constitutes prior publication should consult the editor.</p>
