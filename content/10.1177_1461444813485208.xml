<p>Over the last decade, the interdisciplinary area of “critical information studies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461444813485208">Vaidhyanathan, 2004</xref>) has evolved substantially. At the dawn of the digital millennium, much of this work consisted of asking big-picture questions about copyright and society. In recent years, though, more of the work has focused on specific questions, and while much of it is still done in law schools, it has also drawn in scholars and methods from economics, political science, anthropology, and history. These researchers have greatly expanded our understanding of how creative works circulate, even as practices change with remarkable speed. Two of the more recent volumes in the field are welcome entrants filling valuable niches.</p>
<p>In <italic>Reclaiming Fair Use</italic>, Patricia Aufderheide and Peter Jaszi<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1461444813485208">1</xref></sup> fuse careful legal scholarship with accessible writing, useful advice, and fuel for a growing movement. Roughly the first half of the book recounts the history of copyright law, especially the shifting, contested interpretations over the past several decades. These chapters are a remarkably good scholarly reading of the legal history, yet the whole book – filled with vignettes and discussion questions – is accessible to non-lawyers such as undergraduates, high school students, and user communities. The rest of the book is a roadmap for how to use fair use. It recounts how user communities, starting with documentary filmmakers, created space for fair use by creating legally-vetted codes of best practices – a process the authors have helped lead. The authors also give a useful roadmap for how to make real use of fair use.</p>
<p>The most important message of <italic>Reclaiming Fair Use</italic> is that the limitations and exceptions that exist in copyright law right now are important, valuable, and often more than adequate for transformative uses of existing cultural works. While acknowledging that copyright law still needs some reforms (144–146), it delivers a persuasive message that, in the main, we need to make better use of the rights we already have. They argue that “copyright has for far too long been a lawyer’s preserve, and that copyright decisions, particularly about reuse of others’ copyrighted work, can and must be made by creators if we are to get the best culture we can” (xiii).</p>
<p>Chapter 2 kicks off a singularly compact, accessible summary of copyright, including a selective but solid history of important statutes and cases. This chapter explores what fair use is and where it came from, while also exploring how copyright has generally gotten longer and stronger. Chapters 3 through 6 offer a fantastic recap of the evolution in the case law and broader thinking about fair use. This story begins with the mid-century shift toward thinking about copyright giving “the copyright owner … more or less complete sovereignty over uses that are more than trivial in quantity or quality” (35), as well as the turn toward an economic perspective in the legal academy. It also visits the clash between copyright-as-property industry lobbyists on one side and free culture activists on the other – including the who-needs-copyright crowd (exemplified by John Perry Barlow) and advocates of creating a copyright-lite zone via alternative licensing (such as Lawrence Lessig and Cory Doctorow). The authors argue that in this clash, the perceived value of fair use was diminished; the industry wanted the public to believe that it rarely applied, and reformers’ horror stories strengthened this perception. Chapter 5, however, proclaims that in the last few years fair use has been resurgent, becoming genuinely useful thanks to user communities willing to use it, as well as a shift in public discourse. Chapter 6 illustrates how judges have repeatedly recognized transformative uses – uses that add something valuable back to the culture – as fair. I particularly appreciate the eloquent discussion of the circularity of the argument that potential licensing means a given use is not fair (82), as well as the brief exploration of the major exception in the trend toward support for transformative uses, which is musical sampling (90–93).</p>
<p>The remaining chapters are about building a safe space for fair use on the ground – how it happened for documentary filmmakers and other communities, how to use fair use, and how to think about this in other countries. The story of documentary filmmakers’ code of best practices is probably somewhat familiar to many readers, but Chapter 7’s rich detail is not to be missed. In particular, scholars should learn from filmmakers’ experiences with risk-averse gatekeepers. When filmmakers contended they should leave copyright questions to broadcasters, lawyers, and insurers, “Peter [Jaszi] would explain, ‘Your gatekeepers don’t really care if you make a pretty good film or a great one. You do’” (97). The same is true for publishers’ and administrators’ relative indifference to the distinction between good and great scholarship or teaching.</p>
<p>While uniquely valuable, <italic>Reclaiming Fair Use</italic> will not satisfy everyone. It contains some minor oversimplifications of complicated legal matters. For instance, the authors write, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) “requires Internet service providers [ISPs] like Verizon and YouTube to take down works that copyright holders claim infringe on their copyright” (3). As they surely know, this is not, strictly speaking, true – the law offers immunity from suit if ISPs comply with this and other conditions – but the effect is nearly the same as a mandate. The same is true of the authors’ claim that Creative Commons (CC) “licenses forbid the use of digital rights management (DRM)” (12), which would prevent commercial home video distribution of CC-licensed films. More precisely, CC licenses forbid DRM that prevents uses that would be authorized under the license, so some light DRM may be permitted. Still, as with the DMCA example, the effect is nearly the same as a categorical requirement.</p>
<p>The book plays down proposals for reform, generally singing the praises of the status quo and even eliding some clear issues – doing so to better focus on how to use current law. For instance, while supporting DMCA reform (144–146), the authors encourage readers to participate in the law’s triennial hearings, by which one can win exemptions to the DMCA’s ban on circumventing DRM (75–77). Some will find the tone here too positive. The exemption process is a clear example of prior restraint of speech, administered by the industry-friendly Copyright Office. Further, it provides no mechanism for legalizing the tools of circumvention. Still, these DMCA exemptions are hard-won and potentially useful for those who, like the media studies scholars led by Peter Decherney,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1461444813485208">2</xref></sup> spend the substantial time required. The authors are even right that the 2006 ruling in favor of Decherney “was a remarkable precedent” (76). Especially relative to the 2000 and 2003 rulemakings, which were practically a catch-22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461444813485208">Herman and Gandy, 2006</xref>), the later rounds have been good news indeed.</p>
<p>Aufderheide and Jaszi make just four policy recommendations: a fix for the problem of orphan works, no more copyright term extensions, DMCA reform, and a sharp reduction in statutory damages (144–147). This is a good beginning to a list that could, without much additional space, contain more important examples. These might include a return to some kind of copyright formalities such as notice, registration, and renewal (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461444813485208">Lessig, 2001</xref>: 251–252; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461444813485208">Patry, 2011</xref>: ch. 9), as well as real punishments for abusive or sloppy copyright threats and takedown requests. Many are also increasingly concerned about the underhanded process of using international agreements, negotiated in secret, to force the hands of domestic legislators, a process of “policy laundering” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461444813485208">Hosein, 2004</xref>: 189; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461444813485208">Yu, 2011</xref>: 1024–1028). While no brief list would sate all critics, the authors’ list still seems a bit too brief, even in this context. In terms of readability, it would also be helpful to allude to these policy recommendations at earlier points in the book, such as the discussion of the DMCA triennial hearings.</p>
<p>Another, slightly larger concern is the book’s understandable but regrettable false equivocation between the two sides in the debate, such as the contention that the “clash of … two extreme agendas effectively sidelined the concept of balance in copyright law” (47). While there is room to critique some of the members and policy positions of what I call the strong fair use (SFU) coalition, most copyright reformers have spent the last decade advancing a fairly modest agenda – and one largely targeted at preventing the further expansion of copyright. This is true of non-government organizations like Public Knowledge and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, as well as most allied stakeholder groups, industry groups, and public intellectuals. The proposals in <italic>Reclaiming Fair Use</italic> are actually representative examples of the broader SFU community’s policy agenda. In sharp contrast, when members of what I call the strong copyright (SC) coalition advance policy proposals, they are often quite extreme, on points both substantive (e.g. efforts to ensure that users and websites who are merely accused of infringement are scrubbed from the internet) and procedural (e.g. efforts to reduce public input into domestic and international copyright negotiations). While I respect the decision to skate over this difference in a book intended to be empowering and relatively non-controversial, these coalitions are really not equally guilty of extremism.</p>
<p>The other book is a fine volume of pure scholarship. In <italic>Pop Song Piracy</italic>, Barry Kernfeld’s passion for the history of American music leaps off the page. He retraces the last eight decades of the unauthorized distribution of music, from the illicit distribution of song lyrics and sheet music to peer-to-peer trading. The book is a highly readable, meticulously researched, detailed history, and it will speak to anyone interested in the history of music, the circulation of popular culture, and the tension between law and the demand for entertainment.</p>
<p>Kernfeld has a compelling, albeit familiar thesis: “Famous musicians and powerful music corporations want to maintain a monopoly over the songs they control and to prevent others from distributing their songs without paying for the privilege” (2). He might also add that, sometimes, it is government seeking monopolistic control over the distribution of music, with cultural or political rather than economic aims. “This struggle takes different forms, but in the end has the same result. The monopolists give in” (2). Either the monopolists give in and assimilate the forbidden practice into the legitimate economy, or the medium that was the source of the contest becomes obsolete. In era after era, this proves true – at least until the present time, during which the conflict between authorized and unauthorized internet distribution shows “no prospect for resolution” (200), providing an important caveat if not a devastating blow to the broader thesis.</p>
<p>The study is aimed at instances of what the author calls “transformational use, whereby some creative person, thinking … and … operating outside of [the corporate] box, comes up with a song product that in some respect offers a new way to appreciate music” (4). This is <italic>not</italic> the same standard for transformational use that is in the case law around fair use, as described in <italic>Reclaiming Fair Use</italic>. Rather, the transformation Kernfeld describes concerns the arrangement, reproduction, or distribution of works. <italic>Pop Song Piracy</italic> is about attempts to satisfy an otherwise unmet need, ranging from magazines that contain the lyrics of many popular songs, to the ability to acquire songs online. This is distinct from unauthorized products that are merely equivalent – an unauthorized substitution that is otherwise almost exactly the same as the authorized one. Innovators create a samizdat product that satisfies a demand that is not available in the licensed market, demonstrating its value and pushing official producers to reevaluate their strategy. As long as the contested medium remains relevant, official producers will generally create authorized versions that attempt to coopt the market for the transformative product.</p>
<p>Part I explores the piracy of printed music, and here the author’s unique research really sets the book apart. After the first chapter’s brief description of the distribution system that characterized the Tin Pan Alley era, the second and third chapters offer a rich retelling of the long-forgotten history of bootleg song sheets. Whereas the official distribution channels focused on sheet music, complete with musical notation, there was an unmet desire among the public for sheets containing the lyrics of several popular songs – without the musical notation. “These compilations of lyrics have a centuries-old history in England and a long history as well in America, where they often convey a political agenda” (26), but the song sheets with popular song lyrics were commercial products for the enjoyment of the public. The songwriters tried using enforcement to stop the circulation of this product, which was far more cost effective than the full sheet music for each song, but it was mostly a failed effort – that is, until magazines with licensed copies of song lyrics appeared, coopting the bootleggers’ market. By 1944, “music publishers were earning approximately $600,000 annually in licensing fees from legalized song sheets” (51). He also explores the contents of song sheets as well as how they were used; along the way, readers learn a good bit about the musical tastes and habits of consumers in the prewar era.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter explores the history of pop song fake books, or compilations of brief musical summaries of popular songs designed for working musicians. Starting in 1949, bootleggers began providing fake books with abbreviated versions of up to a thousand popular songs each. One can imagine how valuable such a resource would be for working musicians who performed in settings such as night clubs. As in the story of song sheets, enforcement efforts failed for years until music publishers gave up and began releasing authorized pop song fake books in the 1970s. Chapter 4 also explores unauthorized copies of sheet music, such as those used by churches and educators, though these get less attention since they are a substitution rather than a transformational product.</p>
<p>Many of the remaining battles against unauthorized distribution may be more familiar. Kernfeld considers pirate radio, especially in European countries with government monopolies (Ch. 5), unauthorized phonograph duplication (Ch. 6), illegal tape copying (Ch. 7), the trade in bootleg recordings of live performances (Ch. 8), CD copying (Ch. 9), and internet distribution (Ch. 10). Even though he is plowing more well-known areas in these chapters, the author continues to provide valuable insights. I particularly appreciated the technical background on tape duplication in Chapter 7. In Chapter 8, the author’s personal examples of irreplaceable poetry and jazz recordings that would be ripe for bootleg distribution – and that sit, unduplicated, in private hands – will break many readers’ hearts. While the most unique achievement of <italic>Pop Song Piracy</italic> is in Part I, the book is compelling throughout.</p>
<p>As with <italic>Reclaiming Fair Use</italic>, my critique of Kernfeld’s book is a mere quibble next to the high praise it deserves. Mostly, my complaints boil down to my own pet issues and examples not being covered with the depth that I would have chosen. I would have liked to see a bit more about DJ mixes, as well as unauthorized remixes of popular songs on white label records. He also could have discussed the large number of groups that have followed the Grateful Dead in allowing noncommercial concert recordings. Further, it was surprising to find no mention of the Audio Home Recording Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461444813485208"><italic>Audio Home Recording Act</italic>, 1992</xref>) and the resulting commercial failure of consumer digital audio tape systems. Kernfeld also might have explored the unauthorized online distribution of guitar tabulations, which is for 21st-century guitarists what bootleg song sheets were for prewar hobbyist singers. No book can cover everything, of course, and none of these omitted topics are essential.</p>
<p>Overall, both <italic>Pop Song Piracy</italic> and <italic>Reclaiming Fair Use</italic> are important contributions and great reads. Anybody with an interest in the cultural, economic, or legal significance of the circulation of copyrighted works will quickly appreciate Kernfeld’s book. <italic>Reclaiming Fair Use</italic> should be even more widely read. Not only have Aufderheide and Jaszi given us a detailed, insightful, updated history of the politics of copyright, they have also provided a road map for the fair use of copyrighted works. For this reason, virtually everybody who produces information goods – for a living, or for fun – should read it.</p>

<p>Readers should know that I am quite partial to both of these scholars. As is often the case with more established scholars who are generous with their time, they have both provided me with feedback on my scholarship. I have even worked with Aufderheide on the research that led to the International Communication Association statement of best practices. Still, as my review shows, I believe our entire discipline and many more thousands of people owe the authors a debt of gratitude for the work that they have done on this issue, and I would feel this way even if I had never met either of the authors.</p>

<p>Decherney’s 2006 proposal for an exemption was co-authored by two University of Pennsylvania colleagues, Katherine Sender and Michael X Delli Carpini – the latter of whom was my PhD adviser. I also filed a written response and appeared in person to support this proposal.</p>
