<p>Cambridge University Press, after completing the publication of the series New Testament Theology (from 1991 till 2003), now publishes the new series Old Testament Theology. Brent A. Strawn and Patrick D. Miller, the two general editors, define its purpose. “Each volume in the series seeks to describe the biblical book’s theology as well as to engage the book theologically – that is, each volume intends to <italic>do</italic> theology through and with the biblical book under discussion, as well as to delineate the theology contained within it” (xvi). The present volume by Moberly on the theology of Genesis is the first volume in the new series.</p>
<p>In his first chapter: “What Is a ‘Theology of Genesis'?,” Moberly takes his stand in this most discussed field of what biblical theology could be: “Only if one can recover a more classic sense of theology, as an attempt to understand everything in the world in relation to God, will one be better placed to start to make sense of the theology of Genesis” (5), and from there he defines what he intends to do: “It is in the meeting of biblical text with canonical context and the ongoing life of communities of faith that theology is done – and where one may hope to try to articulate a theology of Genesis” (17). Moberly’s book has two major parts. Each has the same structure: a general introduction to the section, followed by specific studies on selected texts. Chapters 2–6 of his book study the Prehistory (21–120): “On Reading Genesis 1–11”; “Genesis 1: Picturing the World”; “Genesis 2–3: Adam and Eve and ‘the Fall’”; “Genesis 4: Cain and Abel”; “Genesis 6–9: Cataclysm and Grace”. Chapters 7–12 are on the Patriarchal Stories (121–245): “On Reading Genesis 12–50”; “Genesis 12:1–3: A Key to Interpreting the Old Testament?”; “Genesis 12:3a: A Biblical Basis for Christian Zionism?”; “Genesis 22: Abraham – Model or Monster?”; “Abraham and the ‘Abrahamic Faiths'”; “Genesis 37–50: Is Joseph Wise?” As can be seen from the outline, nearly as much space is given to the first eleven chapters of Genesis as to the nearly forty remaining chapters, as happens often in studies on Genesis.</p>
<p>Moberly opens his first part with some general reflections on how to read Gn 1–11. These chapters are not historical, and Moberly quotes Origen, who already in the third century stated that they are not to be understood “literally.” He spends a whole chapter on this question that seems by now to be accepted by any intelligent reader of these chapters. This shows that Moberly addresses himself not only to his colleagues but also to the general public. He then moves to the different stories covering essentially the whole prehistory. His approach is synchronic, a canonical reading; he often starts from the classical reading of the text and then gives an alternative reading. For instance, the traditional reading of Gn 2–3 as “the Fall” is compared with the positive reading of that story by James Barr. That leads often to long quotations of different authors. After careful reading of the biblical text, Moberly returns generally to the traditional reading but enriched by the new views.</p>
<p>In the general introduction to the patriarchal stories, in which the religious concepts and practices are so different from the Mosaic religion, Moberly summarizes what he published in a previous book entitled <italic>The Old Testament of the Old Testament</italic>, like the fact that Christians have kept the Old Testament even after they had the New Testament. His study of individual questions in the patriarchal stories is very different from that of the prehistory. He only touches upon a few chapters, as can be seen from the outline. Some of the questions he studies may surprise, but are present-day issues, like Christian Zionism (Ch. 9). He always follows the same approach, the classical interpretation is compared with an alternative reading, for instance: Is Abraham a model or a monster in Gn 22?</p>
<p>If one takes the book of Moberly as is, one is impressed by the way he succeeds in reading carefully the biblical texts, by his open mind to different readings of the same text, and by his reading of Scripture as a believer (after all, he is looking for the theology of Genesis). Most chapters of the book count twenty pages and could stand by themselves. In them Moberly frequently repeats what he previously published in books or articles referred to in the footnotes. One could wonder why Moberly touched on some and not other issues; for instance, why not the prayer of Abraham to save Sodom, or the destruction of those cities, which all raise theological questions? His choice of scholars who give opposing readings is obviously personal and therefore questionable; for instance, the discussion on the Joseph story is centered around the study of von Rad. That study had indeed a great impact, but what about some later studies, for instance that by Wénin? The bibliography of Moberly is indeed limited to English studies and a few German, but only if they have an English translation.</p>
<p>Students, or ordinary readers of Genesis, will appreciate Moberly’s book if they take it as a collection of independent studies of which some could have been left out, and others could have been added, but if they look for what the title promises: <italic>The Theology of the Book of Genesis</italic>, I wonder if they will be satisfied. The book presents theological issues based on independent stories, but no synthesis is offered. Is there a theology of the whole prehistory? Is there one of the patriarchal stories? Is there a link between these two parts of the same biblical book? Perhaps Moberly does not present one because there is none, but he could at least have discussed that question.</p>
