<abstract>
<p>This article examines the troubling erasure of queer difference (and particularly feminist and lesbian difference) in the seemingly benign and inclusive depiction of gay parents and gay kids. Focusing on the hit film about a family headed by two moms – <italic>The Kids Are All Right</italic> – I wonder what representations of gay kinship push at the boundaries of familial normativity and which ones simply paint the traditional picket fence in rainbow hues? Why are we seemingly so stuck on alternative and diverse families and never get to counterkinship and deep difference? Why can’t gay parents ever get laid (by the same sex they supposedly desire)? Most curiously perhaps, why are most of the parents we see in popular representations (with the exception of <italic>The Kids Are All Right</italic>) male even when the statistics tell us otherwise? Why are all (televisual, cinematic) parents so wonderfully “accepting” of their queer progeny even as we know queer kids are still getting kicked out of their homes in the “real world” of not so hip family life? An examination of contemporary representations in popular television and film reveals a complex combination of newly inclusive and potentially challenging images with tired and dangerous odes to a universalism that reasserts normative heterosexuality and further effaces feminist critiques of hegemonic family formations.</p>

<p>Everywhere you look these days, gays are all in the family. From the neurotic gay dads in TV’s new hit sitcom <italic>Modern Family</italic> to the lackluster lesbian moms in <italic>The Kids are All Right</italic> to the louche but hip gay teens of <italic>Glee</italic> it appears that homos – once relegated to the decidedly unattached netherworld – are now cropping up in all the old familial places. Of course, these family images emerge in the context of an exploding and harshly attenuated queer visibility – in popular culture, in political life, in our courts, in our universities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363460712459311">1</xref></sup> This visibility is – by most reckonings – a predictably narrow one, largely presenting images of deracinated, get-along gays awash in a sea of feel-good heterosexual “acceptance.” And it is endlessly undercut by the persistence – if not ratcheting up – of institutionalized discrimination. Lest we pop the champagne corks too soon, it is crucial to recall the harsh facts: ENDA<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1363460712459311">2</xref></sup> is still languishing in the US Congress, DOMA<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1363460712459311">3</xref></sup> is still the law of the land as are dozens of other state laws, gay teen suicide and homelessness are still disproportionately high, antigay initiatives (such as the Tennessee bill to ban any mention of homosexuality in public schools) are voted in and become law. And these are just a few of the more “official” signs of battles still unwon and animus still unabated.</p>
<p>But changes should not be downplayed either. The trajectory of gay visibility is neither a singular and linear narrative of progress and victory, nor a simple story of no movement at all. The (liberal) celebratory progress narrative may be delusional and dangerous but the (more radical) two-steps back and no steps forward tale is similarly dismissive and short-sighted. Perhaps we can broadly characterize the story this way: the first stage of gay visibility was marked by either absence, coded and subterranean images, or the pathos of abject stereotypes. The second burst on the scene in the late 1980s and early 1990s – spurred by social movements, by Hollywood niche marketing, by commodification, by disease – and brought us (irrevocably I think) out of the dark place of closeted invisibility (and the more suggestive and sometimes thrilling place of reading between the lines) to the highly problematic space of public spectacle. And now, it might be that we are in our third phase: a phase of banal inclusion, normalization, assimilation, everyday unremarkable queerness but also, of course, continued abjection, if not quite as melodramatic or buffoonish as in the past. This new moment is one – crucially – in which many of the “firsts” are firmly in the past. If the 1990s brought us a slew of pioneering innovations (e.g., the first gay kiss on TV, the first gay wedding announcement, the first gay parents in public view, etc.), then what happens to gay representations and – more elliptically – the imagination of gay identities and communities when the quest for simple visibility (that checklist of firsts) is no longer the reigning cultural impetus? More specifically for this particular project, how do images of gay families enter into this new moment? If the <italic>Will and Grace/Ellen/Queer as Folk</italic> zeitgeist of the years running from roughly 1994–2005 brought queerness into the family home largely through the familiar tropes of friendship, coming out, and – to a lesser extent – the politics of community, then this new wave of gay visibility moves in some decidedly different directions.</p>
<p>It is crucial to frame this new queer familialism in a broader context of contemporary discourses about “gayness,” discourses that appear overdetermined by two linked tropes: the same-sex marriage mania and a newly resurgent biological essentialism (the “born with it” or, to quote Lady Gaga, the “born this way” refrain). In other words, these new family images are wrapped up in – and compromised by – the current ideological framework in which gay rights are signified almost completely through the political acquisition of same-sex marriage and the theoretical buy-in of biological immutability. I would argue, further, that gay family images are now emerging as the sanitizing counterpart to gay sexual liberationist images. By and large these images are of churchgoing, nuptial-desiring, station-wagon driving, pet-loving, PTA-attending, suburban dwelling two-parent and child households. In the current mainstream “pro-gay” zeitgeist, gay marriage plus gay parents plus gay genes plus gay soldiers = victory. This media-friendly version of sexual minority inclusion is predicated on an erasure of feminist and queer critiques of gender normativity and the nuclear family.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1363460712459311">4</xref></sup> The mainstream visibility of the unthinkable possibility (gay marriage) hinges on mainstream invisibility of a more unthinkable possibility (feminist, queer families), and helps to bolster the liberal, assimilationist models of “acceptance” and tolerance of queers.</p>
<p>Here I want to briefly examine the troubling erasure of queer difference (and particularly feminist and lesbian difference) in the seemingly benign and inclusive depiction of gay parents and gay kids. Narrowing in on family here now, I wonder what representations of gay kinship push at the boundaries of familial normativity and which ones simply paint the traditional picket fence in rainbow hues? Why are we seemingly so stuck on alternative and diverse families and never get to counterkinship and deep difference? Why can’t gay parents ever get laid (by the same sex they supposedly desire)? Most curiously perhaps, why are most of the parents we see in popular representations (with the exception of <italic>The Kids Are All Right</italic>) male even when the statistics tell us otherwise? Why are all (televisual, cinematic) parents so wonderfully “accepting” of their queer progeny even as we know queer kids are still getting kicked out of their homes in the “real world” of not so hip family life? Perhaps we would do well to queer Tolstoy for a moment: all happy gay families sing show tunes together; every unhappy gay family is unhappy in its own straight way.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1363460712459311"><title>Hate is (not?) a family value</title>
<p>To move now from Tolstoy to a popular bumper sticker (“hate is not a family value”), I want to complicate the easy assumptions behind that obviously erroneous claim and challenge the decidedly unqueer “queer” families on offer in contemporary culture. First, let’s acknowledge that family remains a vexed site, at once the place of continued stigma and rejection and the expansive location for creative new configurations of kinship. Some of us older homos even remember when asking if someone was “family” was a coded – and particularly poignant – way of ascertaining their sexuality. Our grand narrative (“coming out”) is itself situated so deeply in the familial; we come out to friends and co-workers but the source of so much strife and stress (and joy and relief too) has been in the revelation to family members. It is surely no accident that one of the most enduring and active gay rights groups consists of parents (and friends) of lesbians and gays (PFLAG). Both gays with kids and parents of gays get wild applause at Pride parades and the stroller brigades compete with the “I love my gay son” t-shirt wearing mamas for accolades and a warm embrace. Indeed, new genres seem to have popped up in a market ever ready to commercialize sentiment: sperm donor stories, odes to alternative parenting, memoirs of growing up gay (or trans, or bi, or queer, or …).</p>
<p>It has become something of a truism that having a gay son or daughter or parent or sibling is the basic stuff of transformation; our culture is filled with stories of changed hearts and minds following a family revelation. At the same time – and this is what we are beginning now to see in popular culture – gays themselves, more and more, are constructing their own families, whether through donor insemination, surrogacy, or earlier heterosexual marriages and relationships. Yet for all the new family formations and inspiring work of groups like PFLAG, it remains the case that other stories still persist: stories of familial rejection and violence, of kids scared to tell their parents or parents hiding from their kids, of isolation and persistent fear, of homelessness and suicide. However, in the rush to claim victory over homophobia, these stories of familial (and institutional) discrimination have faded in the face of overly-optimistic prognostications and fantasies of a benign new embrace. All too often, contemporary discussions and images of gays and their families (either their families of origin or their own ‘families of choice’) erase the banal and everyday salience of active homophobia and rely fundamentally on a number of troubling assumptions. These include what I call the “fallacy of familiarity”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1363460712459311">5</xref></sup> that imagines a “natural” relationship between knowing a gay person (through family ties, for example) and a substantive and thoroughgoing critique of anti-gay sentiment and heterosexist assumptions. While of course familiarity can breed empathy, it can also breed contempt or, more to the point, can produce a sentiment of individual love (“I love my gay son” or “I love my two moms”)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1363460712459311">6</xref></sup> that may or may not translate into a changed social consciousness. So here I want to ponder the rather conflicted and complicated images of gay families in contemporary culture, particularly in an era where gay marriage is the uber-signifier of gay inclusion and the brass ring of gay rights, an era where “tolerance” is the pinnacle and biological immutability the discursive road most taken.</p>
<p>I think we are seeing primarily three tropes or strategies in contemporary family images (and here I am talking about images of gay <italic>parents</italic> as well as ones of straight parents and gay <italic>kids</italic>) and I want to hone in on how gender and lesbian identity play out in these tropes. First, there is the “universalist” theme that posits gay families as not really so different after all. Second, we have the “still abject adolescent” theme (e.g., <italic>Glee</italic>, news stories on teen suicides, the “It Gets Better” project, etc.) that does at least speak of continued homophobia even as it assures us that progress is most assuredly being made. Last, and perhaps most promising, is the charmingly innovative “hey kids lets make an alternative family!” theme, best illustrated in TV shows like <italic>Modern Family</italic> and <italic>Brothers and Sisters</italic> and mainstream magazines stories on the everyday wonders of brave new families. By and large, though, all of these tropes produce a series of troubling displacements. First, homophobia and indeed heteronormativity as forces to be challenged are pushed aside or downplayed. This is most vividly illustrated in the culturally hegemonic fantasy of completion or the progress narrative promulgated by straight liberal allies like former <italic>New York Times</italic> columnist Frank Rich (and some gays as well), who seem to argue that the battle is over, and that all that remains is to tidy up the marriage laws and tone down school bullying but the world we have won is here now. For most of the representations of contemporary queer families it is as if homophobia is a relic of the past. And, interestingly, homophobia is now wholly located in adolescence: it is youth who experience it and youth who perpetrate it. Families of origin and “the social” writ large (much less the state) get let off the hook. Second, gay difference is itself displaced through a strategy of benign inclusion and tolerance married with universalism. Third, robust feminist reimaginings of kinship and intimacy are decidedly disappeared in the rush to normalize gay families through recognizable gender binaries. And no recent representation is more guilty on this last count than the critically acclaimed film of 2010, <italic>The Kids are All Right</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1363460712459311"><title>California dreamin'</title>
<p><italic>The Kids are All Right</italic> comes with all the appropriate indie credentials as well as the commercial Hollywood bona fides. Directed and co-written by Lisa Cholodenko – known for the lesbian themed indie film <italic>High Art</italic> and herself a lesbian mom – and starring Julianne Moore, Annette Benning, and Mark Ruffalo (all A-list Hollywood celebrities with more than a touch of indie hipster cred), it was poised (like <italic>Brokeback Mountain</italic> before it) to be THE zeitgeist movie on gay families. It was inevitably overburdened as the first mainstream Hollywood film about lesbian moms and their kids. The fact that it featured major stars and garnered critical and popular attention as well as accolades and awards situates it as one of those “symptomatic” texts that exceed their momentary iteration.</p>
<p><italic>The Kids Are All Right</italic> tells the tale of a long-term lesbian couple with two kids whose already frayed relationship is put to the test by the entry into their world of Paul, their sperm donor, who proceeds to bond with the kids and have an affair with Jules, the stay at home “wife” of masculinized workaholic/alcoholic Nic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1363460712459311">7</xref></sup> While acclaimed high and low by the mainstream media and the more Hollywood friendly gay media (e.g., <italic>The Advocate</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1363460712459311">8</xref></sup> it did come in for its share of criticism from the more skeptical blogosphere and academically-based writers. The recurring theme in this more disapproving discourse centered on the affair between Jules and Paul and what it intimated about lesbian life and sexuality. Feminist and queer academic Jack Halberstam, writing in the blog Bullybloggers, summarized many of the critics by claiming that the “… film loads sexual inertia, domestic dowdiness and bourgeois complacency onto the lesbian couple and leaves the sperm donor dad in the enviable position of being free, cool and casually sexual.” (Halberstam 2012). The irony of glam gals Benning and Moore as sexless and dowdy either points to our cultural inability to imagine lesbian passion (that isn’t porn) or our cultural inability to sacrifice hetero star cred at the altar of that passion. In either case, it should go without saying – but I will say it anyway – that as much as I am not the marrying kind I would indeed willingly settle down in miserable (but California sunny) domestic not-bliss with either Annette Benning or Julianne Moore (or, for that matter, the dashing Mark Ruffalo). They are rich, famous, beautiful, and straight: just the way we like our lesbians.</p>
<p>But, to be serious, there is much to concern us here. While the use of gay male porn for Sapphic sex play or the launch of a hetero affair by a putative same-sexer are fairly humdrum and not at all bothersome in some global sense (at least to those of us fairly catholic in our sexual tastes), in the context of the narrative arc of the film they are troublesome to say the least. For example, had they been able to actually use that porn to good effect it might have been an interesting moment in opening up our imaginations about the diversity of sexual iconography. But, like every potential sexual moment between the two women, this one too is shortcircuited. They start … and can’t seem to finish. Every attempt (and there aren’t many) of sexual play between the women fails. Now, true enough, one could see this as a commentary on the perils of long-term coupling: the long-term derails the coupling, or so we are told. But this is not the desultory lack of interest of disaffected dykes, but rather the slapstick inability to maintain even a modicum of romantic gravitas. First – contrary to popular opinion – middle-aged lesbians do in fact have sex, and often with each other. Even middle-aged lesbians with children have sex. Really. Alas, not in Hollywood, even when the lesbians are hetero-pretty Moore and Benning. Paired, of course, with the antidote to this lesbian desert of no-desire (hot, penis-happy, passionate hetero romps, replete with lush Garden-of-Eden fertility imagery), our lesbians suffer not so much from the proverbial bed death but rather its more gruesome second cousin: bed rigor mortis.</p>
<p>Critically, though, this tired phallic narrative (revealed most laughingly when Jules genuflects before Paul’s penis) is framed by an even more retro one that – I would argue – situates the film as more <italic>gender</italic> normative than anything else. Further, the abhorrent gender politics of this film provide the <italic>vehicle</italic> for the equally abhorrent universalizing politics. In other words, the couple becomes recognizable if not sympathetic by trading on one of the most reliably antifeminist tropes of all time: the cold, controlling and hard-drinking working mom from hell. <italic>The Kids Are All Right</italic> re-genders (normatively) what could by all accounts be a queerer (and more feminist) family form. Two women become, in this film, mom and dad, worker and lover, fire and ice, recuperating normative gender roles in a veritable bonanza of binary oppositions.</p>
<p>One critic inadvertently reveals the gender politics of the film when he writes that “As Nic, the more patriarchal half of a same-sex married couple in Lisa Cholodenko’s high-strung comedy <italic>The Kids Are All Right</italic>, she [Benning] wears a short, blunt haircut; drops her voice (she purges the tinkle); and presents to her teenage children, a boy and a girl, a façade of stability, of someone who values structure above all. Nic’s political agenda is unspoken but implicit: that two mothers (the other is Jules, played by Julianne Moore) can create a home that’s every bit as traditional as one with a mother and father” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363460712459311">Edelstein, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>One particular 3-part scene is emblematic of this overweening (and curiously unnecessary) linkage between lesbian sexual failure, assertive masculinity, and maternal comeuppance. This scene of sexual failure is bookended by two others that reveal the ideological intent. Here, then, in the middle scene, Nic is attempting to romance Jules with a candlelit bath and the hint of more to follow. She is solicitous but controlling and slightly hysterical, a mode carried throughout the film. But amour is not to be, as Nic responds to a phone call from a patient and leaves Jules alone in the tub, frustrated and angry. When Jules finally stalks downstairs, she finds Nic pouring herself a glass of wine and conferring with a patient, having seemingly forgotten the romantic interlude she herself initiated. This moment of clichéd romance derailed by “workaholic” (and possibly alcoholic) behavior is preceded by what can only be understood as the “ball transfer” scene. Here, gently macho Paul has bonded with the teenage boy Laser and, in the course of but a few hours, has managed to both diagnose and address Laser’s acquiescence to his obviously brutish best buddy, whose rough and tumble relationship with his own father sparks poor Laser’s desire for daddy action. The mothers – true to form – have been ineffectual in getting Laser to re-evaluate his relationship with the clearly unstable young man but, you know, they don’t have balls so they can’t transfer that power to the son. The ball transfer scene <italic>precedes</italic> the failed lesbian romance scene, which is then followed up by the heterosexual revelation scene. Here, we witness the first kiss between Jules and sperm man Paul where they find themselves in a sweaty embrace after working together in the garden – signifying her “natural/real woman” status and sensual fertility in contradistinction to the unnatural, mannish, sterile Nic. So lesbians fail once again at even the most tired clichés of romance. And they fail because mannish working gal Nic can’t tear herself away from her work (or her wine). This also, of course, sets up the narrative justification of Jules’ betrayal: if Nic had just paid more attention to her (like a real man) she wouldn’t have strayed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1363460712459311"><title>Universal blues</title>
<p>If gender normativity and a kind of retro anti-feminism haunt the seemingly delightful <italic>Kids Are All Right</italic>, then an equally troubling rhetoric of universality becomes the meta-discourse that governs both criticism and – arguably – reception practices of most audiences. Like its (non-family centered) predecessor <italic>Brokeback Mountain</italic>, this universalizing move can be seen most explicitly in both the advertising and the reviews. Indeed, that “cowboy love story” won over hearts, and perhaps even some minds, with precisely this strategy of titillating with the new while simultaneously reassuring with the assertion of a universalism of a generic love story. Of course, generic and universal in this sort of a context always really means that heterosexuality is secured as the default point of comparison. <italic>Brokeback Mountain</italic>, then, was sold and marketed and reviewed as the film about gay cowboys that wasn’t really about gay cowboys because it was about “love” which is, inevitably if implicitly, heterosexual. In much the same way, <italic>The Kids Are All Right</italic> circulates as both a radically “new” representation of “gay families” while embedding this newness in an over-arching universalist discourse of “family.”</p>
<p>Here, Hollywood wants to have its homosexual difference and contain it too: these representations are marketed as a “new” twist on what is of course a universal (read heteronormative) story of a family trying to make it work and a couple trying to rekindle the flame. Indeed, much of the PR (including interviews with the stars, critical reviews, and blogosphere pontificating) went down the well-worn universalist track. Almost every review follows a similar template. So, for example, film critic Roger Ebert tells us that “The Kids Are All Right” centers on a lesbian marriage, but is not about one. It's a film about marriage itself, an institution with challenges that are universal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363460712459311">Ebert, 2010</xref>). He further opines: “I refuse to call it a ‘gay film.’ I toyed with the idea of not even using the word ‘lesbian’ and leaving it to you to figure out that the couple was female. This is a romantic triangle happening to involve these three people” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363460712459311">Ebert, 2010</xref>). A.O Scott, in <italic>The New York Times</italic>, captures perfectly this frisson of difference that titillates even as it reassures us in its normalcy:<disp-quote>
<p>But its originality – the thrilling, vertiginous sense of never having seen anything quite like it before – also arises from the particular circumstances of the family at its heart. There is undeniable novelty to a movie about a lesbian couple whose two teenage children were conceived with the help of an anonymous sperm donor. Nic and Jules, a couple with two children, a Volvo and a tidy, spacious house in a pleasant suburban stretch of Southern California, are a picture of normalcy. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363460712459311">Scott, 2010</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>So what we see here is novelty in the service of normalcy, or as another critic notes, “Genders aside, you know this couple; one of the more satisfying jokes in <italic>The Kids Are All Right</italic> is that good intentions and parental cluelessness are beyond sexual orientation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363460712459311">Burr, 2010</xref>). Another article, entitled “Same sex-with the same family issues,” assures us that “<italic>The Kids Are All Right</italic> isn’t about a gay family; it’s about all families” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363460712459311">Austerlitz, 2010</xref>). For another critic, “The guiding joke in <italic>The Kids Are All Right</italic> is not that Nic and Jules are a same-sex couple, but that they're so utterly conventional — the kind of healthy-eating, meticulously recycling, solid citizens you might find in any affluent metropolitan enclave” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363460712459311">Taylor, 2010</xref>). Yes, exactly, and the joke is on us. Or, as the director herself says, “Our intention wasn’t overtly political. The subversion, as we saw it, was to be nonpolitical, and just to make this human story that was about a family that people could relate to, no matter what your identity or your sexual preferences were.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1363460712459311">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other critics can be even more directly universalizing:<disp-quote>
<p>let's start by getting past any hesitations or reservations about the lesbian household premise on which <italic>The Kids Are All Right</italic> is based. The issue of gay marriage is not what’s on the table here. At its heart, this is a movie about how families, whatever their composition, stay together, love each other through difficult times, and weather the particularly storm-tossed seas that come when the kids hit their teenage years. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363460712459311">Sharkey, 2010</xref>)</p></disp-quote>Of course, universal means normal means hetero means universal. And, in this logic, as one reviewer says, all marriages are really heterosexual after all:<disp-quote>
<p>More than anything, <italic>The Kids Are All Right</italic> is a film about marriage. Not about gay marriage in particular, though the portrait of this couple's decades-long bond underscores the absurdity of the debate about what to call same-sex unions. Cholodenko, who has a donor child with her partner, isn't making a rah-rah commercial for alternative families – in fact, some gay viewers may bristle at the movie's less-than-orthodox take on lesbian sexuality and the complications of donor parenthood. What Cholodenko has aimed for, and achieved, is something bigger: a serious and funny film about the simple yet incomprehensibly fraught act of moving through time with the person you love. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363460712459311">Stevens, 2010</xref>)</p></disp-quote>So “something bigger” is of course not something “gay” or, god forbid, lesbian – that would be a special instance (a special right?). Lesbian relationships are therefore the particular, the signifier but never the sign. Or, as Howard Bragman, a Hollywood publicist known as the “coming-out guru” for helping gay celebs go public, says “It's the perfect post-gay ﬁlm … Gays are just part of the landscape, which is where we want to be.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1363460712459311">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even gay pundits were largely unthinkingly celebratory, arguing, as nationally syndicated gay columnist Dan Savage did here, that the director was brave for engaging in some hard “truth telling” about the lesbian community. As he says:<disp-quote>
<p>Ms. Cholodenko dramatizes some truths about lesbian sexuality and identity that many lesbians are uncomfortable discussing among themselves much less seeing portrayed in a film intended for a general – mostly straight – audience. (A lot of lesbians watch gay male porn; some lesbian-identified women are also attracted to men and sometimes sleep with men. Discuss.) Ms. Cholodenko also portrays a boy raised by a lesbian couple as hungry for male attention. Considering the right-wing attacks on same-sex parents, that’s also a brave bit of truth-telling. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363460712459311">Savage, 2010</xref>)</p></disp-quote>Hmm. Since when is understanding masculinity as a necessary patrilineage a bit of truth telling? Seems to me “father knows best” has a quite sturdy and hegemonic hold on American social consciousness and has indeed been presented as such a truth that it needs no telling at all.</p>
<p>My issue with <italic>Kids</italic> therefore is not the hetero romp Julianne Moore has with Mark Ruffalo (although had it been paired with a lusty lesbian life it would have been far more interesting) or the use of gay male porn to attempt to spice up the women’s sex life or even the depiction of a long-term relationship as sexually and emotionally dry. Really – the affair with the donor is both ludicrous and sad. It is ludicrous because her adoration of his penis is so over the top as to render their first encounter slapstick and cartoonish. But it is also sad because it thoroughly diminishes her as a parent. Indeed, the affair itself is not of concern to me, nor the fact that she does so with a man. But it does defy both logic and some basic tenets of parental decency to embark on an affair with the previously anonymous sperm donor, given that there is a world of men/women out there more than willing to have affairs with gorgeous but neglected lesbian housewives. So our paradigmatic queer moms are crappy parents, crappy lesbians, crappy lovers, crappy everything. To top it all off, these women are not even self-conscious about their “casual” racism, which is most painfully exemplified by using Jules’s firing of the hardworking and blameless Mexican gardener to cover up her indiscretion with Paul as the premise for a throw-away joke. While a minor note, it is a telling one where the single character of color is used as minstrel show fodder for high hilarity and narrative emptiness.</p>
<p>No, my problem is much more with the reliance on universality which entails – almost always – a de-gaying of gayness; the reliance on heteronormative gender paradigms so that the women are depicted as – really – just like our neighbors down the street where daddy goes out to work and mommy stays at home; the invisibility of lesbian culture and lesbian friends; and the erasure of the extended queer kinship networks that most of us do construct out of both need and desire.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1363460712459311">11</xref></sup> This last issue remains – for me at least – the most persistently troubling. If invisibility and abject stereotypes were the problems of the past, then a new glib tokenism and erasure of community seem to be the signs of the difficult representational present. Gayness is both the motivation for the plot but the emptiest of signifiers or, rather, a signifier cleansed of any queer (and feminist) “politics of difference” challenge and filled instead with a liberal universalism that acts as a cultural pat on the back for tolerant heterosexuals and allied “just like you” homonormative viewers.</p>
<p>The ideological work done in such texts is complex, for the inclusion that this twist offers is enticing – particularly in a context marked by such a history of exclusion. There is, of course, some value in the normalizing and universalizing move, in demystifying and de-demonizing that which has been both hidden and made abject. But the socio-political costs are many and variegated. In the case of this film, the cost is feminism certainly, but also any sense of queer parents emerging out of and living within queer communities and culture. Of course, what is also lost is a critique of heterosexual family formation and a vision of the kind of difference a progressive queer and feminist difference can – and often does – make, not just for the parents but for the children as well. Couldn’t we – for a moment – imagine that children of gay parents might indeed walk in a world of more gender play and fluidity, more gender sophistication and (dare we say it) more righteous political anger? Might we imagine that they not only encounter homophobia along the way but also perhaps a different kind of kinship? Couldn’t we imagine, then, that the kids are not all right but are actually better off?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1363460712459311">12</xref></sup> Narratively, of course, while the queer family is reconciled at the end – it takes a male figure (and his overweening phallic presence) to bring them together: he is the catalyst that both disrupts this homo home and gets it back on some semblance of even keel. He is also the catalyst that prompts Laser to reject his bullying best friend and Joni to stand on her own two feet: it takes a man, therefore, to set a lesbian family straight.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1363460712459311"><title>Not so modern families</title>
<p>So these are our lesbians of the moment, mired in old anti-feminist tropes, sexless and floundering, significant only by their referentiality to universal and normative heterosexuality. But at least, I guess, we are finally seeing some <italic>lesbians</italic> as parents; it remains the case that most gay families represented in popular media consist of male parents who are – by and large – in a lot better shape and are of course most definitely NOT looking for love in all the wrong genitals. Given that lesbian moms remain a far larger segment of the population, this is a curious phenomenon and may have much to do with the potentially more challenging configuration of a home without male presence and dominance. I should also add that the lesbians of contemporary media (including of course our penis happy Jules) are curiously depicted as endlessly sexually fluid and polymorphous in their desires. Almost all the lesbians are kinda “bisexual” – you know, that fluid wishy-washy girlie sexuality that just can’t make up its mind – while the men not so much. So our current representational moment connects “messy” lesbian sexuality with ineffectual parenting and sets this up against sexually stable gay male identity and competent parenting. If the California mothers are hapless and harried and stereotyped (and living in a world devoid of other queers) then the gay dads of the hit TV sitcom <italic>Modern Family</italic> at least seem to have an occasional homo friend or two and share a giggling awareness of their own embodied stereotypes. The big queen is of course the stay-at-home dad but also the sports-watching handyman. Their mutual embrace of gay effete sensibilities at least foregrounds their performativity, even while we cringe at the show’s reluctance to depict even a modicum of physical affection let alone full-on sexual passion. <italic>Modern Family</italic> too traffics in the universalist tropes in which the gay dads are the tokens that add to the quirky, multiculti stew of “contemporary family life,” albeit a very monied one. But while <italic>The Kids Are All Righ</italic>t hyper-heteros the lesbians (even their tepid butch/femme performance is less homocultural and more 1950s housewife/husband), Cameron and Mitchell are devoutly queer, have at least some modicum of a queer-centered social life, and infuse their parenting with a skittish gay sensibility and (over)awareness of themselves as the stereotypical white gay dads with the adopted Asian baby. Several episodes play this up, most hysterically when they attempt to play “the gay card” in the kindergarten admissions battle and are bested by the interracial lesbian couple with a handicapped child.</p>
<p>The gay marrieds of the nighttime soap <italic>Brothers and Sisters</italic> (2002–2011), on the other hand, are refreshingly physical and surprisingly complex. In the 2010–2011 season they first attempted surrogacy, then adopted an older child and – finally – expanded their family when the supposedly failed surrogate turned up with a baby in tow. More importantly, the show resists the tokenism that so troubles contemporary culture by revealing that the beloved uncle – everyone’s surrogate father and go-to guy – is himself a little light in the loafers. Here, as in <italic>Modern Family</italic> but not in our Hollywood indie hit <italic>The Kids Are All Right</italic>, gayness is more richly integrated into the ongoing narrative. The gay dads of <italic>Brothers and Sisters</italic> are not just desexualized hetero parental clones, but amorous lovers, engaged sons, devoted siblings. And, they seem to live and love in a world not wholly circumscribed by heterosexuality, so their parenting practices seem at least somewhat informed by alternative sensibilities. So the gay dads of TV fare much better (as parents, as lovers) than the lesbian moms of the big screen. But in all of these, gay parenting is itself rendered both unproblematic to the public at large and not structurally or socially different from heterosexual parenting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1363460712459311"><title>We are all Gleeks</title>
<p>It is only when we get to gay teens, though, that we still are allowed entrée into the persistence of homophobia and the difference sexual difference makes – even as that is eventually and quickly swallowed up in the warm love of family acceptance. In <italic>The United States of Tara</italic>, a quirky Showtime series about a mom with multiple personalities, a gay son comes out and his parents congratulate him and move on to the next activity. Even in <italic>Glee</italic> – where we actually do see homophobia and its effects on the young Kurt – his coming out to his father provides only a simple moment of challenge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1363460712459311">13</xref></sup> Dad’s initial difficulty is quickly overcome in one single episode (a queer positive re-education faster than a Lindsay Lohan relapse) and he becomes not only open and “accepting” but a brave warrior dad defending his gay son. Indeed, Kurt’s gayness is in many ways signified as analogically identical to any of the outsider statuses that the <italic>Glee</italic> kids inhabit – from fat girl to wheelchair-bound boys to teen moms. But at least here, queer kids are not nullified by normalcy: Kurt is the over-the-top, sensitive, showtune singing, fashionista we all remember fondly from high school drama club. And his encounters with hetero family life don’t sacrifice his queerness at the altar of acceptance. His queerness changes others – most dramatically his father – whereas the queerness of the lesbian moms is either an empty signifier or a drag on both kids and sexual pleasure. And, later in the series, when sharp-tongued Santana avows her love for the hysterically deadpan cheerleader Brittany, she struggles mightily both with that old interior desire to hide, and with the vicious rejection from her beloved <italic>abuela</italic> (grandmother). We know (this is a sitcom after all) that all will be wrapped up with a song and a dance (in this case, “I Kissed a Girl and I Liked It”) but at least we see queerness <italic>mattering</italic> – to the kids who come out, to the family members who may or may not respond well, to the culture of a school in which anti-gay taunts are still as common as scribbled love notes on a bathroom stall.</p>
<p>Whether in <italic>Ugly Betty</italic> or <italic>Glee</italic> or <italic>Brothers and Sisters</italic> or <italic>The Good Wife</italic> or <italic>Desperate Housewives</italic> or any number of films with the obligatory gay character – hip acceptance and blasé embrace are the rule not the exception. In most of these worlds, the parents and other family members are benignly embracing of the production of queer families. Now this presents something of a dilemma, for on the one hand only depicting horrified sisters or grandparents refusing to acknowledge their grandchildren would do a disservice to the very real changes in social consciousness that has had very real effects on everyday life, including family life. But the rosy picture is not only disingenuous, it can help to present a false sense (which, by the way, many progressive pundits – gay and straight – contribute to) that the battle for gay rights and deep sexual freedom is somehow won or at least largely over. In other words, these family images largely present a world beyond both the closet and beyond serious homophobia. In addition, it helps to sort of remythologize family (even after all these years of feminist critique of family life and structure) as the haven in a homo’s world. Homophobia is narratively externalized and displaced outside the family unit and put on the doorsteps of the internet (cyberbullying), the judiciary and other institutional locales, and individual “bad” people. As the family becomes more “queer” so queerness becomes familialized as a site of homonormativity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1363460712459311"><title>Will the real queer families please stand up?</title>
<p>So where do we see any really queer families? Of course, some independent films can and do show queer families in a different register – I think particularly of that wonderful early indie <italic>The Incredibly True Adventures of Two Girls in Love</italic> from 1995, where you actually were able to lay eyes on the unthinkable: lesbian kids and lesbian parents represented in a context of difference from the hetero and homo-normative. But there are glimpses even in mainstream media and mostly in television and not film of a more complicated and interesting take on queer families. I want to mention just two examples. The first is from the brilliant Showtime series <italic>Nurse Jackie,</italic> which features a rich panoply of sexual reprobates. What is important here is that the whole narrative world has already been queered: heterosexual family life is shown as riven with duplicity, there is a strangely macho but also queeny gay male nurse, and the upper crust British doctor is bisexual (or just profligate) and shown with both male and female lovers. Familial queerness enters into the workplace when it is revealed that odd duck Dr Coop has two moms,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1363460712459311">14</xref></sup> who then later surprise him with a devastating divorce.</p>
<p>Interesting representations of truly queer kinship crops up in unusual places. Probably the most unlikely source is the long-running nighttime soap <italic>Grey’s Anatomy</italic>. There have been a number of gay and lesbian characters in this series but its queer quotient has been ratcheted up in recent years as two of the main female characters navigate a fairly complex relationship, made all the more difficult by differing desires when it comes to reproduction and family life. In a bizarre sequence of events that can only happen when network TV confronts sexy Sapphic surgeons, the lesbian couple end up in their own ER – having spectacularly crashed their car right at the moment of a marriage proposal. To make matters more televisual, lesbian orthopedic surgeon Callie is both gravely injured and blissfully pregnant – by her male best friend (and occasional lover) ne’er-do-well (but heart of gold) Dr McSteamy. During the course of the series, the three of them try to figure out a way to imagine a kind of kinship that includes them all. In this critical scene, girlfriend (and reluctant co-parent to be) pediatric surgeon Arizona and baby daddy Mark (plastic surgeon of course) are arguing over how to proceed medically given the car crash, a decision that may turn on a “the mother” or “the baby” dilemma. In arguing his point, Mark declares that he is the father, that he is the only one that matters and that she (Arizona) is “nothing.” Now, what I like here is not only the fact that they refuse the simple hetero couple model but I like that homophobia is made visible, and made visible in a character that is central and that spectators are encouraged to admire and like. Mark does come around and recant, but we can applaud the naming of a persistent homophobia even as we are pained by its explicitness.</p>
<p>These exceptions aside, what remains depressingly the same is the rarity with which queer lives are shown as their own stories, not as signs of hetero hipness or the decline of western civilization. Indeed, those stories exist but have now largely been ghettoized either to all gay all the time cable programming or gay film festivals or the rare network or cable series such as <italic>Brothers and Sisters, L Word</italic> and so on. The question is: Can we have it both ways? Can gay families – particularly feminist, lesbian ones – be radically challenging, deeply different, unmooring our certitudes of kinship and care while at the same time being wholly normalized and unthreatening to hetero family business as usual? The dilemma at this moment, then, is how to “speak” gay identity that goes beyond the intractable oppositions of “always gay” (gayness as the only signifier of identity) and “incidentally gay” where gayness is emptied of historical specificity and challenge in the universalizing move of making heterosexuality hip. And what do we do as a community with community yearnings? How do we mark real losses in a world of corporatized queerness at the same time that we embrace the complicated communities in the here and now?</p>
<p>For gay families exist in a complicated <italic>context</italic> and we need representations of these multi-layered communities: we need images that depict the work that goes into making communities happen. Still and all, what we largely see is the lone queer (or now queer family) navigating her way through the thickets of hetero life and miss out on that broader social and political community. In other words, these gay families might be shown to refuse to reduce queer struggles to “gay rights” or – god forbid – “gay marriage” or “gays in the military.” A more prosaic and multi-layered queer politics should be part of the context of these familial images instead of the sterile world of deracinated lesbian suburbanites we see in <italic>The Kids Are All Right</italic>. We need to imagine, perhaps, a different relationship between visibility and being known; or, to put it another way, between the commodified spectacle and the desiring community. We need to insist that our families might just be radically different (not just modern or California hip) in ways that upend heterosexist business as usual and provide a template for imagining kinship in the future tense.</p>
