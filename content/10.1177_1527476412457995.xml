<abstract>
<p>This article explores the ways in which conceptions of hegemonic femininity are exploited and reinforced on Canadian weight-loss makeover programs <italic>The Last 10 Pounds Bootcamp</italic> (2007–) and <italic>Bulging Brides</italic> (2008–). These shows feature predominantly female participants whose prescribed diet and exercise regimes promote physical ideals that are bound up with notions of discipline, desirability, and belonging, while claiming the vicarious authority of contemporary health discourses on obesity. This article argues that despite Canada’s reputation as a “socially healthy” nation, the gendered depiction of body weight and size on <italic>The Last 10 Pounds Bootcamp</italic> and <italic>Bulging Brides</italic> provides a contradictory picture of the treatment of women’s bodies in Canadian society. The article then considers the implications of possible alternative readings of these transformation narratives, which suggest that multiculturalism may be a lens through which more traditional views of gendered national identity can be subverted.</p>

Popular programs in the United Kingdom include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1527476412457995"><italic>Supersize vs. Superskinny</italic> (2008</xref>–), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1527476412457995"><italic>You Are What You Eat</italic> (2004-2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527476412457995"><italic>Honey We’re Killing the Kids</italic> (2004-2007)</xref>, and various iterations of Jamie Oliver’s food “revolutions.” Each of these programs is, to varying degrees, ideologically supported by the “truths” of obesity-epidemic discourse that have been recently “recontextualised in government policy, health promotion initiatives, web resources and school practices” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1527476412457995">Wright 2009</xref>, 1). These policies, practices, and initiatives impact directly on the lived experiences of individuals whose bodies are visibly marked as “abnormally” large or heavy, while also playing a significant role in the identity development of children and youth in the societies in which these programs are broadcast (and later become cultural talking points). Representations of embodiment that depict fatness as explicitly undesirable and burdensome on healthcare systems also suggest that overweight signifies a willful lack of compliance with requirements for good citizenship within a given society.</p>
<p>While the vast majority of these programs depict participants as already medically obese, a number of Canadian examples, including those to be analyzed in this article, have chosen actively unfat females bodies to be the subjects of biopedagogical narratives of weight loss. Unlike programs such as <italic>The Biggest Loser</italic>, which focus attention on the health and social problems the overweight participant may already be experiencing, <italic>The Last 10 Pounds Bootcamp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1527476412457995">Figure 1</xref>) and <italic>Bulging Brides</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1527476412457995">Figure 2</xref>) create affective engagement with viewers by focusing instead on a more ambiguous future threat of weight gain, which only exacerbates the cognitive dissonance already being displayed by many participants on these programs who seem convinced that their bodies are barely acceptable as they are. The body anxiety these kinds of programs create can be seen as an extension of the moral panic that contextualizes obesity-epidemic discourse—what Lauren Berlant refers to as “the pedagogical project of turning eating into medicine and its effects into a health crisis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527476412457995">2011</xref>, 102). It is troubling to see the prioritization of size and weight over health on Canadian television, given that “a history of collectivism and Keynesian economics ties Canadian national identity and citizenship with public policies focused on collective health and wellbeing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527476412457995">Callaghan 2011</xref>, 2). In her survey of national health policies in 2001, Anne-Marie Jutel found that while the United States emphasized quantitative measures such as body mass index (BMI) and placed weight management before health management, the Canadian government recognized the shortcomings of using BMI as a sole indicator of health and acknowledged the danger of very low body weights. In Jutel’s view, the 1988 <italic>Canadian Guidelines for Healthy Weights</italic> reflect “an individual-centered approach that hesitates to group people in categories of ‘unhealthy’ or ‘irresponsible’ on the basis of weight” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527476412457995">2001</xref>, 10). Jutel also points out that <italic>The Report of the Task Force on the Treatment of Obesity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527476412457995">Health and Welfare Canada 1991</xref>) does “not see self-referral as diagnostic, and in fact [it] underline[s] the fact that many healthy individuals may expose themselves to significant risk by pursuing weight loss for cosmetic purposes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527476412457995">2001</xref>, 11). The inclusion of actively unfat women on Canadian size-transformation makeovers that appropriate the same health narratives applied to the undeniably obese participants of American shows like <italic>The Biggest Loser</italic> thus sends confusing messages about the relationship between size and health.</p>

<p>This composite of images from the opening credits of The Last Ten Pounds Bootcamp (Slice, 2007-) illustrates that in this program, fat is constituted as both fundamentally female, and as an aesthetic rather than medical issue, despite Europe and Boman’s attempt to frame it verbally within a health discourse.</p>

<p>Links between identity and place-based belonging, in the context of race, class, gender, and sexuality, have been the subject of much scholarship; makeover television’s current preoccupation with representations of embodiment provides an additional dimension to the framing of such discussions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527476412457995">Jones 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1527476412457995">Leyda 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1527476412457995">Weber 2009</xref>). The feminization and queering of fat embodiment we see in these programs is in keeping with Pierre Bourdieu’s theory of cultural capital, which, having already privileged white (wealthy) heterosexual men, is now extended to incorporate trim fit bodies. If, as Marusya Bociurkiw asserts, Canadian television is “a marker of an affective Canadian national space, one that promises an idea of ‘home’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476412457995">2011</xref>, 2), then local makeover narratives play a critical role in signifying who is welcome around our collective table.</p>
<p>In this article, I explore the sociocultural construction of the “ideal” female body on Canadian reality television by analyzing size-transformation narratives broadcast on the women’s TV network Slice. First, I illustrate how <italic>The Last 10 Pounds Bootcamp</italic> (hereafter <italic>TLTPB</italic>) performs the biopedagogical disciplinary work of contemporary obesity discourse, even when avoiding the explicit use of “medico-scientific” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1527476412457995">Murray 2008</xref>) language to explain weight-loss strategies, and while actively targeting subjects who are not medically overweight. I argue that these inconsistent priorities belie Canada’s reputation as a socially healthy nation and produce contradictory representations of women. I then turn my attention to the depictions of specifically heteronormative femininity offered by <italic>Bulging Brides</italic>, which links the slim female body not only with social health but also with heterosexual marital longevity, suggesting that fat embodiment symbolizes a spoiled and sexually undesirable identity. I further consider the implications of an alternative reading of these narratives by analyzing one of the few examples on this program of a non-Caucasian bride. I argue that the cooperation and resistance of various participants may be read as representing specific modes of Canadian belonging, particularly highlighting the role that racialized identity can play in both complicating and subverting some traditional notions of Western heteronormative femininity.</p>

<title>“Give It to Me”: Disciplinary Medicine’s Prescription for Looking “Hot”</title>
<p><italic>TLTPB</italic> is currently rebroadcasting episodes from its fifth season while in production for the sixth one. This body transformation series features a new participant in each thirty-minute episode, but uses a reoccurring set of narrative conventions. The series follows the structural patterns that Brenda Weber identifies as typifying the makeover genre: improvement of the subject through transformation, submission of the subject to disciplinary expertise, and finally “the big reveal” of the subject to friends and family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1527476412457995">2009</xref>, 29–30). In five seasons and seventy-eight episodes, <italic>TLTPB</italic> has featured only eight male participants, despite a casting call that asks for both men and women between the ages of twenty and forty-five. Perhaps this is not surprising given the program’s placement on Slice, a self-proclaimed “women’s network”; significantly, however, this pattern suggests that the construction of ideal weight and body shape is primarily the concern and responsibility of women. The unequal burden of representation in the gendering of the “fat” body on <italic>TLTPB</italic> reinforces the notion that “fat is female” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1527476412457995">Wolf 1992</xref>, 92). The female body, having historically been at the mercy of male desire and expectation, is particularly vulnerable to being labeled as unattractive and undeserving of success or acceptance when fat, and programs like <italic>The Last 10 Pounds Bootcamp</italic> and <italic>Bulging Brides</italic> exploit an anxiety that many women have lived with for their entire lives. Julia Leyda draws on Julia Kristeva’s concept of abjection to explain how fatness is now “associated with illness and death, as well as lack of discipline or socialization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1527476412457995">2012</xref>, 7). Postfeminist discourse asserts that we are in an era of ever increasing female agency and empowerment that regularly challenges the continued necessity of “feminism” and particularly of feminist scholarship, yet the attack on the size and shape of Western women’s bodies is ubiquitous. This attack, which is manifested by the multiplicity of unrealistic representations of female bodies that appear in advertising, magazines, film, and television, is seen by many scholars as causally linked to present-day female self-determinism. Thus, the construction and representation of idealized “norms” for the female body can be viewed as a particularly insidious way in which women continue to be disciplined within a patriarchal society.</p>
<p>That the “unruly” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1527476412457995">Rowe 1990</xref>) body in this program is primarily female is further complicated by a familiar narrative wherein the ideal female body is constructed through its necessary subordination to male authority (here, the hypermasculine former football player, Tommy Europe, who serves as both the program host and physical trainer). The opening credits display a montage of images of labeled female “problem” areas, intercut with short clips of Caucasian women in various exercise poses of physical submission to the African-Canadian trainer, all of which are narrated by his voice shouting “come on let’s go!” “harder!” “faster!” “is that all you’ve got?” and “give it to me!” The sexual overtones of this narrative construction are further reinforced by the last image of the credit sequence—a close-up shot of a tightly denim-clad woman’s bottom walking away from the camera. Perhaps unsurprisingly, what the program constructs as targeted problem zones on the body are also the areas that typically distinguish physical female embodiment from male. Even in the few episodes that feature male participants, these same credit sequences appear, showing only women.</p>
<p>At the beginning of each episode, the participant (or “recruit”) explains how she wants to change her body, what she thinks is the main cause of her unacceptable weight and body shape, and why she is undertaking the four-week challenge (e.g., to attend—and look hot at—a family reunion, wedding, graduation, or New Year’s Eve party). The program’s title suggests that participants are in the final stages of a weight-loss journey, seeking help to banish a stubborn “last ten pounds,” but these introductions clarify that the goal is a standard event-ready makeover. The recruit is then ambushed by Europe, accompanied by nutrition expert Nadeen Boman, a petite Caucasian woman in her mid-twenties. Europe and Boman record the subject’s weight and measurements; her body is then evaluated in specific detail to illustrate problem areas. The participant is always unhappy with her weight and measurements, although the average starting dress size of participants is an eight. Unlike programs such as <italic>The Biggest Loser</italic> or <italic>Supersize vs. Superskinny, TLTPB</italic> does not require the subject to be unclothed for these sequences, but neither is this initial weigh-in always private. The subject may be measured in front of an amused group of loved ones or she may be taken into a private room only to have Europe shout her weight to her friends and family. Because the participant is not medically obese, it is difficult for producers to encourage shame-inducing disgust or horror from friends and family through a visceral display of corpulence. Nevertheless, the subject displays self-conscious embarrassment through groans, sighs, or nervous giggles when her weight and measurements are noted. Europe takes perverse pleasure in sharing private information about the subject without her permission and in making snide comments about her perceived bodily deficiencies; for example, “Pam’s got a good attitude—too bad it’s not a personality contest. She needs to work harder if she wants to lose her big butt” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527476412457995"><italic>TLTPB</italic> 2007</xref>, episode no. 2).</p>
<p>Boman clears the kitchen of unhealthy foods, while Europe takes the recruit shopping to buy a goal outfit. “Bad” foods are any items that are processed or that contain any fat or sugar, even if the fat content might appear in otherwise “good” foods such as nuts, avocados, or peanut butter. Food choices are ridiculed, as is common in most makeover programs, reinforcing the authority of the expert both as someone whose knowledge is superior and as someone to whom the recruit must completely submit to successfully achieve her weight-loss/body transformation goals. The show circulates conflicting messages about health, as food is reduced to an instrumental necessity that is robbed of both pleasure and positive identification with the self.</p>
<p>While shopping, Europe acts as fashion consultant, but his “man’s man” persona restricts his advice to brief evaluative comments that mainly indicate whether he finds the recruit desirable in each outfit she models. His comments encourage her to select an outfit that is tight-fitting and “sexy.” “I’m not really feeling that top,” his response to Pam’s loose-fitting blouse, becomes “I’d say that was definitely worth the wait” to her selection of a low-cut black halter-top (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527476412457995"><italic>TLTPB</italic> 2007</xref>, episode no. 2). These remarks also reinforce the notion that a woman dresses primarily to attract (male) attention. As Millman explains, “women are prone to disembodiment not only because they are constantly exposed to intrusive judgments about their bodies but also because they are taught to regard their bodies as passive objects others should admire” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527476412457995">1980</xref>, 202). The recruit’s final choice is purchased two sizes smaller than what she can fit into, sometimes provoking skepticism. Pam asks, “Are you planning on letting me eat during this whole thing?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527476412457995"><italic>TLTPB</italic> 2007</xref>, episode no. 2). If the recruit loses more than five pounds after two weeks and can comfortably fit into the target outfit, she will be pushed to drop another dress size over the remaining two weeks, emphasizing that a woman can never be too thin, regardless of her relative health or fitness.</p>
<p>After the two-week weight check, the participant is confronted with a digitally altered projection of her body illustrating significant weight gain, to motivate her to keep up with the lifestyle change that she is making. In these sequences, the actual number of pounds purportedly gained is ignored by the recruit, as all attention is focused on the image of the body. Europe correlates any amount of weight gain with a specifically undesirable (read asexual) bodily appearance, but there is no mention of possible future health problems that might be caused or exacerbated by additional weight. Europe’s comments to participants while they gaze at their possible future bodies also suggest that this is an affective strategy that seeks to further discipline these women through the promotion of fear and anxiety. This anxiety is easy to produce, given that the construction of meaning as it relates to fat bodies has been overwhelmingly negative for the better part of the last century. Whereas adiposity was once seen as the embodiment of personal success, American society has spent the last ten decades fighting a moral, aesthetic, medical, and/or ethical war on fat (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527476412457995">Bordo 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1527476412457995">Stearns 2002</xref>), and the effect of this hypervigilance is now being seen in Canadian representations of ideal embodiment. Shannon, who has demonstrated her commitment to change by losing seven pounds after the first two weeks of the new food and exercise regime, is told, “I don’t think it’s gonna happen to you, and I hope it doesn’t happen to you, but you seem like the sort of person that needs to be motivated, constantly” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527476412457995"><italic>TLTPB</italic> 2007</xref>, episode no. 3).</p>
<p>Recruits are predictably upset by these suggested future selves. Samantha, a new mother in her mid-thirties: “I was horrified that, firstly what I do look like and what I could look like . . . so it was double-whammy, bleh [mimes throwing up], gross” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527476412457995"><italic>TLTPB</italic> 2007</xref>, episode no. 4). Fat revulsion is reinforced, in some cases bringing the participant to tears. Jodie, an “emotional eater” in her twenties says, “That is just absolutely . . . I didn’t like myself when it started, so that is just such an eye opener . . . [turns head away from the projection in disgust] make it stop!” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527476412457995"><italic>TLTPB</italic> 2007</xref>, episode no. 1). The “future vision” segment is <italic>TLTPB</italic>’s attempt to connect the overtly superficial focus of the four-week bootcamp (looking sexy in a new outfit) with a long-term commitment to healthy living. Yet the program invokes the authority of medical discourse through the use of images of possible future obesity without ever addressing either the current material reality of the recruit’s health or possible future health issues that could arise as a consequence of an obese body.</p>
<p>Each episode concludes with the final weigh-in and fitting of the target outfit. If the recruit has lost ten pounds or more, then she is congratulated for diligently following the diet and exercise regimen and assured that she has taken significant steps down the road to a healthier lifestyle. This does not acknowledge the unrealistic aspects of the diet regimen that are unlikely to be maintained in the long-term (e.g., absolutely no cheesecake, no nachos, no alcohol, etc). Moderation is not discussed, as disciplinary medicine in this program equates self-governance with the complete elimination of “bad” foods. If the recruit has lost less than ten pounds, then her lack of discipline is blamed: “Bootcamp demands one-hundred percent commitment and that’s ultimately why this stubborn recruit failed to reach her goal” (Europe, on Lara’s loss of only three pounds, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527476412457995"><italic>TLTPB</italic> 2007</xref>, episode no. 7). The final images of the program show the recruit modeling her target outfit and reflecting on how her smaller body assures her of confidence at the upcoming event. These closing shots may show the recruit at the event itself, or modeling clothes in a bedroom or shop, illustrating how weight-loss television narratives primarily offer female bodies a “pathway towards living properly in a neo-liberal world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1527476412457995">Silk et al. 2009</xref>, 379) where normalcy is constituted via middle-class consumption practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1527476412457995">Roberts 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1527476412457995">Silk et al. 2009</xref>). There are no images of physical activity or enjoying healthy meals with friends, despite Europe’s claims that the program aims to reinforce long-term lifestyle changes. The recruit rarely mentions the implications of improved health and fitness, the sole focus of her enthusiasm being the increased aesthetic desirability of her improved body, as evidenced by descriptors like “hot,” “sexy,” “smokin’,” and “yummy mummy.” Rather than addressing the root of feelings of bodily inadequacy, the recruit is instead encouraged to overcome the “insecurity in the culture at large” through physically transforming her “brand” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527476412457995">Hearn 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Recruits are expected to follow strict diet and exercise plans, which typically include the consumption of no more than 1,500 calories per day and the completion of nine hours of exercise each week. This regimen is not rationalized in medical terms (neither Europe nor Boman have this authority), but the trainers repeatedly use biopedagogical discourse as they suggest that what is essentially a crash diet is really the beginning of a long-term shift toward a healthier lifestyle. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1527476412457995">Health Canada (2011)</xref> guidelines for estimated daily energy requirements state that that the minimum number of calories “sedentary” women between the ages of twenty and forty should be consuming is between 1,800 and 1,900. “Active” women, defined as “accumulat[ing] at least two-and-a-half hours of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity each week” (recruits on <italic>TLTPB</italic> engage in three to four times this amount of exercise) should be consuming between 2,250 and 2,350 calories per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1527476412457995">Health Canada 2011</xref>). Thus the program’s approach to food consumption could arguably be described as eating-disordered. The efficacy of <italic>TLTPB</italic>’s regime may seem evident in the weight-loss results of each episode (always correlated with self-reported improved self-esteem), but there have been no follow-up studies to assess if recruits have been able to maintain the body size and shape they achieve by the end of the four weeks. This discrepancy between the amount of food that the Health Canada guidelines advise women to consume and the regimen prescribed on the show is further evidence that Canadian television’s mediated representations of women’s bodies are at odds with a national reputation for a more holistic approach to health and fitness.</p>
<p>Callaghan sees this current Canadian participation in a “popular culture pathologization of the obese body” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527476412457995">2011</xref>, 4) as predictable, given the country’s present sociopolitical state, which has been “marked by an aggressive process of the elimination of social programs and social assistance spending as it moves towards neo-liberal economic and social policies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527476412457995">2011</xref>, 4). This position echoes the views of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1527476412457995">Laurie Ouellette and James Hay (2008)</xref>, who have also noted the multiplicity of ways in which reality television serves the interests of governments that seek to empower citizens to take responsibility for themselves so that the state does not have to. Resistance to these biopedagogical narratives, however, is still both possible and necessary. As Susan Bordo notes, regardless of the benefits of diet and exercise, women’s bodies are “a site of struggle, where we must <italic>work</italic> to keep our daily practices in the service of resistance to gender domination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527476412457995">2003</xref>, 184). Women on <italic>TLTPB</italic> are constructed as explicitly gendered citizens, tyrannized by the unjustified governance of their sizes, weights, and shapes in a manner that discounts national health discourses in these matters, and yet this governance is perversely rationalized by participants’ desire for and submission to it.</p>

<title>“I Don’t Think That’s What Richard Bargained for”: Wedding Fantasy versus Married Reality on Bulging Brides</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“Every woman wants to look stunning on her wedding day. Now help is on the way for bulging brides.”</p>
<attrib>Tommy Europe</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The social and cultural pressure to look perfect on one’s wedding day is much greater for a bride than it is for the groom. Jeffery Sobal, Caron Bove, and Barbara Rauschenbach suggest that this is because “women care more about weddings, with men focusing on ‘getting married’,” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1527476412457995">1999</xref>, 114) but this pressure also stems from the historical presentation of the bride as a piece of property to be made resplendent before being given by her father to her husband. A version of heteronormative femininity is performed in traditional Western wedding rituals by a bride who wears white and equates the size and shape of her body with her marriage’s likelihood of success. This performance assures the groom of the value of the woman he is about to marry while also impressing similar notions on his friends and family, who may even survey his “acquisition” with envy. Women are not unaware of this; as one “bulging bride” notes in her exit interview, “When I walk towards Anthony, he’ll look at me and think ‘damn does she look amazing’ and everyone else will be looking at me thinking ‘damn does she look good!’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527476412457995"><italic>Bulging Brides</italic> 2010</xref>, episode no. 36). Like <italic>TLTPB, Bulging Brides</italic> is hosted by Tommy Europe and Nadeen Boman. The individual skill-sets and personalities of Europe and Boman also dictate the similar narrative structure and content of the show. While the mode of address in this program is comparable with that of <italic>TLTPB, Bulging Brides</italic> stands out for the way that it explicitly and unapologetically reinforces ideas of heteronormative femininity while linking a slim female body with social health and marital longevity.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527476412457995">Shari Dworkin and Faye Wachs’ (2009)</xref> analysis of sports magazines finds that heteronormativity is almost always implicitly reinforced through the portrayal of ideal masculine and feminine body “types,” of which the ultimate goal appears to be the attraction and retention of attention from the opposite sex. Women are encouraged to understand that their allure for men depends on becoming the “right kind of object,” while men are advised to assert their masculinity through demonstrating their ability to act on women, whether as caretakers or lovers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527476412457995">Dworkin and Wachs 2009</xref>, 175). These body-specific stereotypes are reinforced in <italic>Bulging Brides</italic>, beginning with the formal introduction of the two hosts, who pose together on the Vancouver waterfront; Europe, shirtless, displays a sharply contoured torso, while Boman rests her hand coyly on his shoulder.</p>
<p>As with <italic>TLTPB</italic>, the social construction of weight (and indeed health) in <italic>Bulging Brides</italic> is further evidenced by the absence of an explicit medico-scientific discourse. The sole goal is to be beautiful (as equated with fitting into the smallest dress possible), yet this more superficial motivation is rationalized and balanced with personal accounts that cite health, energy, and fitness as primary motivators. The appeal to better health is particularly disingenuous given the circumstances; six weeks before a traditional wedding is likely to be one of the worst times for a bride to attempt to make major lifestyle changes involving diet and exercise. The bride’s initial acquiescence to the fitness and diet plan is formalized in a verbal contract, symbolizing marriage vows or saying “yes” to a proposal. When Europe and Boman ask if she is prepared to stick with her diet and exercise plans and do everything she is asked, she replies “I do” or “I will,” constructing herself as a docile subject whose free will is limited to choices that must first be offered by others. The assault that must take place on the idea of eating for pleasure also ignores or rejects the notion that the food we consume is tied to our cultural identities. Participants note how difficult they find it to stick to their diets when the pre-wedding weeks are filled with events like cake-testing, bridal showers, hen’s nights, and rehearsal dinners. Europe’s blithe response is that these brides will simply have to learn to curb temptation if they want to fit into their dresses. Giving in to temptation is always wrong, and participants are formally punished in the narrative segment labeled “Payback” when they inevitably do so. This payback takes place first thing in the morning after a night of partying, and typically involves Europe ambushing the bride and her friends in their beds, interrupting much-needed sleep. Payback involves anything from pole-dancing to calisthenics to a many-mile hike, where the bride is disciplined both for her own good and for Tommy’s pleasure. Eating or drinking anything that is not on the meal plan constitutes “cheating” on Europe, again framing the legitimacy of the subject’s choices as under the control of other people, and in a context of monogamous matrimony.</p>
<p><italic>Bulging Brides</italic> uses “future vision” as an opportunity to essentialize what marriage purportedly does to a woman’s body. Europe tells Sarah (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527476412457995">2008</xref>, episode no. 1) that as a new bride, she will experience many changes, including a possible weight gain of ten to fifteen pounds each year, which is then visually displayed to her through a digitally altered version of her future self. When Europe asks if this is what she wants to look like on her third anniversary, she replies, “Absolutely not! I don’t think the marriage would last that long!” Compared with “future vision” on <italic>TLTPB</italic>, it is telling to see the difference in a participant’s reaction to this hypothesized future threat when her body is constructed as a vested interest of her future husband, and one that she has an apparent duty to maintain at the smallest possible shape and size throughout her married life. Sarah is motivated both by a love for her partner and by an anxiety that becoming fat would constitute a breach of their social contract, resulting in the withdrawal of his affection for her. The inherent queerness of the fat identity is also apparent here as it is implied that fat people cannot be viewed as either sexy or sexual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527476412457995">LeBesco 2004</xref>, 89). There is also an unsettling sense of inequality in the implication that a woman who lets herself go is no longer desirable in a marital relationship and yet there is no mention of a reciprocal entitlement to view her partner in the same way. This perpetuates the idea that a woman must work hard to get (and keep) a man because her fundamental worth is bound up in her sexual desirability and her capacity to resist the natural effects of time in maintaining it.</p>
<p>As in <italic>TLTPB</italic>, a woman in <italic>Bulging Brides</italic> is primarily a gendered citizen, particularly as she is interpellated in the program as a “bride,” who by definition requires a corresponding groom in a heteronormative marital relationship. As suggested by some “partner challenge” segments, her new identity as a strong woman may also be precariously positioned to collide with a view of more traditional masculinity that expects men to always be able to best women in any physical contest. In the pilot episode where Sarah and her fiancé Rick must complete a three-thousand-foot climb to a mountain summit, Rick is struggling to match Sarah’s pace, and their banter is competitive bordering on unfriendly.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Rick:</speaker>
<p>“You’re getting tough to beat.”</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sarah:</speaker>
<p>“Well be prepared, because it’s gonna be like that for the rest of your life.”</p>
</speech>
<p>Tommy asks the couple what the hardest part of the challenge was, and Rick responds that it was seeing Sarah beat him up the hill, to which Tommy replies, “that’s what it’s gonna take, in this marriage. Grind it out, when times get bad.” Tommy equates Sarah’s ability to outpace her future husband as creating a “bad time” for Rick, which sends a contradictory message regarding the ultimate value of Sarah’s weight-loss and fitness choices. Unlike <italic>TLTPB</italic>, many participants in the concluding segments of <italic>Bulging Brides</italic> refer to the long-term health implications for their lifestyle changes. Many see their ability to follow the regimen during one of the most stressful times in their lives as evidence of their capacity to overcome any obstacle that married life might throw at them, including maintaining the regimen. These women now appear to be invested in maintaining both their health and physical beauty (as represented by the smallest body possible) not only for themselves but also to continue to provide their husbands with “what they bargained for.”</p>

</speech>
<p>The implications of transformation narratives are quite insidious for women, for they perpetuate the myth of what Linda Hirshman first referred to as “choice” feminism, whereby all things a woman might be and do are viewed as equally empowering, so long as she chooses them herself. The trouble with the discourse of choice feminism is that it operates under the assumption that every woman has a boundless variety of choices available to her, that she has the resources and knowledge necessary to access this range of choices, and that she further understands the implications of each choice. A participant on <italic>TLTPB</italic> or <italic>Bulging Brides</italic> is presented as an empowered woman who is taking control of her life by choosing to be on the program and to work cooperatively with Boman and Europe for her own good; however, after making this choice, she no longer has the agency to resist the logic of what she is asked to do. There is no option to change her mind unless she wishes to be told that she is lazy, a quitter, or possessed of a bad attitude. Female passivity is also repeatedly perpetuated on <italic>Bulging Brides</italic> through Europe’s insistence that the subject must submit herself to his authority to receive his help to do what she cannot do alone. As McKinley explains, “the only control the ‘ideal’ woman is allowed is usually self-control” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527476412457995">1999</xref>, 102), highlighting that even control of the self can cease to be empowering when it is only granted at the whim of an outside authority. This is what makes the few occasions when women actively resist the series’ disciplinary pedagogies so fascinating, and I wish to further explore the implications of this resistance in the context of simultaneously racialized and gendered citizenship.</p>
<p>Priya is introduced to viewers by Tommy Europe in the third season of <italic>Bulging Brides</italic> as “one of our biggest challenges yet; she complains every step of the way in her struggle to adopt healthy eating and workout habits” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527476412457995"><italic>Bulging Brides</italic> 2010</xref>, episode no. 28). Priya admits, “If I want it to go well, then it will go well. But if someone is pushing me? And I don’t wanna do something? Then that might be problematic for the other person.” Given Canada’s status as a multicultural society, it is somewhat surprising to see that in three seasons and thirty-nine episodes, Priya is one of only two women of color to be featured on the program, and she is the only one of south Asian descent. Priya’s cultural heritage also provides an opportunity to address the degree to which the equation of thinness with attractiveness is a fundamentally Eurocentric beauty ideal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527476412457995">Jones 2010</xref>, 78). She is the only woman who does not wear a traditional white bridal gown; her wedding outfit is a richly colored, two-piece, midriff-baring <italic>lehenga</italic>. Her motivation also differs from many other brides, as her outfit already fits, but she would like to reduce the prominence of the belly that it displays. Priya is not interested in making major lifestyle changes, only in toning her stomach (which she whimsically calls “Bobby”) sufficiently to avoid feeling self-conscious on her big day. The way she describes her desire to reduce her belly also implies an understanding of her wedding as a cultural celebration, marking her desire to look her best as part of paying respect to her guests, rather than merely a narcissistic indulgence in romantic fantasy. As she says in her exit interview,
<disp-quote>
<p>On my wedding day I can just relax and just be happy. With everything that’s going on around me, there’s just one less worry—I won’t have to worry about my stomach bulging out and greeting everyone. And now I can just know that I’ll look all right on my wedding day, and that it’s gonna be me and not “Bobby.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527476412457995"><italic>Bulging Brides</italic> 2010</xref>, episode no. 28)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Throughout the process, Priya is resistant to Europe’s methods, but stopping short of absolute noncompliance. She never refuses to do what he asks, but she does not enjoy the process, nor is she convinced by the strategies he attempts to use to motivate her. She arrives at “Tommy’s Playground” in flip-flop sandals, claiming that she does not own running shoes so he is forced to give her a pair. He discourages questioning of his methods, but Priya wants to fully understand the process, to mentally prepare for it: “I honestly think Tommy needs to let me know what’s coming, how many reps it’s gonna be.” Her resistance to being pushed too hard and too quickly causes him to physically isolate her from himself and the cameras: “I’m not prepared to listen to all of that.” It is apparent that his irritation and impatience may be clouding his professional judgment when he tells the camera that at five foot three and one-hundred-and-thirty-five pounds, her “physical state is atrocious . . . I mean, she’s lazy . . . and I know why she’s a bulging bride.”</p>
<p>It is also possible that Europe’s harsh assessment of Priya is connected to her “south-Asian” identity, and the stereotypical expectation that she be a hard-working and unemotional high achiever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1527476412457995">Wang 2010</xref>, 406–408). His determination to break her belligerent spirit ultimately culminates in a stand-off where he walks out on her in an exercise session so that she is forced to chase after him and apologize to convince him to continue to work with her. Martin Roberts, in his analysis of <italic>What Not to Wear</italic> (BBC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1527476412457995">2001</xref>), highlights the way in which this makeover program reproduces the narrative structure of a police show, becoming a story “about overcoming resistance, as the subject, like the suspect in the interrogation room, has to be broken down and eventually acquiesces to the rule of law” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1527476412457995">2007</xref>, 236). While Roberts finds that resistant subjects are central to the narrative structure and viewer appeal of <italic>What Not to Wear</italic>, resistance in <italic>TLTPB</italic> and <italic>Bulging Brides</italic> is represented by Europe as evidence that a subject does not have what it takes to change her body.</p>
<p>Even after she is forced to apologize to Europe and reaffirm her commitment to his prescribed regimen, Priya is still not keen to give up her lamb curry, nor does she feel that her diet plan should prevent her from enjoying a pre-wedding <italic>haldi</italic> purity ritual that involves being rubbed with turmeric paste and then hand-fed traditional Indian foods by her female friends and relatives. The demonizing of particular ethnic foods (and by association the cultural practices of those ethnic groups) is not uncommon in the approach to diet taken by many size-transformation programs. While the process seems to be less overtly Eurocentric on <italic>Bulging Brides</italic>, it is also difficult to evaluate accurately given the paucity of racialized brides on the program, despite Canada’s diverse multicultural population. Perhaps surprisingly, Priya’s “Payback” for her culturally based transgressions is an early morning of Bollywood dancing; as Europe admits, “I had to make it something somewhat fun for Priya, to make sure she does it.” Nonetheless, Priya’s attitude reflects her unwillingness to be subjugated and her refusal to be grateful to Europe for doing what she refers to as “his job.”</p>
<p>It is curious that this, one of the most overt forms of resistance that appears on <italic>Bulging Brides</italic>, comes from a participant with an immigrant background. It is here that we see a fragment of Canadian identity (as manifested by multicultural diversity) peeking through in a narrative of female body transformation that many scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527476412457995">Heller 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527476412457995">Jones 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1527476412457995">Matheson 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1527476412457995">Weber 2009</xref>) have identified as fundamentally American. While Canadian identity can also be seen as embodying the notions of deference, peacekeeping and respect that are illustrated by compliant (nearly all) white women on this program, the trade-off is a return to a less progressive view of the female body and character. McPhail reminds us that being overweight in 1950s and 1960s Canada “came to represent women’s doomed departure from the ideal white, middle-class nuclear family form” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527476412457995">2009</xref>, 13). This suggests that the women who comply with Europe’s demands may only be reinforcing their subjugation to traditional discourses of femininity and emotionalism, particularly as they are engaging with these demands and discourses while being constructed as “brides” with implicit obligations toward their future husbands.</p>
<p>The harder Europe tries to paint Priya as petulant and undisciplined, the more ridiculous he looks; this can be pleasurable to viewers, watching Priya’s mischievous refusal to be made to feel bad about herself, unlike the vast majority of other brides. In this instance, we have an example of the transformation narrative incorporating what Matheson calls “an ironic, skeptical reading into its representational strategies, in a sense translating a playful resistant engagement into its address to women” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1527476412457995">2010</xref>, 164). Makeover subjects who do not gush and cry about how their experience has been life-changing, but seem to feel okay about themselves as they are, help to reframe the upward mobility myth of the American (and now Canadian) Dream by repudiating the idea that the only way to “belong” is to conform to an imposed standard of beauty. This highlights a tension within discourses of citizenship between the ideas of “inclusion” and “belonging”; “a subtle difference really, but one that allow[s] for the maintaining of an outsider identity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476412457995">Bociurkiw 2011</xref>, 45). If a “combination of pleasurable and painful affects work to produce national sentiment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476412457995">Bociurkiw 2011</xref>, 48), then the fact that Priya is the child of immigrants may be part of what allows her to navigate this difference so successfully. While it may be difficult to generalize about the power of resistance afforded to some individuals doubly marked as “other” (ethnic female) based on this singular example, in the context of a “Canadianess” that is at once celebratory and suspicious of diversity, examples such as this one are perhaps more powerful for their rarity.</p>
<p>Transformation narratives such as those on <italic>Bulging Brides</italic> and <italic>TLTPB</italic> claim to offer a means of filling the empty self, for which the vast majority of deferential Canadian female participants (and many viewers too, judging by comments on blogs, online news stories, and other internet forums) appear to be grateful. The tension on these programs between the construction of the female “healthy citizen” as one who must be assimilated to arbitrary and unrealistic standards of size and weight, and one who can happily accept who she is, is particularly relevant for Canadian women given the nation’s historical reputation for better health practices than its American neighbors. Narratives of prescribed embodiment assimilation also parallel some anti-immigration discourse that asserts that “they” must learn quickly to adapt to the Canadian way of doing things, or “go back where they came from.” Multicultural identities provide Canadian women with an additional filter through which to negotiate their physical and emotional selves. Coming from families who have struggled to simultaneously embrace Canadian culture while retaining some sense of their own cultural heritage, it is possible that some women with multicultural backgrounds may find themselves more adept in resisting dominant sociocultural ideologies than their Caucasian counterparts, who have seldom been visibly marked as “other.” <italic>Bulging Brides</italic> and <italic>TLTPB</italic> may attempt to construct compliance with hegemonic beauty norms as a form of belonging and empowerment, but it remains clear that there is ultimately more power to be gained for women through resistance to these disciplinary pedagogies.</p>
