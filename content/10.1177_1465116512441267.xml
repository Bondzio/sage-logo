<abstract>
<p>Parliamentary institutions and partisan norms are complex and new members of parliament are unlikely to possess an innate awareness of optimal behaviour. This paper examines how new legislators adopt the behavioural patterns of incumbent members in the Sixth European Parliament. The latter provides an excellent opportunity to study such adaptive behaviour; in addition to newly elected members from 15 former states, new members from ten accession countries took seats for the first time. We examine how voting behaviour differs between new members from the 15 former states, new members from accession countries, and incumbent members. Our analysis shows that new members from former states defect less from their European political group than incumbents, while new accession country members defect more. Over time, the differences between these groups disappear.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1465116512441267" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>When members of parliament (MPs) are first elected to office they have a limited understanding of the demands they will face in their new position. In addition to becoming accustomed to the parliamentary rules of procedure and the various formal and informal protocols of parliamentary practice, they must also discern what their senior colleagues and fellow partisans expect of them. Inevitably, as new members gain experience they come to better understand how to interact with their new colleagues in the parliamentary arena. Although they may wish to hit the ground running as active participants in the policy-making process, they must first determine how to balance the competing demands placed on them. In particular, they must learn when they may express their own views and when they must toe the party line. But how exactly does the behaviour of new members differ from that of their senior colleagues? Do new members exhibit adaptive behaviour that reflects their increasing experience within the legislature? And how long does it take them to adopt behaviour that emulates more established members? We address these questions using roll call vote data from the Sixth European Parliament (EP).</p>
<p>The Sixth EP (2004–2009) provides a particularly good setting in which to examine how new members of parliament change their behaviour as they gain a better understanding of the demands placed upon them. In addition to newly elected members from the fifteen old EU member states (henceforth EU15), the Sixth EP marked the first time that members of the European Parliament (MEPs) from ten new member states took seats. We offer a theory to explain new member behaviour that draws on the fact that MEPs are agents of two principals – their national parties control their electoral chances, while European political groups (EPGs) affect their careers within the parliament. When these two principals disagree, members must decide whom to support. Moreover, the relative importance of these principals may vary across time within a term. Incumbent members have learned how to balance the competing demands placed on them by these principals. They have determined when they can support the EPG over the national party and when they must defect from the political group.</p>
<p>New members do not join parliament with an innate sense of how to balance these competing demands. They may make ‘mistakes’, supporting one principal more often than do incumbents. Over time, though, they adapt their behaviour, and their voting defection patterns come to mirror those of their more senior colleagues. From our theory, we derive hypotheses that we test by examining defection patterns on roll call votes over time during the Sixth EP. This project contributes to the growing literature relating to legislative behaviour and organization. In particular, our research suggests that optimal legislative strategies are a product of member experience. Members enter legislatures with some uncertainty regarding how best to pursue their goals, but update their strategies as they acquire information regarding institutional rules and practices. This finding has broad implications for both representative government and institutional design.</p>
<p>Using panel regression models we find that, at the start of the term and compared with incumbents, newly elected EU15 MEPs are less likely to defect from the majority of their EPGs on roll call votes. Over time, however, these newly elected members begin to defect more and come to mirror incumbents. MEPs from accession countries start off the term more likely to defect from their EPG majority than incumbents. Over time they, too, moderate their behaviour and come to mirror the incumbent group. Finally, we offer a discussion of our results and some concluding remarks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1465116512441267"><title>Adaptive behaviour in the EP</title>
<p>Studies of legislative behaviour have long been concerned with questions of party cohesion on roll call votes (e.g. Poole and Rosenthal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1465116512441267">1991</xref>; Cox and McCubbins, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1465116512441267">2007</xref>; Carey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1465116512441267">2009</xref>; Kam, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1465116512441267">2009</xref>). They examine why parties have become more cohesive over time, how parties exert influence over their parliamentary delegations, and the effects of institutions such as presidentialism and electoral systems. Oftentimes, MPs are seen as agents of multiple principals – on one hand, they must obey their party leadership if they wish to advance their career within the party; on the other hand, they are elected by voters who can hold them accountable by voting them out of office (Carey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1465116512441267">2009</xref>; Hix, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1465116512441267">2004</xref>). The extent to which the ‘multiple principals’ problem exists is a function of the electoral system. This tension is more pronounced in systems that encourage MPs to seek a personal vote compared with party-centered systems where parties have greater control over individual MPs' electoral fates (Carey and Shugart, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1465116512441267">1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Few studies, though, have examined how MP behaviour changes during the course of a single legislative term. Behaviour may change because the demands placed on MPs by competing principals vary systematically during the parliamentary term, specifically as elections approach (Lindstädt and Vander Wielen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1465116512441267">2011</xref>), or because MPs update the information they possess about how principals want them to behave. The latter motivation is most likely to affect MPs elected to parliament for the first time. At the start of the term, they may experience considerable uncertainty regarding the rules and norms of parliamentary behaviour. Over the course of their first term, they come to better understand the formal and informal constraints. We examine this question with respect to new members of the EP.</p>
<p>An expansive literature has examined the party system and voting behaviour in the EP (see for example, Hix et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1465116512441267">2007</xref>; Hix and Noury, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1465116512441267">2009</xref>; McElroy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1465116512441267">2007</xref>). The most common goals of EP roll call studies have been to explore the cohesiveness of the EPGs (Faas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1465116512441267">2003</xref>; Hix, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1465116512441267">2004</xref>; Hix et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1465116512441267">2005</xref>) and to examine coalition formation in the EP (Kreppel and Tsebelis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1465116512441267">1999</xref>; Hix et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1465116512441267">2007</xref>). The increased importance (and cohesion) of these political groups has been taken as evidence of the EP's increased institutionalization (Kreppel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1465116512441267">2002</xref>; Hix et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1465116512441267">2007</xref>). But why do MEPs defect from the political groups they have joined?</p>
<p>To understand the nature of party competition and coalition formation in the EP, we must consider that MEPs are agents of two principals (Hix, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1465116512441267">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1465116512441267">2004</xref>). National parties run EP election campaigns to elect their members, but once MEPs take their seats, national party delegations join with other like-minded national delegations to form EP political groups (McElroy and Benoit, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1465116512441267">2010</xref>). Thus, national party leadership controls MEPs' electoral prospects, while the political group leadership can shape their careers inside the EP. When the goals of these principals conflict, MEPs must decide with whom to side. Numerous recent studies have highlighted how the tension between national party leadership and EPGs affects MEP behaviour within the parliament (e.g. Faas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1465116512441267">2003</xref>; Slapin and Proksch, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1465116512441267">2010</xref>; Lindstädt et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1465116512441267">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Needless to say, the interaction among national parties, national party delegations within the EP, and EP political groups is highly complex. National parties, in particular those in the national opposition, increasingly use their delegations in the EP as a means of policy oversight at the EU level (Proksch and Slapin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1465116512441267">2010</xref>). At the same time, national parties must ensure that their EP delegations do not stray too far from the policy goals of the party at home (Messmer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1465116512441267">2003</xref>; Lindstädt et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1465116512441267">2011</xref>). Political groups, on the other hand, wish to impose discipline on their members to pass legislation. They, too, have some power to punish dissidents and reward loyalists through the handing out of committee assignments, reports, and other perks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1465116512441267">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Both national parties and political groups play a role in the progression of MEPs' careers, and both are likely to influence MEPs' decision-making calculi. Yet, new members do not enter parliament with an instantaneous and complete understanding of how to handle the partisan pressures they face. There is clearly a learning curve, a fact acknowledged by policymakers and observers alike. Russell Patten, chief executive of the Brussels consultancy Grayling, for example, has attributed the underrepresentation of new member state MEPs among committee chairs to their lack of experience, saying ‘it took many of them a couple of years just to get used to the way the Parliament works’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1465116512441267">2</xref></sup> Others have found that new member state MEPs are also underrepresented among rapporteurs, perhaps due to their inexperience (Hurka and Kaeding, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1465116512441267">2011</xref>). New MEPs from member states with more experience in the EU must learn the ropes as well. MEP Dr. Kay Swinburne, a British Conservative Party member who first entered the EP in 2009, acknowledged experiencing a ‘steep learning curve […] getting to grips with the way in which you can make a difference here’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1465116512441267">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In short, incumbents are better able to discern strategies that contribute to both electoral and policy-making success than those with no previous experience in office. Moreover, we might expect that MEPs who adopt suboptimal strategies are less likely to gain reelection. Because of their inexperience, new MEPs do not automatically know under which circumstances to support which principal. Rather, they enter the parliament with a degree of uncertainty regarding how to weight the importance of principals. At the start of the term, they may err in one direction or the other too often. They may support their national party over their political group, or vice versa, more often than incumbents do. Over time, though, they acquire information regarding whom they need to support in order to advance their career within the parliament. A member's capacity to make such an assessment is a function of her experience as a legislator (Stratmann, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1465116512441267">2000</xref>). As they gain experience over the course of a term, new members' behaviour should come to mirror that of incumbents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1465116512441267">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Sixth EP offers a particularly interesting opportunity to examine how these competing principals shape MEP behaviour. At the start of the Sixth EP, there was an influx of new MEPs due to the expansion of the EU to ten new member states. Therefore, some incoming freshmen belonged to national parties with experience in the EP, while others were members of national parties that were themselves new to the EP. Given the disparity in EP experience across national parties in this term, we cannot necessarily expect new MEPs from EU15 on the one hand and accession states on the other to have faced the same starting balance of pressures from their national parties and party groups. Instead, it is quite plausible that the comparative demands from party principals were substantially different across these groups of freshmen given that some national parties had themselves little appreciable knowledge of how to optimally apply pressure to their MEPs. As a result, differences in the balance of pressures could cause freshmen from these groups to err in systematically different ways. For instance, a freshman whose national party exerts far more pressure than her party group may be more inclined to err in favor of her national party (by mistakenly defecting from her party group) than other freshmen with more equitable pressures from party principals. Therefore, we expect new members across the EU15 and accession states to behave differently from one another upon entering the legislature, and both groups of freshmen to behave differently from incumbents.</p>
<p>Efforts to refine our expectations for behavioural differences across new members from EU15 and accession states are more tentative. On the one hand, national parties with minimal experience in the EP may pay little attention to decision-making in the body, and may therefore tend to ignore the activities of their MEPs to a larger extent than parties with more experience. On the other hand, national parties with little EP experience may, at first, place excessive pressure on their members before they come to realize the benefits of collective behaviour through repeated legislative activity in the EP. Much literature has argued that members of any organization (or alliance) must repeatedly interact in order to generate meaningful organizational cooperation (Gulati, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1465116512441267">1995</xref>; Jones and George, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1465116512441267">1998</xref>). National parties may recognize the returns to legislative cooperation only over time, leading them to temper independent ambitions. This would imply that new members from accession states may initially experience greater national party pressures than their counterparts from EU15 countries, whose national parties have a history of collective action in the EP.</p>
<p>There is some preliminary evidence to support the latter conjecture. Examining roll call data from the first 18 months of the Sixth EP, Voeten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1465116512441267">2009</xref>) finds that while enlargement has not changed the EP's overall ideological structure, MEPs from new member states do exhibit different behaviour (see also Bailer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1465116512441267">2009</xref>; Hix and Noury, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1465116512441267">2009</xref>). He finds that Poole's (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1465116512441267">2000</xref>) two-dimensional spatial voting model does not explain the roll call votes of MEPs from Eastern Europe as well as it does votes cast by EU15 MEPs. In addition, he finds evidence of more national voting and lower political group cohesion among Eastern European MEPs, especially those from Poland and the Czech Republic. Bailer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1465116512441267">2009</xref>) has also found evidence that MEPs from accession states had more frequent contact with their national parties than their colleagues from EU15 states at the beginning of the Sixth term. In short, evidence exists that both new accession state MEPs and their national parties behave differently, showing (and demanding) more national party support than other MEPs (and national parties) early in the term.</p>
<p>Therefore, we expect freshmen from accession states to exhibit party group defection practices that reflect adaptive behaviour at the individual and perhaps even at the national party level. The national parties from accession countries had to learn to work with other parties in their EPG. They, too, had to determine an optimal strategy when exercising control over their members. This means that changes in the behaviour of accession country freshmen across time may well be the product of updating by both individual MEPs and their national parties. Since national parties and individual MEPs from accession states have identical exposure to the EP, we cannot disentangle the precise effect that adaptive behaviour at the individual versus national party level has on observed defection practices. Nonetheless, we suggest that the behaviour of EU15 freshmen provides a useful guidepost. Namely, the initial behavioural differences exhibited by EU15 freshmen compared to incumbents at the beginning of the term and their subsequent changes in behaviour can more clearly be attributed to individual-level adaptive behaviour. Evidence of adaptive behaviour by EU15 freshmen suggests, at the very least, that individual-level adaptations play a role in the observed changes in defection practices among new members in general. On the basis of the above theoretical claims, we arrive at the following hypotheses.
<list id="list1-1465116512441267" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>H1:</bold> New MEPs entering the EP behave differently from incumbent MEPs when deciding whether to defect from their EP political groups on roll call votes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>H2:</bold> New MEPs from EU15 member states adopt different defection practices than new MEPs from accession states.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>H3:</bold> The differences in defection practices between both groups of new MEPs and incumbents dissipate over time.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In sum, we suggest that new members, who have yet to adopt optimal strategies for balancing competing demands, are likely to over- or under-value certain principals, leading them to assume different defection practices relative to more senior members who have a greater understanding of the system (H1). All new members did not, however, enter the Sixth EP with uniform pressures from national parties and party groups. Members from accession states belong to national parties with no history of collective action within the EP. These MEPs likely face more or less pressure from their national parties than new members from EU15 states (see H2). Importantly, if differences across freshmen and incumbents are a function of information asymmetries, then freshman behaviour should increasingly resemble that of incumbents as they gain institutional experience and close the informational gap (see H3). Our empirical analysis of panel roll call data from the Sixth EP (2004–2009), which we describe in detail in the next section, provides support for our three hypotheses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1465116512441267"><title>Data and methods</title>
<p>Because the Sixth EP (2004–2009) witnessed the election of three different groups – incumbents as well as freshmen from EU15 countries and freshmen from ten new member states – it lends itself well to empirically testing theoretical predictions about adaptive legislative behaviour. Of course, the election of these three distinct groups is not unique to the Sixth EP. Since the first direct elections of the EP in 1979, there have been three other expansion rounds – Greece (1981), Spain and Portugal (1986), and Austria, Finland, and Sweden (1995). However, there are several reasons why the previous expansion rounds (occurring during the first, second, and fourth EP terms, respectively) do not lend themselves as well to studying the dynamics of adaptive behaviour. First, the EP was not as institutionalized or prominent an actor as it became with the onset of the Fifth EP and the expansion of the codecision procedure. The emergence of two principals – national parties and EPGs – materialized only once the EP had gained sufficient powers within the EU political system that EPG discipline became plausible. Without power to affect the policy-making process, there is little incentive for EPG leaders to organize and constrain their members' behaviour (Kreppel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1465116512441267">2002</xref>). This sets the stage for potentially competing demands on MEPs from their national party and their political group. Another advantage of the Sixth EP is the EP's increasing reliance on roll call votes over time. For the Sixth EP, there are sufficient data to allow us to track an MEP's voting behaviour throughout the term, while for earlier terms the number of roll call votes tends to be insufficient to allow for fine-grained time-dependent analysis. Lastly, expansion in May 2004 corresponded very closely with EP elections and the start of the Sixth EP. Thus, MEPs from accession countries joined the EP at the same time as freshmen from the EU15.</p>
<p>We study MEP voting behaviour over time by dividing the EP term by month. We argue that months are the smallest meaningful time unit for which we can assess defection counts. The reason for choosing the smallest feasible unit of time is to capture as much detail of the adaptation process as possible. The resulting data set is a panel with the dimensions defined by individual members and time. It is comprised of 810 MEPs who served at some point during the course of the Sixth EP, with 601 of these MEPs having served for the complete duration of the term. Throughout the analysis, we use two data sets – one including all MEPs who served during the Sixth EP and another restricted data set consisting only of MEPs who served for the entire term. We find there to be a more compelling rationale for using the restricted data set, since MEPs who served only a partial term may not have had sufficient time to adapt their behaviour to the institutional context. From both data sets, we exclude MEPs from Bulgaria and Romania (96 members), who joined in 2007, three years into the EP term, as well as those who began the parliamentary term as non-attached members, unaffiliated with an EPG (34 members). It would not have been appropriate to consider Bulgarian and Romanian MEPs as part of the 2004 accession countries since they would have had more limited exposure to legislative behaviour and practices than other countries' MEPs. Moreover, considering them as a separate group would create an imbalanced panel. We exclude the non-attached members as they do not have two principals and, therefore, our theory does not apply to them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1465116512441267">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of the 810 MEPs in our full data set, 309 were first-time members from EU15 member states and another 171 came from newly admitted EU member states. In other words, only approximately 41 percent of the membership of the Sixth EP had served in the previous Fifth EP. We divide members into three categories – incumbents from EU15 states (41%), newly elected members from EU15 states (38%) and newly elected members from new member states (21%) – and examine differences in voting behaviour among these groups over time. To capture the tension that MEPs experience from competing principals over the course of the legislative term (see Lindstädt et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1465116512441267">2011</xref>), we use MEPs' monthly count of defections from the majority of their EPG as our dependent variable. The data used for generating the dependent variable come from Hix et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1465116512441267">2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1465116512441267">6</xref></sup> Following Hix et al., we recode the roll call vote data such that every MEP vote is recorded as either 0 or 1. In particular, for absolute majority votes <italic>present but did not vote</italic>, <italic>absent</italic>, and <italic>not an MEP</italic> are recoded as missing values, and <italic>no</italic> and <italic>abstain</italic> as 0. The coding for simple majority votes differs from that of absolute majority votes only in that <italic>abstain</italic> is coded as missing rather than 0.</p>
<p>The defection variable is a dichotomous measure that assigns a value of 1 to individual roll call votes in which an MEP voted contrary to the majority of her party group, and zero otherwise. The monthly defection count variable simply sums the instances of defections by month for a given MEP. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1465116512441267">Figure 1</xref> shows the number of roll calls for each month used to construct the monthly defection counts for each member. The <italic>N</italic> of the final data set is 42,930.

</fig></p>
<p>Our primary interest in this project is determining whether MEPs engage in adaptive behaviour that reflects legislative experience. In particular, we are interested in assessing whether new MEPs adopt legislative behaviour (on roll call votes) that, over time, resembles the behaviour of more experienced members. This presupposes that incumbents have acquired a (reasonably) optimal strategy of balancing competing demands during their tenure in the EP. Of course, we cannot claim that this model identifies the specific process(es) by which new members update their behaviour. Such a model is beyond the scope of this article. In fact, gaining empirical traction on these processes is quite difficult, not least because (1) theoretical models aimed at identification are in short supply (but see Young, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1465116512441267">2009</xref>), and (2) where theoretical identification has been achieved, lack of suitable data often impedes empirical testing.</p>
<p>Therefore, we remain agnostic as to the precise mechanism that generates behavioural adaptations. There are several viable possibilities. For one, new members may undergo a socialization process, in which they adopt the behavioural traits of existing members as they assimilate into the organization. Members may also adopt behaviours through learning processes. There are several competing models of learning (i.e. behaviour diffusion), ranging from mere exposure to a behavioural practice to the evaluation of practices on the basis of observed rewards/sanctions. It seems most plausible to us that members learn (via some diffusion process) the preferences of party principals and gain a better understanding of how to balance these demands. This is not to say that this process alone is responsible for adaptive behaviour, as learning could certainly occur concurrently with other processes. Whatever the mechanism responsible, an observation of behavioural adaptation provides evidence that legislating is an acquired skill that demands some duration of experience. Empirically, we allow for the possibility that freshmen from EU15 countries and freshmen from accession countries go through distinct, and possibly different, adaptive processes. In particular, it is plausible that EU15 freshmen draw on the experience of incumbent members in their national party delegation, which clearly would have an effect on the adaptive process. Freshmen from accession countries, on the other hand, do not have the luxury of consulting incumbent members from their national party delegation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1465116512441267">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Before describing our modelling strategy, one further note of caution is warranted regarding our dependent variable. The use of roll call votes as data in the EP is certainly not uncontroversial. Some scholars have examined selection bias in roll calls, and have found that using roll calls can lead to biased estimates of ideology and party cohesion (Carrubba et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1465116512441267">2006</xref>). In the EP, approximately one third of all votes are roll calls. The remaining two thirds are taken either by a show of hands or by electronic vote where the outcome of the vote is recorded, but not the positions taken by the individual MEPs. Nevertheless, because our interest lies in studying changes in voting behaviour over time, we argue that the non-random nature of roll call votes does not pose a problem for our analysis. Carrubba et al.'s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1465116512441267">2006</xref>) analysis is primarily a note of caution to researchers who use roll call votes to estimate ideology and EPG cohesiveness. In this paper, we are not interested in estimating the variation in cohesion across groups, but rather in MEPs' support for their EPGs across time on a highly visible form of parliamentary behaviour subject to partisan pressure from both national parties and EPG. We believe that analysis of roll call votes is the best way to assess such defection behaviour. The fact that roll call votes, in the aggregate, may be more partisan (i.e. exhibiting greater cohesion within political groups) than decisions that are not subject to a roll call does not preclude time-dependent variation consistent with our theory. We also have no reason to believe that these selection effects advantage our theory. In fact, an argument could be made that the selection bias found in roll call data disadvantages our theory in the empirical analysis, since according to Carrubba et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1465116512441267">2006</xref>), roll call votes tend to overestimate EPG cohesion. By definition, this implies fewer defections by MEPs from their EPG across time, making it less likely that we find a statistically significant result.</p>
<p>For our empirical analysis of monthly MEP defections from the majority of their political group, we rely on generalized estimating equation (GEE) population-averaged models. GEE models are particularly suitable in the current context because they are designed to deal with correlated data structures, they provide flexibility with respect to the specification of within-group correlation structures, and they offer distinct advantages over the main alternatives – random effects and fixed effects models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1465116512441267">Zorn, 2001</xref>). Specifically, fixed effects models tend to be rather impractical when the number of groups is fairly large, and random effects models assume that the random effects are uncorrelated with the covariates (Zorn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1465116512441267">2001</xref>) Since our dependent variable is a count, we use a Poisson GEE model with a log link that clusters on MEPs. The GEE model takes the following general form.

</p>
<p>In equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1465116512441267">1</xref>), ln λ<sub><italic>it</italic></sub> is the log of the mean defection count for individual <italic>i</italic> in time period <italic>t</italic>. Since GEE is a population-averaged model, it does not explain each individual defection but rather the average defection count for an individual within a given time period. The independent variables are given by the vector <inline-formula id="ilm1-1465116512441267"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-1465116512441267"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext mathvariant="bold">x</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext mathvariant="bold">it</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and the coefficients by the vector <bold>β</bold>. The variance of the defection count for a given individual and time period, <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub>, is equal to the mean defection for that individual and time period. Finally, the within-group variance over time is given by <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and defined by the generic correlation structure <inline-formula id="ilm2-1465116512441267"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math2-1465116512441267"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>φ</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. Here, we assume an AR1 structure (<italic>R</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(α) in equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1465116512441267">1</xref>)) for the within-MEP correlation over time. We estimate the model with robust standard errors using the sandwich estimator (Williams, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1465116512441267">2000</xref>; Rogers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1465116512441267">1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The model includes a number of independent variables, represented by the vector <inline-formula id="ilm3-1465116512441267"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math3-1465116512441267"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext mathvariant="bold">x</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext mathvariant="bold">it</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> in equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1465116512441267">1</xref>). In particular, we include a dummy variable for freshmen MEPs from EU15 countries (<italic>Freshman MEP</italic>), a dummy variable for freshmen MEPs from accession countries (<italic>New Member State MEP</italic>), a time counter (<italic>Time</italic>) as well as the time counter raised to the second power (<italic>Time</italic><sup>2</sup>), and interactions between the freshmen dummies and the time counter (<italic>Freshman MEP</italic> × <italic>Time</italic> and <italic>New Member State MEP</italic> × <italic>Time</italic>). We include a quadratic polynomial of time since tests indicate that the functional relationship between time and defections is best characterized by this specification. Moreover, in order to capture the timing of convergence in defection behaviour across groups, nonlinear movement must be permitted. We expect the variables <italic>Freshman MEP</italic> and <italic>New Member State MEP</italic> to be statistically discernible from one another, suggesting that freshmen from EU15 countries experience a different adaptive process from members of accession countries.</p>
<p>A variable, termed <italic>NP-EPG Left–Right Difference</italic>, is also included to capture the distance between national parties and their EPG on a general left–right dimension – the dominant dimension of conflict in the EP (Hix, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1465116512441267">2002</xref>; Hix et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1465116512441267">2007</xref>). MEPs belonging to national parties that are more ideologically distant from their EPG are expected to defect with greater frequency across the entire term. Moreover, there is evidence that MEPs from accession countries were more right-wing than EU15 MEPs, suggesting that a control for left–right ideology is warranted (Farrell et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1465116512441267">2006</xref>). As a measure of distance between the national parties and their EPG, we rely on Benoit and Laver's (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1465116512441267">2006</xref>) measure of national party positions and McElroy and Benoit's (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1465116512441267">2012</xref>) measure of EPG positions. Both measures are based on data from expert surveys, and so these measures are exogenous to the phenomenon of interest. In both surveys, experts were asked to place parties on a 1–20 scale capturing a general left–right dimension. We simply calculate the absolute distance between the national party position and the position of the EPG. In addition, we estimate a model including the variable <italic>NP Position EU Integration</italic>, which measures the position of the MEP's national party on EU integration and is based on data from an expert survey conducted by Hooghe et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1465116512441267">2010</xref>). The variable ranges from 1 (strongly opposed to European integration) to 7 (strongly in favor of European integration). We expect higher values on this scale – more favorable views on EU integration – to result in a downward shift of a national party delegation's intercept, or, stated differently, a lower baseline defection rate for members of that national party delegation. In the following discussion, we refer to the <italic>NP-EPG Left–Right Difference</italic> and <italic>NP Position EU Integration</italic> variables collectively as ‘position’ variables.</p>
<p>Finally, we include an exposure variable in the form of the logged number of votes per month – <italic>log(Votes)</italic>. Exposure variables are typically included in Poisson models to give a baseline for the likelihood of observing the behaviour of interest, thereby correcting for the common problem of overdispersion (e.g. see Cameron and Trivedi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1465116512441267">1998</xref>; Gelman and Hill, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1465116512441267">2007</xref>). The coefficient for the exposure variable <italic>log(Votes)</italic>, as is the typical approach, is set equal to 1 during the estimation. This accounts for the variation in the number of votes across months shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1465116512441267">Figure 1</xref>, and therefore corrects for unevenness in the possible number of defections from one month to the next.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1465116512441267">8</xref></sup> Web appendix A provides descriptive statistics for the aforementioned variables.</p>
<p>In the next section, we present the results of our empirical analysis, and discuss the predicted effects as well as various robustness tests.</p>

<p>The GEE model outlined in the previous section allows us to assess the effect of group membership on MEPs' average monthly defection behaviour. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1465116512441267">Table 1</xref> presents the results of six GEE models in which the dependent variable measures the monthly count of defections by an MEP from at least a simple majority of her EPG.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1465116512441267">9</xref></sup> As there are multiple roll call votes in each month (for the exact distribution, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1465116512441267">Figure 1</xref>), the GEE model estimates the effect of the independent variables on the <italic>average</italic> defection count per month (ln λ<sub><italic>it</italic></sub> in equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1465116512441267">1</xref>)).

For all models, the dependent variable is an MEP's monthly defection count, where the count refers to defections from at least a simple majority of the political group.

</table-wrap></p>
<p>Columns labelled ‘All MEPs’ show the results of the GEE models for the unrestricted data set (i.e., data including all MEPs that served for any duration during the Sixth EP), while columns labelled ‘Full Term MEPs’ show the results of the models for the restricted data set (i.e. data including only MEPs that served for the entire EP term). As a robustness check, we also estimate the models both with and without the position variables – <italic>NP-EPG Left–Right Difference</italic> and <italic>NP Position EU Integration</italic>. The reason for doing so is that we do not have position data for all of the national parties in the data set (i.e. the Hooghe et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1465116512441267">2010</xref>, and Benoit and Laver, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1465116512441267">2006</xref>, data do not account for all national parties in our data set), and thus inclusion of these variables further decreases the <italic>N</italic>. Coefficients with negative/positive signs indicate that an increase in the variable of interest reduces/enhances the average defection count.</p>
<p>First, we consider the coefficients for the variables <italic>Freshman MEP</italic> and <italic>New Member State MEP</italic>. In particular, we are interested in the effect that being a freshman from an EU15 country and being a freshman from a new member state has on average monthly defection counts when compared to EU15 incumbent MEPs. These variables directly address H1 and H2. In particular, the argument is that EU15 incumbents have had ample time to find the optimal balance to respond to competing demands from their respective national parties and EPGs. The same cannot be said for freshmen from EU15 or accession states. We hypothesize that, at the outset of the term, these groups defect at different rates relative to one another and incumbents.</p>
<p>We find that the coefficient on <italic>Freshman MEP</italic> is negative and statistically significant in each of the models, which points to a statistically discernible difference between EU15 incumbents and EU15 freshmen in terms of defection behaviour. Specifically, EU15 freshmen have an average monthly defection count that is lower than the corresponding count for incumbents. This suggests that EU15 freshmen are more cautious in their defection behaviour than their incumbent counterparts.</p>
<p>Conversely, the coefficient on <italic>New Member State MEP</italic> is positive and statistically significant across the models, which further confirms a statistically discernible difference between accession country MEPs and EU15 incumbents. By transitivity, we can also conclude that a statistically meaningful difference exists between freshmen from EU15 and accession countries. Compared to EU15 freshmen, accession country MEPs take a much more aggressive approach to defecting from their EPG. Of course, these are just the baseline effects for group membership. But as stated in H3, we expect that these differences between freshmen and incumbents slowly dissipate as the legislative term progresses. We test this hypothesis by including the quadratic polynomial terms of time (<italic>Time</italic> and <italic>Time</italic><sup>2</sup>) as well as interactions between the time counter and the dummy variables for freshmen from EU15 countries and freshmen from new member states (<italic>Freshman MEP</italic> × <italic>Time</italic> and <italic>New Member State MEP</italic> × <italic>Time</italic>, respectively).</p>
<p>The coefficient on the time counter (<italic>Time</italic>) is positive and statistically significant, which indicates that the defection count initially rises with every additional month. This finding makes sense, as we expect incumbent MEPs to increasingly vote with their national party rather than their political group as elections draw near. At the same time, the negative and statistically significant coefficient on the squared time counter (<italic>Time</italic><sup>2</sup>) indicates that the increase in defection counts over time occurs at a decreasing rate. Looking at the interaction between EU15 freshmen and time (<italic>Freshman MEP</italic> × <italic>Time</italic>), we can see that it is positive and statistically significant across models, indicating that the defections by EU15 freshmen, who have a lower baseline defection count than incumbents, increase at a faster rate than those of incumbents, leading to convergence in behaviour over time. Similarly, considering the interaction between accession country freshmen and time (<italic>New Member State MEP</italic> × <italic>Time</italic>), we notice that the coefficient is negative and statistically significant, suggesting that accession country freshmen, who are initially more aggressive in their defection behaviour than incumbents, close the gap with incumbents over time as well (from the opposite direction than EU15 freshmen).</p>
<p>Finally, the variable measuring the distance between the left–right positions of national parties and their EPG (<italic>NP-EPG Left–Right Difference</italic>) proves to be positive and statistically significant, as expected. This suggests that an increase in the ideological distance between national parties and their EPG results in higher defection rates among respective MEPs. Furthermore, national party position on European integration (<italic>NP Position on EU Integration</italic>) has a negative and statistically significant effect on MEP defections, also as expected. Therefore, an increase in support for EU integration reduces the expected defection count. In other words, with increasing commitment to EU integration, MEPs exhibit greater solidarity with their party group. We argue that these variables are important to include in our empirical analysis both because they speak to the predilection that national party delegations might have to support their party group, and because they offer an additional robustness check for our key independent variables. Importantly, we find that the inclusion of these variables does not substantively alter our central findings.</p>
<p>We note again that these models also include an exposure variable (<italic>log(Votes)</italic>), the coefficient for which, by definition of an exposure variable, is set to 1. This corrects for the problem of overdispersion that typically occurs in models of the Poisson family. Furthermore, the model assumes an AR1 within-MEP correlation of the errors. The Wald χ<sup>2</sup> statistic indicates that we can reject the null hypothesis that all of the coefficients are jointly equal to zero.</p>
<p>We include additional models in web appendix B as robustness checks. The independent variables included in these models are identical to those appearing in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1465116512441267">Table 1</xref>, the sole difference being the specification of the dependent variable. While the dependent variable for the models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1465116512441267">Table 1</xref> is the monthly count of defections by an MEP from at least a simple majority of her EPG, in web appendix B we instead classify a vote as a defection if a member votes against at least 60 percent of her EPG. The results of the models using the 60 percent threshold are impressively robust. The coefficient signs are consistent across similar models using the different specification for the dependent variable, and in all but one case the variables retain statistical significance at conventional levels. The sole exception is the coefficient on the variable <italic>New Member State MEP</italic> × <italic>Time</italic> in the ‘All MEPs’ model excluding the position variables, although it is still marginally statistically significant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1465116512441267">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Returning to the discussion of our core models, which measure defections from a simple majority of the party group (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1465116512441267">Table 1</xref>), we simulate defection counts across the three groups of MEPs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1465116512441267">Figure 2</xref> fits local polynomial smoothers with 95 percent confidence intervals to the predicted defection counts by MEP group for the models including the variables <italic>NP-EPG Left–Right Difference</italic> (Panels (a) and (b)) and <italic>NP Position EU Integration</italic> (Panels (c) and (d)). In doing so, we hold the number of monthly votes constant at their mean and allow all other variables to assume their observed values. The figure captures the over-time convergence of defection counts across groups and the differences in behaviour between freshmen from new and existing member states.

</fig></p>
<p>While freshmen from new member states tend to defect more than incumbents at first, freshmen from existing member states tend to defect less than incumbents. By the end of the term, all three groups converge on roughly the same number of defections. We note that some divergence in our predictions in the final month(s) is not entirely surprising considering that the conditions on the polynomial terms would have to be extraordinarily precise in order to achieve perfect convergence in the final month of analysis. Since we generate predictions based on actual data, and offer an empirical model driven by a parsimonious theory, there is bound to be some degree of slippage. Nonetheless, the empirical predictions are strikingly consistent with our theoretical expectations, and in most cases two groups of MEPs have defection rates that are statistically indiscernible in the final month of analysis.</p>
<p>Considering that the average number of monthly defections in the EP is relatively small, the differences in predicted defection rates across the categories of MEPs at the outset of the Sixth EP are substantively meaningful. The differences in mean predicted defection rates across accession freshmen and incumbents, incumbents and EU15 freshmen, and accession freshmen and EU15 freshmen are approximately 22, 31, and 52 percent of the average monthly defection rate, respectively. It is also worth noting that we likely understate the occurrence of defections, since roll call analysis in the EP has been shown to systematically overestimate EPG cohesion (Carrubba et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1465116512441267">2006</xref>). More importantly, though, we believe our contribution lies in finding evidence that MEPs who are new to the EP update their legislative behaviour over time to mimic the behaviour of more experienced MEPs. The substantive importance of this project relates to the process of adaption among members and not the number of defections. Therefore, we suggest that the manner in which defection behaviour changes across time is far more central to our contribution than the magnitude of the defection rates. Defection practices are merely the vehicle by which we examine adaptive behaviour.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1465116512441267" sec-type="discussion|conclusion"><title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>Much has been written about the effects of competing principals on MEPs' voting behaviour. At times, the European political groups and their national party delegations disagree, placing competing demands on MEPs. Experienced MEPs know when to obey which principal. New members, though, cannot be expected to inherently possess this knowledge. They must learn how to respond to these competing pressures over their time in office. They should behave differently from incumbents at the start of the term, but come to mirror incumbents' behaviour (at least with regard to defections from political groups) by the end of the term.</p>
<p>Our results demonstrate that new MEPs do behave differently than incumbents. Moreover, new members from accession countries behave differently when compared to new members from EU15 countries, likely due to different levels of national party experience in the EP. The new members from EU15 states exhibit greater willingness to support their EP group, while new members from accession countries more often side with their national party. Over time, though, both groups of freshmen learn how to respond to the demands of their competing principals. By the end of the term, defection counts for both freshmen groups converge to that of incumbents.</p>
<p>This article is among the first to thoroughly examine the effects of Eastern accession on voting behaviour in the EP, as well as how member behaviour changes across time within a parliamentary term. Our findings offer strong support for the claim that new legislators initially engage in behaviour that reflects information deficits. As they acquire knowledge regarding the rules and practices of the institution, their behaviour increasingly resembles that of more experienced members who have had time to develop viable strategies. This work demonstrates that legislating, and particularly balancing competing demands, is a skill that members learn on the job. It is neither innate nor immediately acquired.</p>
<p>This finding has important implications for our understanding of legislative behaviour and, more generally, the functioning of the legislative organization. Our results suggest that members operate with a comparatively high level of uncertainty early in their legislative careers. That is, legislators are likely to adopt suboptimal behaviours and practices in areas in which they have limited experience. In turn, this finding has implications for the quality of representation that inexperienced lawmakers provide. A legislature that is populated by a sufficient number of unseasoned legislators could well see this inexperience have a direct bearing on policy output. The adverse effects of legislative inexperience are at least partially responsible for the heightened barriers to membership that are characteristic of institutionalized organizations.</p>

<fn id="fn4-1465116512441267"><label>4</label><p>The literature on socialization, primarily drawing on a supranational or social constructivist approaches, also suggests that new members may behave differently than incumbents. This literature argues that EU officials become more favorable towards EU integration over time because they join a community working towards the shared norm of European integration (e.g. Schmitter, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1465116512441267">1971</xref>; Checkel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1465116512441267">2001</xref>). However, empirical support for such socialization is generally weak (see Franklin and Scarrow, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1465116512441267">1999</xref>; Hooghe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1465116512441267">2005</xref>; Scully, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1465116512441267">2005</xref>). With regard to the EP, Scully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1465116512441267">2005</xref>) finds that new MEPs vote no differently than incumbents on three key roll call votes and little evidence that they change their behaviour with regard to defections from their EP political group over the first few months of the term. Our concern, though, is not whether new MEPs change their attitudes towards the goal of EU integration over time, but whether they change their behaviour to more closely mirror the behaviour of incumbents. We expect that new members will update the weight assigned to their party principals as they become increasingly accustomed to the rules and norms of partisan control in the parliament.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn5-1465116512441267"><label>5</label><p>We also construct a restricted data set dropping MEPs who switched EPGs during the course of the Sixth EP. Party switching is more common in the EP than in most national parliaments (McElroy and Benoit, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1465116512441267">2009</xref>; McElroy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1465116512441267">2009</xref>). Of the 940 MEPs who served at some point during the Sixth EP, 61 MEPs, approximately 6.5 percent, switched their EPG affiliation at some stage during the term (calculated using data from Høyland et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1465116512441267">2009</xref>). Of those 61 MEPs, 13 were from Bulgaria or Romania, and are therefore dropped. An additional 25 began the term as non-attached and are dropped as well. Fourteen of those 25 non-attached MEPs briefly joined with some Bulgarian and Romanian MEPs to form the Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty (ITS) group in 2007, and then returned to being non-attached when ITS broke apart 10 months later. Thus, all members of the ITS group are excluded from our analysis. The remaining 23 party switchers come from a handful of mostly small, fringe national parties including the Italian <italic>Lega Nord</italic> and <italic>Italia dei Valori</italic>, the UK Independence Party, the League of Polish Families, and the Swedish <italic>Junilistan</italic>. The exclusion of these members from the models does not substantively alter our results.</p></fn>

These observers joined political groups and were allowed to speak in committee meetings. However, they were only allowed to observe during plenary sessions – they could not speak or vote. While these observers may have helped ease the transition for new member state parties by way of the information they had acquired about EP institutions, they would not have been particularly helpful to members and parties with respect to the optimal balance over competing party principals. Moreover, of the 162 observers in the Fifth EP, only 46 were elected to serve in the Sixth EP. We estimated a model controlling for observer status to examine whether these 46 observers behave differently from other new member state MEPs. The variable is not statistically significant, and its inclusion does not substantively affect our results. We believe that this null result implies that mere observation provides insufficient experience to MEPs regarding how to optimally balance competing demands.
