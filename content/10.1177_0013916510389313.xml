<abstract>
<p>Ecotourism in natural protected areas is receiving growing international recognition as a means to enhance sustainability. Nonetheless, research on ecotourism and, in particular, on young ecotourists segmentation is still scarce. This study aimed at segmenting the market of young tourists using a range of psychosociological factors. First, a sample of 365 young tourists was segmented on the basis of holiday motivations (considered driving factors of attitudes and behaviors). Second, each group identified was characterized by a consistent set of other psychosociological variables, such as personality traits, personal values, general environmental beliefs, and behavioral variables (ecotourism behavioral intentions and consumption habits). The results show that about 80% of the sample would be open to the ecotourism, and different communication strategies for promoting ecotourism for different segments of potential ecotourists are also proposed.</p>

<p>Several international organizations have highlighted the relevance of natural areas as social, cultural, and economic resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013916510389313">International Union for Conservation of Nature, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013916510389313">International Union for Conservation of Nature, United Nations Environment Programme, &amp; World Wildlife Fund, 1991</xref>). Ecotourism represents one of the means to link these beneficial elements. The European charter for sustainable tourism in protected areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013916510389313">Europarc Federation, 2002</xref>), that is consistent with suggestions expressed by Agenda 21 and the European Union recommendations, emphasized the growing importance of sustainable tourism for (a) increasing awareness of, and support for, protected European areas because of their importance for the future generations and (b) improving tourism management and supporting sustainable development.</p>
<p>According to the World Tourism Organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013916510389313">WTO, 2002</xref>), ecotourism (a) is an all-nature-based form of tourism in which the tourists’ main motivation is the enjoyment of wilderness and of the traditional cultures inhabiting natural areas; (b) generally includes educational content; (c) is typically, albeit not exclusively, organized for small groups of tourists by small locally owned firms; (d) minimizes the potential negative impact of tourism on the natural and cultural environment; (e) generates economic benefits for the local community (job creation and revenue); and (f) increases awareness of biodiversity conservation principles among locals and tourists. To summarize, ecotourism encompasses environmentally sustainable behaviors and also the social, cultural, and economic development of the territory and the local population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013916510389313">Bonnes &amp; Bonaiuto, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013916510389313">Carrus, Bonaiuto, &amp; Bonnes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916510389313">Donohoe &amp; Needham, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013916510389313">Holden, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013916510389313">Hunter &amp; Green, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>In light of its far-reaching potential benefits, local promotion of well-managed, environmentally sustainable ecotourism appears crucial, particularly among younger individuals because of their higher potential to spread ecological awareness in the foreseeable future. Targeting young people may enable them to create bonds with the natural environment while promoting proenvironmental attitudes and behaviors. Advertising ecotourism among young people also reflects the assumption about their active role in the construction of a more sustainable future. Young people will need to assume responsibility to preserve the current and the future quality of natural environment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013916510389313">Jensen &amp; Schnack, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013916510389313">Maggi, Beato, Fasanella, &amp; Lombardo, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Ecotourism promotion might be fostered by identifying the motivational and psychological roots of ecotourism and elaborating appropriate communication strategies for ecotourism advertisement. Such a marketing approach may prove a valuable strategy for ecotourism promotion. This approach would require examining the targets’ needs, motivations, and expectations to gain a better understanding of the elements that can affect tourism-related behavior. Identifying the factors linked to tourists’ preferences and behaviors is crucial to foreseeing their potential travel choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013916510389313">Bradley, Waliczek, &amp; Zajicek, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013916510389313">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013916510389313">Raj, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916510389313">Um &amp; Crompton, 1990</xref>). In this regard, within the social psychology literature, an influential model is the theory of planned behavior (TPB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013916510389313">Ajzen, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916510389313">1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013916510389313">2000</xref>). The TPB states that evaluations of the possible alternatives and outcomes are at the basis of individual choices. More specifically, behavioral intentions, based on the attitudes toward a specific behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, are considered the most proximal antecedents of actual behaviors.</p>
<p>Even environmental psychology research and theorizing have developed several models to understand the relationship between psychological factors and ecological choices and behaviors (such as ecotourism). According to the value–belief–norm theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013916510389313">Stern, Dietz, Abel, Guagnano, &amp; Kalof, 1999</xref>), proenvironmental attitudes and personal values are viewed as factors that can shape ecological behaviors. Values linked to historical and cultural heritage provide criteria for decisions and behavioral choices, as shown by empirical evidence in diverse behavioral domains such as recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013916510389313">Hopper &amp; Nielsen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916510389313">Nielsen &amp; Ellington, 1983</xref>) and energy saving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013916510389313">Black, Stern, &amp; Elworth, 1985</xref>). Nevertheless, individuals’ characteristics are not homogeneous and may vary according to several social and personal factors. For this reason, one marketing approach is to segment the target population into ideally homogeneous subgroups, to match the product’s specificities with the public’s specific demands (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013916510389313">Addis &amp; Podestà, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013916510389313">Christensen, Torp, &amp; Firat, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013916510389313">Jain &amp; Kaur, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013916510389313">Kotler, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013916510389313">Kotler &amp; Roberto, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013916510389313">Proctor &amp; Kitchen, 2002</xref>). Although several studies of young tourist market segmentation have been carried out, the evidence gathered so far has not been used for promoting ecotourism among the younger generation. This is surprising because youth tourist sector, aged 16 to 24, which accounts for 20% of the international tourism market, is growing faster than most other travel segments with a global volume growth of 3% to 5% a year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013916510389313">WTO, 2008</xref>). Here, we aimed at applying a marketing segmentation approach to a sample of potential young tourists.</p>

<title>Tourists and Ecotourists Segmentation</title>
<p>Consumers’ characteristics are the key elements of the marketing strategy. These represent the starting point for the identification of product qualities that better respond to consumers’ preferences. Communication strategies for promoting ecotourism could be developed on the basis of the target population’s needs, motivations, interests, and expectations, which are the driving forces behind attitudes and behaviors. Hence, it is important to apply a segmentation strategy that would identify homogeneous subsets that could be targeted by specifically tailored communication strategies.</p>
<sec id="section2-0013916510389313">
<title>Typologies</title>
<p>The social-psychological literature on tourism has offered several different theoretical or empirical types of tourists. Two of the best-known models are <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013916510389313">Cohen’s (1972)</xref> theoretical typology and the empirical typology developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013916510389313">Plog (1974</xref>, 1987). Cohen proposed a tourist typology based on the concept of need for familiarity. This typology specifies four distinct segments: (a) <italic>organized mass tourists</italic>, that is, tourists with conventional habits who seek familiar holiday situations where they feel safe; these tourists prefer to spend their leisure time in a single place, enjoying the weather, food, and comfortable resorts, and they usually dislike exciting new experiences; (b) <italic>individual mass tourists</italic>, that is, travelers who often use the same facilities as organized mass tourists but who are more likely to make more individual and independent decisions; unlike organized mass tourists, they prefer to visit more than a single place, carefully plan the tour before leaving, and look for those archeological sites, monuments, and artistic locations that make a destination unique and original; (c) <italic>explorers</italic>, that is, travelers who tend to share the same facilities preferred by mass tourists, but these individuals organize their trip by themselves and prefer going off the beaten track and getting in touch with locals; (d) <italic>drifters</italic>, that is, adventurous travelers who look for novel, diversity-oriented, and “authentic” experiences. These tourists prefer to leave home without a specific destination in mind and visit unusual destinations. For the drifters, a trip has an existential meaning, and frequently they do not even call themselves tourists.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013916510389313">Plog’s (1974</xref>, 1987) psychographic model specifies three types of travelers arranged along a continuous dimension on the basis of their personality traits. The <italic>allocentrics</italic> are placed at one extreme of this continuum. They are travelers who enjoy adventure, novelty, exciting experiences, and not-organized tours; they prefer traveling by airplane and staying in nonconventional accommodation, with minimum comforts and services; they enjoy getting in touch with different cultures and foreign populations. At the opposite extreme of the dimension, the <italic>psychocentrics</italic> are anxious travelers, with no appetite for adventures and new experiences; they choose well-known and popular destinations, enjoy relaxing activities, and prefer traveling by car and staying in conventional full-comfort resorts. The intermediate type is the <italic>midcentrics</italic>, holding the middle ground between the tried-and-true preference of the psychocentrics and the variety-seeking needs of the allocentrics.</p>
<p>Other attempts have been made to distinguish tourist segments empirically. A few of them have focused specifically on younger targets. A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013916510389313">Richards and Wilson (2003)</xref> analyzed the young tourist market in different countries (Canada, the Czech Republic, Hong Kong, Mexico, Slovenia, South Africa, Sweden, and Great Britain). On the basis of motivations and behaviors, Richards and Wilson identified three groups of young tourists: (a) <italic>backpackers</italic>, who are relatively older (above 26) and more experienced travelers; they seek novelty and contact with fellow travelers and are more likely to use specialist travel agents; their favorite destinations are South-East Asia, Australasia, and South America and tend to prefer air transport and trains or to hitchhike; they end up spending the most on their holidays because of their tendency to travel for longer periods; (b) <italic>travelers</italic>, who are driven by the need to belong and frequently visit friends and relatives during their trip; their favorite destination is North America, and they are more likely to rent a car to reach their destination; (c) <italic>tourists</italic>, who mainly seek to relax and more often use mainstream travel organizations and organized tour buses to reach their destinations. Despite the above-mentioned differences among these groups, the three types of young tourist frequently share the same kind of activities: visiting historic sites and monuments, trekking, sitting in cafes/restaurants, and shopping.</p>
<p>Even in the very specific domain of ecotourism, market segmentation typologies differ in their theoretical and empirical nature. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013916510389313">Lindberg (1991)</xref> theoretically distinguished four ecotourism market segments along a hard-to-soft spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916510389313">Laarman &amp; Durst, 1987</xref>) that takes into account the different motivations and behaviors. This approach identified (a) <italic>hardcore nature tourists</italic>—scientific researchers or individuals who travel for education-related purposes; (b) <italic>dedicated nature tourists</italic>—people traveling to protected areas to understand local, natural, and cultural history; (c) <italic>mainstream nature tourists</italic>—people who visit renowned wilderness destinations; and (d) <italic>casual nature tourists</italic>—people who come into close contact with nature only incidentally while in a holiday trip (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013916510389313">Galley &amp; Clifton, 2004</xref>). A different study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013916510389313">Weaver &amp; Lawton, 2002</xref>) identified still another typology: (a) <italic>harder ecotourists</italic>—travelers who display a strong affinity with typical proenvironmental attitudes (conservation and sustainability) and prefer traveling in small groups; harder ecotourists favor long trips with few, if any, services provided; in addition, they are physically active and enjoy challenging activities, and are experienced in making their own travel arrangements and emphasizes the function of traveling as an existential experience; (b) <italic>softer ecotourists</italic>—travelers who appreciate ecotourism but like equally more traditional holidays; softer ecotourists prefer to travel in large groups and to plan multipurpose short trips; in addition, they are not very physically active, request comforts and good quality service, and tend to rely on travel agencies and tour operators; and (c) <italic>structured ecotourists</italic>—these travelers are similar to harder ecotourists in their strong environmental commitment and their level of physical activity; nonetheless, structured ecotourists are also close to softer ecotourists in their preference for multipurpose and short trips, larger groups, and premium services.</p>
<p>Other ecotourist typologies may be found in the existing literature, such as that developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013916510389313">Palacio and McCool (1997)</xref> on the basis of travel benefits, that developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013916510389313">Blamey and Braithwaite (1997)</xref> on the basis of social values, or that developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013916510389313">Luzar, Diagne, Gan, and Henning (1998)</xref> on the basis of the new environmental paradigm. The variety of typologies found in the tourism/ecotourism literature could be partly traced back to the limited number of segmentation variables: the need for familiarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013916510389313">Cohen, 1972</xref>), personality traits and tourism habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013916510389313">Plog, 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013916510389313">1987</xref>), motivations and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013916510389313">Lindberg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013916510389313">Richards &amp; Wilson, 2003</xref>), and travel benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013916510389313">Palacio &amp; McCool, 1997</xref>). Few studies have considered a larger number of segmentation variables (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013916510389313">Weaver &amp; Lawton, 2002</xref>). This more complex and comprehensive approach seems particularly appropriate once one realizes that diverse psychosociological aspects can affect people’s holiday preferences and behavioral patterns. Furthermore, most studies on ecotourism have considered adult groups, whereas preferences for ecotourism among younger individuals remain relatively underresearched, despite the increasing economic relevance of younger cohorts for the tourism sector.</p>
<p>The study reported herein aimed at identifying sound market segments of young tourists, using a broad range of psychosociological factors. First, a sample of potential young tourists was segmented on the basis of holiday motivations as driving forces behind attitudes and behaviors; then, each group was marked by a set of psychosociological variables such as personality traits, personal values, and environmental general beliefs. Behavioral variables were also considered (ecotourism behavioral intentions and consumption behavior habits). Building on such segmentation, we will highlight the ecotourism attributes that best fit young tourists’ needs and expectations, and use this information to propose specific communication strategies for promoting ecotourism.</p>

<title>Participants and Procedure</title>
<p>A total of 365 students from high schools in the Rome area participated in the study (170 males, 188 females, 7 subjects have not reported gender, mean age 18.9). Under the supervision of a graduate student, the participants filled in a questionnaire, including the measures described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0013916510389313">
<title>Measures</title>
<p><italic>The New Ecological Paradigm</italic> Scale is a 15-item instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013916510389313">Dunlap, Van Liere, Mertig, &amp; Jones, 2000</xref>) measuring two general belief dimensions about the natural environment: an anthropocentrism dimension and an ecocentrism dimension. Responses are given on a 4-point scale, with “completely disagree” and “completely agree” as anchors. Exemplar items for the ecocentric view dimension are as follows: “We are approaching the limit the earth can support; when humans interfere with nature, it often produces disastrous consequences”; “plants and animals have as much right as humans to exist.” Exemplar items for the anthropocentric dimension are “Humans have the right to modify the natural environment to suit their needs”; “the earth has plenty of natural resources if we just learn how to develop them”; and “the balance of nature is strong enough to cope with the impact of modern industrial nations.” Satisfactory reliability was observed for the ecocentrism score (.70), but low reliability was found for the anthropocentrism scale (.52).</p>
<p>A <italic>Holiday Motivations Scale</italic> was developed ad hoc. On the basis of the psychological and sociological tourist literature (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013916510389313">Kakyom, Jeonghee, &amp; Jogaratnam, 2006</xref>), six holiday motivation dimensions tapping into the following needs were identified: knowledge, belongingness, self-actualization, relaxation and getaway, self-esteem, and fun and entertainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013916510389313">Losito, Metastasio, Rimano, &amp; Cini, 2003</xref>). The scale includes 59 items (5 to 7 items for each dimension). The participants were asked to indicate how important each item was to them on a 4-point scale (1 = <italic>not at all important</italic>; 4 = <italic>extremely important</italic>). Tapping knowledge needs, the scale contained items such as “experiencing a new culture” and “increasing knowledge about the natural environment.” For belongingness needs, the scale contained items such as “visiting friends and relatives,” “to be together with my family,” and “experiencing pleasant moments with my friends.” For self-actualization needs, exemplar items were “rediscovering myself,” “being daring and adventurous,” and “putting myself to the test.” For relaxation and escape needs, the scale contained items such as “to reduce stress,” “escaping from ordinary responsibilities,” and “being physically or emotionally refreshed.” For self-esteem needs, exemplar items read “to get prestige” and “to visit places recommended and appreciated by friends.” Finally, for fun and entertainment needs, the scale contained items such as “enjoying good weather” and “having fun or being entertained.” <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013916510389313">Table 1</xref> shows that principal component analysis (PCA) supported a five-factor structure (explaining 45.27% of the total variance): (a) conformism and social recognition (eigenvalue = 7.07), (b) knowledge and discovery (eigenvalue = 5.16), (c) escape and fun (eigenvalue = 3.17), (d) personal well-being and belonging needs (eigenvalue = 2.56), and (e) loneliness and adventure (eigenvalue = 1.95). The scree plot of eigenvalues suggested that no further factors contained reliable systematic variance. Satisfactory reliabilities were observed for the scale scores (.81, .84, .82, .78, and .60).</p>

<title>Postmaterialistic/materialistic values</title>
<p>The scale contains three separate batteries of items corresponding to potentially desirable goals at political, economic, and societal levels. Each battery is composed of four items, two referring to postmaterialistic values and the other two referring to materialistic values. The postmaterialistic values considered in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013916510389313">Inglehart’s (1977)</xref> instrument are (a) seeing that people have more to say about how things are done in their jobs and in their communities; (b) trying to make our cities and countryside more beautiful; (c) giving people more say in important political decisions about topics such as the natural environment, peace, justice, and so on; (d) protecting freedom of speech; (e) progressing toward a less impersonal and more humane society; and (f) progressing toward a society in which ideas count more than money. In contrast, the materialistic values considered are (a) maintaining a high level of economic growth, (b) making sure this country has strong defense forces, (c) maintaining order in the nation, (d) fighting rising prices, (e) achieving a stable economy, and (f) fighting crime. For each battery, the respondents were asked to choose their two most important goals.</p>

<title>Consumption habits</title>
<p>A 37-item scale was developed ad hoc for this study. The scale was based on a preliminary instrument developed by L. Cannavò (personal communication of 8 February 2006). The scale investigates how often respondents perform a set of behaviors in various domains: environmental sustainability (e.g., recycling, paying attention to energy saving, using bicycles or public transport to travel), sensitivity to issues concerning the natural environment (e.g., reading proenvironmental magazines, spending my holidays in the countryside, visiting beautiful landscapes), general knowledge and culture (e.g., visiting art exhibitions, visiting archaeological sites, reading poems and novels), and use and consumption of natural medicine and organic food (e.g., using natural medical products, using homeopathic products, eating organic food). The respondents were asked to indicate their consumption habits on a 4-point scale, ranging from 1 (<italic>never</italic>) to 4 (<italic>very often</italic>).</p>
<p>PCA, summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0013916510389313">Table 2</xref>, supported a four-factor structure (explaining 46.75% of the total variance): (a) culture and environmental awareness (eigenvalue = 4.90), (b) alcoholic beverages (eigenvalue = 2.50), (c) movement (eigenvalue = 2.06), and (d) natural remedies and biological food (eigenvalue = 1.76). The scree plot of eigenvalues suggested that no further factors reflected systematic sources of variance. Satisfactory reliabilities were observed for the scale scores (.81, .82, .71, and .62).</p>

<title>Young Tourists Segmentation</title>
<p>We assumed that analyzing holiday motivations was crucial for gaining a better understanding of people’s travel patterns. Hence, the participants were clustered using the following five dimensions emerging from the PCA on the Holiday Motivations Scale: (a) conformism and social recognition, (b) knowledge and discovery, (c) escape and fun, (d) personal well-being and belonging needs, and (e) loneliness and adventure. We decided to limit the number of clusters to a manageable number and at balancing parsimony and completeness in segmenting the sample. A five-cluster solution appeared to provide adequate group separation and parsimony of interpretation. On the basis of the group centroids, the five distinct market segments were named (a) postmodern tourists, which accounted for 63 respondents; (b) wellness tourists, which accounted for 86 respondents; (c) unconventional tourists, which accounted for 56 respondents; (d) vacationer tourists, which accounted for 79 respondents; and (e) ecotourists, which accounted for 74 respondents. The profile of each group on the holiday motivation dimensions is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0013916510389313">Table 3</xref>.

<title>Cluster 5: Ecotourists</title><p>These individuals attach the highest importance to holiday motivations on the <italic>knowledge and discovery</italic> and <italic>loneliness and adventure</italic> factors. These young tourists are interested in getting in touch with other cultures, with other ways of living, and with the natural environment.</p>
<p>Some preliminary implications may be sketched from the descriptions earlier. Young ecotourists (Cluster 5) appear more likely to visit natural protected areas compared with the other segments. Similarly, postmodern tourists (Cluster 1) appear as putting special motivational emphasis in being connected with the natural environment, compared with the other clusters. By contrast, unconventional tourists (Cluster 3) attached little importance to all the holiday motivations, even the one connected to the natural environment. Vacationer tourists (Cluster 4) seem to be less attracted by an ecotourist holiday than other segments and are rather more motivated by the possibility to escape from daily routine and having fun. Such impressionistic conclusions need further refinement (see below for DA results) and will be addressed with richer detail in the discussion.</p>
<p>Individuals in all clusters appear to hold favorable intentions to visit natural protected areas, with 81.5% of individuals across clusters holding a favorable intention. However, some differences in their intentions were also detected across groups, χ<sup>2</sup>(4) = 17.64, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. In particular, Cluster 3 individuals expressed more often no intention to practice ecotourism (standardized residual <italic>z</italic> = 2.3) compared with Cluster 1 and Cluster 5 individuals (standardized residuals −1.8 and −1.6, respectively) who rarely express a negative intention to visit natural protected areas.</p>

<sec id="section17-0013916510389313">
<title>Segments Characterization</title>
<p>The segments of young tourists identified earlier were further investigated through DA, using a set of psychosociological variables as predictors. More specifically, aggregated scores for items corresponding to the dimensions of the following scales served as predictors for group (cluster) classification: New Ecological Paradigm Scale, postmaterialistic/materialistic values instrument, Consumption Habits Scale, and the Big Five. Prior to the analysis, and to reduce the pool of predictors, we introduced only those psychosociological and personality dimensions that correlated significantly with holiday motivation dimensions. As a result, the following predictors were considered: culture and environmental awareness, intellect/openness, agreeableness, extraversion and conscientiousness, ecocentric view and anthropocentric view, and postmaterialistic values. We maintain that such an approach would render more comprehensive and ecologically valid the segments identified. Two significant canonical discriminant functions (Wilks’s Λs = .657, .853, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .01) were found to separate the five clusters described earlier.</p>
<p>The first discriminant function was saturated by culture and environmental awareness standardized rotated loading (.829), intellect/openness (.443), ecocentric view (.401), and postmaterialistic values (.460), and, negatively, anthropocentric view (−.379). The second function is saturated by agreeableness (.450) and conscientiousness (.619). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013916510389313">Figure 1</xref> presents the cluster centroids on the two canonical discrimant functions. Ecotourists are discriminated from the remaining groups on the first (horizontal) dimension, appearing as more environmentally aware, with higher scores in intellect openness, ecocentric view, and postmaterialistic values. At the opposite end of the dimension, the vacationer tourists are characterized by their anthropocentric view. The second (vertical) dimension shows how wellness tourists are characterized by higher scores on intellect/openness, compared with the other groups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this research, we aimed at identifying and describing different profiles of potential young ecotourists. A CA approach provided a sensible and theoretically useful segmentation into five groups of young tourists on the basis of their holiday motivations: (a) postmodern tourists, (b) wellness tourists, (c) unconventional tourists, (d) vacationer tourists, and (e) ecotourists. To enrich and specify the profiles further, DA differentiated significantly three of the clusters (wellness tourists, vacationer tourists, and ecotourists) on the basis of a set of psychosocial factors. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed below.</p>
<sec id="section19-0013916510389313">
<title>Theoretical Implications</title>
<p>Unlike previous research, our study targeted specifically potential young tourists and considered a broader set of segmentation variables. Nonetheless, from a theoretical standpoint, our results parallel to some extent previously identified typologies. For instance, the characteristics of the wellness tourists and ecotourists resemble those of the softer ecotourists and harder ecotourists, respectively, described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013916510389313">Weaver and Lawton (2002)</xref>. Like the softer ecotourists, the wellness tourists are more likely to prioritize comforts and services and avoid wilderness settings and physically challenging, uncomfortable, and risky experiences. Like the harder ecotourists, the ecotourists prefer sustainable behavior, intact and not popular destinations, and risky and challenging experiences. The ecotourists are also reminiscent of the drifters of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013916510389313">Cohen’s (1972)</xref> typology, of the allocentrics described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013916510389313">Plog (1974)</xref>, and of the backpackers discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013916510389313">Richards and Wilson (2003)</xref>. The wellness tourists are also reminiscent of other tourist types described in the literature. Their characteristics are similar to the psychocentrics of Plog, who, as the wellness tourists, express weak desires for adventure and novelty but appreciate familiar and popular destinations and relaxing activities. In addition, general proenvironmental attitudes crucially differentiate our three groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013916510389313">Luzar et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013916510389313">Weaver &amp; Lawton, 2002</xref>). Such attitudes refer to people’s view of the human–nature relationship and stood out as an important component of the general attitudes toward ecotourism in our sample. By means of this dimension, it is possible to place our categories along an anthropocentrism/ecocentrism theoretical continuum. At the anthropocentrism extreme of this continuum, we found the vacationer tourists and wellness tourists, whereas at the opposite extreme (ecocentrism) we can place the ecotourists.</p>
<p>Compared with previous research, we considered here a broader set of psychosocial aspects as personality traits, personal values, holiday motivations, general proenvironmental attitudes, and behavioral habits. More similarly to the approach used herein, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013916510389313">Weaver and Lawton (2002)</xref> ecotourist typology was based on a broad range of segmentation variables such as behaviors, attitudes, and motivations (actual and expected behavior with respect to their general ecotourism experiences, opinions about ecotourism, general environmental and social attitudes, motivations for visiting ecotourism destinations, and usual ecotourism activity); nonetheless, their typology did not consider personality traits and personal values, as we did here. We are confident that the broader set of psychosociological factors we focused on could substantially enhance the theoretical implications of the results and support far-reaching practical interventions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0013916510389313">
<title>Practical Implications</title>
<p>The results allow us to briefly sketch communication strategies matching the peculiarities of the different types of young potential ecotourists.</p>
<p>Wellness tourists are characterized by holiday motivations focusing on well-being promotion through sport and on close social relationships (with friends and relatives). In addition, they appreciate the good quality of the natural environment but do not neglect the availability of comforts and services. Instead, they try to avoid adventure and uncertainty. Wellness tourists are best characterized by agreeableness and conscientiousness. Most of them, although less frequently than the ecotourists, express a willingness to visit natural protected areas. In general, this group of tourists reveals positive attitudes toward ecotourism. Nevertheless, such positive attitudes rest on an anthropocentric view of the human–nature relationship: They appreciate nature as far as it can benefit personal well-being and the quality of the tourism experience. A communication strategy specifically tailored to this group could target these individuals’ preference for holidays that provide psychophysical well-being, socialization, a good-quality natural environment, services, and comfort. Wellness tourists could be persuaded to approach ecotourism experiences by emphasizing the chance that ecotourism offers to take care of themselves, to enjoy a walk on comfortable and safe paths, and to relax surrounded by human-friendly natural environments. Also, hinting at the possibility of enjoying good-quality (though sustainable) services and comforts and the opportunity of experiencing interesting social relationships would be likely to catch their attention. Instead, it would be advisable to omit the possibility of experiencing unusual and adventurous situations when targeting the wellness tourists, as they do not appreciate such high-intensity experiences.</p>
<p>Vacationer tourists are mainly motivated by escaping from daily routines, duties, and responsibilities. They crave for fun, entertainment, and comfort. They show an anthropocentric view of the human–nature relationship, and compared with the other two groups, they are less likely to visit natural protected areas. On the whole, this group of tourists reveals a negative attitude toward ecotourism. A communication strategy targeting vacationer tourists could take into account their preferences for holidays that offer the chance to escape from everyday life and have fun while enjoying good-quality comforts. Ecotourism could be promoted among these individuals by highlighting the possibility of getting away from it all and of having fun with no need to sacrifice comfortable (albeit sustainable) services. However, it would <italic>not</italic> be advisable to stress the adventurous side of an ecotourist vacation.</p>
<p>Finally, ecotourists are characterized by holiday motivations focused on the opportunity to experience fusion with nature and new experiences, such as contact with diverse cultures and populations, adventure, and solitude. They are more likely to visit historical and archeological sites and prioritize energy conservation and responsible recycling. They are characterized by intellect/openness as a personality dimension. Moreover, ecotourists accept the natural environment for its intrinsic value, subscribing to the notion that no living organism is intrinsically superior to any another. Thus, they reveal a positive attitude toward ecotourism, shaped by an ecocentric view of human–nature interactions. Furthermore, they are oriented toward postmaterialist values, such as ecology and nature conservation. As a consequence, ecotourists are more likely to visit natural protected areas compared with the other two groups. A communication strategy targeting ecotourists could profit from their fondness for culture, adventure, solitude, and uncontaminated natural environments and their keen interest in environmental issues. These young tourists could be attracted by the opportunity to enjoy time in natural environments, have close contact with local history and culture, and the visit historical and archeological sites. They are adventure seekers; thus, they could be attracted by advertising that emphasizes the availability of adventurous outdoor sporting activities. Solitary travel, enjoying silence, and serene solitude could also attract their attention. Finally, because the group is particularly concerned with nature preservation, the ads could highlight the chance to translate sustainability and preservation principles into practice.</p>
<p>Selecting the most appropriate communication strategy should obviously take into account the aims and the targets of the advertising campaign. If the ads are aimed at strengthening ecotourism attitudes, they should target those tourists (ecotourists and wellness tourists) who share proenvironmental attitudes. Conversely, if they are aimed at widening the pool of potential visitors, the ads could target those individuals who are more worried about the discomforts of ecotourist holidays (vacationer tourists), emphasizing the agreeable side of the ecotourism experience.</p>

<title>Limits and Avenues for Future Research</title>
<p>First, we need to stress the need to replicate the present results to test the generalizability of the findings to other samples. Second, it might be argued that our reliance on two ad hoc scales limits to some extent the generalizability of the findings. Of course, these ad hoc scales require further scrutiny. Nonetheless, our scores achieved acceptable reliability and the pattern of results lends support to their validity. Finally, our segment characterization may also be considered as limited because only three of the five groups identified by CA were significantly differentiated by the predictors introduced in the DA. Future research broadening the set of predictors could boost the efficiency of the classification. These limitations notwithstanding, it is important to remark that, to our knowledge, no previous study has used a target segmentation approach for developing ecotourism promotion communication strategies.</p>
<p>Our novel results suggest practical implications: Proecotourism attitudes marked two of the three groups, and about 80% of the participants expressed their willingness to experience ecotourism in natural protected areas. Such results should encourage public agencies as well as the private sector to pay renewed attention to the younger generation’s potential for the ecotourism sector and to develop effective strategies to promote ecotourism (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013916510389313">Weaver &amp; Lawton, 2007</xref>).</p>
