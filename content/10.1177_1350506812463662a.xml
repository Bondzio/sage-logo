<p>In <italic>Colonial Memory</italic> Sarah De Mul focuses on memory and colonial histories in Dutch and British women’s travel writing. She draws from writing by Aya Zikken, Marion Bloem and Doris Lessing in order to conduct this analysis.</p>
<p>As an undertone, De Mul is concerned with the notion of historical hegemony (i.e. whose opinions and histories have been given attention) and critically evaluates each piece of work with regard to perspectives of gender, race, ethnicity and social class. The problem, according to De Mul, of historic hegemony is the fact that ‘dominant discourses of colonial remembrance help to engender a binary opposition between national and non-national other, resonating hierarchies existing in the colonial enterprise’ (p. 28). In order to provide alternative pieces of history De Mul states that: ‘I have deliberately put together a selection of women writers that will not let us be essentialist about gender or simplistic about feminism’ (p. 13).</p>
<p>In this discussion of a yearning back in time De Mul critically discusses the notion of memory and the fact that memory can be both unreliable and influenced by a person’s history and social surroundings. Among other topics concerning memory, De Mul shortly discusses the notion of ‘postmemory’ in which it is common for second generation Holocaust survivors, who have grown up with traumas that precede their birth, to have their life experiences characterized by this trauma. In developing this theme, it would also have been interesting to hear De Mul’s opinion on the notion of ‘transmission’ in regard to memory (vivid memories and dreams experienced by the second generations as if it were their own experiences), as discussed by for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350506812463662">Kellerman (2001)</xref>, and its possible connection to postcolonial writings.</p>
<p>De Mul states that hegemony of history and a white male perspective needs counter-histories, either written by other ethnicities, social classes, or that involve a different gender perspective. She provided three alternative stories written by women. These stories do let the reader experience women’s travel, but the discussion concerning how these stories differ from the typical male perspective is strangely absent. It is not clearly identified by De Mul, and a comparison is not, at least not explicitly, made. It leaves me to wonder what the significance and learning experience of these three stories really are.</p>
<p>De Mul defines travel writing as: ‘an auto-biographical first-person narrative, in which a travelling persona retrospectively describes his or her travel experiences involving the peoples and places he or she encounters’ (p. 22). She describes women’s travel writing as ‘distinguished from those written by men’ (p. 24) but does not develop this statement much further than saying that women’s travel writing particularly emphasizes the personal. She mentions that male accounts of colonial history tend to focus on ‘politics, economy and the public space’ (p. 125) but it is still difficult to discern whether or not these women’s travel writings are indeed distinctly different from men’s travel writings. The writings by Zikken, Bloem and Lessing are internal, private, and discuss everyday life. However, I would have appreciated more information concerning the differences between male and female travel writings. Since the field of women’s studies is multidisciplinary, readers who are not especially familiar with the colonial past or colonial theory require further information. De Mul does state that travel writing is historically embedded and dependent upon historical and social context, and this is partly what she addresses in her book. It is, however, difficult to understand how these historic accounts (by Zikken, Bloem and Lessing) are different to hegemonic accounts because the comparison is not thoroughly explained.</p>
<p>De Mul’s criticism of hegemony of historical accounts does not only concern men’s travel writings, but is also utilized in her critique of Zikken, Bloem and Lessing’s aims. For example, Zikken is a white Dutch woman who spent her childhood years in Indonesia, which she longs to again visit in order to re-live some of her childhood memories. De Mul criticizes Zikken for taking childhood memories and as an adult making the ‘colonial past into the object of her personal sentiments’ (p. 75) thereby demonstrating how colonial guilt ‘gradually came to be addressed in Dutch public discourse’ (p. 73). Bloem is a second generation Dutch woman from an inter-racial relationship who differentiates herself from ‘Dutch’ behaviour by claiming knowledge of the local Indonesian culture as she returns to the country where her parents lived. De Mul is critical of Bloem’s use of her knowledge of the local culture and states that this familiarity ‘serves to legitimise her ethnographic authority over the Indonesian space she describes’ (p. 94). Lessing is a white British woman who spent her childhood years in Zimbabwe. Lessing strongly opposed colonization and this is partly why De Mul is critical of her writings, since Lessing’s works often exclusively deal with ‘white female self-realisation’ (p. 106). Black characters on the other hand are portrayed as side characters in roles of domestic servants. The above examples demonstrate De Mul’s tendency to critically evaluate travel writings, and her strong focus on how social context and our ‘national imagination’ influence historical accounts.</p>
<p>What De Mul does very well is to emphasize the importance of women’s writing, underlining the fact that everyday events (and other events) in women’s lives are important, and can be a source of learning. She also speaks about the societal, class-based, gender-based and race-based influences that are central to all experiences, thereby highlighting the fact that no historic accounts are completely unbiased. She also avoids universalism and underlines differences, even within women’s travel writing, by incorporating the three distinctly different stories.</p>
<p>De Mul discusses the methodological limitations of her research, which is important in order to inform the reader of her thought processes and what future research can offer. She also mentions prominent feminist writer Chandra Talpade Mohanty who is critical of ‘white western feminism’ and the ‘global hegemony of western scholarship’. Thereby, De Mul includes an important discussion on the feminist tendency to universalize the category ‘women’, in accordance with western values, thoughts and beliefs. De Mul’s arguments appear well grounded in feminist debates in general and especially in literature discussing colonialism and particularly the British occupation of other countries.</p>
<p>It is important to be critical of women’s writings and at the end of the book De Mul discusses how western colonial discourse will benefit from an honest debate on how these memories and writings can contribute to discussions of transnational feminism and cultural differences. This criticism is valid and is often expressed by feminist writers, especially those from minority ethnic groups, who are wary of the tendency of western feminists to universalize.</p>
<p>There are many positives about this book, the downside, however, is the fact that De Mul does not explain how these stories are uniquely or distinctively female and what sets them apart from hegemonic accounts of history (and if they really are different since they too, and especially so Lessing’s writings, appears to enforce white hegemonic discourse). Perhaps it is the fact that the stories articulate a belonging to, and a connection with the local people that makes them uniquely female. At the same time, all three stories contain accounts of a ‘white’ understanding of the country or people met, but also an inclination to belong to a different country and culture. De Mul leaves her reader to do a great deal of interpretive work by themselves.</p>
