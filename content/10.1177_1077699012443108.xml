<p>The latest in what is becoming a wider shelf of books on radio talk in this country examines the format and the role that it plays in both the political process and popular culture more generally. Among the central questions the author addresses is why people listen to political talk (that often riles them up) instead of music, which can be relaxing. Do listeners seek information on political issues to help them make voting decisions, or do they simply enjoy the hosts and content that validates their existing beliefs? Are there other attractions to the broadcast hours of chatter?</p>
<p>After briefly relating the history of talk radio as well as where the format stands today in terms of audience demographics and advertiser support, Bobbitt, who teaches at the University of West Florida, examines how talk radio may (or may not) have had an impact on political campaigns from the 1950s through the 2006 midterm election, as well as the real impact of talk radio on the 2008 presidential campaign. It is just this direct impact that raises questions about the balance of such programming.</p>
<p>Bobbitt reviews (in a chapter each) the many types of talk show hosts: conservatives (by far the majority in both number and hours on the air), progressives (a beleaguered lot on the air, including the failed Air America network), libertarians, women, the haters and shockers, and—finally—the local hosts in some markets.</p>
<p>Bobbitt considers the future of political talk radio in light of the possible (widely bewailed by the on-air hosts, though highly unlikely in reality) return of the FCC’s Fairness Doctrine that once required broadcasters to provide balanced controversial programming.</p>
<p>Some see talk radio as a growing social problem—and one that has influenced some elections. Others argue that such programming demonstrates the best of First Amendment freedoms. The fact that the talk is so lopsided in viewpoint is constantly debated. This volume sheds light on what the reality is, but sheers away from making policy suggestions.</p>
