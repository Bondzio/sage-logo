<title>Background</title>
<p>The importance of social determinants of inequities in health has been increasingly recognized in public health research and policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812464915">1</xref>]. A social determinant of health is an extrinsic force related to socioeconomic and cultural factors that affects wellbeing. Thus, the focus is on identification of avoidable determinants related to the circumstances in which people live and work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812464915">1</xref>]. However, while such avoidable determinants are often analysed in relation to socioeconomic position, they are rarely considered in relation to gender differences in health. For example, avoidable determinants of socioeconomic differences in depressive disorders are often related to work environment and material disadvantage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812464915">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812464915">3</xref>]. But surprisingly, when it comes to the large body of research on determinants of gender differences in depression, the focus is predominantly on intrinsic, unavoidable factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812464915">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812464915">5</xref>]. Thus, the importance of biological factors (hormones, genes, etc.) is strongly emphasized in spite of reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812464915">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812464915">7</xref>], which conclude that the biomedical model alone cannot explain women’s increased risk of depression compared with men. These reviews conclude that genetic and other biological factors (e.g. gonadal hormones) have no or few effects, while socio-cultural and psychological factors are likely to play a significant role in explaining why women have a higher prevalence of depression compared with men. Thus, there is a need for more focus on the gendered social and avoidable determinants of depressive disorders.</p>
<p>While most explanations for women’s predominance in depressive disorders seem to be biomedical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812464915">4</xref>], the explanations related to life circumstances often focus on women’s multiple roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812464915">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812464915">8</xref>]. Two hypotheses of multiple roles dominate; the role enhancement hypothesis about the beneficial effects on health of multiple roles, and the role strain hypothesis in which health consequences owing to the strain of multiple roles are emphasized. Difficulties in balancing work and family demands have been shown to be detrimental to women’s health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812464915">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812464915">10</xref>]. However, owing to inconsistencies in the findings of the health implications (measured e.g. as psychiatric disorders) of multiple roles, Staland Nyman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812464915">11</xref>] draws the conclusion that we need to move beyond simplified expectations of either role strain or role enhancement hypotheses and instead examine in more detail the contexts within which social roles are enacted. An interesting strand of research in line with StalandNyman’s conclusions has been developed by Schofield and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812464915">12</xref>]. It emphasizes the importance of gender relations on structural, group and individual levels for understanding the uneven distribution of health between men and women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812464915">12</xref>]. A gender-relations approach means examining health concerns in the context of men’s and women’s relations and interactions with each other in different settings, such as work and family life. One way of analysing gender relations is to ask about participants’ perceptions of whether their lives are marked by gender equity or inequity, whether at home or in life overall. There is, however, a dearth of research on gender equity as a social determinant of health or of depressive symptoms, despite suggestions that inequities may be harmful to wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812464915">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812464915">14</xref>]. Hopcroft and Bradley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812464915">15</xref>] included country level measures of gender equality as indicators in a multilevel analysis of sex differences in depression across 29 countries, finding that depression was more prevalent in less egalitarian countries and among women in all countries studied. This female to male disparity was more pronounced in countries with greater gender equality. The authors hypothesized that in more repressive societies women may view their position and opportunities relative to other women only, and have less of a sense of marginalization than in settings where women’s horizons allow them to view their options and limitations relative to those of men as well. This research models methods for looking at gender inequities across communities but cannot account for variations within a population or a household.</p>
<p>Despite evidence that socioeconomic factors and gender inequity are each independently associated with depressive symptoms, studies examining their relative and/or interactive effects have been sparse, and limited by the lack of a measure of self-perceived gender equity in the couple relationship.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section4-1403494812464915">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>This 26-year follow-up study includes all pupils who, in 1981, attended the last year of compulsory school (age 16) in all schools in a medium-sized industrial town in the north of Sweden, the so-called Luleå cohort. The attrition rate was extremely low. At the 26-year follow-up 94.3% (n = 1010) of those still alive (n = 1071) of the original cohort (n = 1083) continued to participate. For this study a sample was made of participants who were cohabiting or married at the time of the last follow-up at age 42 (n = 773, women = 390, men = 383).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1403494812464915">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>All participants were investigated at ages 16, 18, 21, 30 and 42, with a comprehensive questionnaire as well as with register data. Data were collected by group questionnaires at ages 16 and 18 during school hours, and at ages 21, 30 and 42 the participants were invited to reunions with their former classmates. Those who could not attend these reunions (and those at age 18 who had finished school) received a mailed questionnaire. More detailed descriptions of the method have been published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812464915">16</xref>]. For this study, the follow-ups at age 30 and 42 were used.</p>
<p>The questionnaire consisted of about 90 questions regarding family background, work experience, work environment, financial position, social support, gender inequity measurements, civil status, domestic work, health situation, etc. The same but age-adjusted questionnaire was repeated at the follow-ups. The questionnaire was derived from well-known and validated questionnaires, such as the Swedish national survey of living conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812464915">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812464915">18</xref>] and the Low-income study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812464915">19</xref>].</p>
<p>The study has been approved by the Regional Ethics Vetting Board in Umeå.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section7-1403494812464915">
<title>Health outcome at age 42</title>
<p>The variable ‘depressive symptoms’ was measured with one question about how often respondents had felt depressed during the last 12 months. The variable had the following four answer alternatives with frequencies among men/women in brackets: never (62/47%), sometimes (34/41%), often (3/10%), permanently (1/2%). As illustrated, the distribution was skewed and the only possible way to dichotomize the variable in order to gain sufficiently large groups was as close to the median as possible, i.e. between never/all other alternatives (38% of the men, 53% of the women).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1403494812464915">
<title>Exposure variables</title>
<p>Socioeconomic status was measured with two variables – socioeconomic position and financial strain. The classification of <italic>lowering socioeconomic position</italic> was formed on the basis of the Swedish classification of socioeconomic status, based on the current or latest occupation at age 42. Lowering socioeconomic position was condensed into three classes: 1. middle and high white-collar workers and self-employed (reference); 2. lower white-collar workers; 3. blue-collar workers comprising un-skilled, semi-skilled and skilled workers;</p>
<p>Financial strain was measured as an index based on 11 questions regarding whether respondents had been forced to do without any of the following during the last 12 months: cooked meal, buying clothes that they or the family needed, paying the bills on time, going to the cinema/concert/theatre, inviting friends home, travelling to see relatives or friends in other places, buying a present, going on vacation, subscribing to a daily newspaper, spending time on a hobby or leisure activity, going to the restaurant/pub [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812464915">20</xref>]. Each question was based on a four-grade ordinal scale and the answer alternatives were coded as: often = 3, seldom = 2, never = 1, non-applicable = 1. As some participants misunderstood the last alternative, the answer alternatives ‘never’ and ‘not applicable’ were merged into alternative = 1. Thus, the range of the index was 11–33.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1403494812464915">
<title>Gender relations were measured with two questions</title>
<p>Overall assessments of gender inequity in the couple relationship were measured with the question “How gender equal do you consider your couple relationship to be?”. The five alternatives were: totally gender equal = 1, quite gender equal, somewhat gender equal, not especially gender equal, not gender equal at all = 5.</p>
<p>The second question about gender relations was about <italic>high responsibility for domestic work</italic>. The question was ‘How much of the responsibility for domestic work do you take?’ The five answer alternatives were: nothing = 1, less than half = 2, half = 3, more than half = 4, whole responsibility = 5.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1403494812464915">
<title>Earlier depressive symptoms</title>
<p>In order to be able to analyse the directions of the associations between the exposure variables and depressive symptoms, we controlled for earlier depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494812464915">21</xref>]. Thus, depressive symptoms at age 30 were measured and dichotomized in exactly the same way as the outcome variable.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section11-1403494812464915">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Windows version 18.0 of SPSS was used for data analysis. A p-value &lt; 0.05 or a confidence interval (CI) of 95% for the odds ratio (OR) was chosen as statistically significant. As significance tests chi-square was used for dichotomous variables and t-test for continuous variables. Pearson’s correlation between all pairs of exposure variables was less than 0.18.</p>
<p>The dependent variable had to be dichotomized, owing to a skewed distribution. We chose to dichotomize at the median, in order to analyse more extreme groups than the median would have given. Sensitivity analyses were performed in order to define how to dichotomize variables with ordinal scales. Thus, different cut-off points of each specific variable were tested in the regression analyses. In all cases, the results were the same in the sensitivity analyses and the guiding principle was to dichotomize at the median.</p>
<p>Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed in order to estimate the OR with 95% CIs for depressive symptoms in relation to our measures of inequity after control for earlier depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494812464915">Table I</xref>). Interaction analyses were performed between each pair of exposure variables.</p>

<title>On the results</title>
<p>Financial strain – and among women also gender inequity – were significantly related to other depressive symptoms, after control for the exposure and for earlier health status.</p>
<p>Interestingly, lowering socioeconomic status was not at all related to depressive symptoms among neither men nor women. Our finding of the importance of one’s partner relationship rather than one’s socioeconomic status variables on depressive symptoms among women is supported by a Finnish study based on a large nation-wide sample of middle-aged women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494812464915">22</xref>]. The study showed that socioeconomic factors were less important correlates of depressive symptoms than poor quality of intimate relationship and physical health. While that study measured satisfaction with intimate relationships, ours measured perceived gender inequity in the couple relationship. Thus, we measured a dimension more related to gendered power relations. Our findings for women are in line with our earlier research, in which self-perceived gender inequity in the couple relationship was related to psychological distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812464915">13</xref>]. However, in contrast to that study, this article showed no relationship between gender inequity and depressive symptoms among men. The lack of statistical significance among men could arise for several reasons. There are indications that men express depressive symptoms in other ways than women, changing their behaviour but not naming their mood as depressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494812464915">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494812464915">24</xref>]. For example, increased alcohol consumption could be a way for men to ‘escape’ their depressive moods. Even the methods for measuring depressive mood may be gender-related, with no single measure being equally applicable to men and women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494812464915">25</xref>]. Thus, our lack of findings of a link between domestic gender equity and depressed mood among men could be an artefact arising from the need to consider gender in selecting indicators for study. As few men reported an unequal relationship and fewer men than women reported depressive symptoms, this study may have lacked the statistical power to identify an association between home equity and mood, producing a type 2 error. We, therefore, cannot conclude that there is no relation between inequity in the couple relationship and depressive symptoms among men.</p>
<p>These and earlier results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812464915">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812464915">14</xref>], argue for the need for further analyses of gender relations, such as gender inequity in couple relationships in future public health research. Our measure has an innovative focus on self-rated inequity in the couple relationship but needs to be developed by, for example, including the direction of the inequity. We may presume that women who report a gender unequal couple relationship are disfavoured while men with similar reports are favoured. However, gender inequities may of course have other directions in couple relationships, and therefore, future research also needs to further develop the measures of the direction of domestic gender inequity.</p>
<p>High responsibility for domestic work was not related to depressive symptoms, which is in contrast to earlier findings among women in this cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812464915">13</xref>]. However, the population of that study included only couples with children, among whom the division of responsibility might be of more importance for health than among the broader sample of this study.</p>
<p>Our results regarding the impact of financial strain, as well as the lack of impact of other measures of socioeconomic status on depressive symptoms among both men and women, are in line with existing findings. Results from the Whitehall II study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494812464915">26</xref>] showed that the association between income and depressive symptoms can be largely accounted for by pre-existing health and other measures of social position, especially wealth. The authors found a strong independent association between household wealth and depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494812464915">26</xref>]. Our measure of financial strain resembles wealth as a measure of income earned over decades and across generations, while earlier health status had little impact on financial strain in our study. Different indicators of socioeconomic position are not simply interchangeable, because each measure reflects a somewhat different aspect of social stratification. Therefore, choice of indicators should consider existing research to select a variable or variables of relevance to both women and men, and whose meaning fits most clearly with the study aims.</p>

<sec id="section15-1403494812464915">
<title>On the methods</title>
<p>The main strength of this study is the long follow-up of a cohort of school leavers in combination with an extraordinarily low attrition rate. Earlier research has shown that non-responders tend to have worse health/health behaviour than the responders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494812464915">27</xref>]. Great effort was devoted to tracing all participants, as well as to keeping them informed about the study in order to increase their willingness to participate.</p>
<p>The cohort was chosen from a middle-sized town in Northern Sweden, raising the question of generalizability of findings. Previous analyses of the cohort have, however, indicated it to be comparable to the country as a whole with regard to socioeconomic factors as well as health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812464915">16</xref>]. As the question about gender equity in the couple relationship was asked only of those currently in a relationship, our results do not apply to those who do not have a partner at the time of the investigation. Of course, depressive symptoms may be a result of inequity in a past relationship, therefore more research is needed with research questions that take account of domestic gender equity across time and relationships.</p>
<p>In Sweden, the concept of gender equity in both society as well as in private life is widely known and discussed. Therefore, it is possible to pose direct questions to people about their experiences of gender equity. The cohort study also includes qualitative methods with personal interviews. These interviews have revealed that the participants understand and have reflected upon the question. Also, the large proportion of the cohort who responded to this question implies that the participants understood the meaning of domestic gender equity. Our aim was not to define an absolute measure of a gender equal or unequal relationship, but rather to look at whether individuals’ perceptions of inequities had some bearing on perceptions of depressive symptoms. Our findings do suggest the importance of considering self-reported inequities within the home environment as explanatory factors for depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>The main limitation of the study was the relatively small cohort size. Thus, the lack of significant findings among men could arise from a type 2 error. Future research needs to address our research questions in larger samples.</p>
<p>The measure of depressive symptoms also needs to be discussed. All measures of depression and depressive disorders are self-rated. Even clinical diagnoses of depression are based on self-reported symptoms rather than objective measures. There are several scales (like Hospitality, Anxiety and Depression scale, Beck’s depressive inventory and the Major Depression Inventory), which are meant to capture a diagnosis of depression. A comparison of these scales provided no evidence for the superiority or inferiority of any one in comparison to the others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494812464915">28</xref>]. Our intention was not to measure depression as a psychiatric diagnosis, but to capture self-perceived depressive mood via a direct question about the frequency of a set of indicative symptoms.</p>
<p>There are several different indicators of socioeconomic position, which all measure aspects of underlying socioeconomic stratification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494812464915">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494812464915">30</xref>]. Indicators of occupational position are often used as they capture more specific job-related factors, such as certain exposures, as well as social status. Our measure (including information about one’s latest occupation) did not exclude those out of the labour market. Educational level is also a common measure of socioeconomic position. However, in spite of the same level of education, women, in our study as in others, often have lower incomes than men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494812464915">30</xref>]. We used financial strain as another indicator of socioeconomic position. The motivation for choosing this exposure variable is that earlier research indicates that wealth, in contrast to income, is a good measure of social position to use in health-related research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494812464915">26</xref>].</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Financial strain, and among women also gender inequity in the couple relationship, was related to depressive mood. There is a need to pay more attention to gender relations in future research on social determinants of depressive mood.</p>
