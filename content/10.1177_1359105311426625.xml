<abstract>
<p>This study explores the therapeutic potential of heritage-object handling in nurse-patient encounters with women facing cancer. Ten women participated in an object-focused conversation with a nurse specialist. Sessions were audio-tape recorded and transcribed. Kleinian theory framed the analysis to reveal the individual ways women ‘used’ the object in the session. Professionally observed heritage-object handling provides an aid to discussion with patients and has potential as an assessment platform for therapeutic work or as an intervention approach in its own right. Further longitudinal controlled trials are needed to evaluate such benefits, particularly given the depth of the talk revealed in this study.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Engagement with the arts has been shown to have a positive effect on well-being in health contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105311426625">Wang, 1999</xref>) and a landmark study commissioned by Arts Council England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105311426625">Staricoff, 2004</xref>) has provided important evidence of positive outcomes induced by the arts with regard to stress, anxiety and depression, pain intensity and overall mental adjustment to illness.</p>
<p>Women diagnosed with a gynaecological cancer report a vast diversity of experience involving major transitions in their understanding of themselves, their illness and their world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311426625">Brennen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311426625">Dennison, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311426625">Picardie, 1998</xref>). For some, this is a struggle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311426625">Petticrew, et. al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105311426625">Tarraza &amp; Ellerkman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105311426625">Tomlinson &amp; Tomlinson, 2005</xref>). Despite some evidence in arts-in-health literature and wide clinical acceptance of the value of enriching the lives of cancer patients while they adjust to their diagnosis and undergo investigations or treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311426625">Di Gallo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311426625">Murray &amp; Gray, 2008</xref>), until recently there was little systematic research on the subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311426625">Cronin &amp; Gale, 1996</xref>). Convincing evidence for the effectiveness of arts approaches in different disease groups across different clinical and non-clinical settings remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311426625">Camic, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Adopting a broad based perspective arts in health research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311426625">Emmison &amp; Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311426625">Guillerinin, 2004</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311426625">Harrison, 2002</xref>) examines a range of bio-psychosocial factors in health care that may benefit from arts participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105311426625">Rich et al., 2006</xref>). Work in progress by the United Kingdom’s Departments of Culture Media and Sport and Department of Health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311426625">DCMS &amp; DOH, 2007</xref>) seeks to develop indices and measures to assess future community-based museum programmes with people suffering from mental health problems. In cancer care there have been cautious attempts to explore how the arts may be used to help patients adapt to the illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311426625">Frith &amp; Harcourt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311426625">Martin &amp; Spence, 1987</xref>), alter their patterns of thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311426625">Radley &amp; Bell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311426625">Radley &amp; Taylor, 2003</xref>), attenuate emotional difficulties and distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311426625">Collie, Bottorff, Long, 2006</xref>), develop emotional capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311426625">Bell, 2006</xref>), and reduce symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311426625">Rykov, 2008</xref>). These and other methodologically innovative studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311426625">Gillies, et al., 2005</xref>) have paved the way for this promising new area of research: the use of objects from museum collections as a psychotherapeutic resource or intervention approach for people with cancer.</p>
<p>The ‘use’ of objects with patients goes back to Melanie Klein’s revolutionary psychoanalytic play technique with children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311426625">Klein, 1997 [1932]</xref>). At the start of a course of analysis she provided the child with a personal ‘box’ containing a variety of objects—human figures, animals, tiny motorcars, buildings as well as paper, pencils etc.—to take out at each session. The objects were chosen to provide a vocabulary to facilitate the expression of the child’s thoughts and feelings, clarifying their exploration through the child’s conscious and unconscious phantasies<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1359105311426625">1</xref></sup>. The introduction into clinical practice of heritage or museum objects may have analogous therapeutic value for cancer patients, and this study aims to explore this possibility.</p>
<p>Klein’s model of the mind, her conceptual innovations concerning the constant interplay between the internal world, the world of fantasy and the external world, provide the theoretical rationale for the work as well as the framework for our analysis. The ‘inner’ world of phantasy is as real a place as the external world, Klein discovered. It shapes our view of the outer world, and in turn the outer world is shaped, coloured, and influenced by our internal world. In other words, suggests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311426625">Melzter (1981)</xref>, referring to Klein, we need to attend to this very real inner world of phantasies as they influence us as much as external events. Klein’s ideas about emotional development follow from this premise. The baby, then the child, manages loss (of the breast/mother) by recreating the lost ‘object’ or person (in their absence) symbolically. This can be through a thought, or image, or sound, or something that the child does physically. If we were never faced with loss, we would not develop a symbolically functioning mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105311426625">Segal, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Heritage-objects can carry symbolic meaning for individuals if feelings are projected onto them. The object can act as a repository or container for projections of different and difficult states of mind. They have a particular valence for representing loss, because in order to bear loss we search for ways of finding the lost person, or, in the case of cancer patients, the loss of the healthy self. The object can therefore represent wholeness and integration. Thus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105311426625">Rilke (1963 [1914]</xref>) described the importance of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105311426625">Winnicott (1992 [1951]</xref>) much later called a ‘transitional object’. In describing its symbolic potential Rilke encompasses the possibility of the object including “all that is human, right into the depths of death” in its range.</p>
<p>The foregoing theory helps in understanding the therapeutic potential of heritage-object handling under investigation. The study aims to explore the processes and content of heritage-object handling sessions in a hospital setting: whether objects outside—indeed, beyond—patient’s everyday experience may provide a therapeutically valuable resource to understand concerns raised by the threat of cancer. In other words: how do women ‘use’ the heritage-object during a handling session?</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The preliminary study undertaken in a large London hospital cancer centre used qualitative research methods to elicit and describe patients’ responses during a session focused on handling heritage objects. The sessions were conducted and audio-taped by gynaecological cancer nurse specialists (NB. MJ. AL.) who within the next few days participated in a debriefing interview with the researcher, during which they were invited to reflect on the particulars of the session and its emotional tenor. Field notes were made immediately following these interviews, and notes were inserted in the texts of the nurse-patient transcripts to highlight contextual issues that might have a bearing on the interpretive analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311426625">Knowles, 2008</xref>). Research Ethics Committee approval was given for the study. Pseudonyms are used for patients throughout this article.</p>

<sec id="section3-1359105311426625">
<title>Recruitment</title>
<p>Women eligible to participate had either recently had surgery for a gynaecological cancer and knew their diagnosis, or had a significant family history of ovarian cancer and were attending for screening<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1359105311426625">2</xref></sup>. Clinical members of the research team identified consecutive eligible women from the gynaecological cancer and familial gynaecological cancer clinic lists. Patients were informed by letter about the study and asked if they would be willing to participate. Persons under 18 or with significant cognitive impairment were not contacted.</p>
<p>Ten women were recruited to the preliminary study: five whom had surgery and five who had a strong family history registered on an ovarian cancer screening programme. These represented half the women invited to participate within the recruitment period. Of the remainder, four declined to take part without giving a clear reason while four indicated they were too preoccupied or unwell to undertake anything of the sort. Administrative difficulties in contacting the patient in the designated three month recruitment period before their screening appointment or discharge from hospital after surgery accounted for the two other failures in recruitment. The majority of women recruited were married or living with a partner, not highly educated, and working either full or part time (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105311426625">Table 1</xref>). Selected clinical characteristics of participants are also presented in this table. Six out of ten of the women had had surgery, including one high risk woman who had undergone a prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Nurses conducted the one-to-one object handling session at the patients’ bedside behind bed screens for privacy or in private rooms in the familial cancer clinic. The nurse took with her a ‘loan box’ of lightweight metal, containing six carefully wrapped objects from UCL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311426625">Museums and Collections (2009)</xref>. These included natural history specimens (e.g. agate; a fossil ammonite), archaeological artefacts (e.g. iron-age flint axe-head; Egyptian bronze cat-headed figure) and art works selected for their beauty or historical or general interest. After patients had cleaned their hands with a alcohol hand rub the nurse took the objects out of the box and placed them on a laying-out mat. Patients were free to handle the objects and invited to choose one as the focus of their session. As the women handled their selected object the nurse engaged with them to reflect upon it through a series of non-directive questions:</p>
<list id="list1-1359105311426625" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Could you tell me why you have chosen this object?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What do you think the object is?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What does it feel like to handle the object? (Prompts: Is it enjoyable? If yes, why, if ‘no’, why not? Use other prompts to cover individual situation/experience.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What does the object remind you of? (Prompts: Why do you find it interesting?)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Can you think of any experience that might relate to this object?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How does the object make you feel? (Prompt: Does it make you feel happy or sad/indifferent. Why does it make you feel like that?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Please could you give examples of where this session has worked well for you and where it has worked less well (Why has it worked well/less well?)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The nurses observed the women closely as they handled the objects and tried to be attuned to their thoughts and feelings. The nurse planned the length of the session and agreed this with the patient beforehand. Sessions lasted between 20 and 45 minutes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1359105311426625">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Sessions were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed by the constant comparative method to identify themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311426625">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>). Subsequent analysis used insights from field notes of the nurse-researcher debriefings and areas of relevance, nuance, and psychodynamic interpretation relying on Kleinian theory. This layered analytic process allowed us to incorporate clinical impressions into our data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311426625">Mays &amp; Pope, 2000</xref>). Key disclosure themes were: survival, fear of cancer, powerlessness, reproductive capacity, and (female) family history. Qualitative results are presented so as to demonstrate how these themes unfolded in personal ways in the heritage-object session, and to reveal patients symbolic use of the object; how the woman transfers her thoughts and feelings onto her chosen object.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1359105311426625" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>From the variety of objects to choose from, four women selected the Egyptian cat-goddess; three chose the agate; and the fossil, flint-axe head and small Egyptian pot were each chosen by one woman. i.e. six man made and four natural objects provided the focus for individual sessions.</p>
<p>We have purposively selected one short extract from an object-handling session with a woman who is less sure of herself or resistant within the handling session and two longer ones with a woman very responsive to the objects she handled. The chosen extracts give a flavour of the depth and range of talk across the data set of 5 ½ hours of transcribed nurse-patient object-handling sessions.</p>
<sec id="section7-1359105311426625">
<title>Case One (Patient ID 9)</title>
<p>Sue Dillon is a 37 year-old woman who works in a high street bank. She married in 1998 and has one daughter aged six years. Her marital relationship is mutually supportive and the couple are keen to have another child. Sue’s mother had breast and ovarian cancer and died of her ovarian cancer two years ago, aged 62. Sue’s maternal grandmother and an aunt also died from breast cancer. This family history could indicate the presence of a BRCA gene fault which Sue is at risk of inheriting, and is consequently at increased risk of developing ovarian and breast cancer herself. She attends the gynaecological cancer screening outpatient clinic to manage this risk with regular internal ultrasound scans and blood tests. Sue chose a 10 cm Egyptian bronze cat-headed figure dated 500–650 BC. The figure is holding a sacred rattle and has a woven wicker basket over one arm with kittens inside (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1359105311426625">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Case One</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1359105311426625-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Sue’s rationale for choosing the Egyptian cat-goddess figure perhaps reflects a wish to maintain a long line of female procreation, especially in the light of her family (female) histories. It is also a small figure as if she herself feels ‘little’, and can instinctively identify with it. Handling the object was “comforting” for Sue, which is understandable; despite its smallness it survived. Perhaps her choice of the object reflects her search for a ‘mother’ who does not die young. Interestingly Sue generalizes about the need for comfort instead of admitting her own need for it. Perhaps she is embarrassed by her own vulnerability or perhaps she does not yet trust the nurse. Sue’s spontaneous, chronologically precise mention and awareness of the anniversary of her mother’s death indicates that it may have influenced her choice of object. Her awe of the figure as powerful seems connected, via the kittens, with her fears of being made infertile by the prospect of possible prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or future cancer treatment. By telling the nurse she likes the figure because it is strong, and will endure Sue shows she knows what she needs: indeed, she has become attached to the object, asking half-jokingly if she can keep it. Her request reflects her ‘use’ of the object as something she invests with maternal comfort and endurance. Sue may not be joking about using alcohol as a substitute over the next few days; she turns to oral comfort and to something that would anaesthetize her anxiety—even stop her thinking and feeling.</p>
<p>What our interpretation strikingly shows, is that the object facilitates disclosure of what otherwise might not have come out in the clinical setting. We shall examine this process in more detail in the next case.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1359105311426625">
<title>Case Two (Patient ID 6)</title>
<p>Daphne Page is a 62 year-old single woman diagnosed with stage 3 ovarian cancer. Two days before the session she had a hysterectomy to be followed by chemotherapy. Daphne looked after both her parents but now lives alone with close friends nearby. She recently retired from a successful career in a trade union organization. Daphne chose the Egyptian bronze cat-headed figurine and an 8 cm faceted flint axe-head of 8th<sup>-</sup>century BC (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1359105311426625">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1359105311426625-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Interestingly, as the session starts, Daphne gently goes straight for what matters to her— beneath some denial—her loss of reproductive capacity. The figure evokes fertility for her as an affirmation of femininity, though she later says it’s never been important to her. Like Sue in Case One, Daphne would like to keep the object. The nurse perhaps could have sympathized with this wish: perhaps committing the object to memory or ‘internalizing’ it isn’t enough. A few times Daphne attributes her own ‘quirkiness’ to this eternal figure, enabling her to identify with it.</p>
<p>There is a sense that Daphne’s mention of her ‘flipping’ bag refers to having something precious and not using it, which was indeed true with respect to her womb<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1359105311426625">3</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311426625">Freud, 1991 [1900]</xref>). She comments that the figure is “all seeing” and “knows what she is looking at”, that “this is about me and her”. Daphne may be talking here about the nurse, who is giving her attention and helping her to be self-focussed. At the end of the extract the nurse’s comment seems just right and really <italic>in touch</italic> with Daphne. The second object Daphne chose was significantly, a weapon: the flint axe-head (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1359105311426625">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In answer to the nurse’s question “Why did you choose two?” Daphne acknowledges her feeling of powerlessness as a cancer patient in hospital (perhaps heightened by just having been interrupted). She is alive to the “layering” of the texture and colours of the axe-head, which may be a “weapon of anger”. When she stabs the air with the axe-head to “get the bitterness out” does she mean her underlying anger, if released, can lead to growth? Does “cross” section also express her crossness (anger)? Something about the upper side—the pleasant face shown to the world—is undermined by anger that remains unknown or hidden. This may indicate her wish to integrate her ‘pleasant’, happier side with her hidden ‘angry’ side. Behind her life of giving and self sacrifice is greed and need exemplified by her taking two objects; getting the nurse to stay with her for much longer; and anger, as she says. By telling the nurse about her frustrations and major regrets she can at least bring them into focus and perhaps thereby try to reconcile herself to them. It is worth considering whether Daphne’s realization about wasting many years while her life was ‘on hold’ will lead her to make something of the time left to her. Perhaps now she is capable of great change. So far though, she views her reaction as a dart or weapon to strike back, not yet constructively towards her own development.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A series of studies with vulnerable groups (e.g. in prisons and hospitals) has found that the use of heritage objects provide a sense of identity, continuity, and stability during personal episodes of disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311426625">Lynch, 2008</xref>). Taking an object into one’s own hands—physical engagement and not just exploration of surfaces—is a powerful experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105311426625">Samuels, 2008</xref>). However, no previous study has examined in detail the interactive emotional processes in heritage-object handling or evaluated its potential as a therapeutic approach.</p>
<p>In this study, handling the heritage-object challenged the passivity the hospital experience engenders in patients. It revealed that during heritage-object handling sessions with a nurse, patients were able to ‘use’ their chosen object in creative ways to consider what the illness meant to them. The objects gave women a vocabulary to convey their feelings to themselves and others. Handling heritage-objects—silent forms outside time that ‘tease us out of thought’ as Keats put it—paved the way for psychological work conducive to patient’s sense of active well-being.</p>
<p>Sessions varied in length and emotional depth, but as demonstrated in the excerpts selected for this article, all involved exploration of women’s feelings about survival, fear of cancer, powerlessness, reproductive capacity, and (female) family history. Specific objects, e.g., an Egyptian figurine, evoked deep emotional responses. That the object embodied a huge span of time and reached far into mankind’s past as a link with human beings’ genesis and universality was key to this. The object provided much more than perhaps could be evoked by a present-day object which may lend itself to people’s childhoods and memories, but does not carry that depth unless it is say a beautiful, hand crafted 21st-century bowl, which manages to carry a profound sense of history as well as modernity. As one of the study participants says: ‘a sense of timelessness’ (Patient 6). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311426625">Meltzer &amp; Harris Williams (2008 [1988])</xref> consider why such an object made by man—a successful work of art—is compelling. It induces a process in us, an experience explained by the Kleinian idea of projective identifications (parts of the self that can be put into others) of which the viewer/handler of art is the recipient. The projections from the artist are restorative and include those capacities for the bearing of pain which have been achieved by the artist in his/her own development.</p>
<p>We had not anticipated that patients would invariably express a desire to keep the heritage-object they had chosen. Those who risked expressing their wanting to keep it were rebuffed for we had not thought to explain at the beginning of the study or individual sessions, that patients could not keep the object. This shortcoming was disquieting for us yet provided powerful learning and an affirmation of the relevance of Kleinian theory to the study. Klein’s designation of the mental phenomenon of internal object explains women’s desire to keep the heritage-object. Klein’s thinking intimates an organic transaction between the person and the world, in which parts of experience are ingested and taken in by the mind. An internal object is a dynamic psychic entity which exerts a characteristic influence on the individual’s way of experiencing life, and crucially affects relationships with others. Part of the process of development alluded to in the introduction to this article involved building up a ‘good object’—a resilient internal mother figure which can survive attack, be the object of love and care, and provide a sense of being loved and cared for. ‘Internalizing’ and taking into the mind the heritage-object that in some cases had been invested with maternal qualities of resilience or comfort may not have been enough. The heritage-object served as a transitional object, to be kept, held and thought about in the external world of events. But as Meltzer reminds us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311426625">1981</xref>) ‘we do not live in one world, but in two … we live in an internal world which is as real a place to live as the outside world’ (p.178). The object bridged the patients’ external world and their inner world of phantasies.</p>
<p>The study demonstrates the potential power of the heritage-object to facilitate an emotional experience and reflection; how the object bypasses the intellect and the ‘censor’ and targets the unconscious mind. As one woman said: <italic>‘It has woken my brain up’</italic> (Patient 3). Women invariably remarked on the age of the heritage-object they chose. Gently touching and exploring the shape and texture of a 430 million year old fossil one woman remarked: ‘<italic>to think of something so old; it is caught there forever and ever and ever’</italic> (Patient 2). She apprehends the timelessness of the object and yet its indestructibleness cannot be guaranteed. So while the heritage-objects carry timelessness, they paradoxically also carry transience which makes them more powerful for these patients than if they were indestructible. Women also gave touching affirmations of the project regarding the time and space it gave to them. As one participant commented ‘<italic>In hospital there is a lot of time and space to say what you are feeling. You do that with family and friends and the odd nurse that you find, but it’s all very perfunctory ‘drugs’, ‘how are you’. I’m sure there are other people who want to say lots but don’t feel that they can and who want to express things that they can’t. Where do they begin? So maybe this is a wonderful opportunity for them</italic>’ (Patient 4).</p>
<p>If the wished-for therapeutic benefits of heritage-object handling are to be realised, clinicians must address the effect on patients of exposing raw feelings that may be difficult to contain. Future research and practice must also carefully consider the skills of the health professional conducting the session, and the place of object-handling in patients’ overall psychological care.</p>
<p>This preliminary qualitative study had methodological shortcomings: the number of participants was small; and the study was not longitudinal in its design. Subsequent studies should include carefully selected and validated outcome measures to evaluate the effect of one or more sessions, and an ‘intervention control’ where the nurse interacts with the patient without a heritage-object to establish whether the intervention effect is from their interaction with the nurse or the object. A participant anticipated this when she said to the nurse: ‘I <italic>don’t know whether it’s that (the object) or just talking to you that’s relaxing’</italic> (Patient 4). Other covariates such as participants’ level of education, heritage versus non-heritage object use, and man made heritage-objects versus objects from the natural world, are also critical to thorough assessment of the intervention. Despite its limitations, the study provides important information and an impetus for future research. The benefit of moving beyond verbal therapies to kinaesthetic and visual elements as an aid to assessment and as a resource for psychological work with patients is largely unknown. The Arts and Humanities Research Council has recently funded a longitudinal, repeated measures study (AH/G000506/1) to pursue the question.</p>
