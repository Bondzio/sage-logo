<p>Infection was an infrequent complication of parenteral nutrition (PN) in the early reports by Wilmore and Dudrick.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607111414581">1</xref></sup> However, high-profile descriptions of infectious complications, particularly fungemia, appeared in the literature in the early 1970s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607111414581">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607111414581">4</xref></sup> Whether these infections were related to PN fluid contamination, contamination of the catheter during manipulation, or seeding of the catheter by organisms from a distant infectious site within patients’ bodies was unclear. The potential for infectious complications, coupled with the potential for compounding errors, resulted in endorsement by The Joint Commission (TJC) of medications in their most ready-to-use commercially available form in 2004.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607111414581">5</xref></sup> Whether this endorsement applied to PN solutions remained somewhat controversial until 2007, when TJC published the opinion that because of the complexity of PN, it fell outside the intent of the 2004 endorsement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607111414581">6</xref></sup> Nevertheless, it can be argued that ready-to-use (premixed) commercial PN solutions are safer for patients because they pose less likelihood of being contaminated or of being mixed improperly as compared to PN prepared in a hospital pharmacy or outsourced pharmacy. However, few outcome data support these contentions.</p>
<p>The article by Turpin et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607111414581">7</xref></sup> in this issue of the <italic>Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition</italic> (<italic>JPEN</italic>), uses data from a large claims information database representing &gt;400 U.S. hospitals to explore the relationship between bloodstream infections (BSIs) and method of PN preparation. They demonstrate an association between use of multichamber (MCB) PN bags and a lower rate of BSI (17.5%) compared to the rate associated with use of pharmacy-prepared PN (26.6%). This association remained after adjustment for various patient factors, although the difference in BSI rates between preparation methods was not quite as great (19.6% vs 25.9%). This study is in line with what this commentator called for in an article on commercial premixed formulas published in <italic>Nutrition in Clinical Practice</italic> in 2009: “Information from multi-institutional health-care systems implementing premixed PN systems in large numbers of patients would be particularly helpful.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607111414581">8</xref></sup> The widespread shortages of amino acid products experienced in the United States over the past couple of years have served as an impetus for many institutions to transition a portion and, in some cases, most of their PN patients to an MCB system. It is hoped that this migration to commercial premixed formulas will spawn collection and dissemination of more data germane to the topic of advantages and disadvantages of using MCB in the United States in terms of patient safety, pharmacoeconomics, and logistics.</p>
<p>Turpin et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607111414581">7</xref></sup> some of whom are employed by Baxter Healthcare Corporation, the manufacturer of Clinimix (the only commercially available multichamber PN product on the U.S. market), rightly point out some of the limitations of their study. As a retrospective database analysis, the results should be considered hypothesis generating and useful for help in designing prospective studies rather than seen as proof that MCB use leads to lower BSI rates. Only adults were included in the study, whereas many of the “epidemic” case series of infections secondary to contaminated PN have involved neonates and young children; data from these populations are needed. Although the authors attempted to adjust for severity of illness, the nagging question persists as to whether the population receiving MCB might overall not have been as sick as the patients receiving pharmacy-prepared PN. The longer duration of PN in the pharmacy-prepared group also might have played into the results, as the data from this study indicate that the risk of infection increases with duration of PN. Another acknowledged limitation is that the design of the retrospective study did not allow for distinguishing between sepsis due to intravenous access devices and their manipulation and other causes. The authors claim that the difference in BSI was greater when comparing MCB with PN compounded in the hospital pharmacy (the group that they call HCPN) than when comparing MCB with the entire population of non-MCB patients. The entire non-MCB group included both patients who received PN compounded in the hospital pharmacy and patients receiving PN compounded by an outsourced centralized compounding center. The authors could not always discern from the database which of these methods was used to compound PN in the non-MCB group, which somewhat detracts from the meaning of the higher rates of BSI associated with PN compounded in the hospital pharmacy. Of the 64,315 records classified as non-MCB, only 978 could be positively identified as PN having been compounded in the hospital pharmacy. It is likely that many more than 978 of these 64,315 patients received PN compounded in the hospital pharmacy.</p>
<p>New 2011 guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on the prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections state that infusate contamination leads only rarely to catheter-related BSI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607111414581">9</xref></sup> This assertion also appeared in the 2002 version of these same guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607111414581">10</xref></sup> However, data from Trissel et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607111414581">11</xref></sup> found close to a 5% contamination rate in a study simulating intravenous admixture of complex, multiple-step solutions that would fall into the medium risk level category similar to PN solutions. It is of little solace that this research explored microbial proliferation in growth medium, which would be expected to optimally support microbial growth, rather than components of PN solutions, which may not support microbial growth as readily, and also observed for microbial growth at 25 to 35°C for up to 14 days rather than for just 24 hours, as in a typical PN hang time. This study was conducted when United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) chapter 797 regulations were still very new. Although many healthcare systems in the United States have modified their intravenous admixture facilities and procedures to comply with USP chapter 797, this is not yet uniform across all hospitals.</p>
<p>The CDC guidelines referred to previously recognize 4 routes for contamination of catheters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607111414581">9</xref></sup> One mechanism would involve organisms on the skin migrating from the catheter insertion site along the outside of the catheter to colonize the catheter tip. Safdar and Maki<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607111414581">12</xref></sup> have called this extraluminal contamination and propose that this is the mechanism associated with most infections of noncuffed, nontunneled, short-term central venous catheters as well as peripheral intravenous catheters and arterial lines. A second mechanism of catheter contamination would be from direct contact of the catheter or catheter hub with a hand or a contaminated fluid or device. Safdar and Maki<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607111414581">12</xref></sup> would call this intraluminal contamination and propose that this is the more common mechanism behind contamination of long-term central venous catheters, including peripherally inserted central catheters. For the third route of contamination, the CDC guidelines state that catheters can uncommonly become contaminated as a result of hematogenous seeding from a distant infectious source. The fourth mechanism by which a catheter can become contaminated, infusion of a contaminated solution as mentioned previously, is deemed to be rare by the CDC guidelines. If, as the CDC guidelines and Safdar and Maki<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607111414581">12</xref></sup> propose, infusate contamination is a rare cause of catheter-related BSI and the first two mechanisms are much more common, then one is left to conclude that most catheter-related BSIs arise from errors or omissions in nursing care rather than pharmacy contamination. This makes the relatively large differences between rates of BSI with the various compounding methods in the Turpin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607111414581">7</xref></sup> study somewhat unexpected and enigmatic. The issue begs more exploration in prospective, controlled studies.</p>
<p>If the association between MCB as a PN modality and lower BSI rates is borne out in controlled studies, then in the interest of patient safety, adoption of the MCB system would be prudent. Major opposition to this system has involved concern that achievement of provision of macronutrients tailored to individual patient needs is somewhat limited because of a finite number of concentrations and volumes of MCB that are commercially available. These factors, coupled with the lack of 3-chamber bags in the United States, in which the third chamber is composed of lipid, make the logistics of adopting such a system more challenging. Marketing of more concentration and volume options for MCB, particularly those with a lower nonprotein kcal to nitrogen ratio, will make adoption of this system more palatable for many clinicians. Although MCBs for the neonatal population have begun to appear in some international markets, it is likely that such products will take much longer to get approval for the U.S. market as compared to expanded product lines for older children and adults. This is unfortunate, as it is in our younger patients that epidemic infections associated with PN contamination have most frequently occurred.</p>
