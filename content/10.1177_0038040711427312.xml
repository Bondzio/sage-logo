<abstract>
<p>An emerging literature suggests that the increasingly complex family histories of American children are linked with multiple domains of adolescent development. Much of this scholarship focuses on associations at the individual level. Here, the authors consider whether key dimensions of the school context, specifically the aggregate level of family instability and the academic press within schools, moderate the link between family instability and young people’s course-taking patterns in mathematics in high school. Using the school-based design and the retrospective reports of family structure in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and the linked academic transcript data in the Adolescent Health and Achievement Study (<italic>n</italic> = 6,545), the authors find that students from unstable families do more poorly when they attend schools with a high proportion of academically oriented students. The prevalence of family instability in a school does not moderate the individual experience of family instability in predicting course-taking patterns.</p>

<p>The living arrangements of American children are increasingly dynamic. At the midpoint of the twentieth century, three quarters of American children lived in “traditional” nuclear families—defined as families with two biological parents married to each other, full siblings only, and no other household members—until they reached adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0038040711427312">Furstenberg 2007</xref>). Today, increases in nonmarital fertility, divorce, and cohabitation, combined with declines in first marriages and high rates of remarriage have translated into more complex, dynamic living arrangements for adolescents. Indeed, life-course estimates suggest that most American youth will spend some time living outside a traditional nuclear family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038040711427312">Kennedy and Bumpass 2008</xref>). This instability, and the turbulence it can introduce into adolescents’ lives, is associated with rising inequality among American youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0038040711427312">McLanahan and Percheski 2008</xref>). More specifically, an emerging literature documents a link between complex family structure histories and a variety of behavioral, social, and academic problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0038040711427312">Cavanagh and Huston 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038040711427312">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0038040711427312">Cavanagh, Schiller, and Riegle-Crumb 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0038040711427312">Fomby and Cherlin 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0038040711427312">Osborne and McLanahan 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0038040711427312">Wu and Thomson 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Many of these observed problems are manifest and rooted in high schools. During this life stage, young people spend more waking hours at school than in any other setting. At the same time, they have more freedom and autonomy from adults and spend a substantial portion of each day with peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038040711427312">Collins 1984</xref>). Young people also become increasingly self-conscious and cognizant of social comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0038040711427312">Eccles et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0038040711427312">Eisert and Kahle 1982</xref>). Finally, they are often enrolled in large high schools in which teacher–student relations are less personal, academic pressures are greater, and academic motivation and achievement decline compared to what students experienced in elementary schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0038040711427312">Eccles et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038040711427312">Eccles and Midgley 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0038040711427312">Simmons and Blyth 1987</xref>). Taken together, the curricular organization of schools becomes more open and less structured just as young people’s motivation and opportunities to disengage and act out increase.</p>
<p>Although scholars who study the link between family structure and adolescent well-being typically control for adolescent age or grade, the character and quality of school context in adolescence are understudied. Here, we seek to connect the concurrent, dynamic trajectories of family and school experience by investigating whether school context conditions the previously established association between cumulative family instability and course-taking patterns in high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0038040711427312">Cavanagh et al. 2006</xref>). Specifically, we consider whether two dimensions of the school context—the family structure histories of students at the school and the academic press of students in the school—moderate the individual-level association between cumulative family instability and the math course-taking patterns of high school students. We test our research question with data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) and the linked academic transcript data in the Adolescent Health and Achievement Study.</p>
<sec id="section1-0038040711427312">
<title>Family Instability and the Educational Careers of Adolescents</title>
<p>Students’ academic experiences in a given year are part of a larger trajectory that makes up their educational careers and shapes eventual status attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0038040711427312">Kerckhoff 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0038040711427312">Pallas 2003</xref>). A student’s academic trajectory in high school is predictive of graduation and college enrollment, net of initial aptitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0038040711427312">Schneider, Swanson, and Riegle-Crumb 1998</xref>). The academic trajectory is most clear in subjects such as mathematics, where courses are arranged in a hierarchical sequence, ranging from less advanced (e.g., remedial mathematics) to more advanced courses (e.g., calculus), and where access to more advanced math courses is contingent on the successful completion of earlier ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0038040711427312">Adelman 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0038040711427312">Riegle-Crumb, Farkas, and Muller 2006</xref>; Schneider et al., 1997). Yet even in a hierarchically structured subject such as math, there is variation in individual progression. Students who begin high school on time in math can lose this advantage over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0038040711427312">Pallas 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0038040711427312">Schiller 1999</xref>). In particular, by their junior year in high school, students often have completed much of their required coursework and may select elective courses over advanced math courses as the coursework becomes both voluntary and more challenging and nonacademic domains of success such as friendship, romance, sports, work, and extracurricular activities compete for students’ time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0038040711427312">Csikszentmihalyi and Schneider 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0038040711427312">Lee, Smith, and Croninger 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0038040711427312">Powell, Farrar, and Cohen 1985</xref>). Given this, we consider both the start and end point of students’ math course-taking trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0038040711427312">Crosnoe and Huston 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>At the start of high school, the courses students take, the grades they receive, and their scores on standardized tests set the stage for later success in taking advanced classes, mastering difficult curricula, and scoring well on exams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0038040711427312">Stevenson, Kochanek, and Schneider 1998</xref>). Just as those who begin by taking more advanced courses and earning higher grades have more opportunities to excel academically across the high school years, those who begin high school earning low grades and taking lower-level courses have fewer opportunities to recover and excel over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0038040711427312">Alexander, Entwisle, and Horsey 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0038040711427312">Roderick 1993</xref>). Thus, getting on track early on is particularly important for math course taking, where students who begin high school taking a core course such as Algebra I have less difficulty reaching key college-preparatory courses such as Algebra II by the end of high school.</p>
<p>By the end of high school, students can graduate having completed college-preparatory coursework or not. Math course taking, in particular, is among the strongest predictors of college matriculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0038040711427312">Schneider et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0038040711427312">Stevenson et al. 1998</xref>). Specifically, Algebra II is generally considered a key preparation course for college entrance examinations such as the SAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0038040711427312">Schiller and Hunt 2003</xref>), and students who take at least this course are significantly more likely than those who do not to attend four-year colleges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0038040711427312">Adelman 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0038040711427312">Schneider et al. 1998</xref>). Yet as noted above, the increased autonomy and agency that young people experience as they move through high school can translate into greater variability in curricular exposure and academic success by the end of high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0038040711427312">Cavanagh et al. 2006</xref>). Thus, students’ academic status in mathematics at the end of high school represents far more than students’ interest and ability in a particular subject; rather, it captures a more general picture of their cumulative academic careers in high school, with some students leaving high school prepared to continue their studies in four-year colleges or universities and others less prepared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0038040711427312">Crosnoe and Huston 2007</xref>). To that end, we consider whether students complete the minimum coursework generally required for admission to a four-year university, what we call college-preparatory math.</p>
<p>Family structure, at the individual level, is associated with young people’s academic careers, including whether they persist in school and do well in core academic subjects such as mathematics. For example, young people who experience changes in family structure in childhood are less likely to complete high school compared to those who remain in two-parent families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0038040711427312">Strohschein, Roos, and Brownell 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0038040711427312">Wojtkiewicz 1993</xref>). Moreover, adolescents who reside in single-parent or stepparent families during high school have lower academic aspirations and school engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038040711427312">Astone and McLanahan 1991</xref>). Beyond snapshot measures of family structure, accounting for repeated changes in family structure independently predicts students’ poorer scholastic performance compared to adolescents who grow up in a stable family arrangement, net of current family structure status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038040711427312">Heard 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0038040711427312">Cavanagh et al. (2006)</xref> found that cumulative family instability experienced prior to high school entry was associated with adolescents’ course taking in mathematics at the end of high school, a link that was stronger than the association between family instability and the level of mathematics in which a student was enrolled in the first year of high school. Thus, accumulating evidence suggests that cumulative family instability is associated with young people’s academic achievement in general and course-taking patterns in particular. What remains less clear is how context, specifically the school context, conditions the significance of cumulative family instability in young people’s lives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0038040711427312">
<title>The Role of School Context</title>
<p>More than a warehouse for young people defined by curriculum and testing, the school is a setting for development—a space where young people access relationships, resources, and structured activities that shape learning and identity development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0038040711427312">Eccles and Gootmann 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0038040711427312">Tseng and Seidman 2007</xref>). Two ways of tapping the school context are its compositional characteristics and its school climate, defined as the character and quality of life within a school that is shaped, in part, by its overarching values, objectives, and customs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0038040711427312">Cohen et al. 2009</xref>). In this study, we consider whether the proportion of students in the school who experienced at least one family transition (a compositional dimension) and the academic press (a climate dimension) moderate the link between cumulative family instability and course-taking patterns in math.</p>
<p>Why might the family structure history of students in a school matter? At the individual level, the family instability effect is explained, in part, by diminished social capital, including a parent’s time, attention, and affection, in the parent–child relationship and parental involvement in children’s lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038040711427312">Coleman 1988</xref>). Coleman also describes social capital as productive, like other forms of capital, “making possible the achievement of certain ends that in its absence would not be possible” (p. 98). Without close parent–child relationships, parental communication and monitoring would be ineffective in promoting positive educational outcomes among adolescents. Thus, social capital resources can promote effective socialization and social control of adolescents and influence positive academic progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0038040711427312">McLanahan and Sandefur 1994</xref>). At the school level, social capital within and between families is also associated with academic functioning in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0038040711427312">Pong 1998</xref>). Evidence suggests that students at schools with a higher proportion of married parent families tend to be exposed to high-achieving, academically informed peers, better organized and more academically rigorous classrooms, and more politically powerful and involved parent networks. Conversely, adolescents at schools with a higher proportion of single-parent families are exposed to lower-achieving peers and lower-quality schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0038040711427312">Pong 1998</xref>). Thus, we expect this compositional dimension of the school to play a role in shaping adolescents’ academic trajectories.</p>
<p>We consider two ways that family structure histories of students at the school level might matter for students’ math course taking across high school. First, in what we call the <italic>advantaged ecology hypothesis</italic>, a young person living in an unstable family might do better than expected if he or she attends a school with higher proportions of peers with stable family histories, with the additional social capital within the school offsetting whatever negative impact his or her own family structure history might introduce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0038040711427312">Pong 1998</xref>). Conversely, the same student might do worse than expected in a school with a higher proportion of peers in unstable family histories, where individual-level disadvantage is magnified by lower levels of capital in the school context. Thus, the advantaged ecology hypothesis suggests that being in a school with lower proportions of peers with family instability is good for all students, especially those in unstable families.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the <italic>mismatch hypothesis</italic> posits that students in unstable families might do worse than expected if they attend schools where few peers have similar family histories. This hypothesis is derived from evidence showing that the academic gains of attending a higher-income school may be partially offset for low-income students by their poorer psychosocial adjustment and less advantageous curricular positions compared to similar students enrolled in lower-income schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0038040711427312">Crosnoe 2009</xref>). Under the mismatch hypothesis, young people in unstable families who attend schools where family instability is less common may be especially isolated from classmates and thus may be excluded from exchanges of social capital that facilitate entry into college-preparatory classes and successful completion of coursework. If so, students from unstable families would gain less academic protection in schools where high proportions of students reside in stable families. Similarly, in schools with fewer students with unstable family histories, family instability, a factor correlated with academic standing, might become an important factor by which valued things are allocated. Given that resources in schools (e.g., course slots, good teachers) are limited, school administrators and/or teachers may explicitly or implicitly use family structure history as well as the characteristics that often select parents into less stable families as filters into “good” classes. In other words, family instability, when rare among a student population, would become a stratifier in that school. Alternatively, in schools where many young people experience family structure change, family instability would not be used to distinguish students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0038040711427312">Crosnoe 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The second dimension of school context we consider is the academic press. Academic press, long considered an important dimension of school climate, measures whether the school is defined by achievement-oriented values, goals, and norms and by specific standards of achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0038040711427312">McDill, Natriello, and Pallas 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0038040711427312">Shouse 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0038040711427312">1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0038040711427312">Stern 1962</xref>). For example, taking college-prep courses can offer students high social status in one school but low social status in another. Like all indicators of school climate, academic press is a group-level phenomenon, shaping students’ values, beliefs, and behaviors whether they are conscious that this is happening or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0038040711427312">Crosnoe 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0038040711427312">Pianta and Walsh 1996</xref>). In general, a strong academic press is associated with higher-performing schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0038040711427312">Good and Brophy 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0038040711427312">Lee et al. 1999</xref>). The academic press effect comes about in two general ways. First, schools with higher press provide clearer direction and goals for students and their families. Second, it can motivate both teachers and students to achieve at higher levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0038040711427312">Lee et al. 1999</xref>). For these reasons, we expect that this dimension of the school context can moderate the association between cumulative family instability and course-taking patterns at the individual level.</p>
<p>Similar to the hypotheses outlined for school-level family instability described above, we expect that this dimension of school climate can operate in two ways. First, consistent with the advantaged ecology hypothesis, we expect that a young person living in an unstable family might do better than expected if he or she attends a school with a stronger academic press. Because of time constraints, weaker parental monitoring, and parents’ new obligations in single-parent or blended families, parents in less stable families may, despite their best efforts, be less effective in managing their children’s school performance and course-taking trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0038040711427312">Baker and Stevenson 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0038040711427312">Useem 1991</xref>). In a school with an unambiguous message about academic success, this school-level advantage may offset whatever negative impact family structure history might introduce. Conversely, a young person in an unstable family might be less likely to complete advanced coursework in a school with lower academic press.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the mismatch hypothesis posits that a student living in an unstable family might do worse than expected if he or she attends a high-academic-press school. To the extent that success in higher-press schools is contingent on parental involvement and management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0038040711427312">Lareau 2004</xref>), the impact of family instability in high-academic-press schools might be greater. For example, parents in unstable families may lack the time, income, or cultural capital required to engage with high-academic-press settings to maximize the benefits of the advantaged environment for their adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0038040711427312">Pena 2000</xref>). At the same time, teachers and administrators in high-academic-press schools might assume that students from unstable families lack the home environments necessary to prepare them for such schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0038040711427312">Deschenes, Cuban, and Tyack 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0038040711427312">Patterson, Hale, and Stessman 2007</xref>). For these reasons, students in unstable families might do worse than expected in high-press schools.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>The data for this study come from Add Health, a nationally representative sample of adolescents who were in Grades 7 through 12 in 1995, and the Adolescent Health and Achievement Study transcript study. Add Health used a multistage, stratified, school-based, cluster sampling design to select 80 high schools in 80 communities and then to select an additional 52 schools (typically middle schools) that fed into these high schools. In each study school, Add Health collected in-school questionnaires from every student who attended on the day of administration (approximately 90,000 young people). Information from school administrators was also collected as part of the in-school collection. About one year later, Add Health selected a nationally representative sample from this pool of students to participate in three in-home interviews. Wave I (<italic>n</italic> = 20,475) was conducted between April and December 1995. Parents of adolescents who participated in the in-home interview completed a separate survey instrument (<italic>n</italic> = 17,670). All Wave I adolescent respondents, except those in the 12th grade, were reinterviewed at Wave II, between April and September 1996 (<italic>n</italic> = 14,738). The Wave III interview, conducted between August 2001 and April 2002, captured respondents ages 18 through 26 and included Wave I high school seniors (<italic>n</italic> = 15,170). Approximately 74 percent of the original Wave I sample completed the Wave III questionnaire.</p>
<p>The Adolescent Health and Achievement Study, a transcript study, supplements Add Health with detailed information about educational careers. All Wave III respondents were asked to complete a high school Transcript Release Form that authorized the study personnel to collect transcripts from the last schools the respondents attended. Approximately 91 percent of the Wave III respondents signed a valid Transcript Release Form and had transcript data collected. These data provide official grades, indicators of course-taking patterns at the student and school level, and educational contexts within and among schools that can be linked to the data from the Add Health survey.</p>
<p>A handful of criteria were applied to the multiple waves of Add Health to construct the analytic sample for this study. First, the sample was limited to young people who were in high school (Grades 9, 10, 11, and 12) and at least 14 years old at Wave I (<italic>n</italic> = 14,737). This restriction was applied to ensure that our measures of school context, captured at the in-school survey, actually measure the high school context that young people experience as they move through their math trajectories. Moreover, selecting the Wave I high school cohort also ensures that all respondents had equal exposure to family instability from birth through age 14. Second, only young people with valid transcript data (a loss of 6,034 adolescents) and sampling weights (a loss of 349 adolescents) were included. Finally, because some items capturing school context were derived from the in-school survey and administrator survey, the sample was limited to young people who attended schools that participated in the in-school data collection (a loss of 1,809 adolescents). In total, the analytic sample included 6,545 youth.</p>
<sec id="section4-0038040711427312">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Using data drawn from young people’s high school transcripts, we used two indicators to capture their math trajectories at the start and end of high school. Because the math course sequence in American schools is largely standardized and follows a hierarchical structure, transcript data can be used to create math course sequences similar to those previously designed for National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS-88). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0038040711427312">Schiller and Hunt 2003</xref>). The Classification of Secondary School Courses code for each class allows a standardized classification across schools that can be collapsed into hierarchically ordered categories (0 = <italic>no math</italic>, 1 = <italic>basic/remedial</italic>, 2 = <italic>general/applied math</italic>, 3 = <italic>prealgebra</italic>, 4 = <italic>Algebra I</italic>, 5 = <italic>geometry</italic>, 6 = <italic>Algebra II</italic>, 7 = <italic>advanced math</italic>, 8 = <italic>precalculus</italic>, and 9 = <italic>calculus</italic>) for each year. Additional indicators also identify the highest math course taken within the sequence by the end of high school.</p>
<p>Using indicators that reflected the math courses for which students received credit, we used the course-sequence variable from the first year of high school to construct a binary variable that reflected whether adolescents were on time for math (<italic>completed Algebra I or a higher course in the ninth grade</italic> = 1, 0 otherwise). Students’ values on the course-sequence variables that measured the highest math course completed by the end of high school were used to construct a variable that reflected whether adolescents had completed the minimum level of math (at least Algebra II) typically required to attend a four-year university (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0038040711427312">Schneider et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0038040711427312">Stevenson et al. 1998</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Family structure change</italic> is a count of the number of family structure transitions—parental divorces, remarriages, and cohabitations—an adolescent experienced from birth to age 14. Programmed by the project staff at the University of North Carolina, four sources of data from the Wave I in-home interviews were used to construct these measures: parents’ (usually a mother’s) self-reported union history (three most recent marriage or marriage-like relationships) and current union status from the in-home parent interview; youth’s reports of their current family structure; youth’s reports of the duration of life spent with current household members, including resident parents, a stepparent, and a parent’s partner; and whether and for how long a youth lived with a nonresident biological parent. Parents also reported their union status at the time of their adolescents’ birth. These data were combined to create indicators of resident parents’ composition for each year in an adolescent’s life up to age 14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0038040711427312">Cavanagh, Schiller, and Riegle-Crumb 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0038040711427312">Heard and Harris 2001</xref>). For each year, family structure was operationalized as eight mutually exclusive categories: (1) two biological parents (whether married or cohabiting), (2) biological mother and stepfather, (3) biological father and stepmother, (4) two adoptive parents, (5) surrogate parents (foster, relative, or other type of parent), (6) single-mother family, (7) single-father family, and (8) no parent or person acting in the parental role.</p>
<p>From this array, we counted the number of family structure status changes experienced from birth through age 14. In total, an adolescent could report up to nine reported changes in family structure up to age 14. For example, an adolescent who was born into a family with two biological parents who then resided with her single mother at age 5 and then lived with her single father from age 8 through age 14 would have a family-instability score of 2. Likewise, an adolescent who always lived in a mother-only family and an adolescent who always lived with two biological parents would have a family instability value of 0. Because a parent’s union history is truncated at the third most recent union and some family transitions may be unknowable to teens or unreported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0038040711427312">Brown and Manning 2009</xref>), the number of family structure transitions may be underestimated. Nearly two thirds of respondents experienced no family structure change by age 14, 18 percent experienced one family structure change, and 15 percent experienced two or more changes. To account for youth’s family context at high school entry, we also included a set of indicators reflecting family structure status at age 14 (i.e., stepparent families, single-parent families, and other families, with two biological parent and adoptive parent families as the reference). Results were similar when we controlled for youth’s family structure at birth.</p>
<p>We capture two dimensions of the high school context. First, using Wave I reports of family instability described above, we calculated the proportion of students who experienced at least one transition from birth to age 14 within each school. Because Add Health included students in 144 schools, and the number of students within each school who completed the Wave I interview ranged from 6 to 1,344, with most schools contributing between 80 and 160 students to the Wave I sample, this indicator proxied students’ exposure to family instability within the school. Our second indicator, academic press, was the mean of four standardized items measured during the in-school survey: mean academic achievement, mean educational aspirations (adolescent rating, on a scale of 1 to 5, of how much he or she wants to go to college), percentage of the student body taking math and science classes, and percentage of seniors going on to four-year colleges. The first three items in this scale were created by aggregating all responses on the in-school survey (a near census of each school) within each school, and the last was measured by the reports of an administrator from each school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0038040711427312">Crosnoe and Needham 2004</xref>). Developed using the National Educational Longitudinal Study, this scale was adapted to Add Health data and has been validated in a number of studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0038040711427312">Crosnoe 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Related maternal and paternal characteristics and adolescent characteristics were also included to account for adolescents’ differential opportunities to experience family structure change and academic differences in high school. These include child gender, age at Wave I, race/ethnicity, and youth reports of the highest degree earned by the parent.</p>

<title>Analytic Plan</title>
<p>The primary goal of this article was to explore the degree to which the association between cumulative family instability and young people’s educational trajectories was moderated by school context. We began by exploring how the key analysis variables vary by the school context descriptively. Trichotomizing both dimensions of school context—low (&lt;1 <italic>SD</italic> below the mean), moderate (±1 <italic>SD</italic> of the mean), and high (&gt;1 <italic>SD</italic> of the mean)—we examined how the relationship between family structure history and academic progress varied across different school settings. Equal proportions of the analytic sample (about 12 percent of students) attended schools with low levels (13 schools) or high levels (20 schools) of family instability, with the balance characterized by moderate instability. Twelve percent of students attended schools with low academic press, 18 percent attended schools with high academic press, and the remainder attended schools described as having moderate academic press. The correlation between school-level family instability and academic press was –.37, such that higher levels of academic press were associated with lower levels of family instability within schools.</p>
<p>Next, we explored these associations in a multivariate context using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS, a multilevel modeling procedure that handles dichotomous outcomes. A multilevel approach is ideal for several reasons. First, it explicitly takes into account that students in Add Health are clustered within schools and are not statistically independent observations. Standard errors can be underestimated when within-school clustering is not taken into account. This technique models a random intercept (e.g., allowing the dependent variable to vary across schools) to handle the clustering of data and also incorporates sampling weights. Second, this procedure allows for the introduction of school-level factors as predictors of course-taking patterns, the estimation of a random slope for family instability (e.g., allowing the association between family instability and course-taking behaviors to vary across schools), and the inclusion of cross-level interaction terms (e.g., between family instability and each school-level factor) to explain this random slope. Thus, the final models gauged the role of family and school factors in course-taking behaviors across high school and the degree to which school factors countered or exacerbated the academic implications of cumulative family instability.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>At the bivariate level, family structure history and academic trajectories varied in meaningful ways by school context (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0038040711427312">Table 1</xref>). Beginning with school-level family instability, young people in high-exposure schools (where the proportion of students who had experienced at least one family structure transition was one standard deviation above the mean or higher) were more likely to have experienced more family instability from birth to age 14 themselves and were less likely to have resided in a two-biological-parent family than other youth. Similarly, those in low-exposure schools (where the proportion of students who had experienced at least one family structure transition was at least one standard deviation below the mean) reported lower levels of family instability and were much more likely to reside with two biological parents compared to others. Thus, these associations highlight the clustering of young people by family structure history within schools.</p>

<p>School-level family instability also distinguished the course-taking trajectories of young people. Young people in schools with low exposure to family instability were more likely to have been on time in their math course enrollment in ninth grade (i.e., completed at least Algebra I) (87 percent) than their peers at moderate- and high-exposure schools (68 percent and 58 percent, respectively). The low-exposure advantage persisted through the end of high school, with 84 percent of these young people completing college-prep math by the end of high school. At the same time, the disadvantages associated with high-exposure schools became more pronounced, with slightly more than half in these schools completing college-prep math courses by the end of high school. Still, those in moderate-exposure schools did better than those in high-exposure schools. With the exception of age at Wave I, group differences on all variable means by school-level family instability were statistically significant.</p>
<p>Similar analyses were conducted with variation in academic press. Young people in low-press schools reported significantly more family instability compared with those in moderate- and high-press schools. Those in high-academic-press schools reported the lowest levels of family instability; however, differences between those in moderate- and high-press schools were not statistically significant. Those in high-press schools were also more likely to live with both biological parents and less likely to live in other family forms compared with all youth. With respect to course-taking behaviors, more students completed at least Algebra I by ninth grade in schools with a higher academic press. Eighty-five percent of young people were on time in ninth grade at high-press schools, about two thirds were on time in moderate-press schools, and slightly more than half were on time in low-academic-press schools. The proportion of students enrolled in college-preparatory math courses by the end of high school follow a similar pattern by level of academic press. Again, differences in course taking for those in moderate- and low-academic-press schools were statistically significant from each other. Unless otherwise noted, all variable means by school level of academic press were statistically significant.</p>
<p>With this as background, we then explored the effects of individual-level family instability and school context on students’ on-time mathematics enrollment in ninth grade, net of individual-, family-, and school-level factors (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0038040711427312">Table 2</xref>). Model 1 considers the main effect of individual-level cumulative family instability on math course taking in ninth grade. Cumulative family instability had a marginal, negative association with young people’s math course taking at the start of high school. This effect was attenuated once family structure status was included (model not shown). Factors like not living with any biological parent at age 14, being male or African American, or having a parent with less than a high school degree were also negatively associated with young people’s math trajectory at the start of high school. Being Asian American, having at least one parent with more than a high school degree, and attending a school with higher academic press were positively associated with young people’s math trajectory at the start of high school.</p>

<p>We expected that the association between individual-level family instability and math course taking would vary by school context. As an empirical test, we added cross-level interaction terms between students’ own experience of family instability and school-level academic press (Model 2) and school-level family instability (Model 3). Academic press moderated the associations between family instability and on-time enrollment in ninth-grade math. At the start of high school, cumulative family instability represented a competitive disadvantage for young people in schools with higher levels of academic press. To be sure, young people in high-academic-press schools started off more advantaged than all others. Yet as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0038040711427312">Figure 1</xref>, the disadvantage associated with increases in family instability was most pronounced among young people in these schools. With each transition, the probability of being on time in ninth-grade math declined by approximately 3 percent. (Probabilities are estimated with all covariates except those of interest held at their means.) The disadvantage associated with cumulative family instability was about half that for students in moderate-press schools, and very small (about 1 percentage point change between 0 and 3 transitions) for students in low-press schools. Subtracting Model 1’s fit statistic (36108.8) from Model 2’s (36139.4) indicates that the interaction model (30.6, <italic>df</italic> = 1) is a better fit and provides further support for the observed interaction effect.</p>

<p>No significant interaction between individual-level family instability and school-level family instability was detected for on-time enrollment in ninth-grade math. We conclude school-level family instability does not moderate how students’ own family instability histories shape their initial math course taking in high school in the population Add Health represents. The coefficients and standard errors associated with individual-level family instability and the cross-level instability interaction term, however, are fairly large, suggesting collinearity in the model. In other words, the clustering of family structure history within schools, as noted above, is reflected in our multivariate model, and we are unable to disentangle the separate effects of individual-level and school-level instability on on-time enrollment in ninth-grade math.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0038040711427312">Table 3</xref> shows results from our multivariate analysis predicting the log-odds of enrolling in college-preparatory math by the end of high school. As in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0038040711427312">Table 2</xref>, Model 1 explores the main effect of cumulative family instability, net of select control factors, and Models 2 and 3 include cross-level interactions between individual-level family instability with academic press and school-level family instability, respectively. In each model, we also include a dichotomous indicator of whether a student was on time in math in ninth grade. Thus, we are testing the effect of individual- and school-level characteristics on young people’s end-of-high-school status, net of where they were at the start of high school.</p>

<p>Model 1 indicates that family instability experienced up to age 14 has a modest yet enduring association with a student’s math course-taking trajectory, with each additional transition reducing the odds of completing college-preparatory math by about 10 percent, <italic>B</italic> = –.09, exp(B) = .904. Young people living in single-parent families or without a biological or adoptive parent at 14, Latinos, and boys were also less likely to complete college-preparatory math compared with others. Being on time in ninth-grade math was strongly predictive of enrolling in college-preparatory math, as was being Asian American and having at least one parent with more than a high school education. It is important to note that many of these individual-level associations were also linked with where young people were at the start of high school (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0038040711427312">Table 2</xref>). Thus, the persistence of the cumulative family instability effect or the effect of being male, for instance, means that these disadvantages continue to shape young people’s academic trajectories during high school, net of where they started in high school.</p>
<p>Academic press moderated the association between individual-level family instability and the completion of college-preparatory math at the end of high school (Model 2). More specifically, cumulative family instability represented a greater disadvantage in math course taking for young people in schools with higher levels of academic press; cumulative family instability had a slight negative impact on young people in moderate- and low-academic-press schools (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0038040711427312">Figure 2</xref>). In fact, the findings suggest a crossover effect, with the likelihood of completing college-preparatory math by the end of high school actually lower for young people who experienced two or more transitions in high-press schools compared with others who experienced a similar amount of instability but were enrolled in lower-press schools. Other indicators of family structure history and individual- and family-level characteristics remain largely unchanged when this interaction is taken into account. Subtracting Model 1’s fit statistics (37138.3) from Model 2’s (37157.2) suggests that the interaction model (28.9; <italic>df</italic> = 1) is a better fit and provides further support for the observed interaction effect.</p>

<p>The main effect of academic press is not statistically significant in Model 2, indicating that the level of academic press was unrelated to the likelihood of completing Algebra II when a student had experienced no family instability. The statistically significant interaction term in Model 2, however, suggests that the influence of academic press is limited to students who have experienced family structure change. Such a finding is consistent with the mismatch hypothesis.</p>
<p>As with on-time status in ninth-grade math, school-level family instability did not moderate the association of family instability and the odds of completing at least college-prep math by the end of high school (Model 3). Again, the coefficients and standard errors are fairly large, suggesting collinearity in the model. We interpret these results as an indicator of small cell sizes for selected student subgroups. Specifically, given the results of our descriptive analysis, we expect that there are relatively few students who had experienced family instability themselves but who were enrolled in schools with low levels of instability where they completed college-preparatory math. The limited variation across these three indicators may explain the lack of significant findings pertaining to the cross-level effects of family instability on academic achievement.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Prior research has established that adolescents who have experienced repeated changes in family structure before starting high school are as likely as their schoolmates in stable family structures to begin high school on time in math but less likely to complete college-preparatory coursework by the end of high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0038040711427312">Cavanagh et al. 2006</xref>). This pattern suggests that the high school context catalyzes the relationship between family instability and academic performance in ways that are consequential for students’ eventual educational and socioeconomic attainment.</p>
<p>To test out this idea, we exploited the variation across American high schools on two dimensions of school context: the proportion of students in a school who had experienced family change and the level of academic press in a school. We developed two hypotheses to describe how school context might moderate the association between the individual experience of repeated family change and adolescents’ math course-taking patterns in high school. The advantaged ecology hypothesis posited that schools composed largely of adolescents from stable home environments or characterized by high levels of academic press would make students who had experienced family instability more likely to begin high school on time in mathematics and to complete college-preparatory coursework by the end of high school than students with similar family histories in schools with fewer stable families or lower academic press. The mismatch hypothesis postulated that students who had experienced repeated family structure change would have depressed academic trajectories when they attended schools with lower proportions of students who also experienced family change or more academically rigorous schools compared to students in schools with higher levels of family instability or lower levels of academic press.</p>
<p>Taken together, our analysis supported the mismatch hypothesis, but only with regard to the level of academic press in a school. We found, at the start of high school, a modest main effect of cumulative family instability on the likelihood that adolescents are on time in their math course taking, that is, that they complete Algebra I by the end of ninth grade. The cross-level analysis, however, suggests a more nuanced association, with the link between family instability and course taking conditioned by the academic press of the school. For example, in high-academic-press schools, students who had experienced three changes in family structure by ninth grade were about 7 percent less likely to be on time in math compared to students who had experienced no change. In moderate-academic-press schools, the difference in on-time enrollment between students in stable and highly unstable families was less than half that. By the end of high school, this initial disadvantage persisted in schools with stronger academic press. All else equal, students who attended schools with higher levels of academic press were about 15 percent less likely to complete college-preparatory math when they had experienced three or more changes in family structure, compared to students who had experienced no family structure change prior to entering high school. Family instability was less consequential for students in schools with lower levels of academic press. We also found that for students who had experienced no family change, the strong main effect of academic press that was present in predicting on-time enrollment in ninth-grade math was no longer statistically significant at the end of high school. In other words, the effects of academic press persisted through high school only for students who had experienced family change. No evidence that school-level family instability conditioned the focal relationship between family instability and academic standing in mathematics at the start and end of school was identified.</p>
<p>We offer three points of speculation for future research to identify the point of disconnect between parents, adolescents, and schools. First, students who have experienced frequent changes in family structure may reside in families that are less equipped to provide young people the supports that schools with high levels of academic rigor regard as normative, either because of parental characteristics that select them into unstable unions or because of changes in family processes resulting from family or partner instability. Parents who have experienced repeated union changes have lower educational attainment themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0038040711427312">Fomby and Cherlin 2007</xref>). At the same time, children with these family histories are exposed to higher levels of maternal stress and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0038040711427312">Osborne and McLanahan 2007</xref>) and may experience less consistent parental involvement as parents manage the economic strain of union dissolution or balance social roles and responsibilities in blended families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0038040711427312">Lee 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, parents in unstable families may be less able to access social capital to get their children invested in school-level norms about learning or to negotiate the complex organization of contemporary American high schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0038040711427312">Lareau 2004</xref>). A family’s lack of school-based social capital may emerge from family instability either because of frequent school changes associated with family structure change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038040711427312">Fomby and Sennott 2009</xref>) or because of parents’ lower engagement in parental networks even where students remain in the same school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0038040711427312">Pong 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, schools, especially those with fewer students with unstable family histories, may unintentionally use young people’s family structure history as a way of differentiating and ultimately stratifying students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0038040711427312">Crosnoe 2009</xref>). This might be especially so in high-academic-press schools where competition for a limited number of spots in advanced courses is higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0038040711427312">Crosnoe 2009</xref>). Students in less rigorous schools, in contrast, may have less competition for spots in advanced classes, so that a deficit in social capital or preparation associated with family instability may be less consequential. Moreover, given the correlation between school-level family instability and academic press, lower-press schools likely have more students with unstable family histories, making this characteristic a less meaningful factor used to distinguish students.</p>
<p>Why do we find evidence of a mismatch with school-level press but not with school-level family instability? Two explanations seem reasonable. The first relates to the reliability of these measures. Our school-level measure of family instability is based on the experiences of all students in a respondent’s school who completed the Wave I in-home interview, whereas our measure of academic press is based on a near census of students at a respondent’s school. As a result, the latter set of measures may provide a more robust estimate of the school context than do our measures of family instability. Although family structure—in a single-parent household or not—was included in the in-school questionnaire (and thus available for the whole student body), it does not get at the issue of cumulative instability that we are most interested in. Furthermore, in analyses with that cruder measure (findings not shown), the proportion of students in a school residing with a single parent did not condition the link between individual-level family instability and students’ academic status at the start or end of high school. Still, better measurement of cumulative family instability at the school level might provide more compelling results.</p>
<p>A second explanation might be related to the issue of multicollinearity. As is clear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0038040711427312">Table 1</xref>, young people raised in less stable families tend to be clustered in schools with peers who were also raised in less stable families; conversely, those in stable families were much more likely to attend schools with fewer peers raised in unstable families. Given the strength of this correlation, we may be unable to disentangle the separate effects of individual-level and school-level instability on academic status in high school. The bivariate association between individual- and school-level family instability, however, provides a compelling example of the ways family structure history is associated with school boundaries within and across communities in the United States. Moreover, it suggests ways that the accumulation or absence of resources—social, economic, and cultural—within a school district can compound differences in individual- or family-level resources.</p>
<p>Although our findings advance the way we think about the implications of family instability in young people’s lives, this study is not without limitations. The first limitation is that we fail to consider dropping out as a potential outcome in these multilevel models. We estimated a hierarchical multinomial logistic regression predicting the log-odds of dropping out, graduating without college-preparatory math, or graduating with advanced coursework versus graduating with college-preparatory coursework. Those models did not converge, possibly because of small cell sizes in estimating the odds of each outcome for each family instability/academic press category. Instead, we considered the link between cumulative family instability and the odds of dropping out of high school (about 6 percent of the sample dropped out). If family instability is predictive of school dropout, then our models overestimate the relationship between family structure change and course-taking patterns. In a multivariate logistic regression, however, the odds of dropping out were not related to cumulative family instability, suggesting that the influence of school dropout on our results is minor.</p>
<p>A second limitation relates to our measure of family instability. Our analysis is limited by the absence of information about students’ family instability beyond ninth grade. Because of the study design, we were not able to develop complete family structure histories during the high school years for all students in our sample. We recognize, however, that families that have experienced changes in union status in the past are more likely than stable families to experience later change. Therefore, part of what we attribute to prior family instability may be the result of family instability experienced while students are in high school. Furthermore, students who experienced family instability for the first time in high school are not captured by our measure of family instability up to age 14. We contend that there is theoretical basis to expect that prior instability would have lasting consequences for students to the extent that early instability disrupts parents’ involvement in children’s schooling in ways that have long-term consequences for their children’s academic trajectories, an argument that has been supported in prior empirical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0038040711427312">Cavanagh, Schiller, and Riegle-Crumb 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038040711427312">Heard 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, we focus only on the effect of cumulative family instability, treating each transition with equal weight. Recent research has begun to explore whether different types of transitions, particularly parents’ entrances and exits from a relationship, vary in their impact on family members. For example, research on a population of mothers with young children has established that mothers’ reported parenting stress, material hardship, and depression decline when they enter a new relationship but increase when they leave a relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0038040711427312">Cooper et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0038040711427312">Osborne, Berger, and Magnuson, forthcoming</xref>). Although we recognize the importance of this scholarship, we have focused on the effect of cumulative instability, arguing that all transitions potentially introduce disorder into adolescents’ lives and affect their academic trajectories. Our primary purpose was to identify cross-level interactions between individual experience and school context. Having established that relationship, future work may explore cross-level interactions between social contact and relationship formation and dissolution separately.</p>
<p>The third limitation is that we have information only on school composition and academic press for the high schools where students were enrolled in ninth grade. If a student changed schools, our analysis used information from his or her old high school to predict college-preparatory and advanced course taking in the new school. We expect school change to be more likely among adolescents in unstable families. In the full Add Health sample, we found that students who had experienced any family structure change by Wave I were about 18 percent more likely than peers in stable families to have changed schools by Wave II, but the percentage of students who changed schools overall was small. To the extent that school change is a factor, our results bias the effect of school context on students’ course taking. We note, however, that the interaction terms between family instability and academic press are similar in magnitude for course taking at both the start and the end of high school, giving us confidence that our models estimating the effects of school context are valid.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, our research provides evidence that school context conditions students’ experience of family instability to contribute to differential outcomes in course taking in a highly structured and highly valued subject such as mathematics. Our findings may best be summarized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0038040711427312">Crosnoe’s (2009)</xref> concept of “lost gains”: While students in high-academic-press schools, regardless of family instability histories, are higher achieving in terms of course taking compared to their peers overall, students who have experienced repeated family structure changes lose some part of their advantage. We posit that this disadvantage is the result of a mismatch between the resources—real and perceived—that students from unstable families bring to high-academic-press schools and the resources that are required to thrive in such schools. This mismatch poses a challenge to policy makers and educators who seek to ameliorate social disadvantage through access to opportunity and resources in higher-performing schools.</p>
