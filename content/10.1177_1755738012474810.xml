<sec id="sec1-1755738012474810"><title>The CSA home visit case</title>
<p>Visiting patients at home is an important part of UK primary care. The visit request may be made by patients or by their relatives, for the elderly housebound, children or adult patients who are too unwell (or who perceive themselves as being too unwell) to attend surgery.</p>
<p>At home the doctor sees patients in their own environment and some of the usual consultation resources, e.g. examination couch, peak flowmeter or tuning fork, may not be available. Often the demeanour of patients is different to when they attend the surgery. The patient may be confined to bed or possibly immobile. There may be poor lighting conditions. Sometimes patients are embarrassed by the visit and may minimise the problem. There may be an array of tablets lying around and no other professional or family support to call upon. The visiting GP will often therefore be left to adapt him/herself to the patient’s setting and circumstances and may need to make important decisions about management on the spot.</p>
<p>On a home visit the vigilant doctor can learn much about the coping strategies and social circumstances of the patient. Compared to a surgery consultation, the situation may demand more sophisticated skills in gathering information and an ability to apply sound medical management within the context of the patient’s home environment. There is also a need for effective interpersonal and observational skills to carry your management plan through.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, therefore, it seems reasonable to include a home visit case in the CSA examination.</p>
<sec id="sec2-1755738012474810"><title>How is the CSA home visit case different?</title>
<p>Unlike the other cases, the candidate is likely to be unfamiliar with the ‘setup’ until he or she walks into the room and so will need to rely on observational skills, taking in the patient’s behaviour and also the environmental surroundings. Pay particular attention to the initial contact; so, for example, can the patient greet you at the door or is he or she bed bound? Does the patient have an abnormal gait and what is his/her opening statement as you enter the room? Look for other clues, as there may be vital clinical pointers that can be easily missed by the unobservant.</p>
<p>There may be a relative present and this person may be vociferous. This is part of the challenge and the case will be written to take account of their contribution; your skills in handling this type of pressure will be assessed. Be aware of time, as your 10 minutes will pass very quickly!</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1755738012474810"><title>What happens in the exam?</title>
<p>Not all CSA circuits contain a home visit but if there is to be one on yours this will be made known to you in the pre-examination briefing. During the 2 minute break between cases, and at the appropriate point on the circuit, an exam marshal will call you from your room and you will be escorted to the station where the home visit is located and instructed to wait outside until the bell rings.</p>
<p>Take your paperwork and pencil with you. Inevitably you will be walking past examiners and role players waiting in the corridor on the circuit. Just take this in your stride.</p>
<p>When the bell rings, knock and enter the room. The examiner will already be present and sitting in a corner. Commence the consultation in the normal way and at the end of 10 minutes the bell will go, at which point you will leave the room. Don’t forget to take your paperwork with you and hand any prescription you issue to the role player (this will be assessed by the examiner). The format of assessment is exactly the same as for the other cases and the examiner will be marking against the usual three domains: information gathering, clinical management and interpersonal skills.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1755738012474810"><title>Tips</title>
<p>Read the patient summary beforehand. Look out for positive clues regarding clinical and social information and consider issues that stem from the given information that enables you to focus more quickly on the data gathering process.</p>
<p>Introduce yourself by name and check the name of the patient. Collect information from the patient and relative as to the reason for the home visit, including the main clinical and psychosocial issues and concerns. Establishing this early on enables the consultation to flow smoothly and the management process can remain focused and patient centred.</p>
<p>Remember clinical signs may be hidden under a blanket so don’t forget to strip back bed sheets if indicated. The aim here is to establish a situational appraisal upon which a pragmatic management plan can then be built.</p>
<p>Explain the problem as you see it. Negotiate a future management plan by the time the bell rings at the end of 10 minutes and have a safety-netting strategy for follow-up or referral to secondary care or to other community agency, e.g. district nurse or social services.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1755738012474810"><title>Where candidates go wrong</title>
<p>The underperforming candidate may:
<list id="list1-1755738012474810" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Fail to read material provided and reflect sufficiently on the information in the text.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fail to elicit important clinical and social or psychological information. Bedside clues may be missed and examination technique may be poor, e.g. failing to remove bedclothes to examine lower limbs. A disorganised consultation may not define the concerns of the patient and the relatives. Hence decision-making may then be based on an incomplete picture of the patient’s needs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fail to impart an explanation of the problem that is precise and clear, hence leaving the patient confused. Try to be as clear as possible in your own mind about diagnostic possibilities and explain the likely issues and plan of action to the patient and relative.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fail to keep to time. A domain that is not completed cannot be marked. As a suggestion you should be thinking about a ‘plan’ of intent for the patient after about 6–7 minutes into the consultation and incorporate this into the dialogue with the patient.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fail to negotiate effectively with the anxious or demanding patient or family. Being confrontational is unlikely to impress the examiner; a better approach is to accept the challenge politely and support the patient and relative in a compassionate but practical way.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1755738012474810" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Remember you are not on ‘home territory’. You will be assessed on your capacity to adapt to the patient’s circumstances and to formulate a management plan that is pragmatic and medically competent. This will place demands on your explanation and negotiating skills. As in all CSA cases, judgement will ultimately depend on the examiner’s perception as to whether you are likely to achieve the best outcome for your patient.</p>
