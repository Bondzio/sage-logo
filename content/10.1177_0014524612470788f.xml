<p>After a short introduction, Hahn presents 1-2 Chronicles in seven chapters. Their titles give a good indication of the manner of his reading: 1. Chronicle of All Divine History (1 Chr. 1-9); 2. Highly Exalted for the Sake of His People Israel (1 Chr. 10-16); 3. His Throne Shall Be Established Forever (1 Chr. 17); 4. God Gives Rest to His People (1 Chr. 18-29); 5. Liturgy and Empire (2 Chr. 1-9); 6. In Rebellion since That Day (2 Chr. 10-28); 7. Exile and Return (2 Chr. 29-36). The particular significance Hahn finds in the admittedly fundamental 1 Chr. 17 and 2 Chr. 1-9 is immediately obvious, the one because it is accorded a chapter of its own, the other because its theme is foreshadowed in the title of the volume. And yet, the Chronicler is much less innovative – and hence distinctive – in these two sections than anywhere else in the work, though he does make some deft alterations to the source texts. Each chapter ends with a section on Christian interpretation: the first, for example, on how Matthew and Luke appropriate the Chronicler’s genealogies. There is much to learn from Hahn; but there would be even more if he had been interacting with a range of non-English studies.</p>
