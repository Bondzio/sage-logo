<abstract>
<p>All European countries are confronted with claims by Islamic groups for religious rights in the public domain, as well as counterclaims by those who want to deny Muslims such rights. Examples are controversies over mosque construction, religious education and the right to wear headscarves and burqas. We show that across European countries there are striking differences in the kind of rights for Muslims around which public conflicts centre. Issues that are highly controversial in some countries are entirely absent from the debate in other countries. We explain these differences with reference to national path dependencies resulting from existing church–state arrangements and immigrant integration policy traditions. Using the method of political claims analysis, we conducted analyses of the German, Swiss, Dutch, Belgian, French and UK media debates on religious rights for Muslims, based on a selection of 30 national newspapers for the period 1999–2008.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1468796812470893" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years, Muslim religiosity has become controversial in Europe, both because Muslims and their representative organizations put the recognition of their religious practices on the agenda, and because the increased visibility of Muslim religiosity (e.g. in the form of mosques) has encountered resistance from native populations and right-wing populist political parties. In this article, we analyse cross-national differences and temporal dynamics of contestation over Islamic religious rights in six West European countries with large Muslim populations of immigrant origin: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Given the similarity of the problem of accommodating a new religion, one might expect similar reactions and solutions to issues of Islamic religious rights across countries. Indeed, as we will show, controversies over Islamic religious rights have become more intense in all six countries since the late 1990s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1468796812470893">1</xref></sup> Moreover, all of them have granted Muslims more rights since the early 1980s. However, beyond these broad similarities we also find striking differences regarding the kinds of rights that are contested and the extent of the expansion of Islamic religious rights on the policy level.</p>
<p>To explain cross-national differences, we argue that policy responses have been shaped by pre-existing church–state institutions and ideologies, as well as by whether countries have pursued a more inclusive or exclusive approach to immigrant citizenship rights. These differential institutional contexts define opportunity structures for claim-making about Islamic religious rights, and explain why certain rights are highly controversial in one country, while they are hardly debated at all in other countries, either because they are consensually accepted, or because they are consensually rejected.</p>
<p>In the next section we present our theoretical model and develop a typology of rights that distinguishes more limited from more expansive kinds of Islamic religious rights. From these theoretical considerations we derive hypotheses about cross-national differences and temporal dynamics of contention over Muslim religious rights. Subsequently we discuss citizenship and church–state regimes in the six countries of study, and how they have resulted in varying levels of institutional accommodation of Muslim religious rights, using original data on Islamic religious rights across the period 1980–2008. From there we move to the analysis of claim-making over Islamic religious rights in the period 1999–2008, using data drawn from 30 newspapers across our countries of study. We first present descriptive results to show which types of issues were debated in which countries and how the intensity of debates varied over time, and then conduct a multivariate analysis to test our hypotheses about cross-national differences, temporal dynamics and their interaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1468796812470893"><title>Conceptual framework and hypotheses</title>
<p>To delimit claims over religious rights, we refer to the definition of rights as ‘entitlements (not) to perform certain actions or be in certain states, or entitlements that others (not) perform certain actions or be in certain states’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/</ext-link>). Claims about religious rights then contest entitlements regarding the performance (e.g. to be buried according to Islamic prescriptions) or non-performance (e.g. dispensation from mixed swimming classes) of certain actions for religious reasons, or they are about entitlements that require others to perform (e.g. to create prayer spaces in schools) or refrain from performing (e.g. not to depict the Prophet Mohammed) certain actions for religious reasons.</p>
<p>The central aspect of claims about religious rights for Muslims that we seek to explain is what we call their degree of obtrusiveness. We do not use the term ‘obtrusiveness’ in a normative sense, but define obtrusive rights as those that have a greater potential for conflict with the institutions and the dominant culture of the host society. Although many different factors may determine the degree of obtrusiveness of claims for religious rights, we focus on three general dimensions that have been identified in the literature as being relevant beyond the specificities of particular controversies and national contexts. First, church–state controversies have historically focused mostly on the demarcation of religious rights in public institutions such as the education and public media systems, the army and the state administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468796812470893">Ewing, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468796812470893">Fetzer and Soper, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468796812470893">Koenig, 2005</xref>) Therefore, we distinguish between more obtrusive claims about religious rights in public institutions and less obtrusive claims that refer to contexts outside public institutions. Second, legislation, jurisprudence and normative debates usually take into account whether a practice belongs to the mainstream of Islam as it is practised by the majority or at least by large minorities within the Islamic world (e.g. mosques) or whether it is limited to small, and usually more orthodox, minorities of Muslims (e.g. burqas). Third, we analyse whether claims refer to rights that only require an extension of existing church–state arrangements for Christian denominations, which we refer to, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468796812470893">Statham et al. (2005)</xref>, as parity claims (e.g. to build houses of worship), or they refer to recognition of a practice for which there is no uncontested equivalent in Christianity, which we will refer to, again following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468796812470893">Statham et al. (2005)</xref>, as special rights (e.g. halal food provision).</p>
<p>We assume that, within any country context and at any given point in time, claims for rights in public institutions, for non-mainstream Muslim practices and for special rights will have greater conflict potential than claims for private, mainstream and parity rights. Importantly, however, this does not mean that we expect the same kind of rights to have the same level of obtrusiveness in different countries. For instance, we assume headscarves for teachers (who are public servants) to be more obtrusive than headscarves for pupils in both the United Kingdom and France, but that does not exclude the possibility that headscarves for pupils provoke as much controversy in France as do headscarves for teachers in the UK, or possibly even more. Claim-making in the public sphere is always about contested boundaries. In that sense public debates tend to exclude claims that are at a particular time and place either so consensually accepted (such as headscarves for pupils in the United Kingdom) or so consensually considered out of bounds (such as headscarves for teachers in France) that no one bothers to make claims for or against them. Our aim in this article is precisely to understand why in some cases conflicts around Islam centre around claims for relatively non-obtrusive, basic religious rights, while at other times and places public controversies focus on Muslim rights of higher obtrusiveness along the three dimensions that we have distinguished.</p>
<p>To explain cross-national differences, we argue that debates on Muslim religious rights are influenced by nationally distinct approaches regarding immigrants' access to citizenship rights, on the one hand, and church–state regimes, on the other. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468796812470893">Koopmans et al. (2005)</xref> have shown more generally for contention over immigration and immigrant integration that these factors are critical because they define the institutional and discursive opportunity structures that shape mobilization patterns of migrants themselves, as well as those of pro-migrant and anti-migrant political actors.</p>
<p>National approaches to citizenship structure access to rights along two dimensions. First, immigrants as individuals can have easier or more difficult access to full citizenship rights – a dimension that has often been linked to ‘ethnic’ and ‘civic’ conceptions of nationhood (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468796812470893">Brubaker, 1992</xref> – and thereby to the right to vote and be elected. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468796812470893">Koopmans et al. (2012)</xref> have shown more generally that the size of the immigrant electorate exerts a positive effect on the extension of rights to immigrants and we assume that this mechanism holds for Muslims and their rights, too. In countries where Muslim citizens are a relevant electoral factor and politicians from a Muslim background are more strongly represented in legislative bodies on different levels of the polity, opportunities for Muslims to claim rights will be more favourable and there will be more constraints facing those who want to deny Muslims rights. Moreover, access to citizenship can influence debates on Muslims’ rights in a very direct way if access to certain public positions is tied to citizenship. For instance, the right of teachers or policewomen to wear a headscarf is not likely to become a contested issue as long as most Muslims are non-citizens who do not have access to such public service jobs anyway.</p>
<p>The second dimension of citizenship rights refers to the degree to which states make cultural assimilation demands and are willing to grant cultural and religious rights to minorities. Here we can distinguish between ‘monist’ or ‘assimilationist’ and ‘pluralist’ or ‘multicultural’ approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468796812470893">Koopmans et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468796812470893">Kymlicka, 1995</xref>). Potential citizens in assimilationist states face higher cultural barriers to naturalization, such as language requirements. Multicultural regimes, by contrast, recognize the right of ethnic minority groups to maintain their cultural differences, also within the context of public institutions, among other things by granting exemptions from existing rules and obligations, providing state support and recognition for minority organizations, and supporting the creation of special institutions for such groups, for instance in education or in the media. Opportunities for Muslim rights claims will be more favourable and denying them such rights will be more difficult in pluralist than assimilationist regimes.</p>
<p>This second dimension of access to citizenship rights for immigrants is closely related to how states have historically resolved conflicts between the state and Christian churches (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468796812470893">Bader, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468796812470893">Lipset and Rokkan, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468796812470893">Madeley, 2003</xref>). Some countries (e.g. the ‘laicist’ tradition of France and in some Swiss cantons) mandate a strict separation between the two, in which the state and public institutions are committed to secularism and in which the role of religion in the public sphere is restricted. Other countries have a more intertwined state–church relationship whereby the state recognizes and materially supports one official state church (e.g. the United Kingdom and the Scandinavian countries), a limited number of recognized churches (as in Germany’s system of public corporation status for a limited number of, mainly Christian, denominations) or a plurality of religious denominations. Muslim claims for rights will be more difficult to resist in countries in which reference can be made to Christian (and sometimes also Jewish) precedents. It will, however, be more difficult for Muslims to claim rights in countries such as Germany, where access to religious rights depends on formal state recognition, than in countries such as the Netherlands, where it is largely up to religious minorities to define themselves as a group entitled to rights such as publicly financed religious schools. Muslim claims will face the greatest barriers where even Christian churches have historically been denied many privileges and rights in the context of a strict state secularism.</p>
<p>Our general expectation is that claim-making will focus on more obtrusive religious rights in countries that have inclusive and pluralist approaches to immigrant citizenship rights, and where existing church–state arrangements grant organized religions access to recognition, rights and state resources. In such contexts, Muslims face a relatively conducive opportunity structure and will find it easier to obtain basic religious rights, whereas opponents of Muslim rights will find it difficult to counter such claims. As a result, both Muslim political entrepreneurs and their opponents will shift attention to more obtrusive demands. This leads to our first hypothesis:<disp-quote>
<p>H1: The level of obtrusiveness of claim-making about Islamic religious rights will be greatest in countries with inclusive and pluralist immigrant citizenship and state–church regimes.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>We apply a similar reasoning to variation across the temporal dimension. We assume that in all countries debates over Muslim religious rights initially focus on basic rights of limited obtrusiveness. Over time, some of these basic issues will be settled, either because the right becomes established or because a broadly shared agreement is reached that the right cannot be granted. Thus our second hypothesis is:<disp-quote>
<p>H2: Over time, claim-making on religious rights for Muslims will shift from less to more obtrusive issues in all countries.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Our final hypothesis posits an interaction effect between the two previous hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 states that obtrusive claim-making is more likely in countries with inclusive and pluralistic immigrant citizenship and church–state regimes, where basic Muslim religious rights were relatively quickly granted. This implies that the claim shift over time posited by hypothesis 2 is likely to be strongest in inclusive countries, where the debate does not dwell for long on the most basic rights, and weakest in countries with restrictive citizenship and church–state regimes, where even rights that are uncontroversial and quickly resolved in other countries may remain on the political agenda for a long time. Thus it follows that:<disp-quote>
<p>H3: The shift towards more obtrusive claim-making will be most pronounced in countries with inclusive and pluralist immigrant citizenship and church–state regimes.</p></disp-quote></p>
<sec id="sec3-1468796812470893"><title>Citizenship rights, state–church regimes and their impact on Muslim religious rights</title>
<p>We selected the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, France and Belgium as our countries of study because they face similar challenges regarding the integration of Muslim migrants, but have different cultural and legal frameworks for church–state relations and access of immigrants to citizenship rights. Regarding immigrants’ access to individual citizenship rights (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468796812470893">Howard, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468796812470893">Janoski, 2010</xref>), France and the United Kingdom have historically had <italic>jus soli</italic> attribution of nationality to second-generation immigrants and a relatively short waiting period of five years for naturalization of the first generation. In France, however, naturalization has remained conditional on assimilation requirements. The Netherlands also have a waiting time of five years and have had so-called ‘double <italic>jus soli</italic>’ since the early 1950s, which entails that the third generation automatically becomes Dutch. Moreover, the second generation can claim Dutch citizenship by unilateral and unconditional declaration at majority. In addition, these three countries have important immigrant populations from former colonies, including Muslim groups from countries such as Pakistan, Algeria or Suriname, who already held citizenship upon arrival.</p>
<p>The open citizenship traditions of these three countries contrast most clearly with Switzerland, which knows no <italic>jus soli</italic> attribution of citizenship and has waiting times for the first generation of 12 years or more. In addition, naturalizing immigrants are supposed to show assimilation to Swiss customs. Germany was until recently similar to Switzerland, but has in 2000 introduced a limited form of <italic>jus soli</italic> and has reduced naturalization waiting times to eight years. Belgium, finally, takes an in-between position. It reduced waiting times for naturalization to five years and introduced double <italic>jus soli</italic> in the 1980s, but, somewhat like France, naturalization remained conditional on a ‘desire to integrate’. In 2000, Belgium further reduced the waiting time for naturalizations to three years and removed the ‘desire to integrate’ clause. As a result, naturalization rates have increased strongly in recent years.</p>
<p>Turning now to church–state regimes (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468796812470893">Fetzer and Soper, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468796812470893">Koenig, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468796812470893">Laurence and Vaisse, 2006</xref>), the two most contrasting cases are the Netherlands and France. Pillarization is key to understanding the Dutch case. Established in the late nineteenth century as a result of an ideological struggle between Catholic, Protestant and secular groups, it describes the denominational segregation of Dutch society until the 1960s. The pillarization system gave religious or ideological groups the right to establish their own social infrastructure with government support. Each pillar had its own social institutions, such as broadcasting corporations, political parties, trade unions, health care providers, schools and universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468796812470893">Lijphart, 1975</xref>). Although since the 1960s pillarization has largely disappeared as a sociological phenomenon, its institutional and legal features have to an important extent survived, and have become an important point of reference for debates about religious rights for Muslims.</p>
<p>By contrast, the French ideology of secular republicanism, and its church–state pendant of <italic>laïcité</italic>, define a much more restrictive opportunity structure for Muslim migrants’ religious rights. In contrast to the Dutch tradition, state–church separation here means that there is no place for religion in public institutions. Whereas in the Netherlands there is a broad consensus that only exceptional situations warrant state interventions in the freedom of religion, in France it is similarly consensual that public servants should not display visible markers of religiosity. Separate institutions for religious groups are likewise not seen in a positive light, and Catholic schools have had to fight hard to obtain recognition and still do not receive full state funding as in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The other countries occupy less clear-cut positions. In Germany the state recognizes several Christian and Jewish denominations as public corporations (<italic>Körperschaften des öffentlichen Rechts</italic>). This status entails a range of privileges, including the levying of church taxes and the right to organize religious education classes in state schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468796812470893">Davie, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468796812470893">Kolb, 2000</xref>). In only one of the 16 federal states, Berlin, an Islamic group has been granted the right to organize religious classes in public schools.</p>
<p>Like Germany, Belgium has a system of official recognition of religious groups, in which, however, Muslims have already been included since 1974 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468796812470893">Chaves and Cann, 1992</xref>: 282). The system of formal recognition of faiths entails many financial advantages for religious groups, such as state payment of religious officials’ salaries, tax concessions and state funding of religious education in public schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468796812470893">Ireland, 2004</xref>: 179). Although schools have offered Islamic religious classes since 1978, only one Islamic school has been founded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468796812470893">Ireland, 2004</xref>: 179; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468796812470893">Verlot and Dietz, 2001</xref>). Whereas the inclusion of Islam among the recognized religions is reminiscent of the Dutch approach, Belgium is closer to France when it comes to the toleration of religious symbols in public institutions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1468796812470893">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since the middle of the sixteenth century, the British state and the Anglican Church have had a close relationship. More than 20 Anglican bishops sit in the House of Lords, the nation’s blasphemy laws refer only to Christian doctrines and the Church of England is the official state religion of England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468796812470893">Statham et al., 2005</xref>). Even though the Anglican Church enjoys a privileged position, Muslim groups in England have benefited from the long-established relationship between the church and the state. Albeit on a much smaller scale than in the Netherlands, the state has begun to provide funding for Muslim schools as it already did for Catholic and Jewish schools. The UK does not automatically extend the rights and privileges of the Church of England to new religious groups, but it does follow a pragmatic pluralistic approach in which minimizing conflicts by accommodating the religious rights of minority groups is key (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468796812470893">Fetzer and Soper, 2005</xref>: 34).</p>
<p>In Switzerland, finally, the relation between state and churches is regulated on the cantonal level and varies between French-style strict secularism (e.g. in Geneva and Neuchâtel) and German-style state recognition for selected religions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468796812470893">Pfaff-Czarnecka, 2009</xref>). However, as in Germany, no Muslim community has so far attained such a status.</p>
<p>To verify whether these cross-national differences in citizenship and church–state regulations have indeed led to varying degrees of accommodation of Muslim religious rights, we use data retrieved from a comparative study of immigrants’ rights collected by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468796812470893">Koopmans et al. (2012)</xref>. This study focuses on 10 European countries, including the six included in the present article. From this study, we have selected the 14 indicators that refer to religious rights for Muslims:
<list id="list1-1468796812470893" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>allowance of ritual animal slaughtering;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>allowance of the Islamic call to prayer;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the number of purpose-built mosques with minarets (calculated per 100,000 Muslims);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the existence of separate cemeteries or cemetery sections for Muslims;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>allowance of burial without coffin;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the number of state-funded Islamic schools (calculated per 100,000 Muslims);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the share of costs of Islamic schools that is covered by the state;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Islamic religious classes in state schools;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the right of female teachers to wear a headscarf;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the right of female students in primary and secondary schools to wear a headscarf;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Islamic religious programs in public broadcasting;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Imams in the military;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Imams in prisons;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the existence and prerogatives of recognized Muslim consultative bodies.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The indicators referring to numbers of mosques with minarets and Islamic schools might be seen as outcome variables rather than as rights. We have nonetheless included them because mosques and Islamic schools are hotly contested in many countries even though – with the exception of Switzerland after the minaret ban of 2009, which falls outside our period of study – none of the countries had formal bans on the construction of mosques with Islamic architecture or the establishment of Islamic schools. However, the formal requirements that need to be fulfilled – e.g. sufficient parking space, accordance with local zoning plans, sufficient demand from parents – offer substantial leeway for authorities to obstruct or facilitate mosques or Islamic schools.</p>
<p>A five-level scoring system was used for each indicator, with the score –1 referring to the most restrictive situation across all countries and all points in time, the score 1 corresponding to the most open configuration and the scores –0.5, 0 and 0.5 applying to intermediary situations. Information was gathered for each country for four different points in time: 1980, 1990, 2002 and 2008. These indicators do not exhaust all the religious rights that are relevant to Muslims. Some rights had to be excluded because they did not apply to all countries (e.g. provisions for halal food in school canteens, which are irrelevant in countries where schools do not provide meals). Still, our analysis below confirms that the rights covered by our indicators were responsible for the large majority of public claim-making about Muslim rights in the six countries (compare <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468796812470893">Table 3</xref> further below).
</p>
<p>Regarding reliability of the coding, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468796812470893">Koopmans et al. (2012)</xref> compared their data with other quantitative indicators of immigrant rights and found in spite of variations in the choice of indicators, measurement years and different ways in which scores were attributed a high average correlation across data sets of 0.80. More specifically, they found a 0.81 correlation between their scores for cultural rights – which includes the indicators of Muslim rights used in the current article – and Banting and Kymlicka’s Multicultural Policy Index for the years 1980, 1990 and 2010 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.queensu.ca/mcp/index.html">http://www.queensu.ca/mcp/index.html</ext-link>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468796812470893">Figure 1</xref> gives the average scores across the 14 indicators for each year and country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1468796812470893">3</xref></sup> In all countries, we find that the amount of religious rights granted to Muslims was relatively limited at the start of our period of observation. Since then, rights have expanded in all countries, but to strongly varying degrees, ranging from little expansion in Switzerland to strong increases in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Cross-nationally, the results confirm our expectation that the combination of citizenship and church–state regimes defines a particularly conducive opportunity structure for Muslim rights in the Netherlands, and a particularly unconducive one in Switzerland. The comparison of the United Kingdom and France provides interesting insights into the interaction between citizenship and church–state regimes. The United Kingdom demonstrates that a state–church regime that originally privileged one official church need not be a hindrance to the expansion of Muslim religious rights if an open citizenship regime gives Muslims political leverage to demand equal treatment. France, however, shows that such leverage is of little use in a state–church regime that does not provide a precedent of strongly established Christian religious rights. On the basis of this reasoning we might expect that if increasing numbers of Muslims become German citizens – and thus voters – Germany is likely to follow the British example, and will extend privileges that are now reserved for Christian and Jewish denominations also to Muslims. Belgium, finally, occupies the intermediary position that we could expect on the basis of its mixture of citizenship rights that have only recently become inclusive and church–state traditions that combine elements of French <italic>laïcité</italic> and Dutch pillarization.

<sec id="sec4-1468796812470893"><title>Public debates on Muslim religious rights</title>
<p>To analyse the religious rights debate we draw on content-analytic data of debates about Muslims and Islam during the period 1999–2008, using the method of political claim analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468796812470893">Koopmans and Statham, 1999</xref>). The unit of analysis, an instance of claim-making (shorthand: a claim), is defined as a strategic action in the public sphere, consisting of the expression of a political opinion by some form of physical or verbal action, regardless of the form this expression takes (press statement, political decision, protest event, court ruling etc.) and regardless of the nature of the actor (governments, political parties, courts, Muslim organizations, employers, churches etc.).</p>
<p>Claims were coded by random sampling of articles selected from five newspapers in each country. To gain a representative picture of the print-media landscape, 30 nationwide daily newspapers from different political viewpoints were selected, ranging from tabloid to broadsheet and from the centre right to the left. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468796812470893">Table 1</xref> gives an overview of the media sources that were used.

<p>The articles were sampled from all newspaper sections using the following keywords (or their equivalent in the respective national language): Islam*/Muslim*/Moslem*/mosque/imam/Qur’an (Quran, Qur’ān, Koran)/headscarf/burqa (burkha, burka, burqua)/minaret. From the articles thus retrieved, a random sample was drawn that was coded by researchers and trained research assistants using a uniform codebook.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1468796812470893">4</xref></sup> The dataset includes about 5000 claims and covers a wide range of issues relevant to Muslims and Islam, including immigration issues, terrorism and responses to it, discrimination and integration of Muslims in various sectors of society. For the analyses in this article, we only retain those claims (24% of the total) that refer to religious rights for Muslims.</p>
<p>Because we rely on claims published in news media, we obviously, like every other study of media debates, exclude those claims that do not make it into the media. We are, however, interested in comparing precisely those claims on Muslim rights that do spark public controversy. To return to our earlier example, we do not doubt that outside the view of the media there are some groups in the United Kingdom that would like to ban headscarves for pupils as well as groups in France that advocate teachers with headscarves. The interesting thing to compare is, however, not that in every country one can find if one looks hard enough some groups that make either type of claim, but why some claims that are highly visible issues of public contention in some countries are hardly debated at all in others.</p>
<p>As explained above, our dependent variable is the degree of ‘obtrusiveness’ of a religious rights claim. The three dimensions of obtrusiveness were operationalized as follows:
<list id="list2-1468796812470893" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Rights in public institutions</italic>: Claims about religious rights outside public institutions were coded 0. Among rights pertaining to public institutions we distinguish between claims of intermediate obtrusiveness (coded 1) pertaining to rights for clients of public institutions (e.g. pupils of a public school, patients in a hospital) and claims of high obtrusiveness (coded 2) about religious rights of public servants who represent a public institution (e.g. teachers in a public school, judges or police personnel).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Rights regarding minority Muslim practices</italic>: Claims referring to practices of the majority or at least of large minorities within the Islamic world (e.g. mosques, Ramadan, halal food, headscarves) were coded 0; claims referring to practices that are limited to small minorities of Muslims (e.g. burqas or refusal to shake hands with members of the opposite sex) were coded 1.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1468796812470893">5</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Special rights</italic>: Rights requiring only an extension of existing arrangements for Christian denominations were coded 0. Within the category of special rights we distinguish between claims about rights of intermediate obtrusiveness (coded 1), which are about recognition of special practices of Muslims (e.g. headscarves), and claims about rights of high obtrusiveness (coded 2), which require non-Muslims to adapt to Muslim sensibilities (e.g. bans on publications that describe or depict the Prophet Mohammed in ways that some Muslims consider insulting).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>By adding the scores for the three dimensions, we created a five-point composite score for <italic>obtrusiveness</italic>. The minimum score on this variable is 0, for claims that do not pertain to public institutions, that are about rights to parity with existing arrangements for Christians and that refer to mainstream Muslim practices. The maximum score of 4 can be obtained by claims about special rights pertaining to minority Muslim practices in public institutions, which either refer to rights for Muslims who are public servants or affect the rights of non-Muslims.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1468796812470893">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>To explain differences in the degree of obtrusiveness of claim-making, we use the following independent variables:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1468796812470893">7</xref></sup>
<list id="list3-1468796812470893" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Accommodation of Muslim religious rights</italic>: In order to test hypothesis 1, we use in the regression models below countries’ scores on Muslim religious rights as a predictor, using the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468796812470893">Figure 1</xref> above. For each country we have taken the average score across the period 1980–2008.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1468796812470893">8</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The <italic>year</italic> in which a claim was made is included to investigate hypothesis 2, which predicts an increase in the obtrusiveness of claims over time.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Year*Accommodation</italic>: With this interaction term we test our third hypothesis, which states that the temporal increase in obtrusiveness of claims will be more pronounced in more inclusive countries.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We distinguish between various categories of <italic>actors</italic>. Among actors with a Muslim background we distinguish four types. First are organizational actors that explicitly identify themselves as Islamic or Muslim, such as mosques and imams, Islamic schools or Muslim representative organizations such as the Muslim Council of Britain, the Ahmadiyya Gemeinschaft Berlin or the Union des Organisations Islamiques de France. Second, we distinguish politicians from a Muslim background<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1468796812470893">9</xref></sup> in non-Islamic parties, such as Cem Özdemir (German Green Party), Ayaan Hirsi Ali (Dutch Liberals) or Antwerp city councillor Ergün Top. The third category consists of Muslim-background actors in non-Muslim organizations other than political parties. This includes ethnicity-based organizations such as the Cultural Association of Moroccans in Switzerland or the Association Turcs du Nord, as well as Muslims representing other non-Muslim organizations such as Chief Superintendent Ali Dizaei of the London Metropolitan Police or Hanifa Cherifi, member of the French Haut Conseil à l’Integration. The fourth and final category of Muslim actors are Muslim-background individuals who do not represent an organization, including employees such as Muslim-background teachers, police officers or cooks, intellectuals such as scientists, journalists or actors, and categories of individuals such as Muslim students, parents and pupils or members of the Oxford Muslim community. Further, among the non-Muslim actors we distinguish three types of political parties and their representatives in legislatives and governments: populist right, moderate right and left-wing. Finally, we distinguish a residual category of other non-Muslim actors. It is important to control for possible compositional differences, because if the obtrusiveness of claims differs among types of actors, and actors are differentially distributed across countries, this might explain part of the cross-national differences.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<sec id="sec5-1468796812470893"><title>Descriptive analyses</title>
<p>We first look in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468796812470893">Figure 2</xref> at levels of claim-making about Muslim religious rights over time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1468796812470893">10</xref></sup> In all countries, levels of contention were relatively modest until 2002. In France the debate peaked in 2004, as a result of the intense controversy about the law banning the wearing of Islamic headscarves in public schools. The debate in the United Kingdom peaked in 2006, related especially to Jack Straw’s remarks as Foreign Minister about full face covering as a ‘statement of separation’. In Belgium the peak of the debate occurred in 2007, centred on headscarves for civil servants. Germany and Switzerland had two peaks, in 2004 and 2006. The German peaks as well as the 2004 Swiss peak were related to headscarf issues, whereas in 2006 the construction of minarets was the primary topic in Switzerland. The number of claims in the Netherlands, finally, did not vary as much as in other countries.
<fig id="fig2-1468796812470893" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Number of religious rights claims by year, 1999–2008.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468796812470893-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>In a next step we look in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1468796812470893">Table 2</xref> at the degree to which Muslims and non-Muslims and their organizations made claims in the field of religious rights. In all countries most religious rights claims were made by non-Muslims, but Muslim groups and Muslim-background individuals have a significant voice in the debate. Generally, we find that, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468796812470893">Koopmans et al. (2005)</xref> had already demonstrated for immigrants in general, the involvement of Muslims in public debates is closely related to the inclusiveness of countries’ citizenship regimes. Muslims are most prominent in debates on religious rights in France (46% of all claims) and the United Kingdom (40%), and least in Germany (20%) and Switzerland (19%), with Belgium (31%) and the Netherlands (30%) in intermediate positions. The French figure in particular is striking, because it makes clear that the negative attitude towards symbols of Islamic religiosity that prevails in the French debate is not the result of a lack of involvement of Muslims and Muslim organizations in these debates. Among the Muslim claimants, explicitly Muslim organizations (15%) and non-organized Muslims (10%) are the most important types of actors.

</table-wrap>
</p>
<p>Political party representatives (including members of governments and legislatures at all levels of the polity) are together responsible for 26% of the claims. Among these, the share of right-wing populist parties ranges from 1% in Germany and the United Kingdom to 8% in the Netherlands. In all countries, the majority of claims by non-Muslim actors were made by actors other than political parties, e.g. judiciaries, the police, professional organizations, welfare associations or researchers.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468796812470893">Table 3</xref>, we turn to the issues that were addressed in claims on religious rights. Viewed across all six countries, actors mostly contested rights related to the headscarf (27%). Such claims were, however, much less frequent in the countries that have most accommodated Muslims’ religious rights, namely the United Kingdom (13%) and the Netherlands (14%). By contrast, we find a stronger focus on full face covering (burqa/niqab) in these countries (11% of all claims in the Netherlands and 17% in the United Kingdom). This provides the first evidence for hypothesis 1, namely that in countries that accommodate basic Muslim rights contention focuses on more obtrusive rights. This also explains why mosques and minarets were not high on the agenda in the United Kingdom (5%) and the Netherlands (8%), but constituted the second most important issue, after the headscarf, in France (24%), Germany (26%) and Switzerland (20%). Some other issues were important in only one of the countries: ritual slaughtering in Belgium (21%), Islamic schools in the Netherlands (21%) and allowance of Islamic burial practices in Switzerland (16%). Further, it is noteworthy that claims relating to the recognition of sharia rights are overall rare (2%), but, in line with our argument, they occur most frequently in the Netherlands (5%) and the United Kingdom (6%). The special position of these two countries is also indicated by the high percentage of claims that end up in the ‘other rights’ category, which includes a variety of claims about smaller issues that are hardly debated at all in the other countries, such as adapted housing for Muslims or Islamic banking.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468796812470893">Table 3</xref>, however, provides only limited insight into the degree of obtrusiveness of religious rights, because many of the issues in the table summarize claims of varying obtrusiveness along the three dimensions we have distinguished. For instance, headscarf claims can refer to the private or the public sector and, within the latter category, to civil servants or to clients of the public service. The following three tables, therefore, compare the three dimensions of obtrusiveness across countries. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1468796812470893">Table 4</xref> shows that obtrusive claims referring to public institutions are most frequent in the Netherlands (64%) and the United Kingdom (62%), and least so in Switzerland (42%). Germany, however, deviates from the expectations, with almost as many public institution claims (61%) as the United Kingdom. These German claims are related to two issues in particular: the right of teachers to wear a headscarf and the right to Islamic religious classes in public schools. For both, Christian precedents exist (teaching nuns and Christian religious classes) that make the denial of these rights more contested than in France, where Muslims are also denied these rights, but where there is no similar precedent for Christians.

<p>The next dimension of claim obtrusiveness refers to whether claims are about mainstream or minority practices. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1468796812470893">Table 5</xref> reveals a striking contrast here between the four less accommodating countries (Switzerland, France, Germany and Belgium), where the debate is almost exclusively about mainstream Muslim practices (90–93% of claims), and the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, where the debate is predominantly centred on minority Islamic practices (58% and 53%, respectively). These include the already mentioned claims about burqas and niqaabs and about separate Muslim schools, as well as a variety of claims by orthodox Muslims, such as the one by a Rotterdam civil servant who refused to shake hands with clients of the opposite sex, or a kitchen chef in the canteen of a UK police department who sued his employer because he wanted to be exempted from cooking pork.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1468796812470893">Table 6</xref> captures the third dimension, namely whether there is an equivalent right for Christians or the claim is about a practice specific to Islam or even demands an adaptation of the host society to Muslims’ needs. The country differences here are less clear-cut. The United Kingdom conforms fully to our expectations, with a strong focus on special rights claims (62%) and a sizeable proportion of claims in which the adaptation of non-Muslims to Muslim religious feelings and practices is at stake (14%). UK examples from the latter category are new police guidelines that required police dogs to wear boots when searching the houses of Muslim suspects, or a consultancy agency that advised the National Health Service to ban staff from eating at their desks during Ramadan to avoid upsetting Muslims.

<p>With 54% parity claims, the Netherlands do not deviate much from the other countries, which is partly because of the importance of claims about Muslim schools, which refer to a right for which there is a strong Christian precedent in this country. Switzerland also deviates somewhat from the expectations, with a rather high 56% of special rights claims, which are related to issues such as Islamic burial, headscarves for pupils and ritual slaughtering.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468796812470893">Figure 3</xref> brings the three dimensions together and shows the means of our obtrusiveness index per country. In line with hypothesis 1, claims have a high degree of obtrusiveness in the United Kingdom (2.2) and the Netherlands (1.8). Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and France are close together, but, in line with our expectations, the level of obtrusiveness of claims is lowest in Switzerland (1.1) and France (1.2).

As the first column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1468796812470893">Table 7</xref> (Model 1) shows, claims by Muslim organizations and by Muslim-background actors representing non-Muslim organizations were not significantly more often about obtrusive rights than the reference group. Claims by Muslim politicians tended to be about less obtrusive issues, although the result is only marginally significant because of the small number of cases in this category. Non-organized Muslim individuals and groups were, however, significantly more likely to make obtrusive claims. For political actors, we find that politicians from the left and right differ little from each other, as well as from the reference group, in the level of obtrusiveness of their claims. Populist right actors, however, are significantly more likely to make claims about Islamic rights of low obtrusiveness.

<p>Together these results point towards the actor dynamics behind debates on Muslim rights. Muslim actors who are not formally organized, such as (groups of) employees, students, parents or health care users, often adhering to more orthodox, minority currents within Islam, tend to push the debate towards more obtrusive issues such as burqas, physical contact with the opposite sex or demands to ban depictions of or perceived insults to the Prophet Mohammed. Populist right-wing actors pull debates in the other direction by challenging relatively unobtrusive Muslim rights such as the building of mosques and minarets or the right to wear headscarves outside public institutions. Most Muslim organizations, as well as Muslim and non-Muslim politicians from mainstream parties, can be situated in between these extremes.</p>
<p>Focusing now on country differences, we find in line with hypothesis 1 a strongly significant relationship between the degree of accommodation of Muslim rights in a country and the obtrusiveness of the claims that are central to the public debate about Muslim rights. We also find support for our second hypothesis, which predicted an increase in obtrusiveness over time. In the second model, we test hypothesis 3 by adding an interaction term, which leads to a considerable increase in explained variance. While all other significant effects remain, we find that the interaction term is also highly significant, confirming that the level of obtrusiveness of claims on Islamic religious rights has in particular increased strongly in countries that had already provided a comparatively broad range of rights to Muslims.</p>
<p>Additionally, we ran the second model separately for Muslim and non-Muslim actors (not reported in the table) and found that claims became significantly more obtrusive for Muslim actors over the course of time while the relationship between time and obtrusiveness was not significant for non-Muslim actors. For both groups the impact of the country’s degree of accommodation as well as the interaction term between time and accommodation remained highly significant. The stronger increase over time for Muslim actors suggests that the rise in obtrusiveness of claims is driven to an important extent by proactive behaviour of Muslims and is not simply a reaction to claims and issues that were raised by others, e.g. by right-wing populists.</p>
<p>However, it is important here to differentiate within the category of actors from a Muslim background. The tendency to make increasingly obtrusive claims is concentrated among non-organized Muslim groups and individuals, whereas the claims of Muslim organizations (including mosques and imams) and Muslim-background politicians have similar levels of obtrusiveness to those of mainstream non-Muslim actors. Second, we find differences between Muslims from different countries or regions of origin. For those cases (59% of Muslim claims) for which we could determine the ethnicity of named individuals (which, if not mentioned in the newspaper article, we tried to find on the basis of online information sources) we distinguished actors originating in Turkey, the Maghreb countries, other Arab countries (e.g. Egypt, Iraq), Asian countries (e.g. Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan), and other countries (mainly sub-Saharan African countries, as well as a small number of converts from an ethnic group of the country of residence). We found that Asian Muslims made the most obtrusive claims. Compared with them, the claims of Muslims of Maghrebian (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and especially of Turkish origin (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) were significantly less obtrusive. Muslims originating in Arab and other countries occupy intermediary positions.</p>
<p>Consideration of ethnicity is also an important robustness check for our cross-national findings. Because of different ethnic compositions of the Muslim population it might have been the case that the country differences that we find are due to this factor (e.g. that the UK has many Pakistanis and Germany many Turks), and not to differences in the accommodation of Islam. We find, however, that this is not the case, as all our previous findings regarding the effects of accommodation, time and the interaction between time and accommodation remain of similar size and significance when we additionally control for ethnic origin. Results from these analyses are available from us upon request.</p>
<p>Further, it is important to note that our finding that claim-making is more often about obtrusive rights in accommodating, multicultural countries and in recent years says nothing yet about the direction of these claims, as this includes both claims that support and demand such rights, and claims that oppose them. As an additional step in our analysis, we therefore also look at the positions of claims. To investigate this, we coded all claims on a three-point scale. A score of −1 was given for claims that objected against the extension of a certain right to Muslims or favoured restrictions in existing rights. Claims that favoured extensions of Muslim rights, or objected to the restriction of an existing right, were scored + 1. A score of 0, finally, was given to claims that took a neutral position regarding a certain right, or that contained both restrictive and expansive elements.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468796812470893">Figure 4</xref> shows that, in all countries, the average position of claims on Muslim rights, often referred to as the ‘tone’ of the debate, is supportive, although only marginally so in Germany (+0.03). We find the highest levels of support for Muslim rights claims in the United Kingdom (+0.45) and France (+0.35). Claims about minority practices turn out to command the least public support (average position +0.13) while claims about parity rights with existing rights for Christians find the greatest degree of support in media debates (+0.27). In a multivariate regression analysis, we find, not surprisingly, that all categories of Muslim actors, and to a lesser extent left-wing party representatives, make significantly more claims in favour of Muslim rights. By contrast, populist right as well as to a lesser extent moderate right parties tend to oppose rights extensions or approve restrictions. Furthermore, we find that, if we take into account both the obtrusiveness of claims and the actors making them, only the UK and Germany differ significantly from the other countries. In other words, after taking into account the fact that in France the debate mostly deals with rights of low obtrusiveness, the tone of the debate in that country no longer differs significantly from that in Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. These results further indicate that. even if we take into account that the UK debate is characterized by a high level of claims about obtrusive Muslim rights, the tone of the debate is more positive than elsewhere. The opposite holds for Germany, where basic Muslim rights dominate the debate, but the debate is still comparatively critical of Muslim rights. This once more illustrates what we stated in the introduction, namely that what is understood as controversial can differ very strongly across countries.

<sec id="sec7-1468796812470893" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this article, we have investigated how Western European countries have reacted differently to the challenge of integrating a new religion. We have done so by looking at two aspects of the incorporation of Islam: policies and institutional arrangements regarding Muslim rights, on the one hand, and public debates on restrictions and extensions of these rights, on the other. We predicted that countries with open citizenship regimes – the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands and more recently also Belgium – would have granted Muslims more rights than countries with more restrictive access to citizenship – Germany and Switzerland. The main reason is that in the latter group of countries Muslims lack the electoral leverage to effectively pressure for rights extensions. Regarding state–church regimes, we expected the most favourable setting in the Netherlands, where the state has historically granted many rights to Christian denominations, without making state recognition a precondition for access to such rights. The most unfavourable setting we expected in countries where laicist traditions of a strict religious neutrality of public institutions have historically been predominant. This is most pronouncedly the case in France, but French ideas of <italic>laïcité</italic> have also exerted important influences on neighbouring Switzerland and Belgium. Taking citizenship and state–church relations together, this led us to expect that Muslims have been able to address the widest range of rights in the Netherlands, and to a lesser extent the United Kingdom, whereas we expected the granting of rights to Muslims to be most limited in Switzerland, and to a lesser extent also in France. Using data on 14 indicators of Muslim religious rights for the period 1980–2008, we found exactly this pattern.</p>
<p>We then proceeded to explain differences in public debates about Muslim rights across the period 1999–2008. In particular we were interested in the kind of rights that were contested, distinguishing three dimensions of rights: rights within and outside public institutions; rights pertaining to mainstream versus minority Muslim practices; and parity rights referring to extension of existing arrangements for Christians to Muslims versus special rights for which there is no clear Christian precedent. We combined these three dimensions in a measure of obtrusiveness, which defines the degree to which rights claims challenge existing institutions and the dominant culture of the host society.</p>
<p>We derived three hypotheses and found support for all of them. First, in countries where Muslims have been able to obtain more rights, public controversies tend to focus on more obtrusive rights. Second, in all countries, we observe an increase in obtrusiveness over time, as controversies over basic rights become settled – in either accommodating or restrictive ways – and political entrepreneurs on both the proponent and the opponent side of Muslim rights shift attention to more controversial issues. Third, we find that this trend of claim shift towards more obtrusive issues is strongest in countries that have granted Muslims more rights. In sum, we find strong evidence for a dynamic in controversies over Muslim rights. Settlements reached over basic rights such as mosque construction or headscarves do not lead to demobilization of the actors involved in them, but shift the focus of the debate to new issues of controversy.</p>
<p>Regarding the actors involved in debates, two categories stood out. Not formally organized Muslim individuals and groups, often belonging to more orthodox Islamic currents, were most clearly associated with obtrusive rights claims such as those related to sex segregation, full face covering, bans on depictions and perceived insults of the Prophet Mohammed, or refusals by canteen and catering staff to serve alcohol or pork to non-Muslims. Overall, they were the clearest challengers supporting more expansive Muslim rights. Right-wing populists, by contrast, were the only actor category that focused disproportionately on Muslim rights of low obtrusiveness, thus challenging the acceptance of basic Muslim practices such as mosques and minaret construction.</p>
<p>Strikingly, we found that in all six countries, although only marginally so in Germany, proponents of Muslim religious rights were more strongly represented in the public debate than were opponents. On average, we found this to be the case even for the more obtrusive Muslim rights that pertain to public institutions, minority practices and special rights. Thus, the ‘tone’ of the debate about Muslim rights in Western Europe is not as negative as it is sometimes perceived to be, at least where debates about rights are concerned.</p>
<p>These findings are not self-evident if we view them from the perspective of theories on reactive religiosity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468796812470893">Diehl and Schnell, 2006</xref>), which claim that Muslims will be more inclined to turn to traditional and orthodox versions of Islam in settings where their basic religious rights are denied or contested. Extensions of rights to Muslims should, according to this perspective, prevent the expansion of more orthodox forms of Islam. We should then find that claims about special rights and minority expressions of Islam such as burqas or sex segregation are most prevalent in countries such as France where mainstream forms of religious expression such as the headscarf are restricted. However, contrary to this expectation, we find that these issues are most salient in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, where most rights claims pertaining to mainstream Islam have been granted. As we showed on the basis of a separate analysis for Muslim claims in which we took into account the ethnicity of actors, these cross-national differences are not explained by the different ethnic competition of the Muslim population of these countries. While ethnicity matters, with Muslims of Turkish and Maghrebian origin making less obtrusive claims than their counterparts originating in Asian countries, this does not affect our main finding that more obtrusive claims are made in countries that have accommodated Islam more. This evidence fits our political opportunity perspective, which expects claims for Muslim rights to be more easily expanded beyond basic rights in contexts where the prevailing citizenship and church–state regimes are already comparatively open to demands by immigrants and religious groups.</p>
<p>For the moment, these dynamics of rights expansion do not seem to have settled yet in any of our countries of study. However, it is likely that eventually some form of equilibrium will be found, just as it has been after often long struggles between states and Christian churches. In view of the continuing strong influence exerted by national traditions of citizenship and church–state relations, and against theories that predict cross-national rights convergence (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468796812470893">Joppke, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468796812470893">Soysal, 1997</xref>), our evidence suggests that different countries are likely to settle at diverging equilibria, resulting in a domestication of Islam around nationally specific legal and institutional forms.</p>

<fn id="fn5-1468796812470893"><label>5</label><p>In most cases, this criterion allows a clear-cut classification of claims (a full overview of how various types of claims were coded is available on request). The most complicated case concerns the right to establish Islamic schools, which is difficult to evaluate because in most countries there are high barriers to establishing such schools, and therefore the actual number of schools says little about the demand for them among Muslims. However, even in the Netherlands, where there are few institutional barriers to establishing denominational schools, only about 7% of Muslim children are enrolled in Islamic schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468796812470893">Driessen and Merry, 2006</xref>).

The results are very similar to those reported here (results available from the authors on request).</p></fn>

<fn id="fn10-1468796812470893"><label>10</label><p>The data in the figure can be used only for temporal comparisons and not to compare overall absolute numbers of claims across countries because the density of samples was not the same in all countries. Our aim was to have sufficient numbers of cases for analysis in all countries (about 750 claims per country). What we are interested in is not the absolute number of claims but their distribution across different types and over time.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn11-1468796812470893"><label>11</label><p>We additionally conducted ordered logistic regressions in order to account for the possibility that relationships between the independent variables and our obtrusiveness variable are non-linear. These regressions revealed the same results.</p></fn></fn-group></notes>
